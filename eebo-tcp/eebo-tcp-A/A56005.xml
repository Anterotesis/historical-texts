         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

great <hi>Peſt</hi> we now labour under, they are

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36413:3"/>
impelling, that it is to be feared the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> we now
partake of, will not be the one <hi>m<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iety</hi> of the <hi>Effects</hi> thence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
or thereon depending. By this connexion of <hi>Cauſes,</hi> it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
apparent that this <hi>Peſt</hi> ſhould have took its <hi>beginning</hi> at the
latter end of 1664. and truly had not the <hi>Winter</hi> then been ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſharp (it having a <hi>Froſt</hi> of almoſt ten weeks continuance
together) to have kept it back, it had beyond all queſtion broke
forth then. Nay, and break forth it did then too, as the Learned
Artiſt in <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> can experimentally teſtifie, having
been perſonally viſited with it at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> that year. And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Patients of Mr. <hi>Joſias Weſtwood</hi> the Chirurgeon, were then alſo
afflicted with the ſame Diſtemper, and yet obtained cure againſt
it, the <hi>Air</hi> being then ſo friendly to <hi>Nature,</hi> and an <hi>Enemy</hi> unto the
<hi>Peſtilence.</hi> But now let us conſider its progreſs and increaſe, with
the cauſes thereof, and the poſſibility of its abatement, with the
time when. In this matter I ſhall cen<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ult but not trouble you with
the Figure of the <hi>Suns</hi> Ingreſs into the Equinoctial Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> for
the year 1665. and thence draw down the ſeveral Arguments of
<hi>encreaſe</hi> and <hi>abatement;</hi> and becauſe the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> was hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
untill the Month of <hi>June,</hi> I will begin there.</p>
            <p>This Month, (as if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> had appointed the Sickneſs
to <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Ominous</hi> in earneſt to theſe Nations) we may obſerve two
moſt fatal <hi>tranſits</hi> to uſher it in, <hi>viz. Mars</hi> his then coming to the
oppoſite point of the Aſcendant, and the <hi>Sun</hi> to the oppoſite point
of <hi>Saturn;</hi> a beginning of a ſickneſs ſo miſchievous, that greater
can hardly be; God grant the <hi>end</hi> be not as <hi>inauſpicious:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
(I preſume it will not be of many Months continuance to
this great City, yet we are not to ſuppoſe a <hi>Peſtilence</hi> ended, when
it ſeemingly acquits one place.</p>
            <p>In the moneth of <hi>July</hi> it began to encreaſe conſiderably, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
toward the latter end thereof: there were then ſix oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Erratick Stars,</hi> and two <hi>Eclipſes;</hi> and to add to theſe,
<hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> then came to the Quadrate place of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> and to the oppoſite point of <hi>Saturn</hi> by tranſit; and the <hi>Sun</hi>
then came to the oppoſition of <hi>Jupiter</hi> both by tranſit and aſpect:
all which were very great arguments of its encreaſe.</p>
            <p>In the Month of Aug. <hi>Saturn</hi> comes to the Quadrate place of the
<hi>Sun</hi> and will be ſtationary upon it all the Month; the two Eclipſes
laſt Month do now begin to operate, which are teſtimonies of very
great augmentation: howbeit the fortunate Planet <hi>Venus</hi> coming
to the Sextile of her own place and of the <hi>Moons,</hi> at the beginning
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36413:3"/>
of the Month; and coming to a Trine of the Sun, the latter end
thereof, may ſo happily contemper the fury of it, that it may not
[now] encreaſe or augment to any exceeding great height.</p>
            <p>A part of Septem. is like to prove ſomewhat dangerous, becauſe
<hi>Saturn</hi> is in a manner ſtill ſtationary, and the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> then
come to a Quadrate aſpect, and this in ill points of the Vernal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
<hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> (who is <hi>Dominus Aſcendentis</hi>) then alſo come
to an oppoſition, and both in ſquare of <hi>Luna</hi>'s place; whence it is
probable, that in the ſecond and laſt weeks of this Month, the <hi>Peſt</hi>
may admit of an abatement; but indeed, I much fear about the
middle of the month an encreaſe conſiderable: nevertheleſs, I
hope, and rationally believe (<hi>favente Deo</hi>) that this <hi>Peſtilence</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
aſcend to any higher degree, than it may at that time reach
unto.</p>
            <p>The Month of <hi>October</hi> ſeems to promiſe well, and the <hi>Diſtemper</hi>
therein cannot meet with any eminent cauſe for augmentation:
yet I ſuppoſe the ſecond and laſt week will make ſome ſlight Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
at an encreaſe, becauſe then the Sun comes to the oppoſite
place of the <hi>Moon:</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> hath a progreſſional motion to the
oppoſition of the Sun, and Quartile of <hi>Saturns</hi> places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December</hi> in this reſpect (God not fruſtrating the

And now a word or two touching the preſent
Peſt, whether it be infectious or catching: If any
Diſeaſes be infectious or contagious, to any perſon
or perſons, it is their fear and imagination; and the
timidity of their Affections that occaſion it Caſt off
then the love of the World, let the diſtruſt of God's
mercy be far from you, uſe the exerciſe of a holy
life, and good converſation; and becauſe it is God's
doing, repine not at his Providence, but uſe theſe
ſupernatural Remedies, it being a moſt evident
Truth, that Faith is the beſt Fence againſt Fear. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
the beſt Plaiſter againſt Sores; Repentance
the beſt Reſtorative; and Prayer the beſt antidote
Theſe are the onely Remedies againſt Paſſions, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
Fears, Frights, and Imaginations, which are
more eaſily diſcourſed of, than removed. When, nay,
and before you are forſaken of Friends, and hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Complaints of Neighbours, the crying of
Wives and Children, the mourning of Husbands
and Parents, the ſorrowing of Kinsfolks and Allies,
the Sickneſs ſpreading, the Peſtilence raging, &amp; the
Plague encreaſing from Tens to Hundreds, and
from Hundreds to Thouſands. But (God not alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or ſuſpending the power he hath given to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Cauſes) this Peſt will abate about the latter
end of Septemb 1665<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then grow leſs apace. As
