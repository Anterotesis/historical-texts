         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Croſſe ſubſcribed by the Kings themſelves, and theſe who made them, together with

becauſe none of our ancient kings (as I have proved) had any power to grant or alien
the lands of the Crown (which they enjoyed only in the kingdoms right, and for
its uſe) to any, without the conſent <hi>of their Nobles, and people in full Parliament:</hi>
and in moſt of theſe Charters, <hi>Abbeys and Church-lands</hi> were exempted from <hi>all
taxes, tallages, and temporall ſervices whatſoever,</hi> except the repairing of <hi>high

            <p>Two things there are, which in this enquiry after the originall uſe of our Kings
great ſeales, ſeeme ſomewhat dubious unto me. Firſt, when, how, and by what law
or meanes it came to paſſe, that our Kings Charters and Patents ought of neceſſity to
be ſealed with the great ſeale, contrary to the primitive uſage in former ages, or elſe
to be reputed invalid, and meere nullities in law? Secondly, when, and by what
law or grounds, and in what Kings reigne, Writs, Commiſſions, and other Proceſſe
of law, began to be iſſued out under the great ſeale, or elſe to be diſallowed as illegall?
it being evident unto me, that Charters, and Patents were uſually ſealed by ſome of
our Kings, before any of their writs, commiſſions, or legall proceſſe iſſued under
their ſeales.</p>

            <p>From which Charters and Subſcriptions we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That this King <hi>Edward,</hi> though he added his great Seal to his Charters,
yet he retained the ancient forme of confirming them with the ſigne of the croſſe, and
the ſubſcription of his owne name, and the names of witneſſes; which continued long
after, till <hi>Edward the firſt his reigne,</hi> if not longer, though ſince diſcontinued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That the</hi> Chancellor <hi>in his dayes, though he ſubſcribed his name after
Prelates and Biſhops, yet hee did it before</hi> Dukes, Earles, <hi>and</hi> all other temporall
Lords; <hi>therefore hee was then, no doubt, the chiefeſt temporall Officer, and hath ſo

            <p>By which paſſage and writ it is apparent: Firſt, That the Chancellour in
<hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds Reigne, had the cuſtody of the great Seale. Secondly,
That preſentations to Churches, Archdeaconries, and Prebendaries, were then
granted under the Great Seale. Thirdly, That Chancellours did ſometimes
fraudulently grant and ſeale Patents without the Kings privity; and that theſe
Patents, when diſcovered, were reputed fraudulent and voyd. Fourthly, That writs
at Common Law were uſuall in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond his Reigne; which appeares
moſt plentifully and irrefagably by <hi>Ranulphus de Glanvilla,</hi> chiefe <hi>Insticiar

of Law were reduced by this <hi>Ralph Glanvill</hi> and his fellow Iuſtices, into a

            <p>By which paſſages it is apparent: Firſt, that all theſe Kings Patents, Charters,
were ſealed with his great Seale. Secondly, that the abuſe, loſſe or abſence of the
great Seale, is a ſufficient cauſe to make a new one. Thirdly, that the profit made
by the great Seale, and project of raiſing moneys by new Charters ſealed with it,
was the true originall cauſe all ſealing of Charters and VVrits with his Seale, and
making it ſimply neceſſary in Law; there being no publique reſolution or declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
declaring Charters or Writs not ſealed with the great Seale, to be voyd in Law,
(for ought I finde) before this project; unleſſe that forementioned, touching the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,</hi>
paſſe for a Law, and judgement in this particular. Fourthly, that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
in this Kings raigne had the cuſtody of the Great Seale; the indiſcreet uſe and
abuſe whereof, was good ground in Law to deprive him of its cuſtody.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that our Kings Great and Petty Seals when originally invented, and whiles
the uſe of them was onely private, or meerely arbitrary, not ſimply neceſſary in
point of Law, in the adminiſtration of Juſtice, or tranſactions of the publike
affairs of the Realme, were proper and peculiar to themſelves alone, and in their
owne diſpoſing power onely, as every private mans Seale now is, they uſing them
onely as private, not as publike perſons, in their naturall, not politicke capacities:
But after that theſe Seals, by uſe and cuſtome, became ſimply neceſſary for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
execution of Juſtice and affaires of the Realme, and our Kings made uſe of
them in their politique capacities, as Heads or ſupreame Governours of the body
of the Realme, and publike Miniſters thereof; the whole Kingdom and Parliament
by this occaſion, and upon this reaſon, came to gaine a publike intereſt in and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over theſe Seals as well as our Kings: (even as in all other inferiour Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
the Commonalty as well as the Majors, in Cities and Boroughs; the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as well as the Biſhops or Deanes; the Covents, as well as the Abbots or Priors;

other Acts, to omit Law-Bookes and Hiſtorier. And being thus become <hi>the great
Seale of England,</hi> (the Parliament the repreſentative body of the whole Realme of
<hi>England)</hi> muſt neceſſarily have an intereſt in, and juriſdiction over it in all publike
reſpects, even ſo farre as to new make it when there is need, and to diſpoſe it for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
affairs of Parliament and the Realme, when the old Seale (the proper Seale of
the Parliament) is purpoſely ſubſtracted, yea, denied them for neceſſary publike uſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that after the great Seale became common and neceſſary to moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
affairs, in which regard the whole Kingdome and Parliament came to have a
right in, and power over it; ſo in other reſpects the King ſtill retained a peculiar
intereſt and prerogative in it, in all arbitrary matters of royall grace and favour, to
which he is no ways obliged in point of Law; in which reſpect it is called, <hi>The Kings
Great Seale,</hi> As firſt, in caſes of generall or particular Charters of pardon. Secondly,
of Indenization or Enfranchiſment. Thirdly, of erecting new Corporations, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming

Fifthly, of conferring ſome kinde of leſſe publike Offices, and Annuities for
ſervices performed or to be executed. Sixthly, of granting new Liberties or Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes
of grace to Corporations or private Subjects. Seventhly, of creating or confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
new honours on deſerving men. Eighthly, of Licences for mort-maines, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations,
alienations, conſecrations of new Churches or Chappels, &amp;c. Ninthly, of
publike collections for perſons or townes diſtreſſed through fire, ſhipwrack, or other
caſualties. Tenthly, of private negotiations with forraign Princes, States, or Subjects,
and ſome kinde of Protections, Commiſſions of grace rather then right or juſtice.
In all theſe, and ſuch like particulars of meere grace, or leſſe publike concernment,
the Kingdome and Parliament neither properly have, nor pretend to have any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
right or juriſdiction over the great or petty Seals, but leave them abſolutely free
to the King as if they were his owne private ſeales alone, ſo far forth as his Charters,
Pardons, Grants, Licenſes, Diſpenſations, Protections, Commiſſions of this kinde
are conſonant to the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme, and not repugnant to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Parliament and whole Kingdom, as to all publike affairs of ſtate and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the adminiſtration of Juſtice to all the ſubjects, hath committed the making lawfull
uſe, power and diſpoſall of the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> in truſt to the King, as to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Magiſtrate and Juſtitiar: over which they never claime a conſtituting or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
juriſdiction, whiles it is rightly managed according to Law. But if this Seale
be either wilfully abuſed or ſubſtracted contrary to Law, or truſt, to the prejudice of
the Kingdome, the obſtruction of publike Juſtice, or violation of the priviledges
of Parliament, and not redreſſed after ſeverall complaints and Petitions of the
Houſes to the King for reformation of this grievance; Whether the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or Parliament in ſuch a caſe as this, who have authority to remedy the
grievances, the abuſes, or wilfull abſence of the great Seale, have not likewiſe a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſoveraigne power to make a new great Seale, and appoint a Keeper of it, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying

               <p>This I ſhall endeavour to make good by Preſidents, by reaſons of Law and State-policy;
beginning with the new making, and then proceeding to the keeping and

yea ordaining a new great Seale, new Officers of King and State, without the Kings
preſence or privity, and then it is our preſent caſe in effect: For if this Aſſembly of

inevitable abſence, might lawfully make both a new great Seale, Chancellour,

did, and conceived they might juſtly doe, none then or ſince diſavowing or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring

theſe ſeverall Acts; why they may not likewiſe enjoy the making of a New broad Seal

why the Parliament then may not in ſuch caſes, make a new great Seale of England,

for the neceſſary adminiſtration of Iuſtice and benefit of the Realme, when the

But to make a New Seal, onely like, or not much different from the old, to ſupply
its abſence, with the Kings owne Picture, Armes, ſtile and Title, is no wayes to
impeach, but confirme his Royall Authority, being done in <hi>affirmance,</hi> onely, not
<hi>diſ-ffirmance</hi> of it, as Lawyers ſpeake. Thus their making of a new Seale in <hi>Edward
the</hi> 1. and <hi>Henry the</hi> 6. his Raigne forementioned, was the higheſt confirmation
of their Authorities, and the greateſt expreſſion of the ſubjects Loyaltyes that might
bee; And why the Parliaments making of a new great Seale to ſupply the abſence
&amp; defects of the old, ſhould be deemed a ſetting up of a new King againſt his Majeſty,
more than the Parliaments frequent conſtituting of Lord Protectors, in former
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:159084:16"/>
times to ſupply the infancy abſence, dotage, or imperfections of our Kings
(of which I have cited you many Preſidents elſewhere) which all eſteemed to be
a ratification, not nullification or alteration of their Royall Authority, (or the coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
new money now, to ſupply the want of old,) tranſcends my underſtanding
to apprehend: ſince thoſe who may lawfully make a Vice-Roy to repreſent the
Perſon, or execute the Soveraignty of a King in his name and right, may with
as good reaſon and authority to, make a new <hi>great Seale,</hi> to ſupply the defects
and affected abſence of the old, the Seale being leſſe than the perſon and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty

               <p>Thirdly, The Chancellour of England,<note n="n" place="margin">See the 2 part of the power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments p. 70 71</note> 
                  <hi>hath reſigned up his Office and Great Seal
of England, in and to the Parliament, who have diſpoſed of it to a new Chancellour in

other Seales from time to time, I have ſhewed in the fore-cited Acts, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat;
but conclude, That if our Parliaments have enjoyed ſuch a power and Juriſdiction
over the great Seal, the Chancellours and Keepers of it heretofore, when there was juſt
cauſe; they may exerciſe the ſelfe-ſame power over them now, eſpecially when both of
them have bin purpoſely withdrawne, &amp; detained from the Parliament ſo long, to retard,
annihilate its proceedings contrary to Law, and the Act for its continuance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Parliament hath exerciſed a power over the great Seale, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Seales of the King; as the <hi>Dutchy Seal, Exchequer Seale, Seale of the Court of
Words and Liveries, of the Court of Augmentations, of first fruits and Tenths,
Staples, Surveyors, Seales of cloth and other Merchandize, ſafe conducts, Cuſtomes,
Eccleſiaſticall Courts, and the like;</hi> in preſcribing what Patents Charters, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,

them or any of them, and what not; And where the great and priety Seale ſhall
be uſed to promote right, and where not uſed to ſtay right or juſtice in any caſe

the Parliament may by the ſame, or a like reaſon, exerciſe a Iuriſdiction in making
a new great Seale, and directing the ule of it for the common good, to ſupply the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the old.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Parliament hath cauſed this new Seale to be made, principally to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:159084:17"/>
compleat the Houſe of Commons by ſealing Writs for new Elections of Knights and
Burgeſſes, in places of the old who are dead, or juſtly expelled: and what power the
Kingdom and Parliament have anciently exerciſed in this, or the like caſes, I ſhall
give you a briefe account. Firſt, the Lords and Commons have ſundry times in
former ages, <hi>not onely enforced our Kings to ſummon Parliaments againſt their wills,
when neceſſary, but likewiſe ſent out Writs to ſummon a Parliament, and elect Knights
and Burgeſſes, under the great Seale of England in our Kings names, without their
privity and aſſent,</hi> as I have<note n="*" place="margin">The ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power of Parliaments part 1. f. 8. to 16.</note> elſewhere manifeſted by ſundry Preſidents: And by
the very Act for the<note n="*" place="margin">16 Carol. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Trieniall Parliament,</hi> (aſſented unto by <hi>His Majeſty, and all
the Lords and Commons who are, or were with him at Oxford;</hi> this very Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament)
it is expreſly provided, <q>That in caſe the King refuſe or neglect to ſummon
a Parliament every three yeeres, next after the laſt day of the laſt Parliament pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
it, by Writs under THE GREAT SEALE OF ENGLAND <hi>(ſo
frequently ſtiled in this Act;)</hi> that then every Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> the
Lord Keeper of the great Seale of England, and every Commiſſioner and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
for the keeping of the Great Seale of <hi>England</hi> for the time being,
within ſixe dayes after the tenth day of September in every ſuch third yeere,
ſhall in due forme of Law, without any further Warrant or direction from His
Majeſtie, His Heirs or Succeſſors, SEALE, iſſue forth, and ſend abroad ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Writs of Summons to the reſpective Peeres of the Realme, and Writs of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Sheriffs of the ſeverall Counties, Cities and Boroughs of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Wales, &amp;c.</hi> for the electing of Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes to ſerve in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
preſcribing, that every Lord Chancellour, Keeper, and Commiſſioner
aforeſaid, ſhall take an Oath, truly and faithfully to iſſue forth and ſend abroad all
Writs of Summons to Parliament for both Houſes, at ſuch time and in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as is expreſſed in this Act; under paine of being diſabled <hi>ipſo facto</hi> from their
places, in caſe of refuſall or neglect. And then the Lords are ordered to meet at
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> without Writ or Summons, and any twelve of them are enabled, to
grant out Writs of Summons under their hands and Seales, to all Sheriffs of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Cities, and Boroughs, which ſhall be of the ſame force to all intents as the
Writs of Summons to Parliament under the great Seale of <hi>England.</hi> And in caſe
the Lords neglect or refuſe to iſſue ſuch Writs, then the Sheriffs, Majors, and Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieffs
of Counties, Cities, and Boroughs, without any Writ at all: and in their
default or neglect, the Free-holders and Citizens of each County, City, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
are enabled to elect Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, without any Writ at
all, and the Election and Parliament to be as effectuall, as if ſummoned under the
great Seale of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q> If then a Parliament may be thus ſummoned by the Lord
Keeper himselfe, by a Writ under the great Seale, without the Kings privity, or
contrary to his Command; or by a Writ under the Lords Seals only; or without
any Writ at all, in ſome caſes, and that by expreſſe proviſion of an Act made
this Parliament: why this Parliament may not, by as good or like reaſon
(now it is aſſembled and perpetuated by another Act) make a new <hi>great Seale</hi>
to ſeale Writs of Election, or grant out their Writs without the <hi>great Seale,</hi> by
an Ordinance of Parliament onely, to compleat the Houſes, now the great Seale
hath beene ſo long abſent, and ſuch Writs refuſed to be iſſued under it, though
oft deſired (without any danger of Treaſon, or derogation to the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:159084:18"/>
I cannot yet dicerne. It being farre leſſe, for a ſitting Parliament in this
caſe, to make a new <hi>great Seale,</hi> or iſſue out Writs of Election without the Kings
privity (now in Armes againſt it) to recrute its own Members, then for the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
Keeper, Lords, or Commons</hi> themſelves out of Parliament thus, either with, or
without Writ, to ſummon and hold a Parliament, without, yea againſt the Kings
aſſent, his Proclamations or Inhibitions to the contrary. And thoſe fundamentall
principles of Law, State-policy, with that ſoveraigne power of the Parliament
and Kingdome, above our Kings, which induced both Houſes thus to make, and his
Majeſtie readily to aſſent to this late Act, for the common benefit and ſafety of the
Realm, in caſe of His <hi>Owne</hi> or <hi>the Lord Keepers wilfull neglect, or refuſall to doe their
duties;</hi> will doubtleſſe inable the Houſes now ſitting, to make a new <hi>great Seale,</hi>
or iſſue out Writs of <hi>Election, Errour,</hi> and the like, either under it or without it,
during the voluntary abſence of the King, Lord Keeper, and great Seale from the
Parliament (contrary to Law, Cuſtome, Duty, Oath) of purpoſe to compleat the
Houſes, and expedite publike Juſtice, obſtructed by their abſence. And the rather
may the Parliament doe it in caſe of Writs of <hi>Election,</hi> becauſe ſuch Writs, with
the Elections made by vertue of them, have uſually beene ordered, formed, iſſued
our, determined, judged <hi>onely by the Parliament;</hi> and Writs for new Elections
(by reaſon of death or removall) have <hi>constantly iſſued out, of courſe, by Order
or Warrant from the Speaker or Commons Houſe onely,</hi> without ſpeciall Warrant
from the King himſelfe without refuſall or deniall, as is evident by the Statutes

               <p>From all which Authorities I humbly conceive, the Parliament may lawfully in
the caſe fore-ſtated, both make a new broad Seale and Keeper of it, to fill up the
Houſes, and redreſſe the obſtructions of Juſtice, of Parliamentary proceedings,
occaſioned by the great Seales abſence.</p>
               <p>To theſe authorities I ſhall annex the enſuing Reaſons both of Law and State:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Parliament the ſupreame power and Judicature in <hi>England,</hi> having
the chiefe intereſt and propriety in the GREAT SEALE OF ENGLAND,
in reſpect of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s publike uſe, may lawfully new make and uſe that Seale which is it
own in reſpect of property and uſe; and the Kings only as their publike Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Parliament being the chiefe State-phyſician of the Realme,
may, and ought by Law to redreſſe all publike grievances: therefore the grievances
and obſtructions of Juſtice, occaſioned by the old great Seale and Lord Keepers ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
or abuſe, by making new.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Parliament may and ought to ſupply all defects, defaults of State
Officers, Laws Affairs, prejudiciall to the Realme: Hence it alwayes hath ſupplied
the <hi>Minority, Detage, or Abſence of our Kings</hi> by conſtituting <hi>a Vice-Roy of their own
election to exerciſe all royall Authority;</hi> the abſence of the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> or <hi>Speaker</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:159084:18"/>
of the lower Houſe, when ſicke by ſubſtituting others to ſupply their places; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the Common Law by new <hi>Statute-Laws;</hi> and providing new Laws Courts,
Seale, againſt new miſchiefs, not remediable by old Acts. This appeares moſt lively
by the <hi>Act for Trieniall Parliaments</hi> forecited, wherein the <hi>wilfulneſſe and negligence
of the King, is ordered to be ſupplied by the Lord Keeper; the Lord Keepers, by the
Lords; the Lords, by the Sheriffs of Counties, Majors, and Bailiffs; and theirs by the
Freeholders, Citizens, and Burgeſſes.</hi> The <hi>Councell of Baſil,</hi> and others<note n="*" place="margin">The ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power of Parliaments part 1. edit. 2. p. 13.</note> forecited are
to like purpoſe: and the Statute of 25. <hi>Hen. 8. c. 21. which Law aboliſhing the Popes
authority, enables the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>to grant all Eccleſiaſticall Licences
and Diſpenſations here, which the Pope alone formerly granted at</hi> Rome; <hi>and then
provides, that in caſe the Archibiſhop ſhould wilfully and obſtinately refuſe to grant
ſuch Licences and Diſpenſations to thoſe who demanded them without a juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
cauſe; that then an Injunction ſhould iſſue out of the Chancery under the great
Seale to him, commanding him to grant them; and if he then wilfully refuſed to doe it,
that then the King upon every ſuch default and wilfulneſſe, ſhould grant a Commiſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great Seale to any two Prelates or ſpirituall perſons that would grant them, by an
inſtrument in writing under</hi> THEIR SEALES. The Parliament therefore now
ſummoned and ſitting, by like reaſon lawfully may, and is bound in duty to
ſupply the preſent wilfull abſence of the Lord Keeper and great Seale, (treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
carried from it beyond expectation, contrary to promiſe, and ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
thence) by conſtituting <hi>New ones</hi> in their places. It was one principall

then may the Parliament diſplace the Lord Keeper, for carrying away the great
Seale (the onely Seale of this high Court) in a ſurreptitious manner from them,
contrary to his duty, without and againſt their conſents, and make a new great Seale
and Keeper in lieu of the old.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Parliament is bound to take care, That publike Juſtice (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>In few words, this Parliament, without any exception of King, Courtiers, Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
or any other I have yet heard of; have made a new maſter of the Mint, at
leaſt reſtored an old one to his place, who was diſpoſſeſſed; coyned money, and
made new ſtamps for that purpoſe, where the old were broken or worne out, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings conſent, or any tax of treaſon, or diſloyalty: Therefore, by the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
Law and reaſon, they may lawfully make a new Great Seale, and Lord Keeper
of it for the ends aforeſaid, to ſupply the abſence, defects, and prevent the groſſe
abuſes of the old, without any Treaſon or diſloyalty.</p>

               <head>The miſchiefes occaſioned by conveying away the Great
Seale from the Parliament (repreſented to the Lords at a
Conference Iuly 5. 1643.) are theſe:</head>
               <p>1. IT was ſecretly and unlawfully carried away by the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi>
contrary to the duty of his place; who ought himſelfe to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Parliament, and not to have departed without leave; nor
ſhould have beene ſuffered to convey away the Great Seale, if his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
had been diſcovered.</p>
               <p>2. It hath been ſince taken away from him, and put into the hands
of other dangerous and ill affected perſons; ſo as the Lord Keeper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſent unto by the Parliament for the ſealing of ſome Writs, returned
anſwer, That he could not Seale the ſame, becauſe he had not the Seale
in his keeping.</p>
               <p>3. Thoſe who have had the mannaging thereof have imployed it
to the hurt and deſtruction of the Kingdome ſundry waies. By making
<hi>new Sheriffes</hi> in an unuſuall and unlawfull manner, to be as ſo many
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:159084:20"/>
                  <hi>Generals</hi> or <hi>Commanders</hi> of Forces raiſed againſt the Parliament. By
iſſuing out illegall <hi>Commiſſions of Array,</hi> with other unlawfull Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
for the ſame purpoſe. By ſending forth <hi>Proclamations</hi> againſt
both Houſes of Parliament, and ſeverall Members thereof, proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
them <hi>Traitors,</hi> againſt the Priviledges of Parliament and Lawes
of the Land. By ſealing <hi>Commiſſions of Oyer and Terminer</hi> to proceed
againſt them, and other of His Majeſties good Subjects adhearing to
the Parliament, as <hi>Traitors.</hi> By ſending <hi>Commiſſions</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi> to
treate a peace with the Rebels there, contrary to an Act of Parliament
made this <hi>Seſſion.</hi> Beſides, divers other <hi>Dangerous and illegall acts</hi> have
been paſſed under the Great Seale, ſince it was ſecretly conveyed away
from the Parliament, whereby great calamities and miſchiefes have
enſued, to the Kindomes prejudice.</p>

               <head>The miſchiefes proceeding through want of the Great Seale.</head>
               <p>1. THe Termes have been adjourned; the courſe of juſtice obſtructed.</p>
               <p>2. No originall Writs can be ſued forth without going to <hi>Oxford;</hi>
which none who holds with the Parliament can doe, without perill of
his life or liberty.</p>
               <p>3. Proclamations in Parliament cannot iſſue out, for bringing in
Delinquents impeached of <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> or other <hi>Crimes,</hi> under paine
of forfeiting their eſtates, according to the ancient courſe.</p>
               <p>4. No Writs of Error can be brought in Parliament, to reverſe erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
judgements; nor Writs or Election ſued out for chooſing new
Members, upon death or removall of any; whereby the number of the
Members is much leſſened, and the Houſes in time like to be diſſolved,
if ſpeedy ſupply be not had, contrary to the very Act for Continuance
of this Parliament.</p>
               <p>5. Every other Court of Juſtice hath a peculiar Seale; and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
the ſupremeſt Court of <hi>England,</hi> hath no other Seale but the
Great Seale of <hi>England;</hi> which being kept away from it, hath now no
Seale at all; and therefore a new Seale ought to be made.</p>
               <p>6. This Seale is <hi>Clavis Regni;</hi> and therefore ought to be reſident
with the Parliament, (which is the repreſentive body of the whole
Kingdome) whiles it continues ſitting; the King, as well as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
being alwaies legally preſent in it during its Seſſion.</p>
