            <title>An humble request, to the ministers of both Universities, and to all lawyers in every Inns-a-Court To consider of the scriptures and points of law herein mentioned, and to give a rational and christian answer, whereby the difference may be composed in peace, between the poor men of England, who have begun to digge, plow, and build upon the common land, claiming it their own, by right of creation.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe occaſion of the publication of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
to the Ministers and Lawyers was
this: Upon a diſcourſe between Parſon <hi>Plat,</hi>
Lord of the mannor of <hi>Cobham,</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard
winſtanley,</hi> about the matter of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
upon the Commons in his Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Plat</hi> did promiſe and engage himſelf with loving
expreſſions, and words ſavouring of much moderation,
tenderneſs and reaſon, that if <hi>Gerard Winſtanley</hi> could
prove by Scriptures, the lawfulneſſe of the work, that is,
that the earth was made to be a common Treaſury, and
ought to remain ſo to whole Mankind, without reſpect of
perſons: That he would never hereafter moleſt the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but quietly ſuffer them to build and plant the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in his Lordſhip: And that he would bring in his
Eſtate, and become one in that community.</p>
            <p>This which here followes is a Copy of thoſe Scriptures I
delivered to him, which he had not then time to read over;
but upon diſcourſe at the ſame time, upon the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
he did not gain-ſay, but by his words of Gentleneſs
declared a condeſcenſion, to the light of that univerſall
freedom, held forth thereby to Mankind.</p>
            <p>For the preſent I offer this to the conſideration of all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and Chriſtian-ſpirited men, to judge in the caſe;
And according as Mr. <hi>Plat</hi> gives anſwer, I ſhall be as
ready to declare and publiſh.</p>
            <closer>For the preſent farewell.

and the poor People of <hi>England.</hi> The poor people
ſay, the common Land is their due, by right of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by the Lawes of a Common-wealth. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
encouraged herefrom, do build houſes, and plant them
corn for their Livelihood, upon the Commons and waſt Land,
that they may live like men, in their right of Creation; and that
they may enjoy the benefit of a free Common-wealth, as they
are <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Mannours</hi> ſay, it is not their Creation-right;
thereupon beat them, pull down their houſes, and much abuſe
them, puſhing the poor with their hornes of power, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
Beaſts.</p>
            <p>And though the difference riſe higher and higher between
them, both in point of Conſcience, and point of Law yet hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
there does not any appear to reconcile the difference,</p>
            <p>But Gentlemen, let it not be ſaid hereafter among poſterity
but that there were ſome wiſe men among you, that were not
blinded by paſſion, covetouſneſs, and ſelf-intereſt; but that you
would adventure to ſpeak for righteouſneſs, and that took the
cauſe of the poor into your hands.</p>
            <p>This difference between Lords of Mannours and the poor, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the common Land, is the greateſt controverſie that hath
riſe up this 600. yeares paſt.</p>
            <p>If reaſon and righteouſneſs which is the foundation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and juſt Lawes do give it us: let us have our freedom
quietly; if neither reaſon nor righteouſneſs give us this freedom,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is plaine, that the Scriptures conſiſts of Three Parts.
Firſt, they declare the righteous Law of Creation,
wherein God gives to all Mankind, equall freedome,
without reſpect of perſons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they declare the fall of Mankind from this righteous
Law; and the various unrighteous actings of Mankind, under his
falne eſtate, or power of darkneſſe, by whom he is taken priſoner.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they declare the reſtoration of Mankind to his creation-rigteouſneſſe:
By whom he is reſtored: And the actings and
converſation of Mankind upon his reſurrection from under that
dark, or faln eſtate.</p>
            <p>Ile begin with the Firſt, and take notice how the Scriptures gives
an univerſal freedome in the Earth to whole Mankind.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> God ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man:</hi> By Man, in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
number implies, Mankind. <hi>And let them have dominion:</hi> By
Them, in the plurall number, implies, whole Mankind in all his
branches.</p>
            <p>Againe: he created Man; that is: Mankind. <hi>Male and female,
created he Them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 27. &amp; Ver. 29</note> And bid them, in the plurall number; <hi>increaſe,
and multiply, and repleniſh the earth:</hi> and after Mankind, in his
varietie of branches, did increaſe and fill the earth. Then the creating
Power, or God, gives 2 Commands more.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>To ſubdue the Earth.</hi> And this implies, plowing, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all kind of manuring. So then obſerve. That bare and
ſimple working in the Earth, according to the freedome of the
Creation, though it be in the ſweat of mans browes, is not the
curſe.</p>
            <p>But for one part of Mankind, to be a Task-maſter, and to live
Idle; and by the Beaſt-like power of the ſword, does force ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171096:4"/>
part of Mankind to worke as a ſervant and ſlave. This is
the power of the curſe, which makes mankind eat his bread in
ſorrow by the ſweat of his browes.</p>
            <p>The Second Command from God, was this, to Mankind. <hi>That
he ſhould have dominion over the Fiſh, Fowle, Beaſts, Hearbs,
Plants.</hi> And this implies; that whole Mankind, ſpread abroad
in variety of bodies, and yet but the unity of one Creation,
Mankind is the Lord of the Earth: As <hi>David</hi> ſaith; <hi>The earth is
the Lords:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 24. 1.</note> that is, Mankinds.</p>
            <p>But there is not the leaſt tittle ſpoken, that one part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
ſhould ſubdue, and rule in oppreſſion over another, for this
came in after the fall, and is the Beaſtly Power that hath beene
ſuffered to reigne,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 25.</note> for a time, times, and dividing of time.</p>
            <p>When Mankind lives in the unity of the one Spirit of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe;
he lives in the light, and the light lives in him; which
is Chriſt in him, the light of the Father, or the reſtoring
Power.</p>
            <p>But when Mankind lives in diviſion, contention, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
one part of Mankind hedging themſelves into the earth
by force and ſword, (as experience ſhewes, the ſtrongeſt ſword,
rules over the weakeſt) and thereby ſhutting out another part of
Mankind,<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 1.</note> making them ſlaves.</p>
            <p>Now Mankind lives under the power of the Fall,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> In dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and darkneſſe lives in him. And this darkneſſe is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
or ſonne of bondage, which cauſes all diviſion and ſorrow.</p>
            <p>This ſame Creation-Right, or common freedome in the earth
among Brethren, was confirmed by Covenant from God, to <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
and his Seed,<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 9.</note> without limitation or reſpect of perſons.</p>
            <p>So that, we ſee when that Almighty power did work a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
in the earth, he gave the earth ſtill to be in common;
ſhutting out none, from enjoying the benefit of his Creation:
But when Mankind began to quarrell about the earth; and
ſome would have all, and ſhut out others, forcing them to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
This was Mans fall,<note place="margin">Jer. 45. 5.</note> it is the ruling of the curſe, and is the
cauſe of all diviſions, wars, and pluckings up.</p>
            <p>This ſame Creation-Right,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 8.</note> or Univerſall Freedome in the earth,
was confirmed by Covenant to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or reſtraining any part. Now in this Covenant to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:171096:4"/>
God points out the work of reſtoration by Chriſt, the reſtoring
Power, who ſhall be the joy and bleſſing of all Nations.</p>
            <p>So that in the work of reſtoration, God brings Mankind to this
univerſall freedome in the Earth, without reſpect of perſons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the righteous Law of the firſt creation of all things.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the Scriptures declare the Fall of Mankind from
this righteous Law of Creation.</p>
            <p>And the fall of Man,<note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 12</note> is declared in theſe words: Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in honour, abideth not; that is: he being made the Lords of the
Earth, and had dominion over the Fiſh, Fowle, and Beaſts, and was
free in himſelfe; yet he abode not in that honour.</p>
            <p>For one part of Mankind, ſeeking to enſlave another part, ſetting
up one to be a King,<note place="margin">Rev. 19. 19. 20.</note> or Lord, caſting another at his foot-ſtoole, the
ſtronger part hedging himſelfe into the Earth, by Armies and Selfe-will
Lawes, and thereby hedged out others, did hereby become like
the Beaſts that periſhes.</p>
            <p>And how is that?<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 14.</note> even as the beaſts, that puſhes one another
with their hornes,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 25.</note> ſo does Mankind; ſo that Mankind, in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings
each to other, is become a Beaſt: And this Beaſtly Power
was to reigne for a time, times, and dividing of times.</p>
            <p>Therefore, whoſoever upholds this Beaſtly Power, and yet ſaies
they are the Sons of Chriſt, or reſtoring power, they lie, <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themſelves, and the truth is not in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scriptures likewiſe declares the actings of Mankind under
the fall,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 3.</note> or in darkneſſe. <hi>Cain</hi> roſe up in diſcontent, and killed his
brother <hi>Abel.</hi> The quarrell riſe about the Earth; for <hi>Abels</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
made the earth more fruitfull then <hi>Cain;</hi> thereupon <hi>Cain</hi>
would take away <hi>Abels</hi> labour from him by force.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Brothers did type out, or fore-run all the acting
betweene man and man, from that time to this; being a
plaine declaration of that darkneſſe, into which Mankind is
falne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> Law of equity, was but the moderation, or the curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in of the Fall of Mankind:<note place="margin">Deut. 5. &amp; Cha. 18. 18</note> for his Law was not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer:
but, ſaith he, <hi>there is one comes after me, mightier then
I, and him ye ſhall heare,</hi> which is Chriſt, the reſtoring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>All the wars and diviſions in Iſraels time,<note place="margin">Gen. 23. 4.</note> and ſince: and all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171096:5"/>
buying and ſelling of Land,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 29.</note> and the fruits of the earth, which is
the art of cheating one another,<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 1.</note> is but the actings of Mankind in
darkneſſe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 1.</note> under the power of the fall; for, both Kings, Rulers,
and all people, have had their checks from God, for their unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
walking, or cruelty againſt <hi>Abels</hi> plain-hearted Spirit. And
all the great combuſtions that hath been, and yet is, in the world, is
but politick, covetous, murdering <hi>Cain;</hi> holding <hi>Abel,</hi> or the honeſt
plaine dealing heart under him; or the ſon of bondage, perſecuting
the ſon of freedome.</p>
            <p>Now in the Third Particular. The Scriptures declares the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
of Mankind, to his Creation-righteouſneſſe; or that
the Sonne of Righteouſneſſe ſhall riſe up, and expell the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>And there are 3 degrees of this Firſt the Scriptures declares
promiſes of reſtoration;<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> as in theſe words: <hi>The Seed of the
Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed ſhall be
the joy and bleſſing of all Nations.<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 8.</note> The bright appearing of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 10.</note> the reſtoring Power, ſhall deſtroy Anti-Chriſt, or that
darkneſſe in man,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 27.</note> called the Myſtery of iniquity, that rules in,
and enſlaved Mankind.<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 45.</note> 
               <hi>And in the latter dayes, they ſhall be all
taught of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and the Spirit of truth, ſhall lead them into all truth.</hi>
And ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Now theſe, and ſuch like promiſes, declares the reſtoring of
Mankind to his originall righteouſneſſe, and that they ſhall be
brought to be of one heart, and of one mind; and that they
ſhall be freely willing to let each other enjoy their Creation-rights,
without reſtraining, or moleſting one another; but every one
doing as they would be done by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 2. 4. &amp;</note> 
               <hi>the Scriptures declares Prophecies, foretelling the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration,
in ſuch words as theſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> The Swords ſhall be beaten into
Plow-ſhares,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 34. 35.</note> and Spears into pruning-hooks, and Nations ſhal learn
war no more; but the Lion and the Lamb ſhall feed together: the
waſt places ſhall be builded, and the deſolate land ſhall be tilled,
whereas it lay deſolate in the ſight of all that paſſed by.</p>
            <p>This ſhewes, that the Commons, Heaths, and waſte land, that
hath lain barren,<note place="margin">Joel 2. 21.</note> by reaſon of the unrighteouſneſſe of Kings, and
Lords of Mannors,<note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 34.</note> that would not ſuffer the enſlaved poore to
till,<note place="margin">Zachar. 8.</note> and manure it, ſhall in the day of Chriſts Power, be manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171096:5"/>
and be made fruitfull, that there may be no beggery nor
miſery among Mankind, but that every body may freely enjoy their
creation rights.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20.</note> the Scriptures declares the reſurrection of the ſpirit of
freedome within Man-kind. As in theſe words; <hi>The whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
groaneth and travelleth in pain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>waiting for a reſtoration.</hi> And
<hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body
of ſinne:</hi> That is, who will deliver mee from my covetouſneſſe,
pride, envy, uncleanneſſe, ſelfe-love, and this great power of
darkneſs in me, that hinders me, that I cannot doe to others, as
I would have them doe to me: And that enſlaves mee within, ſo
that I cannot quietly ſuffer others to enjoy their creation rights in
the earth.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles were hated, ſlandered, perſecuted, and bore all
patiently, rather then ſtrive againe, that they might hold forth the
righteous law of creation: This ſhewes the reſurrection of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Love in them.</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt was ſlandred, beaten, reviled, and at laſt put to
death, for no cauſe; yet hee reviled not againe, but ſuffered all
patiently, that he might honour his Father. The ſpirit of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
this ſhewes the reſurrection of the ſpirit from under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and a growing up of freedome and light.</p>
            <p>This ſpirit of Love, Patience, Humility, and Righteouſneſſe,
is called the light of the world, and the ſalt of the earth, which
brings mankind into a moderate, meeke, Loving, and ſeaſonable
condition:<note place="margin">Math 7. 12.</note> It is the reſtoring ſpirit, teaching all men to doe as
they would be done by.<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 15.</note> He that hath this ſpirit, will never ſtrive
to be a Lord of Mannor,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 27.</note> or a divider of Land; for he will quietly
ſuffer every one to enjoy the freedome of his creation.<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 15.</note> This ſpirit
deſtroyes all enmitie: This is the Goſpel: This is Chriſt, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to be the joy of all Nations, which the Miniſters of Chriſt
muſt preach if they be faithfull to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is the ſpirit of poverty, that hath been a ſervant in the
world a long time, but now is appearing and riſing up to draw all
men after him.</p>
            <p>This poore man is hee, that ſaves Man-kinde from utter ruine,
and yet he is deſpiſed by Ignorance. This poore man ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171096:6"/>
in ſonnes and daughters,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 9, 10.</note> ſhall inherit the Earth: This is he
that will give Man-kind a full freedome in the earth, and take off
all bondages, therefore he is called the bleſſing of the earth. But
the power of covetouſneſſe, which is the divider of land, is called
the curſe of the Earth, and murtherer.</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt bid the young man ſell all that hee had, and give to
the poore:<note place="margin">Luk. 3. 5, 6.</note> This ſpeech extends to all men, as well as to that ſelfe-conceited
young man.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt appeares in glory, in the day of his power, hee
will make crooked wayes ſtreight, and ruffe wayes ſmooth, throw
downe the Mountaines, and fill up the Valleyes.</p>
            <p>This declares the univerſall reſtoration of Man-kind to the law of
righteouſneſs, from whence he fell; for when once the Law of
Love and truth is written in the heart of Man-kinde, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
quarrell one with another about the earth, who ſhall have it,
and who not, for it is the birth-right and Inheritance of
all.</p>
            <p>For ſaith Chriſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 20. 25.</note> though the Gentles ſeeke Dominion and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
one over another, yet ſaith Chriſt, it ſhall not be ſo among
you who are my followers.</p>
            <p>Now theſe of the Parliament, Armie, Clergy, Lawyers, and
people of <hi>England</hi> that profeſſes to follow Chriſt: and yet exerciſes
Lord-ſhip over their brethren, not ſuffering their brethren quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to live by them on the Earth; they doe deceive themſelves, and
are hypocrites.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>woe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 1.</note> 
               <hi>woe, woe, to you Rich men</hi> (and Lords of
Mannors) <hi>howle and weepe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 16. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The oppreſſor ſhall fall: and he that
takes the ſword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 52.</note> 
               <hi>and rules by it over brethren, ſhall periſh by it.</hi>
He that hedges himſelfe into the earth, and hedges out his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not ſuffering his brother to enjoy the benefit of his creation;<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 13. 15.</note>
That man is a Thiefe, and a Murtherer, and an Enemie to
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And here I conclude, that theſe fore-mentioned Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but a gleaning of the Bible, gives a full warrant to all poore
men, to build them houſes, and plant corne upon the Commons
and unnurtured land, for their comfortable livelihood, as they are
part of Man-kind, being the right of their creation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:171096:6"/>
And whoſoever denies or hinders them of this freedome, doth
deny God, Chriſt, and Scriptures, and overthrows true and pure
undefiled religion.</p>
            <p>True Religion, and undefiled, is to let every one quietly have
earth to manure, that they may live in freedome by their labours;
for it is earth that every one ſeekes after, that they may liue in peace,
let them ſay what they will.</p>
            <p>The practiſe of the Gentry is to have the Earth to themſelves:
It is that the Armie fights for: It is that the Clergy preaches for;
for if you deny him Tithes, or a Maintenance, you ſhall not heare
of him.</p>
            <p>Nay, is it not the bottome of all National lawes, to diſpoſe of the
Earth: and does not this appear to be true, by the practiſe of Lords
of Mannors and the Gentrie, that cannot be at reſt for vexing and
fretting, becauſe poore men begins to ſee their creation-freedome,
and begins to build upon, and plant the Commons.</p>
            <p>And men that in other caſes are mild and ſeemingly loving, are
like Lions and Devils, ready to kill and deſtroy theſe poore diggers;
and not only the Gentry, but the Clergy generally are mad againſt
this worke: Well, the power of darkneſſe, and the fall, rules in theſe
men; for if the reſtoring ſpirit, Chriſt, were in them, they would
doe as they would be done by.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the Scriptures confirms this creation Right to whole
man-kind, then in the next place it followes,</p>
            <p>That all the Title and Power, which Lords of Mannors have to
the Common land, whereby they beate the people off from this
their freedome, Is no other but the will of Kings, who were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours,
and ruled ſucceſſively by ſwordly power, inſlaving the
creation Man-kind in England.</p>
            <p>Firſt then conſider, That King <hi>CHASLES</hi> and his Lawes
was the Succeſſor of the perſon and power of <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
for he did not rule by the law of creation, ſuffering every one
to enjoy their creation-right on the earth: But by the lawes of a
Conqueſt, which intitles ſome to the earth, and ſhuts out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That K. <hi>Charles,</hi> and that Kingly Lordly conquering
government, is caſt out of England, by the victory of the Armie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:171096:7"/>
him, and by words and Acts of Parliament. If they doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
loſe this their honour and peace too, by their ſelfe-love and
covetouſneſſe, ſuffering the enemie to cheate them by policy, and
thereby being in Kingly power again, who could not overcome
them in the Field.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing Kingly and Lordly power is declared againſt both by
Army and Parliament, the people wants nothing now but poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Common-wealths freedome; for our freedome muſt
not lye within the claſps of a Booke, in words that may be read;
nor in the bare title of a Victory: but it muſt be freedome really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
or elſe it will do us no good.</p>
            <p>The firſt Parliament law, which encourages the poore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
of England, to plant the Commons and waſt land, is this;
wherein they declare England to be a free Common-wealth: This
Law breakes in pieces the Kingly yoake, and the lawes of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
and gives a common freedome to every Engliſh-man, to
have a comfortable livelihood in this their own Land, or elſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Parliament did make this law, preſently after
the Kings head was cut off; That they would eſtabliſh all the old
ancient fundamentall lawes, wherein the Lives, Liberties, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and eſtates of the people of England without exception,
were concerned.</p>
            <p>By this they give a common freedome to every Engliſh-man to
have and enjoy the land for their comfortable livelihood by their
labours, without reſtraint of any.</p>
            <p>For the Ancient fundamentall Law is <hi>Salus populi,</hi> the ſafety,
peace, and preſervation of the whole body of the people, excepting
none.</p>
            <p>And this fundamentall law, called <hi>Salus populi,</hi> was that which
gave life and ſtrength to the Parliament and Army to take up Armes
againſt the King; for they had not the leaſt letter of any written
law for their warrant at that time, all the lawes being for the King,
and none againſt him.</p>
            <p>Now if there be any Ancient Lawes of the Conquerour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealed,
whereby the people are hindered of a quiet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Common-wealths freedome, they are all blotted
out and aboliſhed by this Act of Parliament, which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:171096:7"/>
Therefore the poor people, being part of our <hi>Commonwealth,</hi>
and being impoveriſhed by the <hi>Kingly Lordly</hi> &amp; Power, which is
now caſt out, are freed from the oppreſſions of all thoſe Lawes,
whereby their lives, liberties, perſons and creation-rights, were
enſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aved: And <hi>Salus populi,</hi> is the fundamentall Law, that gives
that life and ſtrength and courage to build upon and plant the
common Land, for their comfortable livelihood. This is the
<hi>Commonwealths</hi> Law, and the <hi>Commonwealths</hi> Freedom.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, The <hi>Parliament</hi> have made an act to free the
People, from yielding obedience to the <hi>King,</hi> and to all that
hold claiming under the <hi>King.</hi> This Law likewiſe throwes down
the power of the Conqueſt, and makes <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> free in their
Land, that they may live comfortably in their <hi>Engliſh Commonwealth,</hi>
and quietly enjoy their Land now, which they could
not, while the conquering <hi>Kingly</hi> and <hi>Lordly</hi> Power ruled.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, The <hi>Parliament</hi> hath made an <hi>Engagement,</hi> to
maintain this preſent <hi>Commonwealths</hi> Government, againſt
<hi>King</hi> and houſe of <hi>Lords.</hi> This likewiſe is but a confirmation
of the firſt, to make <hi>England</hi> a free <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> And that
all <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> may enjoy the comfortable livelihood in the
Land, as Brethren, without reſtraint; for if I have not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to live in peace, and enjoy food and rayment by my Labors
freely, it is no <hi>Commonwealth</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Now in the purchaſing of this declared freedom, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people of <hi>England,</hi> have ſpent their Eſtates, as well as the
Gentry, partly by their free hearts in lending money to the
<hi>Parliament,</hi> partly by Taxes, partly by free quarter, and partly
by plunder in times of Warre. By all which our proprieties are
waſted, and the fruit of our labours laid down and accepted of,
both by <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> to be a price to purchaſe <hi>Salus
populi,</hi> the peoples creation-freedom, out of the oppreſſing
power of <hi>Kingly</hi> power.</p>
            <p>Therefore in reaſon and juſtice, I conceive, that if the poor
people do build houſes, and plant corne upon the Commons
of <hi>England,</hi> for a livelihood, they are protected and warranted
both by Scriptures, and the Lawes of the preſent <hi>Commonwealth:</hi>
And we expect the Officers of the Law, will be as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:171096:8"/>
faithful to us, to put us in poſſeſſion, as our Law-books are to
declare our common freedom,</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome Juſtices do ſay, that for poor men to dig
and plant upon the Commons, they do bring themſelves within
the ſtatute, to be puniſhed for vagrants, idle or wandring
rogues: to this I anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. That the Juſtice cannot call theſe men vagrants, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
rogues; for by the letter of the Law, it is no vagrancie to
dig and work; but when men are idle, wanderers, begging up
and down, theſe the Law lookes upon as puniſhable.</p>
            <p>But the Diggers they ſet themſelves to work, according to
the Law of creation, as they are <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of <hi>England,</hi> claiming the priviledges of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi>
according to the Lawes of a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> that they
may not beg, nor be forced to ſteale through want, and ſo be
hanged by the Kingly and Lordly Law.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Their digging upon the Commons for a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
is no Riot, though ſome Juſtices would make it; for
they do not fight againſt any. And their meeting together, is
no unlawfull or riotous meeting, unleſſe the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of many people in one field, to dig, plow, or reap, be a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,
or an unlawfull meeting.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lawes againſt Riots, or unlawfull meetings, as they
call it, was the Law of the fearfull Kingly Conqueror, leſt the
common people by their often meeting ſhould underſtand
their creation-freedom, and ſo ſhould joyn together, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
and caſt out him that had conquered them.</p>
            <p>Yet the Gentry and Lords of Mannors, who are part of the
<hi>Kingly</hi> and <hi>Lordly</hi> Power, they have met divers times in Troops,
and have beaten and abuſed the Diggers, and pull'd down their
houſes. Yet we do not heare that the <hi>Clergy, Lawyers,</hi> or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,</hi>
who would be counted the diſpenſers of righteous juſtice,
do ſpeak againſt them for Rioters, but againſt the poor labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men ſtill, checking the Labourers for idleneſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
the Gentry that never work at all: therefore if idle
perſons, who wander up and down idly, be puniſhable by the
Statutes; Then judge whether it be not the idle Gentry, rather
then the laborious poor man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:171096:8"/>
Theſe things I leave to the conſideration of all rationall men
to judge of, they being the foundation, whereupon our work
of community in the earth, according to the Law of creation,
being reaſon and juſtice is builded. And I deſire any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
man, <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Lawyer,</hi> to anſwer theſe, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
us, or elſe to raiſe up this foundation of Scriptures
and Law, not by take him <hi>Jaylor,</hi> which is the language of the
Beaſt; but by reaſon which is the voice of the man.</p>
            <p>Though this work of digging upon the Commons, have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
enemies, yet I am aſſured of the righteouſneſſe of the work,
and it ſhall take root in one place or other, before many yeares
paſſe over <hi>Englands</hi> head, I can ſet no time, but I wait for the
conſolation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ariſe up, and break forth in others, as
I have a taſte of him in my ſelf.</p>
            <p>The voice of the <hi>Dragon</hi> is, kill him, pull down his houſe,
beat him, arreſt him, take him <hi>Jaylor,</hi> impriſon him, he is a
rogue.</p>
            <p>But the voice of the Lamb is, love your enemies, let
him live, the earth is his creation-right as well as mine: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us do as we would be done unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> will you all ſtand looking on, and ſee
the <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Mannors</hi> exerciſe <hi>Kingly</hi> Power over the poor
men that claime their creation-right in the earth, and be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent?</p>
            <p>You would be called diſpenſers of Juſtice: here is a point
of juſtice for you to decide: this is the point upon which you
ſhall either ſtand or fall, be ſaved or damned; for you are put
upon the tryal.</p>
            <p>The week before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> Parſon <hi>Plat,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Horſley,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Cobham,</hi> where the Diggers
were at work. And <hi>Thomas Sutton,</hi> the impropriator of <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
came in perſon, and brought divers men, whom they hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to pull down a poor mans houſe, that was built upon the
Commons, and kikt and ſtruck the poor mans wife, ſo that ſhe
miſcarried of her Child, and by the blowes and abuſes they
gave her, ſhe kept her bed a week.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:171096:9"/>
And at this time I went to Mr. <hi>Plat,</hi> and ſpoke with him, about
our freedom in the Commons, he anſwered me, if I could make
it good by Scriptures, he would never trouble us more, but let
us build and plant: Nay he ſaid, he would caſt in all his eſtate,
and become one with the diggers.</p>
            <p>The next week after I carried him this writing afore printed,
being <hi>Munday</hi> in <hi>Eaſter</hi> week, and upon our diſcourſe, he
ſeemed to conſent to many things, and was very moderate, and
promiſed me to read it over, and to give me an Anſwer: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
he promiſed me, that if the diggers would not cut the
wood upon the Common, he would not pull down their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
And the diggers reſolved for peace ſake, to let the wood
alone till people did underſtand their freedom a little more.</p>
            <p>And upon <hi>Fryday</hi> in <hi>Eaſter</hi> week, he came and brought his
anſwer, which was this. He came accompanied with about 50.
men, and had hired 4. or 5. of them, to fire down the diggers
houſes: ſome that ſtood by ſaid, do not fire them, the wood
will do ſome good; his anſwer was, no, no, fire them to the
ground, that theſe Heathens, who know not God, may not
build them again; for if you let the wood alone, they will build
again.</p>
            <p>Thereupon at the Command of this Parſon <hi>Plat,</hi> they ſet fire
to ſix houſes, and burned them down, and burned likewiſe ſome
of their houſholdſtuffe, and wearing Clothes, throwing their
beds, ſtooles, and houſholdſtuffe, up and down the Common,
not pittying the cries of many little Children, and their fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mothers, which are Pariſhioners borne in the Pariſh. And
yet ſome of theſe hired men, lives not in the Pariſh, and ſome
are ſtrangers newly come into the Pariſh: and ſo were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
by the covetous make bate Prieſts, to do this heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
turkiſh act.</p>
            <p>The poor diggers being thus ſuddainly caſt out of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
by fire, both they, their wives and Children were forced to
lie upon the open Common all night: yet the rage of Parſon
<hi>Plat</hi> and his Company reſted not here, but in the night time,
ſome of them came again upon the Commons, while the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were quiet, and ſome of them in bed, and ſaid, we have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:171096:9"/>
Authority from our Maſter, that is Mr. <hi>Plat,</hi> to kill you, and
burn the reſt of your goods, if you will not be gone: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Sir <hi>Anthony Vincents</hi> Servant, called <hi>Davy,</hi> ſtruck at one,
and cut ſome of their Chaires and other Goods to peeces,
frighting the women and Children again. And ſome of the
Diggers asked them, why they would do thus cruelly by them,
they anſwered, becauſe you do not know God, nor will not
come to Church.</p>
            <p>Surely if the God of theſe men, by their going to Church,
teach both their preacher and they, to do ſuch cruel deedes; we
will neither come to Church, nor ſerve their God. Mr. <hi>Plat</hi> in
his Sermons can ſay, <hi>live in peace with all men, and love your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies:</hi>
therefore if the Diggers were enemies, he ought to
love them in action; but it is a true badge of an hypocrite, to
ſay, and not to do.</p>
            <p>Let every Mans actions be tryed, and ſee who ſerves God,
They or the Diggers. Mr. <hi>Plat</hi> and the Gentlemen, (ſo would
be called) that were with him, were full of rage, and gnaſhed
their tongues with vexation; but the Diggers are patient, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
quiet in ſpirit, loving to thoſe that have burned their
houſes.</p>
            <p>Therefore the poor Diggers have got the Crown, and
weare it, and the Prieſts and Gentry have loſt their Crown:
The poor have ſtriven with them 12. moneths, with love and
patience: The Gentlemen have anſwered them all the time
with fury; they would have the Earth and all freedom, but
they will not ſuffer the poor to have either earth or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but what they hire of them.</p>
            <p>But though the Devill be let looſe to ſwell againſt us, in theſe
Gentry that rule over us, by <hi>Kingly</hi> Power, or Law of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Conqueſt, notwithſtanding, they have taken the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to caſt out <hi>Kingly</hi> Power: yet his time to be chained
up drawes nigh: and then we are aſſured this righteous work
of earthly community, ſhall have a moſt glorious reſurrection
out of his aſhes.</p>
            <p>Nay farther, if this ſatisfies not Mr. <hi>Plat,</hi> but he &amp; <hi>Tho: Sutton,</hi>
of <hi>Cobham,</hi> have hired three men, to attend both night and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171096:10"/>
day, to beat the Diggers, and to pull down their tents or
houſes, if they make any more; and if they make Caves in the
earth, they threaten to murther them there, ſo that they will
not ſuffer the poor Diggers to live, neither above nor below
ground: if they beg, they whip them by their Law for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants,
if they ſteal they hang them; and if they ſet themſelves
to plant the Common for a livelihood, that they may neither
beg nor ſteale, and whereby <hi>England</hi> is inriched, yet they will
not ſuffer them to do this neither: And ſo hereby theſe
Gentlemen, take away both creation-right, and Common-wealths
right from the poor Diggers; for they command the
poor enſlaved Tenants and Neighbors likewiſe not to ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Diggers to have any lodging in their houſes, nor to
ſell them any meat for their money.</p>
            <p>And thus the fury of Parſon <hi>Plat,</hi> exceedes the fury of any
other Lord of Mannor. The chief ſetters on to burn theſe hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and to abuſe the Diggers, was Parſon <hi>Plat,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
his Tenants and Servants, were moſt of them there; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>Thomas Sutton</hi> and <hi>William Star,</hi> theſe are they that ſay
the Commons belong to the poor, and yet theſe rich men are
agrieved to ſee the poor make uſe of the Commons: the
actors in this <hi>Turkiſh</hi> deſigne, were furious beyond the fury of
the Beaſts; but many of thoſe that came were threatned by
<hi>Vincent</hi> his chief men, to be turned out of their Livings, if
they came not, ſo that this is not an act of the tenants by free
conſent, but the Gentlemen hired others to do it.</p>
            <p>Theſe men do ſo powerfully act the Image of the Beaſt, that
they will neither buy nor ſell with any freely, nor let any have
land houſes, or work under them but ſuch as have the mark of
the Beaſt; that is, ſuch as are filled with fear of them, and are
obedient to their beaſtly Power. And ſome of them ſay, they
do God good ſervice, if they can deſtroy or kill the Diggers.
Thus the Scriptures are fulfilled. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
            <p>And now they cry out the Diggers are routed, and they rang
bells for joy; but ſtay Gentlemen, your ſelves are routed, and
you have loſt your Crown, and the poor Diggers have won
the Crown of glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:171096:10"/>
For firſt you have not routed them by Law, for you durſt
not ſuffer the Diggers plead their own cauſe, ſo that it never
came to any tryal; and you have no Law to warrant your
Lordly power in beating of the Diggers, but the will of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſwordly power, which is ſelf-will, and Club-law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You have not routed the Diggers by diſpute; for
your impatient, covetous, and proud ſwelling heart, would not
ſuffer you to plead rationally with them.</p>
            <p>Neither thirdly, have you routed them by Scriptures; but
the Diggers have routed you by your own Law; by reaſon, by
Scriptures, and patient ſuffering all your abuſes and now your
name ſhall rot, and your own power ſhall deſtroy you.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, (theſe Lords of
Mannors Anceſtors) had put <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to death, they rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and ſent gifts one to another, and made merry, and in
ſuch like words, ſaid they had routed him. And ſo now theſe
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Phariſees, becauſe they have acted the power of the
Beaſt, and to the eye of the Beaſt, ſeeme to ſtand uppermoſt
for a time, they ſay they have routed the Diggers.</p>
            <p>But they are miſtaken, for the Diggers keep the field of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
quietneſs, joy and ſweet reſt in their hearts, and are fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with love to their enemies; but the Gentlemen are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
they cannot reſt for fretting, jearing, rayling, and
gnaſhing their tongues with vexation.</p>
            <p>They wil not ſuffer the Diggers to look to the Corne which
is planted upon the Commons, being about eleven Acres:
neither will they look to it themſelves, but let the Cattle ſpoile
it, that they may ſay, ſee, their labor comes to nothing. Are
not theſe men the curſe of <hi>England,</hi> that wil not ſuffer others
to live by the<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and will rather ſpoile corne in theſe dear
times, then let the poor enjoy their own righteous labors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Commons?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:171096:11"/>
This work of digging, being freedom, or the appearance of
Chriſt in the earth, hath tried the Prieſts and profeſſors to the
uttermoſt, and hath ripped up the bottom of their Religion,
and proves it meere witchcraft, and coſonage; for ſelf love and
covetouſneſſe is their God, or ruling power. They have choſen
the ſword, and they refuſe love; when the Lamb turnes into
the Lion, they will remember what they have done, and
mourne.</p>
            <p>And thus I have faithfully declared all the buſineſſes, and
though the power of their coverouſneſſe, ſelf-loving fleſh, hath
for the preſent trod our weak fleſh down; yet the ſtrength of
our inward man, hath overcome them; and is the Lord God
Almighty, above that power that rules in them.</p>
            <p>We have declared our Teſtimony, and now let freedom and
bondage ſtrive who ſhall rule in Mankind: the weapons of the
Sonnes of bondage being carnall, as fire, club, and ſword; the
weapons of the Sonnes of freedom being ſpiritual, a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
