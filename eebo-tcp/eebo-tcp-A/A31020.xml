            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you, to which they are so

then when they be moving

            <p>Nor is this without good

of <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues,</hi>
that <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi>
have treasured up in the fair
<hi>Tablet</hi> of your face, and rich

made such a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest

they are no longer mine, but
your owne. And (<hi>Curious

proud am I that you will
make use of your owne, in
giving a <hi>Theame</hi> to my

your Commands.</p>
            <p>For may it please your

among other passages of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
<pb facs="tcp:62864:4"/>
at Sir <hi>Johns,</hi>
there happened a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
concerning the <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
of Love,</hi> and <hi>triumph
of Beauty,</hi> in pursuance of
which the <hi>Trojan Prince
Paris</hi> his Judgement was
called in question, and he
blamed for disposing of the
<hi>Ball</hi> (as he did) to <hi>Loves
Mistris,</hi> when two other
great Deities were her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors;
Your well-worded

commanded me to become
her <hi>Advocate;</hi> so that there
was rather a necessitie of,
than an Arrogance in, my
undertaking it.</p>
            <p>Now (<hi>Excellent Lady</hi>)
so auspicious were my <hi>Stars</hi>
to me (above merit) that
these course-waled Passages
found good acceptance
<pb facs="tcp:62864:5"/>
from that noble Company,
but especially (which I was
most ambitious of) from
your Deare selfe, who bad
me file them upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister</hi>

should evaporate into aire,
and be lost, and enjoined me
to give you an exact Copy
of them, promising to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
them so far, as to let
them find roome in your

            <p>See here then (<hi>Fair Queen

A beauty whom the best verses and

and the hollow <hi>Granado's</hi> of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
She that hath been the rack of

shall not cost thee one sigh, or teare
of despaire, but shall freely come to

merits. Tell me for Loves sake, is
it not more lovely to lie intwined in
her foulding armes, like a Lilly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned

Apples of her breast, the <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
Peares on her cheekes, and the

of Parrats, the braines of Peacocks
and Estriches, prepared (in saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

the smoothest cut Diamond, or

            <p>First, in respect of himselfe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
policy prompted this Prince
to this disposall, for he being made
Umpire between three Deities wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

to winne favour with the most Potent,
which was indubitably <hi>Venus,</hi> if wee

of command and conquest; all

            <p>Secondly, I applaud his judging for
the Sea-born Queen, when I consider
the quality of the gifts that the three
goddesses were Mistresses of. The one
could lade his head with Starry

ambition of men: but why should his
great mind stoop to that Lure which
even a <hi>Cynick</hi> could disdaine? Did not
<hi>Diogenes</hi> preferre his Tub before the

men? through how many restlesse
nights and lesse restfull thoughts doe
they chase these sweet bitter joyes? as
the more we grasp the theevish sands,
the faster they steale through our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62864:41"/>
so is content the farther from

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuno</hi> could also have made him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of inexhaustible mines of gold,
the soul of the world, the price of lives

which most actions are byased: but
why should a Prince make that his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
which <hi>Plato</hi> banisheth from his
Common-wealth, as the mother and

exciting to sacriledge and murder?
This was too poore a bait to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
which was sleighted even by the
Shepheards of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> a happy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
wanting little, because they desired
not much. But this meanes <hi>Paris</hi> kept
himselfe from the fever of avarice, for
<hi>such is the sacred hunger of gold,</hi> that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62864:41"/>
who so enjoyes most of it, seeks (<hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone</hi>

I confesse it was some unhappinesse

had it been in the power of his Opticks

            <p>The true <hi>Idea</hi> of valour and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<hi>Paris</hi> could hardly forme in his
mind, but he might easily throng his
head with thoughts of tedious mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
dangerfull attempts, sleep-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
night-watchings, mortall wounds,
and thousand other <hi>Gorgons</hi> heads that
sense held out to deterre him; so that
who could imagine he should aspire
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62864:42"/>
to that as a reward, of the perill and
trouble whereof he had a full prospect,
and but an eclipsed glimpse of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
He saw but the thornes that hid
the Roses, and even this glimpse was
much clouded by the refulgence of the
third Deity, the beames of whose eyes
(those twinnes of light) so dazzled his,
as he could looke at no other object, so
fares it with a man that forces his eyes
against the Sun. The eye and the eare
be the <hi>Cardinall</hi> senses of inquisition;
and though the eare is the conduit-pipe
of Faith, which (as sacred Rolls report)
comes by hearing, yet certaine it is
that the eye takes in the perfecter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and presents the truest <hi>Idea's</hi> to
the mind, and that one ocular witnesse
is worth ten auricular.</p>
            <p>Suppose a couple of Apples were
profered to a child, the one as faire as
any in Sun-burnt Autumns store, as
beautuous as that which tempted <hi>Eve,</hi>
but of no extraordinary operation, the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62864:43"/>
other but of an indifferent rind, and
somewhat withered with lying, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storative,
and of an excellent vertue,
would any one blame the child (seeing
he cannot see the intrinsique worth of
the other) for chusing that which gave
a pleasant taste to the eye, before it was
seized by the teeth? No more cause
have we to chide with <hi>Paris</hi> for reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of <hi>Pallas</hi> for <hi>Venus,</hi> since he could
not discerne the worth and beauty of
the one, (it being hid in the secret Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet
of her soule) but might of the
other, since his eyes were full Masters
of the rare object of her exquisite
Phisnomy, and divine feature, with
which sweet looks she caught all her
beholders by the eye-lids; and being so
rarely faire, he might well thinke her
as rarely vertuous, for <hi>vultus index ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi>
the frame and composition of the
mind doth follow the frame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the body: so where the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
furniture is beauty, the minds
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62864:43"/>
must needs be vertue, grace and beauty
are so wonderfully annexed, so sweetly
and gently allure our soules, that they
confound our judgment, and cannot be
distinguished, which made the ancient
<hi>Poets</hi> put the three <hi>Graces</hi> still in <hi>Venus</hi>
company, as attending upon her, and
holding up her traine.</p>
            <p>Neither is the reward that <hi>Venus</hi>
could have bestowed on <hi>Paris</hi> to be set
in the reere, but deserves to be ranked
in the first file of desert; and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<hi>Paris</hi> as <hi>Paris,</hi> and not as a Prince,
hers of all the rest was most necessary
for him, she could restore his rib to his
side, which who so misseth, wants halfe
of himselfe.</p>
            <p>His fortune might play her selfe,
and suffer one that had more yron than
he, to take away all his gold, for fortune
is like <hi>April</hi> in raine, or the Moone in
the last Quarter, it will soone change;
but <hi>Venus</hi> could throw into his armes a
friend without change, a Play-fellow
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62864:44"/>
without strife, that after his thoughts
had kept full <hi>Terme,</hi> and been drowned
in the deep <hi>Idea's</hi> of State, could have
brought him cheerfull and <hi>vacant</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalls,
and proved the best <hi>Heleborum</hi>
against Melancholy. Did he desire to
extend his life beyond his life, and
make the Ages to come his owne? she
in requitall of his Princely embraces,
could yeeld him reall fruits of his love,
little living Pictures of himselfe, that
should alwayes carry him about them,
and transmit him to posterity, they to
eternity. Thus might he swallow time
its selfe, and outlive himselfe.</p>

            <p>This Goddesse also gave somewhat

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62864:52"/>
take up their Quarters in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of perpetuall night; omitting
more of little lesser fame, the noble
bloud of forty Kings ran A Tilt, if we
allow <hi>Hector, Troilus,</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> that title.
The free sword tooke liberty to act all
that it pleased, and was as familiar
with entrailes as the <hi>Augures;</hi> all hate
had licence given it, all fury had loose
reines, slaughter and death bestrid the
streets, whilst the gore he shed flowed
up, and stained his thighs, and carried
downe whole heaps of limbs, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
bodies, which the coles of their
owne flaming houses roasted; no sex
or age escaped, infants in the Porch of
Life, the sicke, the aged that could not
hope one day more from natures boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
fell, some to fil up the number, some
to make the prey, it was crime
enough that they had lives. <hi>Pluto's</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
boat-swaine fainted, and asked
a Fleet rather than a Boat to ferrie over
those sad soules to the blacke world,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62864:53"/>
whose bodies the mawes and Dennes
of Beasts could scarce containe, the
whole Earth became a Grave, and all to
satisfie a hot Lust.</p>
            <p>But if this had not happened, the
world had lost that high Example of
filiall duty and piety that <hi>Aeneas</hi> gave,
in burthening his shoulders with his
feeble and most aged Father <hi>Anchises,</hi>
and (leading by the hand his sonne <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius</hi>
of the age of twelve yeares) bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him through the wastfull flames,
maugre the wrathfull foes into the
fields of <hi>Phrygia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of these ashes also sprung the
worlds <hi>Phaenix,</hi> the <hi>Roman Nation,</hi> that
gave Lawes to all the rest, and the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
that performed acts of more
Palme than Fame has breath to blaze.</p>
            <p>And we have no reason to call <hi>Paris</hi>
the Viper that eat out the bowels of
his Countrey, because this sad event of
his judgement was hid from his eyes.
If Nature had made every man a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62864:53"/>
               <hi>Prometheus</hi> to contemplate, or a <hi>Tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
to prognosticate the event of things
before the action of them, or if we all
had our Nativities calculated to our
hands, and were fore-warned of, and so
fore-armed against those Legions of
perils that should encounter us in our
lives warfare, there would be no need
of the veneration of <hi>Fortune,</hi> or repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to her fane to implore her <hi>Protean</hi>
Deitie to be auspicious to us in the
conduct of our affaires; for a disease
when knowne is halfe cured, a wound
<hi>discovered</hi> is <hi>recovered,</hi> and a danger that
is expected is toothlesse and halfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented;
but we are not all allyed to the
<hi>Sybils,</hi> nor have we the gift of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
shared amongst us, because we
should have our minds intense upon
heroicke atchievements, and still <hi>aemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari
meliora,</hi> and leave the sequell to
vertue, who never failes to elevate her
patient sonnes above the reach of
chance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62864:54"/>
And as Ignorance is held to be the
Mother of Devotion; so (in this point)
its the cause of most mens industry:
For if all carried their destinies inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
on their foreheads, such as were
condemned to hew their livings out of
the Rocks, would never appeale to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to divert her harsh sentence, but
would sit downe in despaire, and sigh
out with <hi>Tacitus;</hi> Fortunae saevienti
submittendus est animus, or with <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Fatis Agimur, cedite fatis,</l>
                  <l>Non sollicitae possunt curae</l>
                  <l>Mutare rati stamina fusi.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>By resolute Fates we guided be,</l>
                  <l>To their pleasures submit we,</l>
                  <l>No care can alter their decree.</l>
               </q>
The <hi>Median</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Fates are not
like that pack of petty Tyrants that
make <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> to day, and
<hi>vote</hi> them void too morrow, no, their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62864:54"/>
inalterable <hi>Order</hi> is out, that we should
alwayes tug at the Oare, nor can our
anxious care contrive a way to ransome
us from these <hi>hatches,</hi> under which we
must ever <hi>lye at dead Anchor;</hi> wherfore
its better for us to subject our necks
to the yron yoke of servitude (forged
for us) with Sheepish patience, than
like the wild Bull strangle our selves
with strugling to breake that net from
which we shall never unintangle our
feet, and so by their <hi>sighs</hi> of desperation
(as with bellowes) they augment the
fury of the inraged <hi>wind,</hi> whereas if the
love of Vertue could make them <hi>swell</hi>
their <hi>sailes</hi> with <hi>breathings</hi> after the
<hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> they might perhaps
<hi>arrive</hi> at the <hi>Port</hi> of Honour. <hi>E contra,</hi>
if men were no greater strangers to
their ends than to their beginnings,
those that Fortune had selected for her
minions, would expect still to be dand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon her knee, and that the <hi>Cornu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copia</hi>
and redundancy of her best fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
should drop into their mouths,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62864:55"/>
whilst they (like <hi>Marcus Lepidus</hi>)
stretcht themselves upon <hi>Flora's</hi> green
Carpet.</p>
            <p>Therefore lest the ardour and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
after fame should be refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Cadets by their despaire of soa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
above the gutter, though they
should spread and try to flutter with
their Estrich wings of faint hope, or
in others by their presumption of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
borne up to <hi>Promotions</hi> hill on the
shoulders of their smiling Fate, and
there to find warme lodgings which
they never swet for, prudent Nature
lets no man know what the <hi>plot</hi> is that
she intends in the severall <hi>Scenes</hi> of his
life, till he comes to act the <hi>Epilogue,</hi>
which (contrary to other <hi>Comedians</hi>)
he usually desires to protract.</p>
            <p>Some in their passage through this
elementary world find their way strew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Roses, and their paths spread
with butter, others prick their feet
with bryars and thornes, and stick fast
in the muddy sloughs of trouble, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62864:55"/>
are compell'd like <hi>Haniball</hi> (upon the
<hi>Alps) vel viam invenire, vel facere,</hi> to
find or make way over the hedges and
ditches of incombrance: And as a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim
that steeres his unknowne course
to some remote shrine, when he comes
at a crosse way, is apt to take the fairest
path; Semblably we, when we meet
with any thing ambiguous, take our
owne construction, which is ever such
as the pulse of our affections beats af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and we sooth up our selves that
herein we deviate not from truth; for
<hi>facile credimus quod volumus.</hi> Thus
<hi>Aeacides</hi> demanding of the <hi>Oracle</hi> what
event his War with <hi>Troy</hi> should have,
he interpreted the <hi>Oracles</hi> answer,
which was,
<q>
                  <l>Aio te <hi>Aeacides Trojanos</hi> vincere posse.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Aeacides</hi> to vanquish <hi>Troy,</hi> I able doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce.</l>
               </q>
Thus, <hi>I Say thou art able to subdue the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi>
whereas he should have construed
this Amphiboly in this wise, <hi>I tell thee
the Trojans are able to vanquish thee.</hi> And
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62864:56"/>
that other Prince who enquired whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no he should make a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
expedition against his enemies,
and had this in a scroule,
<q>
                  <l>Ibis redibis nunquam per bella peribis.</l>
                  <l>Thou shalt goe thou shalt returne never
war shall end thee.</l>
               </q>
Put the second <hi>comma</hi> where he would
have had it meant, <hi>viz.</hi> next that verb
<hi>Redibis,</hi> whereas he should have placed
it next the <hi>Adverb nunquam,</hi> and thus
falsly animated he ingaged, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
his last, in the Attempt.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Ilian</hi> Prince <hi>Paris</hi> having the
3 Goddesses standing before him, and
pleading for the <hi>prize of beauty</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
it upon <hi>Venus,</hi> because he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
she being the potentest of the
three (in that she boasted her Trophies
over the chief of the rest) was most able
to doe him good or hurt, and that he
should be so perfectly felicified in what
she could confer upon him, as all the
scruples of gall that the other two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
could cast into his sweet messe
could not be able to imbitter it.</p>
