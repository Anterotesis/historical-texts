            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

immortal Prince, hath now for a choice cabinet piece illuminated in ſmall an invincible Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; Neither can any pen ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully commend his, as his own: Even commending Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity he hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done it; So that the preſent Age may glory, that the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

places of his commentaries. There is no doubt but thoſe great ſouls of which we have ſo often diſcours'd, were lodged in bodies of a mean ſize; your Anceſtors were Hero's, but were not Gyants, and the moſt part of their enemies had the advantage, both in ſtature and bulk: This hiſtorical truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without difficulty received, there can be nothing more juſt, then the conſequences drawn from thence; That had the men of thoſe times been weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and valued by weight; an <hi>Alman</hi> had been neer upon worth two Romans.</p>
            <p>The Almans were both lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and larger; The Galls were ſtronger and more numerous; The Affricans richer and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97432:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Greeks better poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and better skilled in the excerciſes of wreſtling and courſing; But the Romans fitter for command, better diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and more knowing in war; And with this diſcipline which ſome have called, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Empire, the ſource of their Triumphs, they have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugated the ſtrength, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the wealth, the ſubtilty, and even the vertue of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>You ought not to doubt but there was vertue in the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; The deſpiſing of death was common among the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians: The love of liberty, and the deſire of glory were not unknown unto them. But, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the tru uſe of al theſe things
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97432:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was to be found at <hi>Rome: Rome</hi> was the Shop where the gifts of Heaven were wrought, and where the goods of Nature were perfected. It was ſhe, who, firſt of all ſhewed to the world juditious Armies, &amp; wiſe Wars: It was ſhe knew how to mix, as it ought to be, Art with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, Conduct with Fury, and the Divine quality of the Underſtanding, with the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal actions of the Iraſcible part.</p>
            <p>Whereby it appears, That the Soul is Soveraign Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, of all things, aſwel of Military Actions, as of Civil Affairs: The principal part of valor depends not on the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the Body; neither is it a privation of reaſon, and a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

overflowing of the Gall, as the People fancy it; 'Tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the eies that ſee, nor the eares that hear, nor the arms that move; 'Tis the Soul, as a Poet ſays, quoted by <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>; 'Tis the Soul that doth all, whithout which the eies were blinde, the ears deaf, the arms paralitical; It is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and the author of all the operations of man.</p>
            <p>By the Soul a child hath caſt down a Giant, and Bulls are led in a ſtring; By the Soul an Architect ſitting ſtill, orders the work of a thouſand Maſons, and builds Temples and Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; By the Soul a Pilot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtirring, workes more then all the Slaves at the oare, and a man would vainly ſweat to

hoiſe and looſe the ſailes, did he not find his way by the Stars; By the Soul, <hi>Madam,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul having been commanded to make war againſt a King, an Enemy to the Republick, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the way ſo well, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo knowing in a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein he was altogether ignorant; That going from the City a man of Peace, he arrived at the Army a Great Captain, and diveſts his robes to gain preſently a battel: Thus did your Predeceſſors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence; Thus did they manage their firſt Armes; Their Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip was a Maſter-peece.</p>
            <p>I am confident you would ſee one of thoſe people? Can we finde out no way to ſhew you a Roman Conſul? Is there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97432:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no ſafer and more innocent means, then that of Magick, to bring him whole from the place where he is? For, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, you would ſee him, both in body and minde, with that gravity, which bred reſpect in the heart of Kings, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed the people with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; you would ſee him, with that viſible &amp; acknowledgeable Authority, which accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to Priſon and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which dwelt with him when he had loſt all, whereof Fortune could not diſpoyl him, when ſhe had reduced him to his ſhirt. Here he is, <hi>Madam,</hi> who comes not from the Elizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fields, nor from a fabulous habitation; He comes forth of the Hiſtories of <hi>Polibius</hi> or of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97432:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſome ſuch like Country, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he deſerves very well to be looked upon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he no leſs knows how to obey the Laws, then he knows how to command men, and with an elevation of ſpirit, which ſees the Crowns of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns beneath him, he hath a ſoul wholly ſubject to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the people; He reveres the ſanctity of that power in the hands of a <hi>Tribun,</hi> or of a furious Man, or of an Enemy, or perhaps of both. Beleeving, that to fail is the onely ill that can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to an honeſt man; He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves there are no faults little, and making a religion of the leaſt part of his duty, he even thinks he cannot be negligent thereof without impiety; He
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97432:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more eſteems a day imployed in vertue, then a long delitious life; A moment of glory, more, then an age of voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; He meaſures time by ſucceſs, and not by its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Acting by this principle, he is always prepared to hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous undertakings; He is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to devot himſelf, for the good of his Citizens, to take upon him the ill fortune of the Common-wealth; And whether the Oracle direct him, or the Inſpiration come from his own ſpirit, he thanks the Gods, as the greateſt grace they ever conferred on him; for that it was their will he ſhould be the General, which was to be killed of that Army which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97432:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould gain the Victory. In purſuit of this, <hi>Madam,</hi> there is nothing but muſt be eaſie to him, and nothing but we may beleeve of him; He knows neither nature, nor alliance, nor affection, where the intereſt of his Country is concerned; He hath no other particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt but that, and neither loves nor hates, but for publick concernments.</p>
            <p>A ſoul without a body, and rid of matter could agitate in no other manner, nor could it be leſs incommodated with its paſſions; but let us ſay more; It could not be leſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the vain appearance of humane things, aſwel thoſe which aſtoniſh, and thoſe which dazel us; The Bravadoes of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97432:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
day make no more impreſſion on his conſtancy, then yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies careſſes: Princes are as weak againſt him with their wild beaſts, as with their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. And if he had never ſeen Elephants, and were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible from behind the tapiſtry to bring forth all thoſe which are in <hi>Affrica,</hi> or in the Indies, he would conſider them but as a ſport, or the mummeries of <hi>Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> and not as a frightful and threatning thing for <hi>Fabritius.</hi> All what ever is frightful and terrible, in the world, is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to make him wink; All what is ſplendid and pretious cannot afford him temtation; He is neither to be overcome; Nor to be wonn.</p>
            <p>He is of thoſe courages,

               <hi>Madam,</hi> which were invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, were they aſſaulted onely with a lively force, and were a man alwayes to fight, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to make war. But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing for the object of their valor, to overcome what was moſt to be feared in their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they imagine it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to miſtruſt the reſt, and are leaſt careful in thoſe things which they beleeve leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; whence perhaps that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Poets comes, that the Demy-Gods had a part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them which was ſubject to death, and a place whereby they were mortal: Becauſe according to my opinion, there is always imperfection in the works of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that ſhe never takes ſo much care in finiſhing what ſhe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97432:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
makes, but that ſhe alwaies leaves the one ſide weaker then the other: Now, <hi>Madam,</hi> it is not to be doubted, but that this commonly is the weake part of great courages, and here their hearts are of fleſh, which every where elſe are of <hi>Diamond.</hi> There needs not ſo much reſolution to reſiſt the violence of Tyrants, as to defend ones ſelf from their favours; and the power which was given them to do ill, is leſs dangerous then the means they have whereby to oblige men.</p>
            <p>Yet do all theſe means fail, when they are to be imployed againſt a <hi>Roman.</hi> This mortal part is not to be found in his ſoul; he is equally ſtrong on all ſides; He is impenetrable to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97432:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vanity, aſwel as to fear and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; His ſeverity cannot be ſweetned, not even with the complements and flatteries of the King of the <hi>Parthians</hi>; He at once ſubverts diſcovered en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and guards, himſelf from hidden artifices; Nothing is contagious to a minde natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo ſound, and ſo well purged by the diſcipline of his Country; Neither the poyſon brought from far, nor the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring corrupted air, nor ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor citizen have the power to change the goodneſs of his conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Malecontents loſe their time and their pains, if they think to make him reliſh novelties, by infuſing in him an ill opinion of the preſent; How ſpecious ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97432:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the pretences are they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, though they ſpeake the publick good or liberty, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not the language; You were as good court a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal; 'Tis not a human enterpriſe to ſhake his immoveable fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; A Poet ſaid the Capitol was not ſo ſtable, And that <hi>Rome</hi> might ſooner change place; He would rather deſtroy Tyranny, then ſhare it with any man, and rather declare himſelf an Enemy, then a Colleague with an Uſurper.</p>
            <p>Can any thing be added to ſo great a Title. This one thing more, to witneſs the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proof of his vertue: The Republick, <hi>Madam,</hi> cannot loſe him, how negligent ſo ever ſhe be to preſerve him; He ſuffers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97432:14"/>
not onely patiently, but gladly injuries and injuſtices. It never ſunk into his minde to revenge himſelf of her by a civil war, and he prefers the name of an innocent <hi>Banditi,</hi> to that of a guilty <hi>Victor</hi>; He hath been perſwaded from his childhood, and ſince never doubted, That a ſon can never acquit himſelf of all he owes to a mother, though a wicked mother, though even ſhe became a Stepmother. And that a Citizen is for ever obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to his Country, even to his ungrateful Country, which even hath us'd him like an Enemy.</p>
            <p>Behold, <hi>Madam,</hi> you have near upon ſounded the bottome of our Conſuls heart, and the root of thoſe wonderfull things which you ſhall read in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97432:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let's now a while look on his outſide, on that part which is more expos'd to the ſight of men.</p>
            <p>You may obſerve in his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neither a Cowardly or a heavie Coldneſſe, nor a teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and precipitat Vehemency. He ſoftly makes haſte, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth with an inſenſible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Without diſquieting himſelf, he moves inferiour things neither more nor leſſe, Then the Intelligences without tiring themſelves move the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Spheres. To ſee him ſo little troubled about his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a man would ſay, That hee were not the Undertaker, and there appeares ſo much facility
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97432:15"/>
in the moſt painful functions of the Charge he executes, That although hee doth nothing meanly, Yet he doth nothing with Violence. Obſerve how with his Eys he leads the whole Army? How a Nod of his head keeps all the World in their duty? How his preſence onely eſtabliſheth Order, and drives away Confuſion? Truly, there is a delight even for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers themſelves; and even for thoſe who take no intereſt in humane Affaires to obſerve him in thoſe occaſions. The leaſt Motions of his body are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſome Vertue which renders him lovely. 'Twere hard to tell, Whether he be more neceſſary to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or more pleaſing to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97432:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Citizens. He Commands well but it becomes him well to command. His command, <hi>Madam,</hi> is ſo gratefull, That there is a crowd, There is an ambition, that there is a ſenſible pleaſure to obey him.</p>
            <p>That good Grace which ſhines in all hee doth, being infuſed into ſolid qualities, and being joyn'd with Underſtanding and other neceſſary qualities, is an admirable charm and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him to ſweeten the bitterneſſe of diſguſtfull Orders; ſo that hee can execute them without trouble of Minde, or repugnancy of will: It hath a ſtrange force to winn the heart of the Souldiery, and draw their inclinations, were they harder to move, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97432:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then the iron and ſteel they uſe.</p>
            <p>By this charm they binde themſelves not only to him, but they unlooſe themſelvs from all other things; They minde neither Pay, Plunder, or Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; They neither care for the feaſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of <hi>Italy</hi>; They demand and deſire nothing but their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, of whom they are ſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor'd, even ſo jealous, that they apprehend the end of the war, for fear onely they ſhould loſe him by a peace: They murmur againſt the Senate, when he is revoked, neither can they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate themſelves with a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which raviſheth the Victor from them.</p>
            <p>What an one, good God!
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97432:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Muſt ſo paſſionate a Militia be; 'Tis not obedience in purſuit of command; 'Tis zeal which even prevents it; Tis not affection which obligeth them to the cauſe of their Chief; 'Tis a tranſport which raviſheth them from themſelves, and makes him ſay, I am going with the tenth Legion againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of which I am no leſs confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then of mine own perſon; I know it would paſs through the midſt of flames naked, did honour, will, or neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. So that, <hi>Madam,</hi> they are no more ſouldiers of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which march with him; They are as the members of his body, which move when he ſtirs; They are as we may ſay, ſtranger parts of himſelf, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97432:17"/>
are more united to him then his natural.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the reſpect they bare him, is no leſs power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then the love they ſhew him; at leaſt its more powerful, then the right of life and death, which he hath over them; This reſpect governs and rules all his troopes; He drives or ſtops them, as he needs their different obedience; He might be unto them inſteed of Diſcipline. Let no man think, that it is the laws of war, or military orders, which hinders the ſoldiers from committing offences; Tis his preſence and his teſtimony. When they fail, they fear more leaſt he ſhould know it, then they fear to be puniſhed, and divers have been kept in their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97432:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
duties with apprehenſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing him, which would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have done it for fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or diſhonor.</p>
            <p>That, <hi>Madam,</hi> was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, which the <hi>Roman Army</hi> fear'd; and never did Souldiers ſo much ſlight their Enemy, nor ſo much redoubt their Cheif. There never was at once Spirits ſo fierce and ſo docile, did overflow the Field with more impetuoſity, and retire to their places in the Camp with leſſe appearance of having even gone out. After they had done wonders for Courage, they came to enquire whether they had done well or no; They came to render an accompt of their Victory, wherof they were ſomtimes fain to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97432:18"/>
and for which they were ſomtimes puniſh'd.</p>
            <p>This fear of Piety and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, hath produced thouſands of examples in pure Antiquity, and in the Colleges they paſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, they are ſo common, and ſo numerous: But we muſt chooſe what we are to preſent you; I muſt ſhew you, <hi>Madam,</hi> a mark of that generous fame, even when the Empire decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when <hi>Rome</hi> was no more then the ſepulchre of <hi>Rome</hi>; When Nature according to my Opinion, would preſerve her Rights, and make known that the Aſhes of things ſoveraignly excellent are ſtill rich and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p>Under the Empire of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> a Captain named <hi>Fulcar,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:97432:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inconſiderately caſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt the enemies, and having engaged his Troop in a diſadvantageous fight, when a certain man in that extremity, repreſented to him, That if hee would hee might yet retreat with a good part of his men. 'Twere better to die, ſaid hee, For how ſhall I bee able after this, to endure the ſight of <hi>Narſes.</hi> 'Twas not that <hi>Narſes</hi> was cruel, but that the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign vertue is redoubtable. 'Tis that the Mine of the General of a Roman Army is frightful to thoſe who have it not from naked ſwords, or aſſured death. With a look he pierceth the guilty to the heart, &amp; puniſheth them with his ſight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97432:19"/>Is not this, <hi>Madam,</hi> an effect of that Authority w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> comes from Heaven; of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority inherent in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him who hath it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſeparate from that other authority bred by the power given him by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, verified by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and to be read in Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Parchment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with Eagles, and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons in picture, by Rods, Axes, and Archers?</p>
            <p>This ſecond Authority of which you preſume I ſhould ſay ſomewhat, which as yet was never ſaid, Is a certain light of glory, and a certain character of greatneſs, which heroick vertue imprints in the countenance of men.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97432:19"/>
And this Character, and this Light, corrects the defects and the imperfections of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, makes little men appear great, imbelliſheth ugly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, defends the ſolitarineſs and nakedneſs of a perſon expos'd to the outrages of fortune, over-preſt under the ruines of a deſtroyed party, abandoned of his own wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and of his own hopes.</p>
            <p>This Character, <hi>Madam,</hi> is to this perſon a ſafeguard from Heaven, againſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences of the Earth; Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him inviolable to his provoked enemies; binds the hands of Traitors which com againſt him with ill deſigns; findes reſpect and tenderneſs amongſt <hi>Scythes</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:97432:20"/>By this mark the Roman Princes were known by their enemies in the Wars, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they diſguiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, although they were mixt in a croud of ſoldiers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had never been ſeen before. Nothing is able to blot out this character, nor to obſcure this light, not even diſgraces, impriſonment, and the chains of a poor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The Executioner falls backwards at ſight of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and can ſcarce forbear to beg his life of him. Hee fancies that a great flame iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues out of his eyes, which enlightens the Dungeon, and that he hears a hideous voice which cries out, <hi>Who art thou unhappy man, who dareſt lay
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97432:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thy hand en Cajus Marius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not theſe, <hi>Madam,</hi> give me leave once more to ask you, are not theſe the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the deareſt favours which can be received from the Supream vertue. And this ſecond Authority which ſurvives the firſt; This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which preſerves it ſelf in the ruines of power, which conſecrates misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, chains, and dungeons, which renders affliction holy and venerable. Is it not far a more noble thing then the unworthy proſperity of the happy? Then all the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all the Diadems, and all the Magnificence of idle Kings.</p>
            <p>Queſtionleſs, Authority is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97432:21"/>
far more noble then power, and that which is formed from the reverence of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, far more worthy then that which is eſtabliſhed by the terror of puniſhments. The pure and innocent tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of an infinite many ſubjected hearts, is far a more illuſtrious and glorious ſight, then the bloudy and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trophies of ſome caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down heads. I mean caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without any extream neceſſity, and for a ſhew on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a tyrannical and ſavage power, and if the Poets Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are the Philoſophers my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. Mee thinks, <hi>Madam,</hi> that their <hi>Jupiter</hi> did an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on far more admirable and more worthy the Father of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97432:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Gods, and the King of Men, when he removed all things with one of his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browes, and ſhaking his head cauſed <hi>Olympus</hi> to tremble, then when by force of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and tempeſt, he tears up Trees, and breakes downe Roofs.</p>
            <p>Power is a heavy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial thing, which draws af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it a long Train of humane means, without which it would remain immoveable. It acts only with Land and Sea Armies. Upon a march it muſt have a thouſand ſprings, a thouſand wheels, and a thouſand Machines. It commits a violence in fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtep. Authority on the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97432:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contrary, which holds from the Nobility of its Origine, and from the vertue of divine things, quietly works its wonders, Needs neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments nor materials, nor even time to ſet them on work. Its all wrapt up in the perſon of who exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, without ſeeking aid, or demanding a ſecond. Its ſtrong, though naked; and alone fights, though it bee diſarmed.</p>
            <p>Authority needs but one word to perſwade; Three of its ſyllables, <hi>Madam,</hi> humbles the bold, makes the rebel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſtops the impetuoſity, of mutinous Legions, ſtifles ſedition at its birth, and thoſe whom the General was wont
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97432:22"/>
to cal my companions, cannot endure that he ſhould name them either my Friends, or Sirs, Gentlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> or how you pleaſe to render <hi>Quirites.</hi> They fancy that that very word hath already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded them, That thoſe three ſyllables have torn their belts and ſwords from them, that it hath put them amongſt the ſcum of the moſt unclean, and moſt vile populacy.</p>
            <p>I would but ask you the queſtion, <hi>Madam,</hi> whether the name of <hi>Quirites,</hi> coming out of any other mouth, but that of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> would have entred ſo far into the hearts of the Legions, and would have had the ſame power over their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97432:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
minds. For my part I ſhould hardly believe it. I know the height of Rhetorick, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the vertue of the beſt pronounced words. But it reacheth not ſo far. Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is incomparably more perſwaſive, then Eloquence. The ſoldiers would have mocked a dozen of <hi>Ciceroes</hi> Orations, and yet yeild them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at one of <hi>Caeſars</hi> words.</p>
            <p>Nay, I doe verily believe they would have yeilded to his ſilence, had he been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have given them but a ſign of leaving the Camp, without having taken the pains to have ſpoken to them. By this dumb condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, treating them as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, and excommunicated
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97432:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by their Country, &amp; declaring them unworthy of any kinde of ſociety with their General, beyond that of complaints and reproaches which hee might have made them. Such a ſcorn would have ſo griev'd them, that they would have begged death for a favour, &amp; would have caſt themſelvs at his feet to pray him that he would handſomely diſpatch them.</p>
            <p>But I am vext that ſo great a word which was ſo great an action, was not of ſom Roman in the good and healthful time of the Republick, that I might not alledge a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vertue, whoſe cauſe was undecided, as was that of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi> I would, <hi>Madam,</hi> that this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97432:24"/>
example of Military Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were either of <hi>Scipio,</hi> or of <hi>Fabritius,</hi> that I might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly join it with that other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Civil Authority, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which you will give mee leave to conclude.</p>
            <p>You know well that honeſt Man <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> look upon him I beſeech you, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with years and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who ſo long time never ſtirred out of his chamber, and can ſcarce get himſelfe from his bed to his chimney. Yet in that condition, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to be carried to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to quarrel with all the Senators ſingle, and to oppoſe himſelf to the ſhameful peace they were about to conclude. 'Tis to bee believed, <hi>Madam,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:97432:24"/>
that they were no leſſe frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee that hideous old man, then if it had been a ghoſt, which entred the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Chamber, and in my thought, they did not at firſt take him for <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> They took him for his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or his fantaſme, which came from the other world to give them Leſſons, and make them Remonſtrances. Who came to tell them with a tone of command, and a ſtrong voice, which his anger raiſed in the weakneſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate body. <hi>Who ever was the Author of ſo filthy a Propoſition, is no true nor legitimate Roman. He muſt either bee a Forainer or a Baſtard. He muſt be the ſon of one of our ſlaves, or he hath not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97432:25"/>
a drop of bloud left of our fathers, which his baſeneſſe hath not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What would not this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry old man have done had he had his eyes, and the reſt of his body at liberty? Would hee not have beaten thoſe which hee was content to chide onely? Would he not have depoſed <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted him his Kingdome far from relinquiſhing by Treaty an inch of Land in <hi>Italy? I</hi> know not what hee could have done. But I know very well, <hi>Madam,</hi> that he did very much. <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> were agreed upon conditions for a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace. <hi>Claudius</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97432:25"/>
it, and at the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, comes and breaks it off. So that hee proves ſtronger then <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> both together, and carries it away from either of them.</p>
            <p>When ſo ſtrange a Newes was told <hi>Cyneas,</hi> its likely he cryed out, Behold, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing then I have yet admired in <hi>Rome.</hi> I have there ſeen a multitude of Kings, but as yet I had not ſeen their Tutor. 'Tis this blind Man who is the light of the Commonwealth. 'Tis this ſick Man, who warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.

            <p>TIs near the matter, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> What I yeſterday
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97432:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
anſwered you in our common Diſcourſe, when I took my leave. I have ſince found the ſenſe of my proſe in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a Poet, who never made any but thoſe. And I conceived it was not amiſſe after that manner to enter upon this days Conference, and to binde with a knot, which perhaps will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe you, the things I told, with thoſe which you would have me write unto you. Let's again, <hi>Madam,</hi> confeſs it. Its certain, that at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, God diſpenſed great largeſſes, and although his arm is no ſhorter then it was, yet are his hands leſs open then they were. Beſides, birth-right, which Antiquity
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97432:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath over the latter times, it hath had other advantages which ended with it, and are not to be found in the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It hath had vertues which our age is not capable of. It belongs not to us to be <hi>Camillas,</hi> and <hi>Catoes,</hi> we want the vigour of ſuch Men as thoſe inſtead to provoke our courages, they make our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition deſpair. They have rather braved us then inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted us by th<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir actions. By giving us examples, they have obliged us to an uprofitable trouble. They have given us what we cannot take. Theſe examples being of that height that there is no way to attain unto them.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay, <hi>Madam,</hi> that in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97432:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the moſt miſerable times, God cannot ſend ſome cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Soul to make us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his firſt Magnificence. I will not deny but that hee may take a particular care of that ſoul, and but that hee hath meanes to preſerve it from the vices of the Court, and the contagion of Cuſtom. In the moſt general ſtupidity of the world, there is ſome one found to awake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt, who breaks the bounds of the age, who is capable to conceiv the <hi>Idea</hi> of ancient vertue, and to ſhew us that the miracles of Hiſtory are ſtill poſſible things. Its true, <hi>Madam,</hi> there is ſuch an one: But this one makes no number; he marks even ſterility, neither doth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97432:28"/>
hee hinder this ſolitude. Is there a priviledged ſoul, an extraordinary perſon, an <hi>Hero</hi> or two in all the world. Yet is there not a multitude of <hi>Heroes.</hi> There is no people of extraordinary perſons. There is no more a <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Romans.</hi> We muſt ſeek them under ruines, and in their Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We muſt adore their Reliques in the Books I have told you of, and in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I have deſired you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> at firſt thought to be quit, having marked thoſe places, and choſen you thoſe Books. Yet are you not ſatisfied therewith, and it ſeems you pretend that I ſhould adde what is wanting to thoſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97432:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Books. The glories and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſatisfie not your curioſity. It enquires of me ſome things more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and leſs known. You would deſire, <hi>Madam,</hi> that I ſhould ſhew you the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they hid themſelves, and that I ſhould open to you the door of their Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. After having ſeen them out of ceremony, you would be acquainted with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and know from me if ſo direct and elevated a greatneſs, could ſtoop to the uſe of a common life, could deſcend from affairs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments even to ſports and divertiſements.</p>
            <p>I doubt it not, <hi>Madam,</hi> all the houres of wiſe mens lives
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97432:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are not equally ſerious. Their ſouls are not always exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor always contracted, &amp; yet in the ſame vigor, though not the ſame action. Does any man believe that the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barites</hi> only loved Feaſts, and that they alone rejoiced. The <hi>Romans</hi> did it alſo: But they did it in another manner, &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved other manner of Feaſts.</p>
            <p>A voluptuouſneſſe which riſeth higher then ſenſe, which ſeeks the ſuperiour part, and fills it with images: That holy, chaſt, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent pleaſure, which acts on the mind without changing it, or moves it with ſo much ſweetneſſe, that it ſtirs not out of its place, or with ſo much addreſſe, that it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97432:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
removes it to a better place then it had. This pleaſure, <hi>Madam,</hi> was not a paſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of your Romans, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> and <hi>Laelius,</hi> uſed it without ſcruple. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and his friends were of thoſe honeſt voluptuous perſons.</p>
            <p>The Senate and the Field, Civil affairs and Military acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had their ſeaſons conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The Theatre and Verſe had theirs. The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the mind were never better taſted, then by them, and with the ſame hands with which they gain'd Victories, and ſigned the fate of <hi>Nariaeis,</hi> they wrote Comedies, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded thoſe who acted them before them.</p>
            <p>There is not every day
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97432:30"/>
               <hi>Hannibals</hi> to bee conquered, nor an <hi>Africa</hi> to bee ſubjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Antony</hi> and the ſonnes of <hi>Pompey</hi> died but every one once. And then came the general Calm in which the moſt turbulent were at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the world ſuffered it ſelf to be as peaceably go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, as if it had been but one family. So that they have ſometimes wanted enemies, &amp; ſometimes reſted in peace. And in this State, <hi>Madam,</hi> why ſhould they have made wars againſt themſelves? why ſhould they have ſought ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in their owne bowels? why ſhould they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a prey to a diſtemper worſe then <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and more cruel then <hi>Africa?</hi> Why
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97432:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould they bee afraid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, there being no body to diſturb their joy. The <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Sea being ſcoured, and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> reduced into a Province, <hi>Sixius Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> being onely names and phantaſmes. I muſt confeſſe, <hi>Madam,</hi> the deſire of glory was a ruling paſſion: But Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants themſelves doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reigne tyrannically. 'Twas the feavour of their minds, but this feavour did not always burne them with an equall ardour, it had as well its releaſes, as its dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. And do you not believ <hi>Scipio</hi> was out of his high fit, when he gathered Cockles on the Sea ſhoar with his friend, or when he lent his words to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97432:31"/>
               <hi>Cremes</hi> and <hi>Micio</hi> in the Fables of <hi>Terence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I undertake not here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide whether he &amp; his friend were the true Authours of thoſe Fables. It ſufficeth me to ſay, That probably they were the firſt approvers, and that they loved them, if they did not make them. And it may even be, That the Poet changed the diſpoſition of ſome ſcenes by their advice, and that ſome half verſes of theirs may be there. And what we finde fineſt and beſt aju<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>As for the Emperour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:97432:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in whoſe perſon I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the end of their good days, as I doe the flower of them in that of <hi>Scipio.</hi> Its moſt true, <hi>Madam,</hi> that hee hath judged moſt wholeſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the value and merit of every thing, and that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Glory, but that he hated not Pleaſure. I ſpeak of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in general, becauſe hee taſted of all, and having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded his ſenſes very much, he refuſed his Mind nothing. He diſcerned good and fair in all the ſubjects wherein it was to be found; and for that enquiry, he employ'd the beſt skilled, and moſt curious ſpies, ſo that they left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the ſucceeding ages to diſcover.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:97432:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>I dare not ſay, as one hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, that the Muſes were his Buffoons and Ieſters; 'tis an injurious and an uncivil word; I ſhall onely ſay, they had the honour to bee his familiars and his domeſticks, and at that time they were of his Court and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet.</p>
            <p>They were at leaſt call'd at houres of converſation, if not to the deliberation of affaires; and if it bee too much to ſay, that <hi>Virgil</hi> was the Fourth of the Councel held between <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> and his two friends, To know whether he ſhould Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Empire, or Reſtore Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. I ſomewhat ſuſpect the Hiſtory of that Councel, and I can ſcarce perſwade my ſelfe, that the gallant ſpirits of thoſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97432:33"/>
times were ſo much the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours confidents that he ſhould communicate with them affairs of that nature. I am ſatisfied to believe that they intended his vertuous pleaſures without aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a more important dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that hee cauſed the Palace gates to bee open for them, when they were ſhut to Supplicants and Petitioners.</p>
            <p>But when in farre diſtant Countries; nay, in the midſt of the Palaces clouds did riſe, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> obſcur'd the Calm I ſpake of; It was then, <hi>Madam,</hi> when the Muſes were no leſſe neceſſary, then they had formerly been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable: 'Twas then they did him ſervice, &amp; helped <hi>Livia</hi> to uphold her husband; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan already to ſtoop with cares
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97432:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and under affairs. During this diſeaſed and impatient ſeaſon, they were only imploied to ſeek pleaſures &amp; divertiſements for him: They did ſtrive onely to charm his paines with their ſongs; they ſtudied to appeaſe and ſet at reſt that impaatient part of his ſoul which inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watched &amp; tormented it ſelf, To eſtrange his fancy only from the debauches of his daughter, and from the defeat of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; To take away the ſight of troubleſome ſubjects by the interpoſition of pleaſing ones.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Madam,</hi> as it was no ſmal matter of merit for human Men ſometimes to make <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> ſleep, &amp; ſomtimes to chear him, the good Goddeſſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by juſtified themſelves from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97432:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the calumny of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who accuſed them as uſeleſs to the Republick, &amp; as fit to have no rank in the world. This good Prince ſuffering them alſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the too large violence of his thoughts, &amp; by taking ſome intervals of releaſe in thoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles which they took care to provide for him at the ſame time they did divers good acts. For beſides that they avowed themſelves to be his. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the innocent againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the old ſoldiers, &amp; the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the civil victory. He got prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers which uſe to be heard in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and honouring them with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, he rendred them triburary to his glory. But chiefly, <hi>Madam,</hi> he followed the Councel of Nature, which will have all who work, reſt; which entertains its durance by moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; threatens violence with an end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:97432:34"/>I know well that this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Underſtanding which was given to Princes for the Conduct of human things, is incapable of being tired, and would agitate continually, could it be alone. But being ingaged with the body, and having Organs which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly frail and delicate, it muſt manage them for their benefit, and in ſpight of it ſelf, fit it ſelf, to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a ſociety, with which it is ingaged. Princes cannot always be Angels, divorced from ſenſe, and enjoy the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a ſimple beeing; They muſt ſometimes be Men mixt with Matter and Subject to the changes of things compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. There muſt, <hi>Madam,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97432:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Tempeſts of Affairs, and the anxious Objects of the ills they are to combat, be a care taken to finde them pleaſures. Ports to divert and refreſh their Minds, and attracting Perſpectives which may untire and rejoice their eyes. They are the needs of human life, how rich and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſo ever it may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bee of it ſelfe. Labour would weaken the ſtrongeſt Mindes, had they not their helps and ſtayes to ſupport them. Melancholy would ſuffocate them, did they not thus reſpire. To ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly they are the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of reaſon, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the underſtanding. And he who hath diſcovered
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97432:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all the Truths under Heaven, and was ignorant of nothing which could be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Revelation, made ſo particular an eſteem of it in the Fourth Book of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks,</hi> that he was not afraid to ſay, That ſport and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement were no leſſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to life, then reſt and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
            <p>Its true, he makes a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as well as we of playes and divertiſements. Hee is not a Councellor of all kinds of debauches; neither will hee have wiſe men paſs their time as the Vulgar do. Hee hath diſcovered a Mean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by reaſon betwixt an ill humour, and a buffoone in which the ſoul dilates it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97432:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by a moderate motion, and doth not enervate it ſelf by a violent diſſolution. And of this Mean, <hi>Madam,</hi> he hath made a Moral vertue, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the good of company, in purſuit of two others, which he propoſeth to us in the ſame Chapter, for the ſame end. The firſt of theſe three Vertues is a certaine ſweetneſs &amp; facility of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which can accommodate it ſelf without ſervility, and approves not all that is ſaid without choice; neither by diſtaſte doth hee diſapprove it. The ſecond is a cleare freedome, and a cuſtome to ſpeak the Truth even in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, in as far a degree eſtranged from vain
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97432:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
oſtentation, and an affected reſtraint. I intimated before what the third was, and their three vertuous habits, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> rule all the commerce of words, and extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all the entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Men have of one another, whether wee hold pleaſing or diſtaſtfull diſputes, whether true or falſe, whether ſad or joyful. So that, <hi>Madam,</hi> without the firſt of theſe three Vertues, the Aſſemblies of Men would bee but Troops of Enemies mixt together, who would ſcratch &amp; fly in one anothers faces, or Circles of Lovers, who would adore their owne defects, &amp; eſteem their wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97432:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fair. Without the ſecond, they would but be the ſchools of Diſſemblers, who would ſcarce tell us what of the clock it were, or that it were day at Noon, ſo feareful are they of miſtaking. Or Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for Captains, who ſay more then they know, or then they have done, or then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could have been done. In fine, without the Third, of which we have ſpoken, the Aſſemblies of Men being too ſad or too merry, would ſeem either as the Convoyes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted perſons, and the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of a publique grief, or ſpectacles of naked perſons and the image of thoſe licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Feaſts, which durſt not appear before <hi>Cato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:97432:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Mean betwixt theſe two is a Vertue of a truth, neither ſo ſplendent nor ſo high as Wiſdom and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity; yet its a Vertue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Philoſophers, even by the Philoſophy of <hi>Cato.</hi> And ſhould we baniſh it out of our Morals, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication wee have with one another, would have bin but dry and thorny. Our Diſcourſe would rather have been a toile and a labour of the Tongue, then an eaſe and a diſcharge of the heart: and Society if we had permiſſion onely to diſpute and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, would trouble us far more then Solitarineſs, wherein wee at leaſt may laugh out of memory, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97432:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rejoice in our own thoughts.</p>
            <p>I cannot aſſure you, <hi>Madam,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſo praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a quality in the Infancy of the Republick; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though one of their Poets reports well of King <hi>Numa,</hi> and of the Nymph of <hi>Egeria,</hi> the Conferences which they had together, paſſing without witneſs, they could ſpeak of them but by conjecture.</p>
            <p>Theſe Victorious Peaſants knowing nothing but hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry and fighting, were ſenſible onely of groſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures proportionable to the hardſhip of their births; there is no great likelihood that they did poſſeſs a Vertue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97432:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they made profeſſion of, and which ſeldome accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies poverty, which is almoſt alwayes followed with an ill humour.</p>
            <p>So long as their Eloquence, to uſe the termes of <hi>Varro,</hi> ſmelt of Garlick and Onions, we could expect nothing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exquiſite, and it was hard for ſo ſad an auſterity as theirs to hearken to raillery, and to be toucht with joy. Firſt, then they were without weakning to ſoften themſelves; They muſt ſweeten their courages, and unruſt their Manners, That at laſt they might adviſe to cultivate themſelves, as they did their Gardens and their Lands.</p>
            <p>They indeed did it with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97432:39"/>
ſo much ſucceſs, and found ſo happy a foundation, That preſently the good <hi>Genius</hi> was amongſt them a popular thing. This politeneſs paſt from the Senate to inferiour degrees, even to the loweſt form of the meaner people. And if in their cauſe their own witneſs is to be believ'd, they have blotted out all the Graces, and all the Vertues of Greece, and have left the <hi>Atticiſm</hi> thereof far ſhort of their <hi>Urbanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its that, <hi>Madam,</hi> which they call'd that lovely Vertue of Society, after having pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed it many years without having given it a Name, and ſhould uſe have ripened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us a word of ſo ill a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97432:39"/>
ſavour, and have corrected the bitterneſſe which might have been found in it. Wee might accuſtome our ſelves thereunto, as to others, which wee borrowed from the ſame language.</p>
            <p>Now whether that word expreſſeth in Ours a certain Air of the great World, and a colour and tincture of the Court, which not only marks words and opinions, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the tone of the voice, and the motion of the body. Or whether it ſignifie a leſſe perceptible motion which is known but by chance, which hath nothing but is noble &amp; high, and nothing which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſtudied or learnt; which is felt, and is not ſeen, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97432:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a ſecret Genius, which we loſe in ſeeking it. Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a farther ſtretched ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, it means the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Converſation, and the gift to pleaſe in good company: Or reſtraining of it, it be taken for an addreſſe to touch the Spirit with I know not what kind of prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet whoſe pungency is pleaſing to who receives it, becauſe it tickles, and hurts not, becauſe it leaves a wound without grief, and awakens only that part which malice offends. To conclude, <hi>Madam,</hi> according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good Judge in ſuch caſes, It was a knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people were ignorant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97432:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of, and from whom the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> only learnt the true and lawful uſe. Being ſo fit for them, and ſo incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their neareſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that thoſe even of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>; could not acquire it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome failings, nor ſo nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counterfeit it, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance ſhould not mark the diverſity.</p>
            <p>It was then according to this accompt, a domeſtick plant which could grow up but on the ſhore of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> or on the Mount <hi>Palatin,</hi> or at the foot of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> or near the Camp of <hi>Mars,</hi> and near ſome other quarter of that Capitall City of the world.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97432:41"/>
and the Sun of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould have ſo much force and ſo much vertue? Did they ſo ſenſibly agitate on the ſpirits of men? Were they ſo abſolutely neceſſary to make them good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? I fear not of my ſelf to ſay it, not to wrong the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the reſt of the civilized Provinces. But to ſpeak in general, its certain, <hi>Madam,</hi> that the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> had great advantages in the world, owed much to their Mothers, and to their Breeding, and knew many things which no body taught them: there is no doubt but in their moſt familiar entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome graces were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, ſome ornaments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>Theſe ſentiments which parted from the heart, were hidden in great Aſſemblies,

and were diſcovered but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two or three friends, and as many faithful dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, and with whom hee communicated this ſecret fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. And if ſome of them have ſaid that they reign'd all the time they Oration'd, ſo ſoveraign was the power they exerciſed over mens mindes; we may ſpeak even of thoſe which in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation reſtored the liberty which they had taken away in their Orations, That they ſet at large and at eaſe the minds of thoſe they oppreſt and tormented; and that they drew them from that admiration which had agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with violence, to make them ſenſible of a

I have ſeen a great Prince in the low countries, who in that envied the fortune of their free men, and of thoſe inferior friends, and of the meaner ſort, which they had brought out of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, to chooſe them their confidents; and in effect, it was a wonderful content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be a witneſs of their interiour lives, and to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate to the more particular houres of their leiſure.

and Voluptuouſneſſe, and held the Government of States un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the employment of the Wiſe, Becauſe Wiſe men ought not to diſturb themſelvs for fools, for ungrateful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for men. <hi>Fabritius</hi> had the patience to hear the vanity of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> although hee approved them not: Yet with a diſdainful ſmile which hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt to him who brought them forth.

            </p>
            <p>Do you not beleive, <hi>Madam,</hi> that <hi>Cyneas</hi> was ſurpriſed with ſo unexpected an anſwer, and ſo far from the admiration hee looked for from ſo unlettered a Man, whom he thought he had raviſhed with his Eloquence.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97432:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That little ſaying at one blow overthrew the opinions of that great man of <hi>Athens,</hi> and the Eloquence of that brave Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And a regular refutation of <hi>Epicurian</hi> Philoſophy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by a Stoick prepared for the buſineſſe, would not have had the force which this exclamation of one line had, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> rendred <hi>Epicurus</hi> ridiculous, which confounded <hi>Cyneas,</hi> and aſtoniſhed <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi>

            <p>Yet <hi>Fabritius, Madam,</hi> did uſe to aſtoniſh <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> with his anſwers; hee uſually laughed at the Propoſitions which the King ſeriouſly made; And when he once offered him the firſt place next to him in his Kingdome, ſuppoſing that hee would not diſpute ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous

            <p>Theſe, <hi>Madam,</hi> are the firſt eſſays of Politeneſſe, and as it were the deſigne of Urbanity in a Republick of Braſſe and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron amongſt ſimple and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Citizens; but ſimple and innocent in ſuch a way, that we cannot ſay their ſimplicity was ſmooth, &amp; their innocency ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: The Conſuls and the Dictators laughed after this manner.

            <p>Theſe Copies are more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and clearer perhaps then their firſt Originals were; and if they have not the advantage of a lively voice and preſence, which perſwades the ſenſes, and gives a luſtre to vile things; they have that of attention, and of a ſecond view, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> poliſheth the rude, and unmixeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,

            <p>Had it pleaſed the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, the firſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> would yet be one of thoſe Authors whom I alledged upon this ſubject: He with care had gathered what had been ſaid, and what was every day moſt remarkably ſaid. <hi>Tyron</hi> alſo made a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of all the good Sayings of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and an ancient <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian</hi> ſpeaketh of two Books of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> the title of which was the Conceits <hi>Facetiae.</hi> But particularly, <hi>Madam,</hi> the Court of the ſecond <hi>Caeſar,</hi> of which was ſpoken in the beginning of this Diſcourſe. That gallant and witty Court which mocked the conceits of <hi>Plautus,</hi> and the raillery of Antiquity, would
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97432:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
furniſh me wherewith to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you whole days, with a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which belonged unto them in property, and which from thence had received its laſt form: For wee muſt confeſſe with the leave of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that the age of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> judged very ſubtilly of things, perfectly purified by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, gave lights to the Mind which it had not before. It was the golden Age of Arts and Diſcipline, and generally of all fair Literature. All was poliſht and refined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his reign; All were know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ingenious in that Court from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> even to his Grooms.</p>
            <p>Its written, that fire and lightning came from his eyes; whereto I would add, <hi>Madam,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:97432:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they alſo iſſued out of his mouth, but more quick and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering then thoſe, which dazled the Courtiers of thoſe times, which obliged the one of them to complain, that it was not poſſible to look him in the face: He compoſed verſes and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt them; and ſuppreſſing them, he gave out a word of the ill work he had made, which was worth as much as the beſt work which could bee made. He in four words anſwered the long Oration of the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors; but thoſe four words deſerved another Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on longer then the former to commend them.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Commentaries of his life, there was a long time in the world a volume of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97432:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Letters; and you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>Madam,</hi> they were not alwayes concerning State-Affaires nor all addreſt to the Senate or to the Legions; ſome were of raillery, ſome of confidence to his friends; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of love, and of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of his Miſtreſſes, and of the ſame ſtyle with thoſe which his Unckle writ to Queen <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> on tablets of <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Saphirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am coming, <hi>Madam,</hi> to aſtoniſh you. Do you believe, that at this day there is any where any fragments to bee found of thoſe Letters written to <hi>Cleopatra?</hi> And that love, and the love letters of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſurviv'd her hatred, and her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Cato's. This rarity hath
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97432:59"/>
been preſerved in an old Greek Manuſcript, which happily came to my hands, whence I have taken what I have already told you of <hi>Fabritius,</hi> of <hi>Cato,</hi> and of <hi>Caſsius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of this Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript is not unknown, is not the Son of Earth, hee hath a name, and a Countrey, and bears the marks of his Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: He lived under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Antonines</hi>; he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have the ſame deſign with the <hi>Sophiſt Aelian</hi>: But his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing is more at large, and his work may be called a mixture of common with rare things.</p>
            <p>Yet truly, <hi>Madam,</hi> I cannot ſpeak ſo affirmatively of the truth of theſe letters, but that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97432:59"/>
you ſtill have leave to ſuſpend your judgement. I dare not aſſure you, that they were found in <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Cabinet, when the Inventory of her goods was made by order of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Beſides, the <hi>Sophiſt</hi> are men, whom I truſt but in ſome ſort: The Roman Poet teacheth us to feare the <hi>Greeks,</hi> even when they preſent us; and the Cardinal Hiſtorian of the Church made uſe of his advice on the ſubject of the donation of <hi>Rome,</hi> made to Pope <hi>Silve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> by the Emperor <hi>Conſtantin.</hi> Since then the Largeſſes which come from <hi>Greece</hi> ought to be ſuſpected by us, and that in that Countrey there is a number of good willing people which are at leiſure: Since the <hi>Sophiſts</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:97432:60"/>
ſerved as Secretaries to <hi>Fala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and other Princes; I know not how many ages after their deaths, they may have rendred the ſame ſervice to <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon this occaſion: But before wee determine thereupon, it will not be amiſſe to conſult the infallible. * * * *</p>
            <p>Their anſwers which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were rendred at <hi>Delphos,</hi> were not more certain then his. All the Impoſtors of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; All the <hi>Sinons,</hi> and all the <hi>Uliſſes</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> are not ſubtill enough to make him take one for another: And hee will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſolve, whether what we preſent him be legitimate or baſe; whether it be gold from the Mine, or gold of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:97432:60"/>However it be, I believe its Antiquity; And had thoſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the <hi>Greek Sophiſt</hi> alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth been counterfeit, it would have according to my opinion awhile after <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the time of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> We will in another obſerv them with what remains concerning that age; Unleſſe you, <hi>Madam,</hi> eſteem it as already done, and the Age alſo; and affording me the favour of a ſecond Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, you would ſpare the pains of tiring my ſelfe with diſquieting you.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE laſt time I had the honour to ſee you, the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was the chief ſubject of our Diſcourſe. I brought you to conſider him in the beginning, continuance, and perfection of his glory:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97432:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
You obſerved how at nineteen he vyed, with the age and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of <hi>Cicero</hi>; How in one work he acted three or four dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons; How he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conſcript Fathers, who would have treated him like a young man; that although he had not ſtudied ſo long as they, yet he had learnt more; And how he did with addreſſe imploy their Forces to make his deſignes ſucceed, inſtead that he thought to uſe his own name and credit to eſtabliſh his authority.</p>
            <p>I paſt as lightly as I could that bloudy Act of the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virat, whereof there was no way to clear his reputation; and I wiſhed for his honour, that that part of his Hiſtory were
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97432:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blotted out of the memory of things; I ſtaid at the frequent broils, the plaiſtered reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the laſt rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> and accompanied him even to <hi>Rome,</hi> and even to the day of his triumph, after the fatal voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Egypt.</hi> It was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out informing you by the way, that the dexterity of his Minde was always mixt with the good fortune of his arms: And that having overthrown in the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippick</hi> plains the two dear ſons of the Republick, he thought he had done nothing, could he not free himſelf from the two co-heirs he had in the ſucceſſion of his Unckles power, that he might ſecure what he had done.</p>
            <p>The Conduct of that work
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97432:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was admirable, he went beyond his Unckle, and placed himſelf in a better ſeat. The oppoſing vertue was unhappy; Force was found impotent: Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made him a paſſage to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive thither. And then, <hi>Madam,</hi> the Romans began to know the deſign of Providence, and the mortall diſeaſe of the old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. At laſt they loved to have rather an aſſured Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and a peaceable ſervitude, then changes every day, and a perpetual fright of Civil War. Reſt, which they did believe to bee an eſſential good, was to them in lieu of liberty, which ſeemed now no more then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the fancy. Every man was pleaſed to be quiet after ſuch troubleſome affairs, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97432:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſweetneſſe of quietneſſe did ſo agreeably ſlide into their Mindes, that they even wiſhed not for their firſt condition, when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> with aſſurance would have reſtored it; they were ſo weary of Leagues and Parties, that they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for a Benefactor, who would take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trouble of governing themſelvs; &amp; bleſt his Uſurpation, who delivered them from their ill Conduct. Since he leads us, ſaid they, let's ſleep in our Veſſel with ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; let's if we will debauch our ſelves; let's laugh at <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and Pirats: Tis impoſſible we ſhould be loſt, <hi>Caeſar</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for our ſafety. Even the grandchildren of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls and Dictators forgot their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97432:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
honour to follow their intereſt, and forſook a ruinous and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary liberty, to yeild to an obedience which was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and full of effective ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. They were the moſt ſubtile &amp; moſt watchful Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and although they bore the names, which had made the Kings of the Earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they cared not to be ſeen in the crowd amongſt thoſe which give good morrows, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king favours at the door of one of their own Citizens. They ſaid their fortune had ſhewed them the example of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the way to the Palace of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> That they went whether the Gods were gone before them; and that if they had changed party, the Deſtin
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97432:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of things, and the <hi>Daemon</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> had done ſo before them; Thus this Soveraign Soul, and of the firſt rank, which had a Navual Empire over all other Mindes, found neither contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction nor reſiſtance: The proudeſt ſubmitted to the yoak, yeilded to the ſuperiority of his ſpirit without difficulty paſt under ſo elevated an height, and ſubmitted humane vertues to ſomewhat of divine, which they acknowledged in the perſon of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> There was no fierce courage, <hi>Madam,</hi> now to be daunted; neither <hi>Cato</hi> nor <hi>Brutus</hi> to reſuſcitate a dead par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Mutiny loſt even its breath and noiſe, envy was changed in to admiration.</p>
            <p>Whence I conclude, if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97432:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
right, That Envy goes not always ſo farre as Vertue. That Opinion is at laſt tired in following its conſtancy, and that there is a degree whereat Deſert having arrived, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of the ill wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the ill will of Men. In purſuit whereof, <hi>Madam,</hi> an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproachable Judge as you may call Monſieur <hi>Chappellain,</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his voice but a little more then ordinary, pronounced this fair Decree in favour of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> and his new Dominion. Who is that preſumptuous man that dares complain, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is above him, that thinks it ſtrange, that the moſt luminous amongſt creatures, is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and that the worthieſt is the greateſt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:97432:65"/>No man did ever appeal from that Decree <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was Crowned by, the ſuffrage of all the company after his life was made after my manner in little. But becauſe <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Maecenas</hi> were forgot in that life, you witneſſed at our iſſuing out of your Cabinet, that you would not be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if I ſhould tell you what I knew of either of them. And that it would be grateful to you if I made you a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Moecenas,</hi> of whom ſo many have unknowingly ſpoken. You ſhall be obeyed after my faſhion, and I wiſh it may be to your content: But as I uſually do, <hi>Madam,</hi> I will give you the things you ask as they fal into my mind, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97432:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather according to the liberty of Diſcourſe, then the courſe of Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> was bold and wiſe in War, infatigable in Military labours, a religious obſerver of Diſcipline, and had all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of a good Captain: But on the other ſide, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe ſweet and ſociable Vertues which are neceſſary for an able Courtier: He did bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtand the Science of the Field, then of the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; Stratagems, then Intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and what was in time of trouble valour in him, became in time of reſt, rudeneſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſame cannot be ſaid of <hi>Moecenas</hi>; He was eſteemed the honeſteſt man of his time, and had nothing in his perſon which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97432:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nature had not found with care, and which Letters and the great World had not poliſhed. Yet <hi>Madam,</hi> you may obſerve, that the tincture which is taken at this great Light, and which gives a colour to natural goods, was taken from him with a reſerve, and advanced not to the painting and diſguiſe of intentions, ſo that it fel from the total alteration of Probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He had the graces of the Court, but not the vices, and his actions were even as direct as his manner of acting was pleaſing.</p>
            <p>Although the Court may debauch Saints, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at firſt infects what it receivs pure, yet it contaminated not <hi>Maecenas.</hi> It made him ſhew,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97432:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that beſides the uſe of preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which the ſtudy of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome furniſheth, there may be diſpoſition inwardly ſo good, that they are ſtronger then all corruptions from without. Twas he that gave the firſt example to the world, that was ever ſeen of an innocent and modeſt proſpering.</p>
            <p>Hee preſerved in the Court the Maxims he brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in a place where all is falſe and masked, hee would appear what he was.</p>
            <p>But he had no need take care, <hi>Madam,</hi> to counterfeit the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and the Generous: Hee could not but have been much troubled to have hindred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from being ſo: For which hee needed neither labour nor
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97432:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fighting; Giving but way to the courſe of his own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he never fell but on good, and on vertue. And ſo his good actions flowing from the ſpring and not being drawne by ſtrength of arms, as thoſe of ſome <hi>Hero</hi>'s of this age, the eaſineſſe and liberty of them was no leſſe eſteemed then the Splendor and Magnificence: Twas ſaid of him that he was the honour of his Age, and of the Roman Empire; That he was the general Good of the World; That the Sun would ſooner ceaſe to ſhine, and the Rivers to run, then <hi>Maecenas</hi> to do good. A brave man of his time cries out in a Poem which hee addreſt to him, Tis too much given, <hi>Moecenas,</hi> I am but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97432:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
too rich; And indeed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion onely of thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his benefits, could make ſtop of his liberality. If his friends would have believed him, he would have left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nothing. Neither durſt a man praiſe at his houſe either a picture ſent for a rarity from <hi>Greece,</hi> or a ſtatue of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Braſſe, or a ſervice of Chryſtal Glaſſe, leſt he preſently ſhould diſpoil his Palace of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious moveables, and force him that praiſed them to accept of them.</p>
            <p>Exceſſe and Vanity might imitate <hi>Moecenas:</hi> But natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goodneſſe onely could reach his height. But we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>Madam,</hi> that this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of ſpirit was not ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97432:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and unaccompanied; All the Vertues marched in its Train; 'Twas a ſtrong and couragious Goodneſſe, an able and an intelligent Goodneſſe; and out of the ſame fountain whence particulars drew favors and courteſies, the publick was furniſhed with councels and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. How great a Doctor he was in the Science of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; The fate of Affairs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deceived him; He never was a falſe Politician, neither did he wander to appear a good ſpeaker in the vaſt ſpaces of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſimilies. Hee always went right out to truth, and ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaw the ſequel of things in their firſt diſpoſition, That the moſt irregular ſucceſſes did hardly bely the conjectures hee made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:97432:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>Is it not true that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror would have done wrong to ſo excellent a perſon, had he not honor'd him with his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and had hee not given him a ſhare in the government of the world? Being as he was a juſt eſteemer of men, and knowing the value of every thing, he could not legitimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make twelve to be worth no more then two. That a many eminent qualities ſhould not be of more uſe then a mean ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. That the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in reaſon ſhould not have the firſt place in Affairs. In a word <hi>Madam, Auguſtus</hi> tould not but that <hi>Moecenas</hi> muſt have been Favorite to <hi>Auguſtus</hi>; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was to give long and opinionated battels againſt the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97432:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſtraints of ſo modern a ſpirit to make him accept what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and that he was much troubled to overcome him. Yet was he worthy of the Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of the greateſt Prince in the world, that in this occaſion he would not ſuffer himſelf to be overcome, and not give way. That his acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be inferiour to the modeſty of one of his friends.</p>
            <p>Hee did then much good to this friend, but it was as you have already ſeen, to diſtribute it and divide it every way. To inlighten and rejoyce all the earth with the light of his rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. With this wealth <hi>Moecenas</hi> bought for <hi>Auguſtus</hi> all hearts &amp; all tongues, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rendred them of ſo much the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97432:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
better, more noble, and of the more durable ſpecies: So that conſidering ſo new a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, he who gave was leſſe liberal then he was a good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and who received from him was rather his Factor then his Favorite. But, <hi>Madam,</hi> what I am going to tell you, deſerves to be well obſerved: He was ever of the Religion, To receiv nothing which might not juſtly be given, he would have nothing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> might be reproach'd him, not onely from the publick complaint of his renown, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the ſecret ſight of an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed particular. Thoſe who ſince had the ſame favour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other Reigns, uſed it not ſo. Their morrals were larger and more indulgent to their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97432:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They had none of thoſe delicacies of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>When they died not ſoon enough of a natural death, they had recourſe to accuſations to advance the term of the account they made: They cauſed Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents to be condemned to make their Charges vacant, and in the ſight of afflicted Orphans, they bore the marks of their Fathers fortune which were not yet dry of his bloud. <hi>Moecenas</hi> his proceedings were far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from theſe; he would have believed himſelf ſullied with the confiſcated goods of one proſcribed, and as you may gheſſe, How many places and houſes hath he refuſed, becauſe hee would not touch Funeral ſpoils, nor take away the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97432:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of unhappy men.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay more, and his ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples went farther; he hath often ſent back the preſents and gratifications of the Provinces, which he had eaſed, fearing leſt the lighteſt ſign of their grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and that a Noſegay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſuch an encounter, made not the leaſt reſentation of intereſt appear in his advice. He oftner ſet aſide the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which was not diſhoneſt to embrace, what was honeſt barren and unfruitful; He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a ſimple ſatisfaction of Minde to thoſe things which the world eſteems ſolid and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential.</p>
            <p>I believe, <hi>Madam,</hi> that ſo diſcreet and limited a greatneſs raiſed no jealouſies in his Prince.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97432:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
There was no Treaſon to bee feared from ſo ſuperſtitious an integrity. How ſhould he bee a penſioner to <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> had he not accepted all kind of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his favours? And how ſhould he deſire new things to meliorat his condition, ſince he contented himſelf with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle part of thoſe advantages, which the preſent offered. O rare example for happy Men! Such a man is not to be found. How ſtrong and ſolid a piece he was in the foundation of a growing principality. Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it ſelf might have been juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the innocency of this Miniſter, as it might have been upheld by the reſt of his more lively and more ardent vertues.</p>
            <p>Yet would I not deny, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97432:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that his delicate complexion ſometimes rendred him leſſe fit for the labours of his body, and for the toils of war, and was the cauſe that ordinarily his Minde could onely work. But, <hi>Madam,</hi> without being preſt he did not forbear to do much, and to render as uſeful ſervices to the State, as his Colleague, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were not followed with ſo much noiſe and pomp. The Solitude he built himſelfe in Town, and the ſhadowes of his Gardens, hid the half of his vertue. His employments were covered with an outward appearance of lazineſſe. And perhaps <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who appeared was praiſed for the conduct of <hi>Moecenas,</hi> whileſt he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:97432:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Emperour had more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for this; but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the battels gotten in <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> he eſteemed the other more. The one he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved loved him more, and the other had obliged more. All theſe deliberated of general Affairs: But ſometimes he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted only <hi>Moecenas</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the life and fortune of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa.</hi> Witneſſe <hi>Madam,</hi> that little word, upon which one of <hi>Machiavels</hi> Diſciples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a great Diſcourſe. You muſt either put him to death, or make him your ſonne in Law. That is to ſay, you muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe him, or quite gain him. You muſt ſecure your ſelf of a greatneſſe which is ſuſpected to you either by taking him out of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97432:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the world, or planting him in your Houſe.</p>
            <p>You may thereby obſerve that <hi>Moecenas</hi> regarded onely his Maſter: I ſpeak like a French man, and thought onely of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his Authority. <hi>Agrippa</hi> had a taſte of the loſt liberty, and turned his head about from time to time towards the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Republick This never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed counſels but ſuch as were purely honeſt; but his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion wherein concerned the good of the State, would add profit to honeſty. The firſt had the command of Armies, and fought the Enemies of the Empire. The ſecond exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his power even over the Emperours Minde, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appeaſed the motions which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97432:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
roſe up againſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Which he did <hi>Madam,</hi> with ſo much liberty, that the Prince being once on the ſeat of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, where ſome criminal proceſſe was deba<gap reason="illegible: overwritten" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed, and where he began to be carried away with the deceits and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of the accuſers. <hi>Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas</hi> thereupon arriving, and being unable to divide the croud, which hindred his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to him, he handed a Note to him, wherein were theſe words: <hi>Hangman,</hi> wilt thou not come away from them? <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in ſtead of taking offence at the boldneſſe of the word, and of ſo pricking a familiarity, took his friends zeal kindly: And at the ſame time broke up the Aſſembly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97432:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and deſcended from his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, whom perhaps he had not innocently gotten down, had he ſtaid longer.</p>
            <p>He often received ſuch like proofs of his fidelity. Twas <hi>Maecenas</hi> who tempered the heat of his paſſions, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſharpneſſe of his ſpirit; who healed the wounds when he could not prevent the blows; who conſolated him, when he was not in a condition to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtus</hi> very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the deſert and value of this Friendſhip. He perceived well that his perſon being nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to him then his fortune, ſuch like ſervices were to be valued in his Minde, more then the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Towns, and gaining
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97432:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Battels. He witneſſed him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo al the acknowledgments you can imagine from a juſt Prince, and who knew how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh inclination from duty, and thoſe who loved <hi>Caeſar,</hi> onely from thoſe who mixt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſions therewith. Even after his death, he continued to acknowledge it to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; and whenſoever any domeſtick affliction befel him, or ſome outward diſpleaſure, ſighing hee would ſay, This would not have befaln me had <hi>Moecenas</hi> been living. Hee thought himſelf unhappy in poſſeſſing the Empire of the world, ſince he had loſt his <hi>Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee had indeed a great deal of reaſon to regret a perſon ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97432:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good and intelligent, who could neither deceive nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; who could do ill nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of weakneſſe, nor out of deſigne. He had great cauſe to weep the loſſe of a friend, who was both ſo neceſſary and ſo pleaſing. A friend at all houres, and at all times, in whom he found all he ſought, which was his Table and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place Book, the Witneſſe and the Repoſitory of his thoughts; the treaſury of his mind, even his ſecond ſoul.</p>
            <p>In effect, <hi>Madam,</hi> (to ſhew you the worth of a faithful friend about a great Prince) how much doe you think hee confirmed, fortified, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the reaſon of <hi>Auguſtus?</hi> How many thrones hath hee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97432:75"/>
drawn out of thoſe buſineſſes he hath had to diſpatch? How many expedients did he propoſe to himſelf to facilitate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes? How many platforms hath he made to raiſe his works? You need not doubt but hee hath often ſpared the pains of his foreſight, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf with the cares and diſquiets of the future, that he might leave him entirely in the action. That the vigour of his ſpirit might not by being divided, bee diminiſhed. That I might with truth at this time ſay, That they divided amongſt themſelves the ſeveral functions of the ſame duty, and that they both lived but one life.</p>
            <p>The faithful <hi>Moecenas</hi> divers times, <hi>Madam,</hi> upheld <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:97432:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when hee was tired with the ſearch of difficult good, and preſented him with the image of a crowned and enjoyed ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to divert his ſight from the ſad object of ſuffering and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring vertue, after a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Conſpiracy, and when hee judged Clemency better then Iuſtice. He fancied glory to him fairer and more attractive, then ſhee was, to provoke him the more to the love thereof, to oblige him to convert wicked perſons to honeſt men. By chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſentences of death into abolitions, to doe ſo that hee preferred the praiſe of goodnes, which laſts as long as the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and races are preſerved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vengeance, which paſſeth as quickly as the ſtroak of a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97432:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hatchet can bee given, and an head cut off.</p>
            <p>And after this you may if you pleaſe believe <hi>Seneca,</hi> who condemns the ſtyle and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of <hi>Moecenas.</hi> Me thinks <hi>Madam,</hi> that to obtain ſuch like graces from a provoked ſoul, a man ſhould not want Eloquence. I ſpeak of that good and wiſe Eloquence, the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Affairs and Action bred in the Sun, and in the light of the great World, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably ſtronger then the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick of the <hi>Sophiſts,</hi> although that can far better hide and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble its ſtrength.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but its abſolutely neceſſary to ſpeak well, for to have to doe with Princes, who commonly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97432:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reliſh reaſon if it be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately prepared. 'Tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that there bee vertue in the remedies they are to uſe, they will have no bitterneſſe in them. 'Tis not ſufficient that the things we preſent them bee good, if they are not as well good in their form, as in their matter.</p>
            <p>But it is not Princes onely who deſire pleaſing words, and who are offended againſt the Reaſon which reproves them. To ſpeak generally, there being nothing ſo free and elevated as the Mind of Man, it will bee treated according to the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of its nature: That is to ſay, with ſweetneſſe, method, and addreſſe. Thereby <hi>Madam,</hi> the will is carried away without
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97432:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much reſiſtance, and from the Will wee come to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which is ſo much an enemy to conſtraint, that to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew it, it eſtrangeth it ſelf from its proper object, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the truth when any one will cauſe another to embrace it by force.</p>
            <p>Its certain that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of an Art ſo neceſſary to Government, was Soveraign in the perſon of <hi>Moecenas.</hi> As hee was moſt clear ſighted in diſcerning of wits, he was full of addreſſe in their conduct; and was no leſſe ſubtile in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, then he had light to diſcover them. With this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious Eloquence which is nothing but the right uſe of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is communicated
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97432:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Men by ſpeech; he gained <hi>Auguſtus</hi> an infinite many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and after he had perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him moderation, hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them obedience.</p>
            <p>All the Conferences which were held in his Palace, were ſacrifices of praiſe and glory for <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> He was there ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red every day in Proſe and in Verſe. They began to reform then the ancient Language of the Republick, and to ſwear by the Genius and good fortune of the Prince. The Temples which at firſt were built for him in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſince in other Povinces of the Roman world, were deſigned in that place. And to take it from its riſe, a man may ſay, <hi>Madam,</hi> that <hi>Maecenas</hi> with his Orators
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97432:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his Poets, was Founder of all thoſe Temples, was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutor of that new Religion which conſecrated a living man.</p>
            <p>Believe me and all Antiquity rather then <hi>Seneca</hi>; That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Favorite left al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways I know not what ſting in the heart, which provoked the courages of the hardeſt to the love of the Prince and Country, to the ſtudy of vertue and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. A man could not get from him without a ſweet eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion able to awaken the deadneſſe of thoſe who were not ſenſible of the felicity of the reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreamt of the beauty of good things. The air of his face, the tone of his voice, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97432:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what the Rhetoricians compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the eloquence of the body, gained the outward ſenſe in an inſtant, and made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſoul by the facility of whoſe guard it was preſently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>He perſwaded even with the negligence of the moſt familiar entertainment. In his free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation when he deveſted the pomp of the Court, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of his Miniſtry, when he forſook what dazled the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſtill had many ornaments left which he could not leave; he had unvoluntary charms about him which hee minded not, which every where accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Theſe charms, <hi>Madam,</hi> particularly inſpired all he ſaid: It ſupplied the default of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97432:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and even when hee did not grant requeſts, he did not forbear to give ſatisfaction: For you know well, that all things are not always poſſible, and that a man muſt ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe. But I beſeech you, what muſt thoſe preſents be which enriched ſo charming a Mouth, ſince the refuſals which iſſued were not diſpleaſing, and that in ſpeaking he ſo much pleaſed that with his words alone hee could have paid his debts.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Nero</hi>'s Tutor will not have the Confident of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> to ſpeak well. He reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his delicacies and affected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, even the ſoftneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches of his ſpeech, and as he ſays, he was the firſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Roman Eloquence. He
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97432:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
broached forth ſayings, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> to him ſeemed lighter then they ought, but which he hath cut from a work whoſe matter and deſign we are ignorant of. And thereupon without telling us whether <hi>Moecenas</hi> ſpoke in cold bloud, or whether he only had a mind to laugh, he declaims againſt the liberty of his ſtyle with all the ſharpneſſe and all the rage of his.</p>
            <p>To tell you the truth <hi>Madam,</hi> I doubt there was ſomewhat of the <hi>Philarchus,</hi> &amp; of ill wil in the proceeding of <hi>Seneca</hi>: If the pieces he makes at, were ſeen whole, we ſhould ſee that hee diſtinguiſheth not the two Characters, and that he takes a ſuit once uſed at a Mask for the Robes of a Senator, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97432:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
every day wears to the councel. Doubtleſſe he ſeems not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand raillery. He certainly is one of thoſe teſty Hypomies, who would have Plays as ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as Affairs, and Comedies as ſad as Funeral Orations. Let's draw him back in all the occaſions of <hi>Moecenas.</hi> His averſion towards him is too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and too diſcovered. And after having ſcratched at his writings, hee falls on his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with ſo much paſſion, that a man may eaſily perceive the ſpirit of his ſect poſſeſt him, and that he had a deſign to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a reformed Stoick in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the honeſteſt Epicuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that ever was.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay, to weaken the teſtimony of <hi>Seneca,</hi> that hee
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97432:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was a Doctor of the Court, who Philoſophis'd in purple, and with eaſe diſcourſed of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And that even perhaps he exclaimed againſt voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he might wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, &amp; no man envy it in him. I onely ſay in juſtification of <hi>Moecenas,</hi> that its impoſſible the Soul ſhould give without enervating it ſelf, and that as there is a compoſed and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly folly, there may be a free and jovial wiſdom.</p>
            <p>I have heard, <hi>Madam,</hi> from our Learned Monſieur***; but he ſaid it far handſomer then I can repeat it, that there is an Art of uſing pleaſure innocently; that this Art was taught by <hi>Ariſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi>; That ſince it was corrupted at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Petronius</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:97432:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and by <hi>Tigillin,</hi> who abuſed it as poiſoners have Phyſick. He added that the practiſe of that Art was not defended by the Laws of your Country. That on the contrary, they had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Magiſtrates expreſly to have a care of the pleaſures of the people. That beſides the Edicts of the Republick, there was under the Emperors ſpoken of a Tribune for pleaſures. And that he had ſeen a Science and a Diſcipline of pleaſure in the formularies of <hi>Caſsiodorus.</hi> He concluded, <hi>Madam,</hi> that it was not juſt to accuſe the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of things for the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of men, and that it is not credible that the goods of this life ſhould have been made only for the wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:97432:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>It is not credible I am of the ſame opinion w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> this rare ſoul, that God ſhould have ſent vertue into the world for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of poor men, and that it is not vertue if it combat not againſt grief, unleſſe it march on thorns, if it lodge not in an Hoſpital, if it even inhabit not ſepulchres. <hi>Moecenas</hi> would expect till he was dead to take poſſeſſion of ſo diſpleaſing a dwelling; and if he were alive, &amp; had changed <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Paris,</hi> I am confident a man ſhould oftner finde him in ſome place which I know, where there is nothing which contents not the eyes and the mind, then in other places which I will not name, where there is nothing oppoſeth them not. What a pleaſure you
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97432:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would take to learn his Hiſtory from himſelf? What a glory would he receive to have ſom of your Audiences? How would your modeſt converſation touch his minde? You could not hide your ſelf, <hi>Madam,</hi> he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that Soveraign Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which you vail with all the reſtraint, &amp; all the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your Sexe. He would admire you in deſpight of you. We would reconcile his enemy with him at the firſt requeſt you ſhould make him, and even without a requeſt, ſo confident am I of the ſweetneſſe and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his manners. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of his minde would not be diſturbed by the fumes and flouriſhes of the violent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts. He would but laugh
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97432:82"/>
at the pettiſhneſſe and paradox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Seneca.</hi> He would tell you onely, <hi>Madam,</hi> that wee muſt ſuffer all from the race of <hi>Zeno,</hi> and the Nation of the Stoicks. That all is permitted to a Philoſopher, who called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> a fool, who its belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved had a better Title then the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to be King of Kings. And what particularly makes for our ſubject, who was ſo much an enemy of life, that hee councelled Men to hang themſelves when they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little diſturbed, or in an ill humour.</p>
