            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Lords and Owners being eſtated and poſſeſſed as aforeſaid, the now pretended Dreyners <hi>(Anno</hi> 1635) by colour of a Contract with certain <note place="margin">The grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Dreyners.</note> Commiſſioners of <hi>Sewers</hi> (themſelves being the chief in Commiſſion) entred into and upon the ſaid Level, and without conſent of the Owners, without Inquiry by Jury, againſt an expreſs Verdict whereby the ſaid Level was found not ſurrounded, and conſequently not at the diſpoſal of the Commiſſioners of <hi>Sewers:</hi> And alſo notwithſtanding the Exceptions, Suits publick and private, Complaints of the Owners and Commoners, endeavoured to poſſeſs themſelves of 14000 Acres thereof, encompaſſed the ſame with Banks and new Dreyns, ſtopt the old ones, whereby at length ſuch inundations fell upon the Neighbouring Towns, they were conſtrained (the Dreyners refuſing to appear and juſtify their proceedings upon Actions of Law brought againſt them, for the preſervation of their Lives and Goods, being authorized in that behalf by Commiſſioners of <hi>Sewers)</hi> to open the old Dreyns, ſince which the ſaid Level hath been and now is peaceably enjoyed by the Lords, Owners and Commoners as the ſame hath been from time, whereof the Memory of man is not to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Theſe Dreyners now deſire to be Eſtated in the aforeſaid 14000 Acres by Act of Parliament, upon pretence of their Improvement and former <note place="margin">The preſent Queſtion.</note> poſſeſſion thereof.</p>
            <p>The Lords Owners and Commoners pray that they may not be ſtript of their Eſtates upon ſuch pretences, the Premiſes are a true ſtate of the Caſe, Title, and Queſtion in difference; and deny divers Pretences and Allegations, in the Propoſals and Narrative of the Dreyners contained to be true; That is to ſay,</p>

                  <item>1. They deny, That the ſaid Dreyners were ever in a juſt, lawful or quiet poſſeſſion of 14000 Acres of the ſaid Level, For<list>
                        <item>The ſaid Poſſeſſion (ſuch as the ſame was) was obtained illegally only by Colour of a Commiſſion of <hi>Sewers,</hi> but without due proceedings thereupon, and not warrantable by Law, Statute or Precedent.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>2. The poſſeſſion was interrupted by Clayms, Entryes, Diſtreſſes, and Actions brought by the Owners and Commoners, as appears by divers Records, and other Teſtimonies.</item>
                  <item>2. They deny that a Contract was made with the Dreyners to give them 24000 Acres by approbation of many thouſand Commoners, For <list>
                        <item>No ſuch thing was ever yet proved, and the enſuing Complaints, Suits, and Actions of the Owners and Commoners evidence the contrary.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>3. They deny that the undertaking to Dreyn the Level was ever performed, For,<list>
                        <item>The Level in general (the 14000 Acres intended for the Dreyners themſelves excepted) was not bettered by the pretended Dreyning, nor the new Dreyns ſo effectual and uſeful as the old Dreyns, which the Dreyns had ſtopped.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>4. They deny that the Dreyners by their dreyning improved the 14000 Acres to a Mark an Acre annual value, For<list>
                        <item>The ſame was of as great yearly value and profit 40 and 50 years before, as we are ready to prove.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>5. They deny that the Title or Contract, under which theſe Dreyners claim, is the ſame with <hi>Lovels Level, Bedford Level,</hi> and other former undertakings, For<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Lovels Dreyning</hi> was by general conſent after the awarding of a Writ of <hi>ad quod damnum.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Bedford Level</hi> was by verdict found to be ſurrounded ground and of no value, <hi>Lyndſey Level</hi> was by verdict found not ſurrounded, and proved  of a good yearly Value.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>Bedford Level</hi> was contracted for with the Owners and Country at <hi>Lynn</hi> 6 <hi>Car. primi,</hi> and after Dreyned; <hi>Lyndſey Level</hi> never contracted for  with the Owners and Country, but reſted from them by Power and Force.</item>
                        <item>The undertaking in <hi>Bedford Level</hi> was begun, and purſued legally, and finiſhed, and continued to the Honour and Profit of the Undertakers and Country.</item>
                        <item>The undertaking in <hi>Lyndſey Level</hi> was moſt illegally begun, violently and injuriouſly purſued, and never finiſhed to this day, proving only vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and miſchievous both to the undertakers and Country.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>6. They deny that the Lords and Owners (who continually offered and ſtill offer to defend their Right by Law) either committed or abetted any  Riot, or the pulling down the Dreyners Houſes or Plantations, but what their oppreſſions conſtrained poor people to do, or may conſtrain them unto in the future, the ſaid Lords and Owners know not: but have heard what ever Riot was, the ſame was occaſioned by one <hi>Hull,</hi> Servant to the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> who is ſuppoſed to be ſtill living to give account thereof, and the ſaid Lords, and Owners, are unjuſtly Scandaled therewith, not being concern'd in Suit or in Law to excuſe or anſwer it.</item>
                  <item>7. They ſay the queſtion is miſ-ſtated to be now between the Riotters and Dreyners, but between the Dreyners and Owners, which ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to improve theſe Lands.</item>

               <p>The Dreyners Propoſals, which are but three in number, are conceived by the ſaid Lords and Owners unjuſt and unreaſonable, being as followeth:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Propoſal.</hi> That the Dreyners ſhould have 14000 Acres of the Level, with help to repair the Works by them erected.<list>
                        <item>1. <hi> Anſwer</hi>Theſe Owners conceive it unjuſt and unreaſonable that 14000 Acres of Land ſhould be demanded from the Owners thereof without Right and without Price for the ſame, and without Crime or pretence other than the ſcandal of a Riot.</item>
                        <item>2. The Lords and Owners conceive it moſt unjuſt and unreaſonable, the Dreyners ſhould both divide and chuſe not only ſo much in quantity but  the beſt Land in quality, their 14000 Acres being the heart and middle of the Level, ſecured by Banks and Dreyns from the Upland-waters, unto which the reſt is left liable.</item>
                        <item>3. They are ready to prove that 14000 Acres are more by ſome Thouſands of Acres than the pretended Dreyners can claim by their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended  contract made by and with themſelves.</item>
                        <item>4. The Lords and Owners conceive it moſt unjuſt and unreaſonable that they ſhould be required to contribute to the repairs of thoſe Works, by  which themſelves and the Country ſuſtained ſuch miſchief, and which were erected without leave to excuſe them, or Law to juſtifie them: And they conceive this Propoſal deſigned purpoſely to prevent the demand of Satisfaction for the aforeſaid injuries ſuſtained by the Country.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Propoſal.</hi> That the Dreyners when eſtated by Act of Parliament in 14000 Acres will be contented to Sell them to the Country for their Money disburſed  with Intereſt.<list>

If this offer ſhould Intitle the pretended Dreyners to this Level, they may in like manner Intitle themſelves to all the Common and Waſt-ground in <hi>England;</hi> not that they mean or can improve the Nature of the Soyl by Dreyning, but by altering the manner of Enjoyment from Common to Incloſure, when they have the whole to themſelves, the Commoners excluded: by which means, if the ſame were lawful for the Owners to do (as the ſame is not) but expreſly againſt the Letter of divers Statutes, they could themſelves treble every mans Profit.</item>
                        <item>2. Commons are not to be valued according to the ſingle profit made thereof, but as they Benefit and Maintain arable Land to which they belong, and which cannot conſiſt without them: therefore,</item>
