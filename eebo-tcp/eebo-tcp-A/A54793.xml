            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Nay, <hi>how me no hows,</hi> for 'tis very true.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>Not so hasty — For will you prefer a Brace of Quacks to a whole Colledge of able Physitians?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I prefer no Quacks.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, you do—For the <hi>Observator</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> are a couple of meer pretending <hi>Quacks</hi>; they find the Nation labours under a <hi>Scorbutick</hi> distemper, and they come with their <hi>French</hi> Congies, and cry, <hi>Me cure de State. Me cure de State,</hi> when they know no more of State-Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, unless it be to <hi>Draw</hi> a <hi>Blister,</hi> than <hi>Horse-Leeches.</hi>

               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>This 'tis, not to consider: for in so saying, you dishonour the whole Society of the <hi>Crape-Gown</hi> Order of D. D's, and B. D's. and the more inferior sort of Rectors and Vicars, who have now undertaken to be the State Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians themselves. And do you think that the Applications of <hi>Bow Church</hi> Sermons, <hi>Guild-hall</hi> Sermons, Assize Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Anniversary Sermons are not much more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for the present distempers of the State, than the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbucum</hi> and <hi>Cantharides</hi> of the <hi>Observator</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus</hi>?</p>

               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>Both Applications may be good in their kinds.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Sir, but the <hi>Levites</hi> pretend their Licences from Heaven, which th'other can never lay claim to: So that the other are meer Intruders; and whether the <hi>Levites</hi> do not practice beyond their Skill and Commission is much to be question'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>The Scripture commands obedience and submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Government; they are commanded to Preach the Scripture, therefore they are commanded to Preach Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Government.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>That is to say, in Civil affairs, they are to Preach General Obedience to the Laws and the Government; but thence it does not follow they are to be Judges of the breaches of that Obedience: For were it otherwise, they were to take their Texts out of <hi>Polton,</hi> and not out of the <hi>Bible.</hi> For example, were the difference between the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Magistrate, whither the Statute of <hi>Jeofails,</hi> or the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act were to be Repeal'd; what have they to do with that? No more than the <hi>Pinner</hi> of <hi>Wakefield.</hi> Would it not be fine sport, to hear the Pulpits ring with the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, or the Statute of <hi>Jeofails?</hi> You are commanded to obey the Statute of <hi>Jeofailes,</hi> you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to obey the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, <hi>Job</hi> 36.21. In like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner, what have they to do with <hi>Associatians</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,</hi> as they are the Disputes of State? For let them talk till their Lungs ake, they can never prove by Scripture, that either political Associations or Addresses are forbidden, in reference to the English Government. But if the Prince shall once declare his particular dislike to such proceedings, then are they to press a general Obedience to his Will and Pleasure, so far as is consentaneous to Divine Writ.</p>

               <p>The very definition of a Christian Loyalty it self: That is to say, That vertuous and inviolable Fidelity which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64372:3"/>
the Subject ows to his Lawful Prince, by vertue of the same Obligations and Ties by which he is bound to God: And this is that true Christian Obedience which every true Minister of the Church ought to inculcate into the hearts of their Hearers by the force of pure Divinity, not Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of State, which are fluctuating and inconstant; in regard that Reason of State, and alteration of Government may alter the case of Obedience upon various occasions; in so much, that in the quick Turns and Revolutions of the latter end of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> some of the greatest promoters and Practisers of Politick Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, were asham'd at last of their frequent compliance, and retir'd out of the way; as you may Read in the History of the Reformation it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>You have given a nice Distinction of Loyalty, pray make it out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>The first is that Christian Obedience which is due to the supreme power by the Law of God, so far as may stand with the Sacred Interest of Salvation. The second is an Obedience upon the moral motives of Human Interest to the Law of Man, which may sometimes impose commands which a sincere and upright Conscience may in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure scruple at, nay positively deny a submission to: as in the case of the Three Children; or by a late fresh example in the case of the late times, when even temporal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was refus'd by all that adheard to the King whom dire necessity did not compel to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>The late Times, what d'ye talk of those Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>However to talk like a Divine, it was a Supreme Power, tho' set over us for our sins and our punishment: And most certain it is, that both we and the <hi>Calvinists</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, That, <hi>Etiam Infideli Magistratui obediendum est,</hi> with safety of Conscience. I only speak this to shew, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64372:4"/>
men are not to urge upon the Conscience so severely, that were so nice of it themselves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but then to the second.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>The second, which is an Obedience to commands enjoined by the Politick Constitution and Frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I think there is no Dissenter in <hi>England,</hi> that would not be accounted a Rebel, but would confirm it to his Prince with his Heart, his Hand and his Purse. And this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call'd Loyalty, <hi>Loyaute, Legalidad,</hi> (all from the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> word <hi>Lex</hi>) which acts according to the Laws of Nature and Policy, as being due first to those Laws, and then to the Minister of those Laws, as the derivation of the Word plainly implies. Which being the chief satisfaction to the Civil Magistrate, it seems hard that Ecclesiastical Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction should make such a heavy clutter for her far less incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable mite of a coercive power. Just as if one and the same man owed the secular claim a Hundred thousand pound, and the Ecclesiastical pretensions Twenty pound; the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Magistrate should be bound to give no Release for the whole Hundred thousand pound, because the same person requested the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to abate Five pound of her Twenty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>Pay 'em! They dare not come nere ye. Up ye get into your Pulpits, as into so many Beacons; where ye raise such a Flame, that they're afraid of the Countries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon 'em. But doubtless had that method been us'd by those who have taken another course, of teaching true Christian obedience, without <hi>reflexions, flames,</hi> and <hi>virulency,</hi> that <hi>Vnion</hi> had been long since accomplish'd, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Interest at present so much laments?</p>

               <p>No? There's one, Mr. <hi>Read</hi> by name, has fairly lead the way. You will not let him read the Liturgy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in a Church, where would you have him read it? upon the top of the Monument? Or what would you have him do with those Souls that have commited themselves to his charge, and are so well satisfi'd of his conduct to Heaven? Will you hear his own words?

And that Communion in such Churches is lawful.</hi> Now why must Grand-Juries, and Petty-Juries be put to the trouble to vex and torment such men as these, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them from their good intentions?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Because of the Law.</p>

               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>As to that Law (for I know you mean the last Law against seditious Meetings.) I have this to say:</p>
               <p>First, I do not find that the makers of that Law do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the least breach of Political Obedience against the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters: only there is a Supposition, that an Insurrection may be hatch'd at such a Meeting: So that as long as there is no such thing done as the Law supposes, where there is no Transgression there can be no Punishment. So then it remains, that this Law was obtain'd by some part of the Clergy for their own advantage, and to render themselves the more formidable to their Dissenting Brethren.</p>
               <p>In the second place, it was never yet known in this World, that ever any Civil Magistrate, or Supreme Power, made a Law, with an intent to punish any good man. This Law against Dissenters punishes many a good man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never intended by the Supreme Power against the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64372:5"/>
Now, that the Dissenters are good men, I prove from <hi>David</hi>'s own description of a good man in <hi>Psalm</hi> 15. where putting the Question to himself, <hi>Vir bonus est Quis?</hi> He answers, first as to the Civil Government, <hi>Qui ambulat integre, exercetque justitiam</hi>; That is, He that behaves himself dutifully and obediently toward the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and justly toward his Neighbour. Now that the Dissenters are, at least outwardly, under the guard of these descriptions of good men, is plain, for that no Informer complains against them for the least breach of Civil Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence either in Word or Deed as to any other Law, but only the single act of Nonconformity to this Statute. So then the Statute not being intended against them, as being good and vertuous men, and conformable to the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they can be guilty of no Nonconformity to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Civil Power: For the Civil Power, by this Act, enjoyns nothing but Peace to be kept; with the breach of which, no Informer as yet hath taxed them.</p>
               <p>That the Dissenters are not guilty of any Nonconformity to this Act, in referrence to the Ecclesiastical Power, I offer thus:</p>
               <p>The Statute enjoyns the <hi>Exercise of Religion, according to the Liturgy of the Church of England,</hi> which contains no more than only <hi>Truth.</hi> If then the Dissenters speak and pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Truth,</hi> they exercise according to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Psalmist</hi> therefore proceeding in the next words, after he has declared who does well in <hi>Civils,</hi> tels us who does well in <hi>Spirituals</hi>; That is to say, <hi>Qui loquitur veritatem ex animo suo,</hi> He that speaks Truth from his heart: But the Dissenters do speak Truth, nay the Truth of Truth, Divine Truth, and therefore exercise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Liturgy, and as such they are good men, and so to be accompted, <hi>in foro Ecclesiastico.</hi> Now then put it thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64372:5"/>Never any Law-givers ever made a Law, with an intent to punish any man that speaks Divine Truth; But this Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Dissenters</hi> punishes many a man that speaks Divine Truth: Therefore never any Law-givers intended this Law against the Dissenters. And the same Argument holds for the Hearers, as well as the Speakers, for that the hearing of Divine Truth is as Lawful as to speak it.</p>
               <p>So then, if the Dissenters, as intended by the Act, were to be punished, they are Transgressors; but the Dissenters not being intended by the Act are no Transgressors: Therefore the Dissenters are not to be punished by the Act. Or thus:</p>
               <p>If the Dissenters, as not intended by the Act, are not to be punished, they are Innocent; but the Dissenters, as not intended by the Act, are not to be punished: Therefore the Dissenters are Innocent.</p>
               <p>The reason why they are not intended by the Act; is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are Loyal to the Civil Government, and Obedient to the Spiritual, for that they Speak and Preach Divine Truth. And then,</p>
               <p>That the Dissenters Preach Divine Truth is easily thus proved; The Church of <hi>England</hi> Teaches Divine Truth, the Dissenters teach the same Doctrine with the Church of <hi>England</hi>: Therefore the Dissenters teach Divine Truth.</p>
               <p>From whence we may inferr, that to persue such Vast Numbers of People under the Notion of Dissenters with the Lash of a Law, that assignes no breach of publick disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Publick disturbance, no detriment to the Publick Revenue, or forbidden Acts of private injury, but only the supposition of an Offence deduced and inferred from the bare separate Excercise of Divine Worship, seems an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity too much simpathizing with uncharitable, worldly Interrest, that misses more the separated Purse than the sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Person. The moderate Party themselves confess, that as to those who <hi>purely and out of Conscience refuse to conform, their Circumstances are hard.</hi> And it is as hard, that of all

               <p>Well, but where are these Presbyterian Plotters? You see the Popish-Plotters have been visible enough, at the <hi>Old Bayly, Westminster-hall, Tower hill</hi> and the <hi>Gallows</hi>; where be these Presbyterian-Plotters? Do they walk in the Clouds? or have they got every one a Gyges's Ring in their Pockets? Has your <hi>Observator</hi> been all this while observing, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved none of 'em yet? Whoever they be, let 'em be brought to the Stake, and let the <hi>Observator</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> have the pleasure of Roasting 'em to death, the next burning of the Pope, for the reward of their great pains. However, I will not undertake to justifie every individual <hi>Dissenter</hi>; there may be Turbulent, Factious and Ambitious persons of all Professions, and under all Masks of Religion. Nevertheless, I hope you would think it a great peice of Imprudence, for a man to throw away a whole Quarter of Wheat, for the mixture of a Peck of Tares. If your <hi>Observator</hi> and your

               <p>Why you shall come into a Meeting-House, and while the Minister is in his Pulpit, there you shall see a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of People, Young and Old, Rich and Poor, sitting upon their Bums, their Hats pull'd over their Eyebrows, with their Pens, and their Books, and their Blotting-Papers, all so busily employed, as if they were so many men Copying of News-Letters, and this in such a strange Ethiopic Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that no-body can tell what they Write: They may be setting down their last Weeks Gains and Expences for ought I know. Nay, I saw one so wedded to his Hat, that after the Minister was in his last Prayer, he would not stir it from his Head, till he had concluded what he had to Write, wiped his Pen, screw'd his Inkhorn, fix'd his Blotting-Paper, clasp'd his Book, and put it in his Pocket: and by that time the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had almost done.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>All this while, this is no disobedience to the Law. However, I wish there were no greater obstacle of Protestant Unity than this, since it would discover a very extravagant obstinacy indeed, if the promise and performance of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of such an inconsiderable scandal as this should be refus'd. For indeed, Friend <hi>Priestlove,</hi> I must here close with you, that it seems to me a very indecent thing for the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of so Almighty a Prince, as the King of Heaven, to be uncover'd, and that the Hearers should receive the glad tidings of Salvation in so unthankful a Posture. I speak not this so much out of respect or veneration to the Walls, or the Pillars, or the place it self, but to the Message deliver'd, the Deliverer, and the Time of Delivery. But now to retaliate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64372:7"/>
your <hi>Indecorum,</hi> I will tell ye of another Indecency, which I take to surpass yours, from which, I can except no Parish-Church within the Lines of Communication; and which I look upon to be the mischeif of Pews, not us'd in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches; and that is the hideous noise and clatter in the time of Divine-Service. For it behoves Mr. <hi>Sexton,</hi> or Mrs. <hi>Sextoness,</hi> to have a vigilant eye that day, knowing that <hi>Christmas</hi> will come: And the greater the reputation of the Minister that Preaches that day, the worse it fares with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Ear and disturb'd Devotion. At one end of the Church come in Two or Three Women, and then perhaps in the midst of the <hi>Absolution, slap—slap—slap</hi>; by and by come in Three or four men together, and then 'tis, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven, slap—slap—slap</hi>; and if the Lock be a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, then three or four <hi>slaps</hi> more into the bargain. By and by comes a whole shole of Slugabeds, and then 'tis, <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech ye to hear us good Lord; slap here, and slap there, slap there, and slap here; slap</hi> a that side, and <hi>slap</hi> a this side; <hi>slap—slap slap.</hi> Anon come in two or three gay Peticoats, then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starts Mrs. <hi>Ginglekey</hi> from her Hassock, opens this Pew, and that Pew, and then 'tis, <hi>Lord encline our hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Slap here, and slap there: And thus there is no end of <hi>Slapping</hi> all the whole Prayer-time; as if the Pew dores had been ordain'd to supply the place of Organ Responsories; a confusion that would not be endur'd at a common Musick-meeting.</p>

               <p>And what then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>Why, the signal being thus given, the Church is streight in an uproar, <hi>Hum, hum, hum; Hum, hum, hum</hi>; in so much that you would even admire the Bells don't ring back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of themselves. To these kind of Sermons, there are wanting only a Prologue and an Epilogue to entitle 'em ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Buskin</hi> or the <hi>Socc,</hi> according to the quality of the Subject.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, I find where you are, you would not have an Eloquent, Orthodox Minister encourag'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, but not like a Player: For by the same rule, you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64372:9"/>
may as well hiss 'em, when they displease, as hum 'em up, when they tickle your ears. And besides, it shews very ill, at the same time, to reproach a <hi>Meeting-house,</hi> and make a <hi>Theater</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>Well—I shall tell the <hi>Observator</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> what you say, they'l give you an answer I'le warrant ye; I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your three Accusations, Pew-clapping, <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins,</hi> and Church-Huzzaing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>Do so, and commend my Service to 'em, and tell 'em, there's no-body ever car'd a straw for 'em yet, that had either Wit or Sence in their Heads.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>But you were talking, I remember, a little while a-go of Size Sermons, Anniversary Sermons: and <hi>Guild-hall</hi> Sermons, What have you to say against them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>I say still, I do not like your State-Sermons; 'tis such a piece of Pageantry as was formerly us'd to Preach up the Titles of Princes: Sometimes the Scripture was for the House of <hi>York,</hi> sometimes for the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi>; 'Tis such a Spiritual <hi>Agency</hi> in Secular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that nothing can be more Jesuitical. You may know what a Clock 'tis, by the Chiming of the Cathedral Pulpit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Sir, upon extraordinary occasions, and in extraordinary places, men come to shew their Parts and their Learning, not their Divinity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>There you say something indeed; For now-a-days, down-right Divinity, is accounted no more than down-right Dunstable: Which you may gather from the usual answers to the common Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions. What is such a one? A good, honest, plain, down-right man. What is such a one? Ay, marry Sir! there's a Quaint man indeed! He's a <hi>yerker</hi> ye saith; He claws of your Fanaticks. Good God! what a strange itch of being accounted a <hi>Quaint Man</hi> has infected our Crape-gown Gentility! And yet there is no understanding man, but will give more attention to one of <hi>Gifford</hi>'s plain Sermons, than to a Hundred Theological Orations, that make the Pulpits roar like so many Matrasses of <hi>Aurum Fulminans,</hi> under the Guard of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Chymist.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <p>What of all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mery.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I say, that <hi>Satyr</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> are ill-match'd; they look like a White and black Horse i'th' same Coach. <hi>Satyr</hi> is one thing, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof</hi> another; the latter for the Pulpit, the former for the Stage. And
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64372:9"/>
therefore the <hi>Booksellers</hi> have a pretty good Prospect of the Business, while they lay out so exactly Play and Sermon, Sermon and Play, that a Man might almost play at <hi>Chess</hi> upon their Stalls; and in the course of the Game, here snap a Rook upon a Play, there a Pawn upon a Sermon. Nay, it is come to that pass too, that Plays and Sermons are both of a known value; Twelve Pence one, Six Pence t' other, come as many as will: Nothing so certain as Plays at Twelve Pence, Sermons at Six Pence a piece, and Long Thread Laces, two a Penny.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priestl.</speaker>
               <p>I see whereabouts you are; You are for a dull, heavy, flat, insipid Sermon, without Salt. <hi>Salt savours all Things, saith</hi> Salomon <hi>the wise</hi>; and if <hi>All Things,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Eene eat your Shoulder of Veal by your self for me, if you will give me neither Butter nor Oranges.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merr.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, it seems, <hi>Rayling</hi> against the <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as you call 'em, is Sawce for a Modern Sermon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priestl.</speaker>
               <p>It both embellishes, and takes to boot. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> are now the onely People, that have Abettors and Upholders; Alas, as for the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Anti-christ,</hi> as ye call him, he (good Man) is in a sinking condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the <hi>King of France</hi> is tearing from his Head the Third Part of his <hi>Triple Crown</hi>; And would it not be an ungentile Act, to trample upon the Unfortunate? But the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> are Rampant, and headstrong: They are for <hi>Petitions</hi> and <hi>Associations</hi>; They are followed by <hi>Throngs,</hi> and <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merr.</speaker>
               <p>That's no fault of theirs; if the People finding their Doctrine to be as good as <hi>Yours,</hi> are more taken with their Plainness, than with your Flashes, your Extasies, and Raptures.</p>

               <p>Very well—I see you do go to Church some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, you repeat so well. What a happy thing 'tis, to hear an A-la-mode Sermon? A Man may bring away the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and chiefest Part of it in a smart Epitome, without the troublesome help of that Mark of the Beast, call'd <hi>Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</hi>—But what sort of things are these <hi>Phanaticks</hi>? are <hi>they</hi> Men or Mice?</p>

               <p>No Sir, neither will I <hi>derogate</hi> from them. She may be a <hi>Lady after Gods own Heart,</hi> for ought I know: But I am sure it was such a <hi>sufficiency,</hi> that neither <hi>David</hi> nor <hi>Solomon</hi> with all their <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> could ever boast of. And therefore it argues a high piece of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophantism,</hi> to attribute those praises and <hi>sufficiencies</hi> to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Frailty,</hi> which are meerly <hi>supernatural</hi>; and for which

the Person <hi>himself</hi> is forc'd to beg pardon of the Ladys <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty</hi> before he can proclaim 'em. 'Tis palpable he strain'd hard, and that his Brains were upon the <hi>Tenterhooks</hi> for a piece of <hi>purse-opening Sublimity.</hi>

               <p>Nay, he deserv'd it <hi>double</hi> for what he afterwards gives to the <hi>Son. Of whom</hi> (says he) <hi>I think, I may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Complement, say, That he seems to be so made by Nature, as if God had on purpose fram'd him, to demonstrate the Beauty and Lovelyness of Virtue, to those of his Quality, in this Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Age.</hi>

               <p>And all this may be <hi>real</hi>—For (he says) he speaks it without a <hi>Complement.</hi>

               <p>Nay, by your leave he does but think so neither. —For my part, I wish the <hi>Dedication</hi> may not have prais'd the young <hi>Gentleman</hi> out of the World—For 'tis the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Observation,</hi> that <hi>Persons of such rare perfections sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom live long</hi>—I remember a <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> that lost a <hi>hopeful Child</hi> once, and the <hi>Nurse</hi> gave that reason for it. But you do not Observe, Sir; Here's a young Gentleman <hi>made by Nature, and Fram'd by God,</hi> and the Master-piece of both it seems. So that if there should be never another such a <hi>Pattern</hi> in all His Majesties Dominions, you must not think it strange.</p>

               <speaker>Merr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes he does; and that most <hi>soaringly</hi> too. <hi>For</hi> (says he, speaking of the aforesaid <hi>Gentleman</hi>) <hi>so naturally is he inclin'd to all good, and averse from any thing that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that one would almost think that he alone was exempted from that General Corruption and Depravity of Nature, which all other men derive from</hi> Adam.</p>

               <p>'Tis no matter for that—'twill do well enough in a <hi>Pulpit</hi>—And besides you'l find most of the <hi>Red Feather</hi> men asleep—Then you may compare a <hi>good Conscience</hi> to

As for Example in the Case of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Swearing,</hi> to talk of the <hi>Pythagoreans, the Grecian Laws, the Ancient Germans, Jupiters Old Priests,</hi> and <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta tou Meizo nos Homnyousi,</hi> to the Judges, they are too well qualified, as to understand much more than their <hi>Teacher</hi>; and for the <hi>Vnder-Sheriff</hi> and his <hi>Talis-men,</hi> as they <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> not what was <hi>said,</hi> so they <hi>regard</hi> it as little.

               <p>These things are to be press'd upon the People in <hi>plain home-spun-Kersey Sermons</hi>; not in <hi>finical Flanders, lac'd Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues to the Judges.</hi> Either they preach to the <hi>People,</hi> or the <hi>Judges.</hi>—But they don't Preach to the <hi>People,</hi> for they can't understand 'em.— Therefore they Preach to the <hi>Judges</hi>; and that's but <hi>Ill Manners.</hi>

                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> You are to terrifie 'em with the <hi>Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; which, to put in <hi>proper Terms,</hi> you may call <hi>The Grand Assize,</hi> where all <hi>Writs of Error shall be rectified.</hi>

               <p>Well, but if they will Preach, I think tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper, that they should use <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Expressions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the <hi>Subject.</hi>

               <p>I must confess, I would not have a man in an <hi>Assize Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tell the <hi>Judges</hi> a Story of the <hi>good Samaritan</hi>?</p>

               <p>In the first place, I would fain know, why <hi>David</hi> should aim at that time, more <hi>particularly</hi> in the 51 <hi>Psalm,</hi> to assert the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>British,</hi> than of the <hi>Spanish Monarchy.</hi> For my part, I am apt to believe he was otherwise <hi>emyloy'd,</hi> then to think of either.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I conceive the Gentleman does not take the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the words <hi>right.</hi> For the words <hi>L'ke L'babka Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tathi</hi>; Against Thee, against <hi>Thee only have I sinned,</hi> were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Question utter'd in reference to the <hi>privacy of the Fact commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> which lay <hi>conceal'd</hi> from all the World but God (<hi>Joab</hi> being then an Accomplice) and <hi>David</hi> having recompenc'd the <hi>Injur'd La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> by Marriage.

And therefore he makes this <hi>Confession</hi>; to what end? not to shew that he was <hi>unaccountable to none but God,</hi> but to justify the <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in what punishment he should inflict upon him; as the last words of the Text demonstratively imply; <hi>L'magnan tit sd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Why, Sir, I find the Author of the <hi>Present Miseries of Sin,</hi> telling my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> the dreadful Example of <hi>Sylla, who in a violent Fit of Rage,</hi> vomited up his Soul,<note rend="inter">pag. 13.</note>

               <p>That's true indeed;—and I would have allow'd it at <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>School.</hi>

               <p>In the next place, he tells ye of <hi>Alexander the Great</hi>'s killing of <hi>Clitus.</hi> And for this he cites <hi>Oliverius</hi>'s Notes upon <hi>Valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>; whereas he might have quoted <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Arrianus</hi> for the same thing; and that had been done like a <hi>Schollar.</hi>

               <p>Dear Mr. <hi>Priest-love,</hi> I bear no Malice to <hi>Valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> in the least: Only I say, 'Tis somewhat <hi>pedantick,</hi> to quote an <hi>Index,</hi> when a Man may cite the <hi>Book it self.</hi> But I more wonder, that a <hi>Doctor</hi> should cite <hi>Cicero,</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Why should you be <hi>angry</hi> at this?</p>

               <speaker>Merr.</speaker>
               <p>You mistake, Sir; I am so far from being angry, that since <hi>Quotation</hi> and <hi>Margent-filling</hi> are only Acts of <hi>Vain-glory</hi> and <hi>Ostentation,</hi> I would not have Gentlemen unwarily lose their <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause</hi> by ill <hi>Management.</hi>—I promise ye, I expect that some of 'em should <hi>Thank</hi> me for this <hi>good Advice.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest-l.</speaker>
               <p>Ha' ye done now?—</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Yes, Sir.—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest-l.</speaker>
               <p>Why now then let me ask thee, What is the <hi>Meaning</hi> of all this <hi>Clutter</hi> and <hi>Hurly-burly?</hi> Certainly, it must be the <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> that make it.—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merr.</speaker>
               <p>Faith, Sir, I can give no Account of it; but I find the <hi>Church of England-men</hi> are very <hi>Angry.</hi>—You cannot come to <hi>hear</hi> or <hi>read</hi> a Sermon made upon any <hi>publick Occasion,</hi> but let the <hi>Text</hi> be what it will, half the <hi>Sermon</hi> is <hi>Matter of State.</hi>— One cries out against the <hi>Popish Protestants</hi>;<note rend="inter">Bow-Church. Bath-Church.</note> another cries, <hi>Pope Populus in Parliament</hi>; another, no less than a <hi>Parson-Justice,</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">Thetford-Sizes.</note> lifts up the Weavers-Beam of his Indignation, and lays upon the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the <hi>whole Nation,</hi> as if he had engaged all his <hi>Divinity</hi> for the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the <hi>Mortal Stroke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Weight</hi> of his <hi>Text</hi> was <hi>Two Hundred Shekels of Silver—By me Kings reign.</hi>—</p>
               <p>The <hi>Weight</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> a <hi>Hundred and Fifty:</hi>—That <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> is <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>—</p>
               <p>The <hi>Weight</hi> of the rest, you may guess by what follows:—They that <hi>Reign,</hi> ought to be <hi>Kings</hi>; not <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> not <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>; not <hi>Parliaments,</hi> (especially <hi>Parliaments,</hi> that by <hi>bare Votes</hi> would <hi>abrogate Laws</hi>) not <hi>Parliaments,</hi> that by <hi>Arbitrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings</hi> would infringe the <hi>Liberty of the Subject</hi>; not <hi>Parliaments,</hi> that would <hi>Exclude the Right Heir</hi> from the <hi>Crown</hi>; not <hi>Parliaments,</hi> that are <hi>Guilty of High Treason.</hi>—Was it not well now the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was not at <hi>Thetford?</hi> Else, for ought I know, they might have been Committed.—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest-l.</speaker>
               <p>I confess, <hi>Zeal</hi> may sometimes a little exceed.—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they are <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Rational Men</hi>; and sure they would not do this, but that they have some <hi>Reason</hi> for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merr.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly, Sir, I believe some think it <hi>pleases,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do it in <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>preferment.</hi> Others, out of an <hi>over-wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pride,</hi> and <hi>conceit</hi> of <hi>Themselves,</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of their <hi>Brethren.</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64372:20"/>
And then, i' the next place, there is such a <hi>Numerous Fry,</hi> that <hi>Hunger and Thirst after Maintenance,</hi> and so <hi>few Bones</hi> i' the Nation, that they <hi>snarte</hi> at all, who pretend to share with 'em.</p>
               <p>If you will hear their own Acknowledgment, the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Properties of Heavenly Wisdom,</hi> confesses, that the <hi>Quarrels are sleeveless, de Lana Caprina,</hi> as he calls it,<note rend="inter">pag. 28.</note> about <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, Gestures, Days, and other Ceremonials.</hi>

               <p>Why then, one would think, such <hi>Differences</hi> as these, might easily be laid asleep, by a <hi>Charitable Condescension</hi> on both Sides.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merr.</speaker>
               <p>Ay—but then again, says the same Author, the <hi>Confused Noise</hi> of <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con, Ob</hi> and <hi>Sol,</hi> I may add <hi>Whigg</hi> and <hi>Tory, drowns the Voice behind us,</hi> which tells us, <hi>This is the Right Way, walk in it.</hi> We find also, that some Men are <hi>obstinately attack'd</hi> to their <hi>own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>; and these are a sort of People, who believe that <hi>mutual Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are only owing to those of their <hi>own Sect.</hi>

               <p>That's contrary, I am sure, to the Scope of <hi>Christian Perfection,</hi> and the <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and His <hi>Apostles.</hi>

               <p>Why truly, I believe, ever since I can remember.</p>

               <p>Why then I'le propose a way—What think ye of a <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Council</hi>?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merr.</speaker>
               <p>I dare not undertake to <hi>propose</hi> it, Sir; But as to that I'le give ye the words of the Author of the <hi>Old Way of ending new Controversies.</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">P. 32.</note> A National Council <hi>ought more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oblige us, to determine the Controversies among us; because their Decrees are our own Acts, as having chosen the Persons who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent us in it.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priestl.</speaker>
               <p>Very honestly spoken, what think you?—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merr.</speaker>
               <p>That's a thing to be left wholly to <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>—I have nothing to do with it—But in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,<note rend="inter">M. <hi>Maurices</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Preached <hi>before</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> Jan. 30. 1681.</note> there is a <hi>Worthy Gentleman</hi> has put your Friends into an <hi>Extraordinary Method.</hi> Whither they will follow it or no, I cannot tell; but I am apt to believe it is much more <hi>wholsome advice,</hi> than is given them
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64372:21"/>
by their <hi>adored Guide,</hi> to whom they <hi>bow</hi> at <hi>Sam's Coffee-House.</hi> And therefore because they shall not be offended with me, I will give them the Gentleman's own words. <hi>It is not material</hi> (says he,) <hi>from whence bad Men derive their Principles of Disloyalty, since it is too certain, they owe all their Success and Advantages to our sins; as these increase, so do they; they have both one Common Fate, they multiply and decrease together. Our prophaneness and Contempt of Religion, begets in them a Contempt of Authority and the Laws; and the neglect of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Service we pretend to extol, adds greater Numbers to our Enemies than all their Art and Industry can pervert. If we would weaken that Faction, let us take away the support they have among our selves, the Open Scandal and Viciousness of our Lives, and then they are left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretence, and fall without our trouble. Let us confute their Reproaches by a Reformation of our manners, and detect their Hypocrisy, not by washing off the paint with Satyr, but by confronting their pretence and form with solid and sincere Piety. Without this, all other means will be to little purpose. Without this Loyalty is but affectation, a thing no less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable than it will be uncertain.</hi> And with this I will conclude; firmly believing, if this advice were follow'd, all <hi>Thundering in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,</hi> and <hi>Caballing in Coffee-Houses,</hi> would soon be at an End.</p>
