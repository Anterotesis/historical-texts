            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PROPOSALS
Delivered in to the Commiſſioners of Parliament reſiding
with the Army.</head>
            <p>THeſe ſeverall enſuing Particulars being
conſidered, debated, and reſolved upon at
a generall Councell of Warre, (his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
being preſent) wee the Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſioners
of the Army were appointed in
(the name and behalfe of them) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the ſame to your Lordſhips and the Commiſſioners,
to be tendred with all ſpeed to the Parliament; which we
accordingly offer, and deſire your ſpeedy care therein, that
ſo an Anſwer (according to the deſire and expectation of
the Army) may be ſpeedily returned to theſe Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. That there be an effectuall Declaration forthwith
publiſhed to the whole Kingdome, againſt the inviting,
&amp; bringing in of any Forraign Forces, under any pretence
whatſoever.</p>
            <p>2. That the Army may be paid up equall with the diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
thereof, according to the late Votes of Parliament;
And that the Army may forthwith be put into a conſtant
courſe of pay, that they may not be burthenſome and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
to the Country: for the more ſpeedy performance
whereof, we deſire, that the Houſe of Peeres would be
pleaſed to concurre with the deſires of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
(ſo often propoſed to them) for the reviving of the
Committee for the Army; that ſo the Aſſeſſments and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93114:3"/>
great Summes in arreares both in the City, and elſewhere,
may be by their endeavour collected for the ſpeedy and
neceſſary ſupply of the Army: And alſo, that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers
and the Committee at VVeavers Hall, may be ſpeedily
called to an account, in what manner, and by what
warrant, the two hundred and thirty thouſand pounds
lately intruſted in their hands, have been in ſo ſhort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
time conſumed.</p>
            <p>3. That the Militia of the Citie of London, and the
Committee for the ſame, may conſiſt of ſuch Perſons, and
ſpeedily be returned into thoſe hands who formerly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the worſt of times have therein given large teſtimony
of their fidelity to the Parliament and Kingdome; which
beſides the reall ſecurity it will be to the Parliament and
Kingdome, in preventing of dangers, aud preparations
toward another warre; would conduce ſo much to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of iealouſies, and give ſuch a ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to the Army, as that we might the better diſpoſe it
to larger Quarters in ſeverall parts, for the eaſe of the
Country.</p>
            <p>According to, and in purſuance of the Particulars mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
under the fifth Head of the Repreſentation of the
Army, wee do earneſtly deſire.</p>
            <p>4. That all perſons impriſoned in England, or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Wales, (not for Delinquency in relation to the
late warre, but for other pretended miſdemeanours) whoſe
impriſonment is not by the regulated courſe of Law, but
by Order from either Houſe of Parliament, or of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees
flowing from them; may be put into a ſpeedy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and epuitable way of tryall: or (if the neceſſity of
ſetling the generall affaires of the Kingdome admit not
their preſent tryall,) that then they may have preſent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
upon reaſonable ſecurity for their appearance at a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93114:3"/>
certain day to anſwer what ſhall be charged againſt them
in a legall way. And that when they ſhall be tryed, if they
appeare wrongfully or unduely impriſoned; they may
have reparation according to their ſufferings. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
we deſire this may be done in behalfe of Lievetennant
Colonell John Lilburne, M. Musgrave, M. Overton, and
others in their condition impriſoned in and about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>

LETTER ſent from his Excellency Sir THOMAS
FAIRFAX, and the Councel of Warre; to the
Lord Maior, Aldermen, and Common-Councell
of the City of London.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord, and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the carrying on of the great buſineſſe of the
Kingdome towards a generall and happy ſetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it hath been a fixed principle with us to
make it our firſt endeavour with the Parliament;
that all things tending to the engagement of the
Kingdome in a ſecond Warre might be removed,
before we could have a confidence to expect a good iſſue
upon a Treaty with their Commiſſioners: which courſe
of ours, although it might have ſome appearance of delay,
yet by men, that are zealous of the Kingdomes good (we
hope no endeavour will be iudged unneceſſary, that may
ſecure the Kingdome from the danger of a new embroyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Wee are now come thus farre; that the moſt materiall
particulars which we have in preparation to propoſe for
the generall ſettlement of the affaires of the Kingdome,
have been communicated to the Parliaments Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and we hope they are ſatisfyed that they contain in
them things tending to a generall good, and to lay an
hopefull foundation for a common Right and freedome
to the People of this Land in future, and for a laſting
peace amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But before we can ſecurely intend, and without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
apply our ſelves unto the proceeding and diſpatch
of the Treaty thereupon; wee have addreſſed ſome humble
deſires to the Parliament, which we have delivered into
the hands of their Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>The paper conſiſts of three particulars, the laſt whereof
(which is the Militia of the City) you being moſt imedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
concerned, to the end you may ſee, we would aske
nothing which relates to you, without giving you a iuſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93114:4"/>
accompt thereof, and all poſſible fatisfaction therein, we
have alſo given a Copy thereof to your Commiſſioners
to be herewith ſent unto you.</p>
            <p>We ſhould not deſire this or any thing elſe of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
were we not perſwaded that what we deſire is ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and neceſſary for yours and the Kingdomes good
and quiet, and we ſhould willingly have been ſilent (as to
this) but conſidering the iuſt iealouſies which lye againſt
ſome perſons now authorized in the exerciſe of that
power amongſt you, and thoſe attempts which have been
made by ſome who would have engaged your City to a
warre, had not your Lordſhip and the court of Aldermen
and Common Counſell by your wiſedome prevented it,
by getting thoſe Votes which were paſſed by the Militia,
made null; we cannot in a caſe of this importance but
deale freely with you in deſiring your concurrence with
ours to the Parliaments, that the Militia may be changed
into thoſe hands out of which it was taken, of whoſe
care and fidelity to the publique there hath been ſo long
and large experience, as few ages have paralleld. And if
the intereſt we have ſo long fought for be ſtill the ſame.
let it not ſeeme ſtrange, that we deſire both of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and City, that thoſe may be in places of ſuch a truſt
who have given the beſt proofe of their courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in proſecution of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Having thus farre declared our ſelves withall freedome
and cleareneſſe to you, as we doe not doubt of your good
acceptance of our intentions therein, ſo we deſire your
forwardneſſe in a worke, ſo much tending to mutuall
confidence, and to prevent the deſignes of any who would
be glad to put obſtructions in the way to an happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
and envy nothing more then the continuance of a
right underſtanding between you and us.</p>
