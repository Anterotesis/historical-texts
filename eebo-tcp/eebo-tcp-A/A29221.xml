            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The manner of the ungodly life, and fearfull death of Richard Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Eſq. one of the Parliaments Executioners of their Lord and
Soveraign King CHARLES the I.</head>
            <p>THis Hangman <hi>Richard Brandon,</hi> being a lewd and notorious
villain, that formerly had been twice Condemned by the
Law to be Hanged for having two Wives, and by the mercy of
the State pardoned as a fit Inſtrument of their new Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
was naturally addicted to two of his Mrs qualities, viz.
Drunkenneſs and Luſt; he was the only Son of <hi>Gregory Brandon,</hi>
and claimed the Gallows by inheritance; was a man for his time
faithful to the Parliament and State: The firſt he beheaded was
the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> before which time (becauſe he would
be a good Proficient in his Art) he beheaded Doggs and Catts,
and others he quarter'd and hang'd, ſo that in little time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his Arts-maſter, and proved as unlucky a Hangman as the
beſt; and did behead, hang, draw, and quarter better then any
of his Predeceſſors.</p>

               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>This yong <hi>Gregory,</hi> proving ſo apt and good an Artiſt, that
with a little <hi>Snick-up,</hi> he could cure all Diſeaſes or Maladies
whatſoever in the <hi>Body</hi> Politick, not too far gone.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>He had a neat, aſſured cleanly trick</l>
               <l>To cure any neck that had the crick,</l>
               <l>Nay, all Diſeaſes, call them as you pleaſe,</l>
               <l>He had a Medicine gave them preſent eaſe:</l>
               <l>But like a Rogue, he lately gave o're thoſe</l>
               <l>That were his <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> and his <hi>Countries</hi> foes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>When <hi>Iuſtice</hi> call'd him, then hee'd not be ſeen,</l>
               <l>To ſearch their wounds while they were freſh &amp; green.</l>
               <l>But now they are unto a <hi>Gangrena</hi> run,</l>
               <l>There's little good by <hi>Hempſeed</hi> to be done.</l>
               <l>Had <hi>Iuſtice</hi> been impartial, it had been Reaſon</l>
               <l>To hang up Traytors in their thoughts of Treaſon:</l>
               <l>But now their thoughts are grown unto the Act</l>
               <l>What helps it now to hang them for the Fact?</l>
               <l>Yet hang they ſhall, and end their lives on Trees,</l>
               <l>Take them <hi>Will Loe,</hi> for they are all thy Fees.</l>
