            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>INnovation lies under so very Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous a Name, that to break an old Custom, tho' never so Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is esteem'd little less than the profannest of Sacriledgies, <hi>So necessary we think it to believe our Ancestors wiser, than our Selves!</hi> This makes me afraid to turn out of that <hi>beaten Path,</hi> my Predecessors in Dedications, have made the <hi>Via Regia</hi> for us to tread; they have fix'd the Custom of rarely, or never-speaking Truth to our Patrons, and I shou'd be convicted of too open a breach of this, by more Witnesses
<pb facs="tcp:101175:3"/>
than the Law requires, if I shou'd in this Epistle attempt your <hi>Praise;</hi> because all, that have the Happiness of an Intimacy with you, know, and all that have heard of you believe your <hi>Merit</hi> deserves the greatest. Besides I shou'd incur the Imputation of that intollerable Impertinence some News-Mongers are so guilty of, in repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with abundance of Ceremony, what all the World knew before: And to tell my <hi>Readers</hi> that Sir <hi>FLEETWOOD</hi> is a Man of admirable Address, and vicacity in Conversation, that his Reflections are both Judicious and Pleasant; that he knows not only Himself, but the World too; and other Truths, too numerous to particularize, wou'd be but a dull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of what his daily Converse has already, and e'ery moment does prove ten thousand times more effectually; for,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Segnius iritant animos demissa per Aurem</l>
               <l>Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quae</l>
               <l>Ipse sibi tradit Spectator.—</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101175:3"/>
The World Loves to hear something new, something not heard of before, <hi>viz.</hi> That such a <hi>Miser</hi> is a liberal <hi>Mecaenas;</hi> such a thoughtless pert <hi>Debochee,</hi> a Man of Honour, Temperance, Justice and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity; such a stigmatiz'd <hi>Sot,</hi> a Man of Address and Wit: But I must inform 'em that the thred-bare Authors have found, ev'n that Method ineffectual; all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator can say, will not perswade the Parcimonious Patron to be liberal, or the Town to think him so: all his forc'd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums on his Sense, will scarce make him so much a Man of Wit, as to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove some little paltry Present; for with Authors, Sir, as well as Whores,</p>
            <q>Res est, crede mihi, ingeniosa DARE.</q>
            <p>And what-ever the World may think their Brains, their Gold will be always sterling with the Poets.</p>
            <p>I esteem my self more happy in the Choice of your Patronage, because it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures me from Scandalously incurring the
<pb facs="tcp:101175:4"/>
same Follies and Vices I condemn in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But as I have no common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron in Sir <hi>FLEETWOOD SHEPPARD;</hi> so I will not treat you like one, I'll endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to imitate <hi>You,</hi> Sir, that is, entertain you agreeably, as you do all your Friends. But I'm not so vain, as to mean this of any thing I have, or shall say in this Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: no, I leave that lucky Assurance to our brisker Authors, who full of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the University, set up Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticly to assert their own Excellence, and the Follies of all others; let them think to attone for their own nauseous Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations, by railing at the poor Beaux, and crown themselves with Laurel, for having wretchedly attaqu'd those despicable Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. The Entertainment, Sir, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is the following Collection of Verses, where you'll find both <hi>Variety</hi> and <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi> for a great many of the ensuing Poems merit that Title.</p>
            <p>If there can be a Definition given us of Wit, and good Poetry, I'm sure the Praise
<pb facs="tcp:101175:4"/>
and Fate of Authors are not really so Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, as they are generally made. I have frequently heard Men, who have in their Performances excell'd, censure others, very positively, without giving any Reason for what they said; when in those very things they exploded, there have concurr'd all they ever requir'd to a good Poem, Propriety, and Noble Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Thought and Expression, the Images daring, and natural, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses, the Arguments demonstrative, and succinct; the Reflections Just and Brillant. On the other hand, I have seen Authors, meet with a very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Reception in the World, who in my Opinion have but a slender pretence to Merit. Whose works are like St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park</hi> on a <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Holy-day,</hi> a strange Extravagant Medly, here a heap of dull Insipid Stuff, with a pert Air, like a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of heavy, gawdy flutt'ring awker'd City Prentices, with their Swords ty'd up to their Middles; there a dull Thought dross'd in an effected Expression, like Miss
<pb facs="tcp:101175:5"/>
in her Holy-day Garb, as stiffly adjusted as her Father's Beard, when he goes to the Change, or a Sermon. There a false glittering Reflection, set off with the Emphatic Mein of a suburb Harlot to engage the straggling Shop-keeper on his Dominical day of Vacation from Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; besides a thousand other congergated Blunders, like the Flood of the undistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd Mob, that laboriously contribute their share of bustle to the raising a Dust and Noise, as well as the Spleen.</p>
            <p>But if the World wou'd receive the Standard of Wit and Excellence given us by so good a Judge, as Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> viz. <hi>Propriety of Thoughts and Words, or the Thoughts and Words elegantly adapted to Subject,</hi> Authors wou'd meet with a much different Fate, from what they have of late. They wou'd not build their Reputation on any Faction, and challenge Wit from the suppos'd Justice of the Cause they espouse; from the Eminent Man they have the
<pb facs="tcp:101175:5"/>
Impudence to attaque; or the Elimosina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Verses of their establish'd Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Tribute of their Friendship, not Judgment; from the Extravagance of the Paradox they advance, or in short, from the Assurance of their own parts; but only from their true and innate Worth, as they equall'd, or fell short of the Standard of Excellence. This I desire shou'd be the guide of the Reader's Censure of the following Verses; not that I've any Hope my own Will escape the better by this means; for I confess my self before-hand, so far from a Poet, that I don't think my self so; I know by experience, that the Muse has too much of the Jilt of that Sex, she's represented of, to one that has no Money; Want starves Poetry, as well as pleasure; and an empty Purse will never win one of the nine Sisters to the Arms of their greatest Admirer. They are like other Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Friends, flying from our distress, and quitting us like our Shadows, as soon as
<pb facs="tcp:101175:6"/>
the Sun withdraws. I have met with too many Misfortunes, and too few Friends to have Sedateness, and Freedom of Mind, enough to write, as I cou'd wish; without the Golden Bough, there's no Being</p>

            <p>AMongst my other Misfortunes I have lately met with an Adventure, which, for the time I confess troubl'd me more, than any thing that ever befel me. A dull Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Abuse of several of those Gentlemen, I had publicly declar'd my self an admirer of, being thrust into the Epistle Dedicatory of the second Volume of the Ladies Letters, Some were pleas'd very unjustly to lay it at my Door. I'm too sensible of my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to be so Mortify'd at the despicable
<pb facs="tcp:101175:7"/>
Opinion those Gentlemen had of my sense, who believ'd it; but I confess I was sensibly touch'd with the Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Judgment they made of my <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> which I do without Arrogance pretend to be as Orthodox as any Mans, how Heterodox soever my other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions may be thought by some. I speak this so publicly to satisfie those whose Friendship I value, and whose Merit I have ever allow'd, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brib'd by the justest Resentment to deny or lessen. I wish the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Author of the Epistle, would be as just in the owning his Brat, as he was unjust in its Production.</p>

               <l>HOW great a Transport is a brave Man in,</l>
               <l>When echoing Trumpets bid the Fight begin?</l>
               <l>With Joy, the list'ning Warrier hears them sound,</l>
               <l>And rears himself, all ravish'd, from the Ground:</l>
               <l>He grasps his Sword, and lifts his pond'rous Shield,</l>
               <l>And big with Joy, flies to the fatal Field:</l>
               <l>The God of War his heated Breast inspires,</l>
               <l>And his glad Soul swells to receive the Fires:</l>

Already, he descrys the distant Plain,</l>
               <l>Already seems to view the horrid Scene,</l>
               <l>Hear clashing Spears, and Groans of dying Men.</l>
               <l>Such was our Monarchs transport at the <hi>Boyne:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>There, <hi>Nassau,</hi> all the Work was Heaven's, and thine.</l>
               <l>Thy self the foremost, like the leading God,</l>
               <l>Thy Soldiers gladly follow'd thro' the Flood;</l>
               <l>Bending the Waves beneath them with their Tread,</l>
               <l>They rais'd a Tempest, tho' the Winds were laid.</l>
               <l>Each Army, like a well-appointed Fleet,</l>
               <l>Cut thro' the rapid Streams, and mid way met;</l>
               <l>Whilst from both Shores the thund'ring Ordnance speaks,</l>
               <l>In louder Sounds, than those of Brazen Beaks.</l>
               <l>All Elements, Fire, Water, Earth and Air,</l>
               <l>Joyn in the fight, and mingle in the War.</l>

Clouds of black Smoak the face of Heav'n obscure,</l>
               <l>The Earth is shook, and the dash'd Waters roar;</l>
               <l>Hundreds are swallowed up, the furious Tide,</l>
               <l>With a strong Current, rowls away the Dead.</l>
               <l>Already they have shot the Gulph of Death,</l>
               <l>And need no Wastage over Lakes beneath;</l>
               <l>Fate stretch'd himself, and both the Banks bestride,</l>
               <l>Fixing a deadly foot on either side,</l>
               <l>Whilst underneath his Arch the River flow'd,</l>
               <l>Whose Waters rose up to him, swell'd with Blood;</l>
               <l>By thousand differing ways, a thousand fall,</l>
               <l>See Death in all its forms, and dire in all.</l>
               <l>The Stately Youth, that stood erect but now,</l>
               <l>Struck by the mortal Dart, are levelled low;</l>
               <l>Whole Heads and Arms are lopt, the shivering Spear</l>
               <l>Strikes its sharp Splinters thro' the wounded Air;</l>
               <l>All instruments of Death the Fates employ,</l>
               <l>Whom the Swords spare, the Waters do destroy.</l>

From dying Chiefs the River gains a Fame,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Sconberg</hi> gives it an immortal Name:</l>
               <l>Bred up in Camps, inur'd to horrid Wars,</l>
               <l>Loaden with Fame and Honour, as with Years;</l>
               <l>Brave as he liv'd, the good old General fell,</l>
               <l>And his great Master did revenge him well.</l>
               <l>O! had thy mighty shade been by t'have seen</l>
               <l>What Troops of Ghosts he sent to wait on thine,</l>
               <l>Thy thankful <hi>Genius</hi> would his steps attend,</l>
               <l>The best of Masters, and the bravest Friend;</l>
               <l>To him thy Art of Conquering would bequeath,</l>
               <l>VVho fought to make thee famous in thy Death:</l>
               <l>For whilst the Waters of the <hi>Boyne</hi> shall flow,</l>
               <l>Succeeding Ages shall remember you.</l>

Around thy Head a thousand Deaths did fly,</l>
               <l>Spent in the Air; the boldest destiny</l>
               <l>Durst only touch thee in its passage by.</l>
               <l>Thy stronger <hi>Genius</hi> did the stroke decline,</l>
               <l>Fate had the power of ev'ry Life but thine.</l>
               <l>Heroes on either side rush dauntless on;</l>
               <l>The day is vanish'd e're the Battle's done.</l>

               <l>Compassionate Eccho's answer to their Cries.</l>
               <l>Whole Heav'ns concern'd, as 'twere it self in fight,</l>

               <l>Strongly he urges on th' Impetuous Horse,</l>
               <l>And bears down all with a resistless force:</l>
               <l>So swiftly does he drive the flying Steed,</l>
               <l>That Victory can scarce keep equal speed.</l>

Heaven lookswith pity on the mighty Dead,</l>
               <l>And griev'd to see so many thousands bleed,</l>
               <l>Spreads the thick Veil of Night, to keep themhid.</l>
               <l>The Sun went down with an unwonted red;</l>
               <l>Bloody he lookt, as if himself had bled.</l>

               <l>Our <hi>Nassau</hi> fought, and seem'd to fall by him.</l>
               <l>Those very waters where the God lay Drown'd,</l>
               <l>Our greater <hi>Heroe</hi> past and went beyond.</l>
               <l>The Heavens withdraw their Lustre, and their Fires</l>
               <l>And day it self, the last of all, expires.</l>
               <l>Night, Horror, and Confusion, fill the Plain,</l>

               <l>Fierce, and Resistless, through the Land he past;</l>
               <l>His Fame, and he seem'd to make equal hast.</l>
               <l>At his approach th' affrighted Realm is shook,</l>
               <l>The chiefest Cities yield without a Stroke.</l>
               <l>To the proud Walls of <hi>Lmrick,</hi> Siege he lays,</l>
               <l>Which nought but Winter had the power to raise.</l>
               <l>The gathering Clouds do warn him to be gone,</l>

            <head type="sub">Out of the <hi>Anthologia</hi> of the <hi>Italian</hi> Poets.</head>
            <l>SEven Summers Heats, and Winters Frosts are past,</l>
            <l>Since, <hi>Amarillis,</hi> I beheld you last:</l>
            <l>Yet, nor the Winter's Frosts, nor frequent Rains,</l>
            <l>Could quench my Fires, or cool my burning pains;</l>
            <l>Nor the seven Summers, with their scorching heat,</l>
            <l>Expell my Flames, or make my Love abate.</l>
            <l>You, when the dawning day begins to break,</l>
            <l>Are my first Song; yours, the first name I speak:</l>
            <l>And when the mounting Sun has reach'd his height<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <l>From his Meridian, shining warm, and bright;</l>
            <l>My Morning Theme at Mid-day I rehearse:</l>
            <l>You fill my Numbers, and inspire my Verse.</l>

Then when encroaching Night comes hast'ning on,</l>
            <l>The shadows length'ning, as the Sun goes down;</l>
            <l>Still their first Theme my constant Songs pursue,</l>
            <l>And all I talk, and think, is still of you.</l>
            <l>You, in my Dreams, my flatter'd Arms infold;</l>
            <l>Oh! that those Dreams, that sooth me so, could hold:</l>
            <l>But they once gone, and Day again in view,</l>
            <l>With the renewing Light, my Pains renew:</l>
            <l>I fly my House, as that encreas'd my Grief,</l>
            <l>And yet in open Air, find no relief;</l>
            <l>O're Hills, and Dales, thro' ev'ry conscious Grove,</l>
            <l>Born by my restless Passion, on I Rove,</l>
            <l>Aloud complaining; with my pitious Moans,</l>
            <l>I fill the sounding Rocks, and tire the list'ning Stones.</l>
            <l>Echo alone, my loud complaints, returns,</l>
            <l>Echo alone, with kind condoleance mourns.</l>

Oft as the Sighs from my heav'd Heart arise,</l>
            <l>From neighb'ring Caves, as often she replies,</l>

            <l>Oft as some rugged Clift's ascent I gain,</l>

            <l>THey say that Swans, as by the Streams they lie,</l>

            <l>But if they lost a thing so dear as thee,</l>

            <l>If they but knew what 'tis to lose a Friend,</l>
            <l>They sure wou'd choose then a more silent end.</l>
            <l>The deepest Sorrow in deepest Silence gleams,</l>
            <l>The hottest Fires have still the smallest flames:</l>
            <l>Tho' noisie Grief, a Heart untouch'd declares,</l>
            <l>Yet piercing Woe may flow in Sighs and Tears.</l>
            <l>'Twou'd be unkind to see a Friend depart,</l>

            <l>SInce now my <hi>Sylvia</hi> is as kind as fair,</l>
            <l>Let Wit and Joy succeed my dull Despair.</l>
            <l>Oh! what a Night of Pleasure was the last!</l>
            <l>A large Reward for all my Torments past;</l>
            <l>And on my Head, if future Mischiefs fall,</l>
            <l>This happy Night shall make amends for all:</l>
            <l>Twelve was the happy Minute that we met,</l>
            <l>And on her Bed were close together set;</l>
            <l>Tho' list'ning Spies might be perhaps too near,</l>
            <l>Love fill'd our Hearts, there was no room for Fear.</l>
            <l>Now whilst I strove her melting Heart to move,</l>

            </l>
            <l>In her fair Face I saw the Colour rise,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:101175:55"/>
Gently they look, and I with Joy, adore</l>
            <l>That only Charm they never had before.</l>
            <l>The Wounds they gave her Tongue was wont to heal,</l>
            <l>But now these gentle Enemies reveal</l>
            <l>A Secret, which that Friend would fain conceal.</l>
            <l>What she forbids, Love does by Signs command,</l>
            <l>Languishing Looks, and pressing close my Hand,</l>
            <l>And I her Cypher quickly understand.</l>
            <l>My Eyes transported too with Amorous rage,</l>
            <l>Seem'd fierce with Expectation to engage:</l>
            <l>But fast she holds her Hands, and close her Thighs,</l>
            <l>And what she longs to do, with frowns denies.</l>
            <l>A strange Effect on foolish Woman wrought,</l>
            <l>Bred in <hi>Disguises,</hi> and by <hi>Custom</hi> taught.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Custom,</hi> that all the World to Slavery brings,</l>
            <l>The dull Excuse for doing silly things.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:101175:55"/>
               <hi>Custom,</hi> which Wisdom sometimes over-rules,</l>
            <l>But serves instead of <hi>Reason</hi> to the Fools:</l>
            <l>So <hi>Sylvia</hi> by the Method of her Sex,</l>
            <l>Is forc'd a while her self and me to vex.</l>
            <l>But now; when thus we have been struggling long,</l>
            <l>My Strength grows weak, and her Desire grows strong.</l>
            <l>How can she chuse but let the Conqueror in?</l>
            <l>He strives without, and Love betrays within.</l>
            <l>Her Hands, at last, to hide her Blushes, leave</l>
            <l>The Fort unguarded, ready to receive</l>
            <l>My fierce Assaults, made with a Lover's hast,</l>
            <l>Like Lightening piercing, and as quickly past.</l>
            <l>Thus does fond Nature with her Children play,</l>
            <l>First shews us Joy, then snatches it away.</l>
            <l>'Tis not excess of Pleasure makes it short,</l>
            <l>The pain of Love's as raging as the sport;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:101175:56"/>
And yet alas! that lasts, we sigh all night,</l>
            <l>With Grief, but scarce one Minute with Delight.</l>
            <l>Some little pain might check her kind desire,</l>
            <l>But not enough to make her once retire.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Maid's Wounds for Pleasure bear, as Men for praise,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Here Honour heals, there Love their smart allays.</l>
            <l>The World (if just) would harmful Courage blame,</l>
            <l>And this more innocent Reward with Fame.</l>
            <l>When she reflects upon her conquered Womb,</l>
            <l>So many Terrors past, and Joys to come;</l>
            <l>Whose Harbingers did roughly all remove,</l>
            <l>To make great room for great Luxurious Love;</l>
            <l>Pleas'd with the mighty Guest her Arms embrace</l>
            <l>My Body, and her Hands a better place;</l>
            <l>Which with one touch, so pleas'd, and proud does grow,</l>
            <l>It swells beyond the Grasp that makes it so;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:101175:56"/>
Confinement scorns in any straiter Walls,</l>
            <l>Than those of Love, where it contented falls;</l>
            <l>Tho' twice overthrown, he more inflam'd does rise,</l>
            <l>And will to the last Drop fight out the Prize:</l>
            <l>She like some Amazon in Story proves,</l>
            <l>That overcomes the Heroe, whom she loves.</l>
            <l>In the close Fight she took so great delight,</l>
            <l>She then could think of nothing but the Fight;</l>
            <l>With Joy she laid him panting at her Feet,</l>
            <l>But with no less did his Recovery meet:</l>
            <l>Her trembling Hand first gently rais'd his Head,</l>
            <l>She almost dies for fear that he is dead:</l>
            <l>Then binds his Wounds up with a busie Hand,</l>
            <l>And with that Balm enables him to stand;</l>
            <l>Till by her Love she conquers him once more,</l>
            <l>And wounds him deeper than she did before;</l>
            <l>Tho' fallen from the top of Pleasures Hill,</l>
            <l>With Longing Eyes we look up thither still;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:101175:57"/>
Still thither our unwearied Wishes tend,</l>
            <l>Till we that height of Happiness ascend</l>
            <l>By gentle steps; the Ascent it self exceeds</l>
            <l>All Joy, but only that to which it leads.</l>
            <l>First, then so long and lovingly we kiss,</l>
            <l>As if like Doves we knew no other Bliss;</l>
            <l>Still in one Mouth our Tongues together play,</l>
            <l>Whilst wanton Hands are pleas'd no less than they,</l>
            <l>Thus cling'd together now a while we rest,</l>
            <l>Breathing our Souls into each other's Breast:</l>
            <l>Then give a gentle Kiss of all our Parts,</l>
            <l>While this best way we make a change of Hearts.</l>
            <l>Here would my Praise, as well as pleasure dwell;</l>
            <l>Enjoyment's self I scarce like half so well:</l>
            <l>The little this comes short in Rage and Strength,</l>
            <l>Is largely recompenc'd with endless Length.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:101175:57"/>
This Pleasure would remain, if we could stay,</l>
            <l>But Love's too eager to admit delay,</l>
            <l>And hurries us with Speed so smooth away.</l>
            <l>Now wanton in our Joys we nimbly move</l>
            <l>Our Pliant Hands in all the shapes of Love;</l>
            <l>Our Motions, not like that of perter fools,</l>
            <l>Whose active Body shews their heavy Souls;</l>
            <l>But Sports of Love, in which the willing Mind,</l>
            <l>Makes Men as able as their Hearts are kind;</l>
            <l>That Love would ease us of our eager Fire,</l>
            <l>Which, with such active Zeal we now require;</l>
            <l>At last we force that Blessing we desire.</l>
            <l>In Women's Mynes Men labour with great pain,</l>
            <l>And thus we Heav'n with Violence obtain.</l>
            <l>Oh! Heav'n of Love, thou Moment of Delight!</l>
            <l>Wrong'd by my words, my Fancy does thee <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               <l>The working Billows swell, with dreadful noise they flow,</l>
               <l>To Vales and Hills they turn the liquid Plain:</l>
               <l>Their oozy Beds profoundest Waters leave,</l>

               <l>And foam, and rave, with horrid Roar;</l>
               <l>But soon each following surge its leading surge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouls,</l>

               <l>With their impetuous Force;</l>
               <l>Swell'd by its Pow'r, the Passions rage,</l>
               <l>No bounds the soaring Will can curb;</l>
               <l>Presumptuous Minds dare Heav'n engage:</l>
               <l>But crowding Years push on, and forwards drive,</l>
               <l>Till hurried on, vain Men arrive</l>
               <l>On Death's inevitable Coast,</l>
               <l>Where all, dissolv'd to dust, in Nature's Mass are lost.</l>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> in his Name again, and Books and Heirs should die.</l>
               <l>I see the discontented Crew,</l>
