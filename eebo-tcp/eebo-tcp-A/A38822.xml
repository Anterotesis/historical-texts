            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is well known, and confirmed by certain Experience, that by the great care, cost and charges of the Merchants;
<pb facs="tcp:58030:3"/>
and by the great industry and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Planters of Tobacco in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> multitudes of people that are under the present Government, are plentifully maintained, and very many of them get great estates for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and families, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of it are no small profit to the Commonwealth. I think there is no one kind of forreign Commodities that yeelds greater advantage to the publick; and there is scarce any to be compared with it. Wherefore I dedicate this short History of Tobacco un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that are the Merchants and Factors in it, wherein you may at your leisure observe some thing that may conduce to your further content, if you please but to take notice of the great virtues it hath both in Physick and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery. But if we reflect upon our Fore-fathers, and that within
<pb facs="tcp:58030:3"/>
the time of less than one hundred years, before the use of Tobacco came to be known amongst us, (For Captain <hi>Richard Grenfield,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Drake</hi> were the first Planters of it here, and not S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh,</hi> which is the common errour) we cannot but wonder how they did to subsist without it; For were the planting and traffick of Tobacco now hindred, millions of the Nation, in all probability must perish for want of food, their whole livelihood almost depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it. So many <hi>Druggists, Grocers, Tobacco-shops, Taverns, Inns, Ale-houses, Victuallers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, Cutters</hi> and <hi>Dryers of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, Pipe-makers,</hi> and the like, that deal in it, will prove no less.</p>
            <p>The necessity of Tobacco, and maintaining the Plantations of it, is almost as great, if we do but consider who they are that buy it only for their own drinking, and
<pb facs="tcp:58030:4"/>
cannot abstain from it. Sea-men will be supplied with it for their long voyages: Souldiers cannot want it when they keep guards all night, or are upon other hard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in cold and tempestuous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Farmers, Plough-men, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and almost all labouring men plead for it, saying, they find great refreshment by it, and very many would as soon part with their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary food, as they would be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deprived of the use of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco. The Nobility and Gentry, who find no fault with it, but that it is too common amongst the Vulgar, do ordinarily make it the complement of all their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and oft-times all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment besides is but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. Scholars use it much, and many grave and great men take Tobacco to make them more serviceable in their callings. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco is grown to be not only the
<pb facs="tcp:58030:4"/>
Physick, but even the meat and drink of many men, women and children. In a word, it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd so far, that there is no living without it; that notwithstanding the vast Plantations of it in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> all our corn-fields would soon be turned to gardens of Tobacco, were not men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd from it by the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. It is like <hi>Elias</hi> Cloud, which was no <hi>bigger at first than a mans hand, that hath suddenly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the face of the earth:</hi> The <hi>Low-countreys, Germany, Poland, Arabia, Persia Turky,</hi> almost all Countreys drive a Trade of it; and there is no commodity that hath advanced so many from small for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to gain great estates in the world. <hi>Don Ulafc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> who, as I am told, never knew his own name nor parentage, by sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Tobacco, hangs out the sign of <hi>Don de Velasco,</hi> under whom he
<pb facs="tcp:58030:5"/>
was once a poor souldier, and is called now by his Generals name. But though they that traffick in it seldom miscarry, yet others by the intemperate taking of it, have somtimes brought themselves and great estates to ruine by it, in whom this Martial Plant hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned more diseases of the mind, than it can cure diseases of the body, though it be of very great use in Physick.</p>
            <p>I confess that Tobacco is a plant of Gods making, and it hath many admirable faculties in it, and the fault is not in the leaf, though it be sophisticated by some, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately abused by others; yet there is some reason to suspect, that there hath been much of the cunning of the Devil, and of mans perverse understanding imployed in the large propagation of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that <hi>Christians, Iews, Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> almost all mankind,
<pb facs="tcp:58030:5"/>
who are naturally so averse from all that is good, and prone to nothing but mischief, are so much delighted with it. But in my opinion, the providence God intended by discovering this herb to <hi>Christians</hi> amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> that by their daily commerce, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> should be made known to those <hi>Heathen</hi> people, who <hi>sit in darkness and the shadow of death.</hi> The Devil was much afraid of it, as I was enformed by one born in <hi>England</hi> of <hi>Spanish</hi> parentage. For when the <hi>Christians</hi> came first among the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and began to convert them to the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> (as there appeared some symptoms of zeal at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, though it grew soon cold at the sight of gain) the Devil threatned to revenge himself on the <hi>Christians,</hi> by teaching them to take Tobacco, which having once tasted they should never be able to refrain from it. We see in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that <hi>Christians</hi> are so much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it, that they cannot forbear
<pb facs="tcp:58030:6"/>
it; but the Devil seems to be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid than hurt, to think that <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> now adayes are so zealous of Gods glory, as to make it their aim to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw those barbarous people from his service; forasmuch as I can understand they have made this the least part of their imployment, not regarding the purpose of God, nor his dispensations for the saving of mens souls, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seended from <hi>Adam</hi> as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and may <hi>have a part in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ</hi> as well as they; who had they but a glimpse of that light <hi>Christians</hi> have, would doubtlesse bring forth better fruits than <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do, who by their jarring and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences one with another, and by minding so much their own profit and advantage, have given great cause to those ignorant people to blaspheme the name of God, and to abhor the Sacrifices of the Lord. Insomuch that when they were told that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> went to Heaven, they said, <hi>They
<pb facs="tcp:58030:6"/>
would go to Hell, that they might not be where those wicked Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>niards were.</hi> So that it is likely that God seeing <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> now unworthy of his service, hath reserved the conversion of that people, untill such time as <hi>Christians</hi> shall be more charitable and more composed in love and unity amongst themselves. I must not tire your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by writing a Volume upon this subject, left the portal prove too great for the house. I shall onely speak something more concerning Tobacco. And</p>
            <p>First, It is no great friend to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, though it be a physical plant; for the very smoke of it is held to be a great Antidote against all venome and pestilential diseases. It is also sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in Clysters against the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cholick, and therefore King <hi>Iames</hi> merrily said, <hi>That was the way to take it:</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> who was so cured by it was of another mind. The <hi>Irish</hi> they are altogether for snuff
<pb facs="tcp:58030:7"/>
Tobacco to purge their brains. The <hi>Indians</hi> swallow down the smoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst weariness, till they fall into an Extasie. The upper Scout of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as some report, chews it against all diseases, and likes it better than Partridge or Pheasant. But the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way to suck it from a pipe, and puff it out again, is held the best way to cure Rheums and disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lations from the head. It works such contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that Philosophers contend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most about it, as much as Chymists do concerning Mercury: they cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, whether it be hot and dry, or cold and moist, for it quencheth thirst, and yet is the fittest shoing-horn to draw down drink, and to make men dry; it abates hunger, yet is excellent to provoke a mans appetite to meat: It is a fit companion for mirth or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; it will make one sleep, who wants rest; yet will it keep a Scholar waking in his study, and a souldier up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his guard. It puts Physicians to a
<pb facs="tcp:58030:7"/>

D. <hi>Venner</hi> in his <hi>Via recta ad vitam longam,</hi> allows any man, be he Cholerick, Phlegmatique, Sanguine or Melancholique, six pipes a day. Wherefore some object, <hi>That it is a vain thing.</hi> I answer with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> so are all things else, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi> Yet I should counsel no man to take it, who doth not stand in need of it; and those that do, to use it with that moderation as is required in the use of all other things. When thou hast found honey eat not too muah of it; <hi>Ubi mel, ibi fel,</hi> where honey is, there is gall; and in every thing in this world there is something to be avoided. Nature her self speaks the same to us with a loud voice in this Tobacco plant as much as in any thing in the world. For those two ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves that grow upon it, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Bascheros</hi> must be cut off, and thrown away, they smell and taste so unpleasantly, that should they
<pb facs="tcp:58030:8"/>
be mingled with the rest, they would spoil all. As therefore the Planters are very carefull to cast these leaves away, so should Christians be in the use of all temporal things, to cast away all earthly thoughts and desires that are too near the ground, all that is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and offensive to God or man, that all their thoughts, words and deeds may be sweet sented in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils of God, that they may be at length transplanted from their uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Plantations here on earth to an everlasting Plantation in Heaven, which is the prayer of him for your Worships, and for all the worthy Merchants and Planters of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who is</p>

               <p>Tobacco took the Name from the Name of that Country which is a Province in new <hi>Spain,</hi> in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <hi>Indies,</hi> or the new World, about Forty foure Miles above <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Hispaniola.</hi> In this lay the Province Tobacco which was under subjection to the government of <hi>Iucatan,</hi> (the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward called it the Province of the Blessed Victorious Virgin, because in the Year, 1519. <hi>Ferdinand Corte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> Founder of new <hi>Spain,</hi> won a great victory in that place) here was this Noble Plant first found, that Cures almost all Diseases, and from thence afterwards it borrowed the Name. Those of <hi>Pern</hi> call it <hi>Petum,</hi> so do almost all the people that live toward the <hi>Antartick-Pole,</hi> or <hi>Pici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elt,</hi> as <hi>Monardis</hi> holds,<note place="margin">l.Hist. 11. 6.5.</note> or <hi>Perebece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuc,</hi> as <hi>Oviedus</hi> will have it (yet this is not the proper name for To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58030:10"/>
but is ascribed to some other <hi>Indian</hi> Plant by Authours, and it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from Tobacco, as it appears to me.</p>
               <p>Vulgarly it is called <hi>Nicotiana,</hi> or <hi>Nicosiana,</hi> from D. <hi>Iohannes Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> of <hi>Nismes,</hi> who was Counseller to <hi>Francis</hi> the second King of <hi>France,</hi> and Master of requests af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and of petitions in the Court, who first discovered this Herb to <hi>France,</hi> (as that most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Knight and Sea Admirall. Sr <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> about the Year 1586. made it known in <hi>England</hi>) for whose sake it ought to be gratefully received in Memory of him by all Men, unto whomsoever the same of this healing Plant shall be brought. This D. <hi>Nicotius,</hi> when in the Year 1560. he was sent by his King to be Embassadour in <hi>Portugal.</hi> It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on a day that he went to view a Prison, or rather a work house for such as are punished at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where at that time the Kings Court was. There a certain Noble <hi>Dutch-</hi> Man who was the chiefest keeper of the Kings Archives, presented him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58030:11"/>
with this Plant, as being a stranger and newly brought thither from the Island <hi>Florida</hi>; The Embassadour gladly received the Plant, and being rare and come from beyond the Seas, and which he had never seen before he takes, great care to have it planted in his Garden, for he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood before by hear say, of the great Vertues it had to cure Wounds and Ulcers, it having been often used with happy success.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Fame of this Herb spread over all <hi>Portugall,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> speak much in praise of it, and it began to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Embassadours Herb. Not long after he returning for <hi>France,</hi> preserved some of the Seed of it to <hi>Catharina de Medicis,</hi> Queen of <hi>France</hi>; Shee understanding that this Plant was excellent for curing malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Ulcers and Putrified Sores, and admiring at it, as being a new Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Remedy, gave it her Name; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, all <hi>France</hi> over, it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Queens Herb, and <hi>Cathari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria,</hi> and <hi>Medicea.</hi>

                  <p>THe third fort, called the lesser Tobacco, is but a foot and half high, and farre lower than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The root is white, going deep downwards, the length of a span, as thick as ones finger, and is much set about with leaves on the sides. The stalk is round, fat, with fine down upon it, of a pale green, upon which the leaves are green, somewhat round, fat, full of juyce, somewhat hairy, not unlike to mad Nightshade, but they are greater and more white. The flowers are of a yellow pale colour, standing in dented leafie cups, farre smaller than those of great Tobacco, they are hollow, and are

unfolded into five blunt once divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded edges, and when these fall, there remains roundish heads, that are full of pale wan seeds, like to the small ones of the former Tobacco, but they are bigger and round. <hi>Bauhinus</hi> cals this kind yellow Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane. <hi>Matthiolus</hi> cals it, the third sort of Henbane. At <hi>Lions</hi> they call it, black Henbane. <hi>Dodoneus</hi> will have it yellow Henbane; so will <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicerus.

But I with the most learned Herbalist <hi>Dale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champius,</hi> do not think this herb can be referred to Henbane, for their faculties are quite contrary, for the seed of this tasts sharp; as also the leaves, if you chew them they are a long time of a hot tast in your mouth,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58030:15"/>
and it cannot be extinguished, but in long time; and this is a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heat. Wherefore the famous <hi>Donanaeus</hi> did not well to call it Henbane of <hi>Peru,</hi> nor any of the rest, for it cannot be referred to any kind of it, for the leaves are notably acrimonious, which argues a hot and no cold temperament, like to Henbane.

               <p>VVHat concerns the faculties of the Male Tobacco (for in this Discourse I chiefly treat of that) there is great dissention amongst learned men. <hi>Monardes</hi> holds it to be hot and dry in the second degree, and moderate in the rest; and <hi>Dale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champius</hi> holds the same. <hi>Caesalpinus</hi> faith, it is hot in the first, and dry in the third degree. <hi>Edward Done</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Writer, holds it to be hot and dry almost in the third degree. Others deny it to be hot, but say it is extream cold, because the smoke troubles the mind, and brings a man
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58030:16"/>
almost into an Extasis; and therefore they referre it to some kind of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, as I gave notice of before. <hi>Bauhinus</hi> he sayes as much, moved thereto by its stupefying quality, and likeness of the forme that it hath with Henbane. <hi>Mercatus</hi> saith, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hot. <hi>Iacobus Gohorius</hi> dares not give his opinion, but puts it off to some other time. <hi>Lobelius</hi> thinks it is hot intensly in the second degree; and he answers <hi>Dodonaeus,</hi> that it bites in taste, and is hot in the mouth; yet <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> afterwards changed his opinion. I with <hi>Renealmus</hi> say, that the green leaves are hot and dry in the second degree (which tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Sunne gives to them, as it doth to the root and stalk by its heat, and the Moon gives them their color) but when they are dried, they are hot and dry in the end of the third degree. Tobacco is acrimonious, and causeth thirst, troubles the mind, makes the head heavy, which could not be, unless some hot vapour flew up, and fill'd the brain. They do but sport, that say it is cold, for it hath all symptoms of heat.</p>

               <p>IT is sowed in the Island <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> as also in other hot clymates about Autumn, where almost all the year long it brings leaves, flowers and buds. It will grow with us, if conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual care be to help it. It is not sowed with us before the warm Spring, that is, about the Ides or Nones of <hi>April,</hi> as the weather is hot; for it is chill, and at the first fall of the leaf or cold weather it fades, wherefore it must be well fenced from cold. Noble <hi>Clusius</hi> thinks it should be sowed in <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> because the small seed lieth very long under ground before it spring forth, and being sowed in <hi>March,</hi> or in the Spring, in <hi>August</hi> it will bring flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and now and then seed. But we find by experience, that the seed of Tobacco sowed in <hi>April,</hi> in our Countrey, springs forth more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily and sooner, and the stalks are more fruitfull and longer, and the leaves are farre greater and fatt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Plant is gathered, when the Sunne is in the 18, 19. and 20. degree of <hi>Leo.</hi> Being once planted, when the seed comes to be ripe, it will sow it self plentifully of its own accord in many Gardens and Fields, whether it is carried by force of winds. It is sowed in the increase of the Moon, and cut when the Moon decreaseth. The seed is dedicated to <hi>Aquarius</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> being very hot, which quality it hath from <hi>Mars.</hi> In Winter it can hardly be kept but in pots or woodden chests, or little baskets made with osiers, and that in Panteries, and places under ground, or hot houses, or stowes, and so it may be preserved without hurt for three or four years. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salpinus</hi> would also have the stalks planted, yet <hi>Basilius Beflerus Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stettensis</hi> saith, he tried that in his Garden, but it proved in vain.</p>

               <p>Tobacco being thus warmed and fermented, the foresaid leaves must be hanged up with small packthreds, thrusting the needle through the greater nerve of the leaves, that is on the backside, and so they must be hanged up in a windy place, but not very high, where the Sunne shines; for by the Sunnes heat all their forces would vanish.

First, Formally, and then it is an insensible quality different from the first qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, yet resulting from the actions of them. Secondly, Materially, that is for the substance it is inherent in, and that is Tobacco here. Now this is hot and dry, to be considered of for its heat and thin substance: I say then that an Aromaticall sweet smell doth refresh the forces, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth the brain, heart and stomach, for it is a most welcome quality to these parts, and therefore it preserves
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58030:25"/>
their temperament and substance; and the vitall and animall sprits are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made most fit for natures ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, by a smoke joyned with a sweet sent, and sucked in with that Aromaticall Vapour.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To the first I answer, That the Ayre's not joyning needs not trouble us, nor the unfitness of it to nourish. For we do not think that the Ayre doth nourish the solid and fleshy parts really; but being so mingled as I said, and concocted by the strong heat of the heart, I maintan it doth goe into the substance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To the second the answer is easie. For though the water alone be unfit for nourishment, yet mingled with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that nourish, we find it gains a nourishing condition.</p>
               <p>I answer to the Confirmation,<note place="margin">Answer to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</note> That it is true that Meats and Drinks can indeed be converted into nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no where but in the stomach

               </p>
               <p>If then <hi>Plato</hi> forbad young men to drink wine, because by its heat it fils their brains with vapours, and with many hot fumes, and over-heats their bodies, and not only hurts the body, but doth exceedingly hurt the soul by the use of it, as <hi>Galen</hi> saith, 1. <hi>Sanitat.tuend.</hi> Wine must not be given to young men, because it makes them prone to anger and to lust, and makes the rational part of the soul dull and out of temper; and doth not the smoke of Tobacco do this farre more? Wine is hot and moist, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco is hotter than wine, and that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58030:33"/>
excess is the cause of its strong smell, and corroding taste: moreover in place of moisture of the Wine, the heat of it is joyned with driness. He that hath only tasted of natural Philosophy, may easily perceive from hence, that it is a thing full of danger for Colerick Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and disposeth them to burning Feavers, Hecticks, and Frensies, and brings them into unseasonable Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly: For the unnatural heat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the natural heat of the body, destroyes and wastes that, as I said, and by the same means ingenders a Melancholy distemper, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual use of it. Hence it is, that the dry and hot choler is afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed; but this is done by degrees, and insensibly in the younger age and also by reason of the frequent drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Beer, (for our Tobacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists use to do so) and this hinders that the alteration cannot be so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly made. <hi>Galen de sanitat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

mind, to follow the temperament of the body. Which thing, though it be principally to be understood of that Original temperament which we received from our Parents: Yet as that is changed either naturally by age, or accidentally by sucking to much smoak of Tobacco, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther external meanes, so a great change of the affections and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind useth to go along with it; and as heat and acrimony grow and dwell in the blood, so rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and fury do in the soul.</p>
               <p>The Blood being now made thick and congealed, the mind grows stupid and sad; and in some men this is too apparent, though others do prudently dissemble and cover it. Wherefore I cannot see how that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch drawing of smoak of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baceo to the brain and nostrils can be done, but it must overthrow the perfect state of mens bodies and minds, the proportions of the cold elements being subdued, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto heat; being spoile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in their Posterity also; since the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and constitutions of the Parents are naturally passed over unto the Children: and withall, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind that depend upon them. For saith the learned <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58030:35"/>
he shews afterwards in few words, by what helps Art can perform this; namely, by a three fold Caution laid down by Art. One in a due Administration of Meats and Drinks, in the quantity, quality, substance; manner, order, and measure and time of them: Not neglecting in the mean while, the occasion of the place, which is another Caution to take heed of Corruption. The third is in forbidding and forbearing those things, which since they can natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hurt life, they do in a short time dissolve the radical moisture, and so they cut off life in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such are watchings, cares, griefs; also the use of things that vehemently heat and dry, whence of necessity at length (for want of convenient food) the natural heat is extinguished, and the native moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: And so we die by wasting and consuming away. <hi>Galen de Tabe,</hi> saith,<note place="margin">What is <hi>Tabes.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By these things mentioned, it is easie to collect, that the smoak of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58030:35"/>
Tobacco shortneth mens daies. For being that our native heat is like to a flame, which continually feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on natural moisture, as a Lamp lighted, drinks up the Oyl by its heat; it follows necessarily, that for want of food, life must needs fly away quickly, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subject of life is dissipated and consumed: for with that moisture, the imbred heat fails also, and death succeeds.</p>
               <p>You understand therefore (that are Tobacconists) that the sooty fumes of Tobacco, wherein you are wallowing (as it were) in the deepest mire, are of great force to shorten your daies. <hi>Galen</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of opeing Medicaments, asserts, that by the frequent use of them, the solid parts of the body are dried,<note place="margin">1. <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic fimp. facul.</hi>
                  </note> and that the blood grows gross and clotted, which being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Reines, breed the stone. The same thing may be truly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained concerning Tobacco, which many use too frequently, and more then any do use those kind of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicaments; for this is more
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58030:36"/>
hot and dry then they are, and therefore is more forcible to hurt sound and well tempered bodies. Take warning therefore you that love Tobacco, that you do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in using too much of it, and enslave your selves to this fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous smoak, by hunting after it, and making a god of it.

               <p>To answer the former argument that is against it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> observe that it is very necessary to consider, for the use of this remedy, what the temper of the brain is as I said, and what the humour is that abounds in it, for if it be hot it will be much filled and burdned with the smoke of Tobacco, and the cause of this event lyeth in the heat of the part, (for heat natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attracts heat) and also in the largness of the passages of a hot head, whereby it easily admits the Vapours that ascend: but if the braine be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cold and moyst, and then heap

                  <note place="margin">Answer to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>These things premised, I answer to the contrary Argument, that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> in the quoted Aphorism, must be understood concerning those, who have a brain that is very hot and moist and weake withall, and that easily is offended with pain and heaviness. For a cold and moist brain filled with cold and moist Excrements, a hot and drying fume (such as is the smoke of Tobacco,) is most convenient, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially drawn in by a Pipe the way I mentioned before. Yet I think they ought to abstain from it, whose heads are not only weak, but are also of a delicate nature, and are easily disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ep and pain'd not only with fumes but with the most temperate smels.</p>
               <p>Here follows another question,<note place="margin">
                     <p>Another question whether the smoke if Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed into the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach can bring forth su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous moisture of the Brain.</p> 
                     <p>The affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative part.</p>
                  </note> namely whether the fume of Tobacco swallowed into the Stomach (which custome I find to be in continuall use
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58030:43"/>
with many men, but chiefly amongst our Sea men) can draw and purge superfluous humours out of the head and brain?</p>
               <p>Reasons are very forcible for the affirmative part. The first is taken out of the 7. Aphorisme, 30. of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> who say thus; <hi>Whosoever they be that in a diarrhaea void frothy excre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments by stool, those excrements flow from the head,</hi> and from thence it is inferred that humours may be drawn from the head to the stomach by the faculties of purging medicaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing derived by the tunnel. The second is taken from <hi>Actuarius, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sues,</hi> and other approved Authours<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Argument for the Negative part is,<note place="margin">For the negative part.</note> because according to <hi>Aristo</hi> 1. <hi>Sect. Probl. Quest.</hi> 42. When medicaments come to the belly, and are resolved, they are presently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Veins by the same way that the meat is, and when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58030:44"/>
be concocted, but remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, they slip back again, and carry with them those things that stay by them,<note place="margin">How purging is made.</note> and that is called purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And from the stomach to the brain or brest, there are no passages found whereby a purging medicament can passe to allure the humours to it: Therefore the humour that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the brain or thorax, cannot be drawn forth by the fume of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, as by a purgative medicament, which opinion also of <hi>Aristotle</hi> the most Learned <hi>Fernelius,</hi> 3. <hi>Meth.</hi> c 7. seems to defend.</p>
               <p>Note therefore for the resolving of this difficulty, that the more corpulent substance of this fume doth not pass from the stomach to purge the brain, but stayeth in it, or sticks in the Intestins, and from thence it draws forth those humours that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to it, which may be proved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> many waies. First, because medicaments applyed outwardly, as to the Navel, &amp; therefore called Navel-medicaments, to the palme of the hand, or to the soles of the feet, and sometimes applyed to the Nostrils will purge the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58030:44"/>
body, and yet they cannot proceed so far as to purge the humours. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Because we often observe that medicaments and pils are voided almost whole, after purgation, which could not be if they passed all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy over, to draw unto them such hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours as are familiar to them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>Serapiows</hi> argument proves the same, for saith he, if a medicament should pass to a humour, that is farre off from it, it would joyn lovingly with it, and would never draw forth that it delights in the society of; as the Loadstone joyned to the Iron, doth not draw the iron to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, but detains and holds it there. Wherefore we must confesse that some thin fumie substance doth rise from the stomach, by the veins and other secret passages, not only to the brain, but also is diffused, we cannot say how, to all parts of the body.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>Those things being thus observed we answer to the difficulty, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives do not pass through the body to attract humours that agree with them, but they stay in the stomach, and by their force and Vertue they draw them unto them from all parts of the body by waies, that though they are unknown to us, yet they are not unknown to nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Another question whether the Brain can be dried, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioerity.

               <p>For the Negatiue part, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this; Because the great or small quantity of the humour of the whole body, follows the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contracted from the first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Since therefore the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament belongs to the whole living Creature, and not to one part alone, the humour cannot be dried up in the brain nor in any other part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but it must also be dried up in the whole body.</p>
               <p>Now that the temperament must be ascribed to the whole body, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58030:45"/>
not to one part only, is proved from the 1. and 3. Books of <hi>Hippocrates Epidem. From the grayness of the eyes, sharpness of the voyce, and black haire,</hi> you may conclude that the temperament of the whole body is either hot or cold; as if one part could not be hot or cold, but the whole body must be so also.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Galen</hi> is for the contrary part,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part.</note> 2. <hi>de temper.</hi> c. <hi>ult.</hi> where he proves by many arguments, that it is not necessary tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all the parts of the body should follow the temper of the whole. For though in a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate body and very well constituted an equall temper may be found over all the body, but in others that are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from this exquisite temper and just dispensation, it cannot be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally true; for a man may have a large brest and full of haire, and therefore like a Lion have a most hot heart, and be exceeding bold; yet it follows not that all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his body over must be so hot. So we find daily (to pass by other examples) that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men have hot livers, and yet cold brains, and the contrary in others,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58030:46"/>
that it is no wonder that if one man who hath the rest of his veins of his body swelling forth, have the veins of his head and brain after a sort dried up. For <hi>Galen</hi> addes that this may be done, and that the excess of Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in one part, may be the cause of the contrary excess in the rest, and make them weak, or the strength of one part may be answered by the strength or weakeness of another.</p>
               <p>To answer the contrary argument; when <hi>Hippocrates</hi> collects from the colour of the eye or sharpness of the voice,<note place="margin">Answer to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note> what is the temperament of the whole body, this may be taken, as if he did search for the same things in the equall temperament of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereof he finds some tokens in the parts; or he may be understood thus, when other signs in the whole body concurre to signifie the same. For example, if there be signs of heat in the whole body, and a great voyce and large brest be joyned with them, it is evident by these signs that the whole body is hot: which must also be understoode concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the brain, and other parts,

Whence divine <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 2. <hi>Aphorism.</hi> 50. speaks thus. <hi>Those things that we are accustomed to, though they be worse; yet they do us less harm, than those that we are not used to, and therefore we must use what we are wonted to.</hi> This is a most true axiome and cannot be contradicted; For all things that are accustomed, as they are so, are less hurtfull than things we are not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to: for by custome things that are worse are made familiar to nature, and therefore are not dangerous. For what nature is acquainted with, is wont to be harmless. Custome is of such consequence, that from that in preserving of health or curing of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58030:47"/>
diseases we may have great indication, and not much less than we can from nature, as both <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> intimate in many places. For since nature alwaies delights in what it is used to, (as <hi>Galen</hi> saith, 8. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</hi>) it is certain that every one ought to keep his custome: for from custome as well as from nature and age, great conclusions may be made. Since then <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that we must hold to what we are wonted to; what a great danger would it be to leave off this custome which is confirmed by so many years, as this is to smoke Tobacco, in a Pipe at the Mouth and Nostrils, and to change this to a contrary way, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be done suddenly or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, as I am perswaded all men can easily perceive? Whence <hi>Celsus</hi> also speaks, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>He is in danger who both once, and he that twice eats in a day contrary to his usuall custome? Again, sudden ease from violent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and sudden labour from great ease cannot be safe.</hi> When therefore any man thinks to leave off this drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tobacco for a time, he must
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58030:47"/>
not rashly nor suddenly change this custome, for it is almost as strong as nature. Therefore they who use to smoke it, easily bear it, and they that are not used to it cannot so well away with it. Custome makes not only healthfull things to be usefull for us, but also it makes those things healthfull, which were they not accustomed to us, would be the most dangerous. For it is of such force that it overcomes the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of any thing taken, and which is more to be wondred at, the very violence and virulency of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is conquered by it, and it spoils them of their malignity; so I read of a maid that was fed with Wolfs-bane, and in time by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees shee used it for her nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Galen,</hi> 3. <hi>simpl.</hi> c. 18. speaks of an old woman of <hi>Athens,</hi>

The way to dry them is this; run a threed through the fairest Leaves of Tobacco, and those that are moderarely large, and hang them in the shade, in the roof of a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where neither the Sun, nor Fire, nor Wind may come at them. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers shew us another way to keep them any time of the year. Put the dry Leaves of Tobacco into a Viol full of Oyl of Olives; and when you will use them, power off the Oyl, and wiping the Leavs with a thin Linnen Cloth, use them as if they were now gathered.</p>

thus.<note place="margin">The first way.</note> Calcins Tobacco, dissolve the Calx, strain, filtrat, evaporate it; there will be a Salt which will do no harm in a Caustick, and not so Corrosive in dissolving malignant Ulcers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is the common way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Salt from all Vegetables. Burn the Herb in the fire, the place being swept clean with Brooms (some first set it in the Sun, others dry it in the shade) let it burn untill it stick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a lump: Or if you proceed further to burn it, to burn it to ashes, you shall have more Salt. Put the ashes into a glazed earthen Pot, and pour fair water upon them, and let it seeth some hours at the fire; pour it forth into another Vessell, and when the dregs are setled, strain it through a linnen cloath; set the strained liquour at an easie fire with few Coles, that the water may eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and the Salt remain in the bottom.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Another way.</note>The next way is more curious. Burn the dried Herb in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What is filtrated, must be evaporated at an easie fire, in a Glass Vessell, and the salt will remain at the bottom clear and pure.</p>
            <p>The third way is the most exact:<note place="margin">The third way.</note> Gather the Herb green, and bruise it, distill the water of it by a Limbeck, calcine the faeces at a moderate fire, the Vessell being stopt, untill they come to ashes. Let the fire be gentle, that it may not consume the proper and radical moisture of the Plant, for that will make it run to glass; pour the water upon the earth of it, and it will thirstily devoure it: Digest it in Horse dung, or in a Bath some daies. Pour it out as before, that it be not mingled with the faeces, then filtrat it, lastly evaporate what is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. These are the various waies
