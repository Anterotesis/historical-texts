         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there was a Force put upon
the Parliament on the twelfth

Messenger to your Lordship, to know
whether that force; doth continue; for I
am resolved by the Grace and Assistance
of GOD, as a true <hi>English-man,</hi> to stand
to and assert the Liberty and Authority
of PARLIAMENT; And the Army here
(praised be God) is very couragious and
unanimous, and I doubt not but to give
a good accompt of this Action to You.
I have, according to your Act of the 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>

You, that there may be a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

notice, that a part of the Army have
put force upon the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which they
so lately called together, and owned with the
greatest Testimonies of Obedience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for their former Apostacie from

That you will use your best Care, that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of this nature be suppressed. I do
therefore humbly intreat you that the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
may be speedily restored to that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which they enjoyed on the eleventh of

the Assistance of God, with this Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Command to Declare for them, and to

prosecute this just Cause to the last drop of my

Parliament, I having Authority as one of the
Seven Commissioners appointed by Act of
Parliament, Do constitute such as chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Consider how you will answer to the dreadful
God for the ruine of three Nations, for to
serve a lust, or to gratifie a passion: For my
particular, I am ashamed of these Confusions
and Changes that we have made, that we are
now become a scorn and a reproach to our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
friends, and designed to Ruine by all our
Neighbours. I take God to witnesse, that
I have no further ends then the establishing
of Parliamentary Authority, and those good
Lawes that our Ancestors have purchased
with so much bloud, the setling the Nations
in a free Commonwealth, and the defence of
Godlinesse and godly men, though of different
Iudgement; And I take my self so far obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
being in the Parliaments Service, to
stand, though alone, in this Quarrell, And
doubt not but your Lordship, having the fear
of God in your heart, will carefully consider
of this matter: Which is all at present from</p>
