         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

First to incite other men of

<hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who wrote exact Commentaries
(adorned of late with obseruations of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
man of our Nation) of such militarie acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as happened vnder his commaund. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to preuent least such worthy paines
<pb facs="tcp:20847:3"/>
should either perish, or hereafter be set forth by
others as their own: a thing too much practised
by some, not of meanest note. Lastly, to make
this a meane of drawing the residue into light,
which happely sleepeth in the custodie of some
other man. This doe I presume to present to
your Honour; as well in regard of the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
estimation which still remaineth of the
Authour, as for the worthinesse which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
to be in the Worke. For all of vs doe well
discerne both the lustre of many excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in your own noble spirit, and how you
fauour men of valour, learning, or honest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour:
which vertues, as they haue aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

make your memorie eternally to flourish.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit in all Histories three things
are especially required, Order,
Poyse and Truth: yet for diuers
causes it hapneth that in many,
one of these doth faile.</p>
            <p>For some haue written of
times so anciently past, that no
means are extant, either to <hi>direct</hi>
or to <hi>correct</hi> them. Many of these liuing in Artlesse
ages, haue stuffed their Stories with most senselesse fictions;
nothing better then country womens tales. Of this sort was
<hi>Hunibaldus,</hi> who fableth that the French tooke their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
from <hi>Francio</hi> a Troian: and is followed in his sotteries
by <hi>Gregorie</hi> of <hi>Tours, Rheginus, Sigebert,</hi> and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the same suite. After this example <hi>Geoffry</hi> of
<hi>Munmouth</hi> about 400 yeares since, did first (as some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme)
draw the originall of the <hi>Britans</hi> from <hi>Brutus</hi> the
<hi>Troian:</hi> forging such races, names, reignes and passages of
affaires, as may more easily be conuinced to be false, then sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with any certaine truth. Of the same streine is <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikind;</hi>
who by his counterfeit <hi>Saxo,</hi> hath drawen the <hi>Saxons</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20847:4"/>
and first Inhabitants of <hi>Germanie,</hi> from the olde Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Souldiers of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. So the <hi>Scots</hi> set
vp <hi>Scota</hi> daughter to <hi>Pharao</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
of their Nation. Likewise the <hi>Irish</hi> hatched their
<hi>Hiberus,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> their <hi>Danus,</hi> the <hi>Brabants</hi> their <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi>
the <hi>Gothes</hi> their <hi>Gothus,</hi> as founders both of their
Nation and name: a subiect wherein forgeries may range
at large; because the first times of Nations for the most part
are, as very small, so altogether obscure. Of this sort among
the ancients were <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and
<hi>Theopompus:</hi> in whose Bookes <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, many idle
vntruthes are found; euen so farre as the vaine veine of
the <hi>Graecians</hi> durst aduenture to aduowe for truthes. In
how many places (saith <hi>Iosephus</hi>) is <hi>Hellanicus</hi> charged
with falsities by <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> and by <hi>Ephorus?</hi> they by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus?
Timaeus</hi> by many who followed? <hi>Herodotus</hi>
by all?</p>
            <p>Others haue written of Countries farre distant, either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
vnknowen, or by them neuer seene: who writing
vpon vulgar reports, things either imagined, or erroneously
obserued, are easily entangled with vntruthes. Of this fault
<hi>Era<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>osthenes, Possidonius</hi> and <hi>Patrocles</hi> the Geographer
are branded by <hi>Strabo.</hi> Hence also did rise the fables of the
<hi>Arimaspes, Gryphons, Troglodites, Amazons, Satyrs,
Pigmies,</hi> and of their cruell warres with Cranes: of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men with dogs heads, with horse feete, without heads,
without mouthes, with one foote wherewith they couer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
against Sun and raine, and of diuers other monstrous
kinds of men, beasts &amp; fowles, which now are discouered for
vtopicall Aperies. With these may <hi>Stephanus</hi> &amp; <hi>Arianus</hi> be
ioyned; of whom the one writeth, that the French are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Italie;</hi> the other placeth the <hi>Germanes</hi> neere to the
<pb facs="tcp:20847:4"/>
               <hi>Ionick</hi> sea. So <hi>Strabo</hi> choppeth, that the riuer <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et</hi>
or <hi>Danowe,</hi> hath his spring neere to the <hi>Adriaticke</hi>
sea: and that the riuers <hi>Lapus</hi> and <hi>Vezer,</hi> discharge
themselues into the riuer <hi>Enis;</hi> whereas the one runneth
into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the other into the <hi>Ocean.</hi> So are <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,
Marcellus, Orosius, Blondus,</hi> in diuers places of
<hi>Germanie</hi> much mistaken. And so <hi>Sabellicus, Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrane,</hi>
and <hi>Conrade,</hi> doe much confound the <hi>Alans</hi>
and <hi>Almans;</hi> the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Hunnes;</hi> the
<hi>Danes</hi> and the <hi>Dace; Austerane,</hi> and <hi>Austrich;</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the mount Saint <hi>Ottoly</hi> in <hi>Bauaria,</hi> and the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaean</hi>
mountaines in <hi>Polonia,</hi> or <hi>Muscouia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others haue written of their owne countries and
times: but these againe are of diuers sorts. For some
busie themselues much in those things which the popular
multitude doe applaud: making <hi>wordie</hi> (I cannot say
<hi>worthy</hi>) reports of Beare baitings, lanching of shippes,
fleas, mice, owles, maskes, mayings, &amp;c. And if they
speake of any publicke affaires, they discerne nothing but
the out-side: not vnlike to beggars, who trauerse ouer
many Countries, from dore to dore, and touch as many
faire buildings; but obserue nothing either of the persons,
or furniture, or order within. Such Historians doe daily
and duely attend certaine Kings in <hi>India:</hi> And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they doe, whether eate, drinke, sleepe, disport,
ease nature, retyre to any woman; In a word, <hi>All,</hi> they
barely wright downe, and nothing else.</p>
            <p>Some others better furnished with iudgement, doe
strongly biasse in their affections: and that chiesty by two
meanes, <hi>leuitie</hi> and <hi>partiality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the first sort are they who affecting to write ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:20847:5"/>
pleasingly then truely, doe enterlace many ieasts,
conceits, tales, and other pleasing passages; either omitting
or defacing the solide truth. Of this fault <hi>Trebellius</hi> is
reprooued by <hi>Laberian</hi> and <hi>Vopiscus, Tacitus</hi> by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
and <hi>Orosius, Orosius</hi> by <hi>Blondus.</hi> To these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
wee may adioyne <hi>Danudes, Philostratus, Guidius,
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esias, Heca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aeus,</hi> and diuers others; who haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the truth of many things into fabulous inuentions
of their owne.</p>
            <p>Of the second sort are they who vpon hate, feare, or
fauour, either to some persons, or to their natiue countrey,
or to the religion which they professe, or for some other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
respect, doe write Panegyrickes or Inuectiues, rather
then Histories. So <hi>Salust</hi> writeth, that the acts of the
<hi>Graecians</hi> are much admired: not because they exceede
the Atchieuements of other men, but because their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
hauing wit at will, did much enlarge them aboue the
truth. Of this fault <hi>Blondus</hi> and <hi>Sabellicus</hi> are noted
in their Histories of <hi>Venice: Paulus Aemilius</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine</hi>
in their Histories of <hi>France:</hi> and most others
in the Histories of their owne Countries. Who extoll,
depresse, depraue immoderately; making things seeme
not as they are, but as they would haue them; no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
almost then Comedies and Tragedies are fashioned by
their Authours.</p>
            <p>Amongst those fewe who haue written with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
iudgement, and sincerity, the Authour of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
is worthy to be ranged: who doubtlesse was of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
industry; alwaies in action, either with his sword,
or with his penne. He was well knowen to be a man, who
both knew and durst: his courage no lesse free from indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
<pb facs="tcp:20847:5"/>
then from feare. Yet hath hee wrote so modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of himselfe, that some may happelie esteeme him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a looker on, then a medler, in the hot medlies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he doth write: but his attributing so little to himselfe,
will make others attribute the more vnto him. In wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of others hee expresseth a most generous disposition;
neither forbearing the errours of his friends, nor forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the vigilancy and valoure of his enemies; but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
himselfe with an euen hand betweene them.</p>
            <p>Touching the Historie it selfe, it is faithfull and
free; wherein are found sieges, assaults, surprizes, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes,
skirmishes, battailes, liuely described. Great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
both of persons and of actions; much mutability
of fortune, many changes in affaires. Admirable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices,

by two sorts of people;
Captaines and Clergie. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

so doth the Clergie to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

               </note> By these meanes, the ambition of the Duke
<hi>D'Alua,</hi> of Cardinall <hi>Granuill,</hi> and their seconds, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the king to vndertake to subdue the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> to
his pleasure; to lay vpon them such gables, taxes, and
all manner of tributes as should please the King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
But this they could neuer effect without making
away their warlike and politike Nobilitie; namely, the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Counts of <hi>Egmond,</hi> of <hi>Horne,</hi> of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20847:7"/>
               <hi>Battenburgh,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Brederode,</hi> the Marquesse of
<hi>Bergues,</hi> with diuers others of good qualitie. Besides,
they had a great number of strong Townes, innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
treasure and riches; the seate of the most of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
being meruailous strong by nature, by reason of
their great riuers and streights, furnished plentifully with
Artillerie, munition, and other necessaries for warres.
Also t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eir liberties were such, that no stranger might go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
either their Prouinces, or any of their Townes.
And this grieued the Spanish not a little, that such base
people as they esteemed the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> to be, should
possesse peaceably such a braue and rich Countrie, and
their King carrie no other title than Duke, Count, and
Lord ouer their seuenteen Prouinces.<note place="margin">Duke <hi>D' Aluaes</hi> commission.</note> Herevpon the king
resolued to send his great Captaine Duke <hi>D' Alua</hi> with a
mightie army, giuing him commission to alter place and
displace whome, and as many as pleased him, as well in
their prouinces in generall, as in any particular Towne.
Also giuing him authority to execute as many as pleased
him, without respect of persons. This being discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <note place="margin">The intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range.</hi>
               </note> from a Gentleman Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundian
of the Kings Chamber (who was greater with
one of the Kings Secretaries wiues, than with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band)
by reason of the Spanish long counsailes in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,
it came in good time to the Prince, long before
the Dukes troupes marched from <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Italie.</hi> In
the meane time the Prince animated the people all hee
could against the Spanish, making diuers of his assured
friends acquainted with his intelligences;<note place="margin">His policie,</note> but durst not
trust Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> fearing his ambition and choler
would marre all. Notwithstanding considering his vogue
and greatnesse with the men of warre, hee durst attempt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20847:7"/>
nothing without him. Wherefore politickely the Prince
fed both parties, assured the Gouernesse the Dutchesse of
<hi>Parma,</hi> of his loyalty towards the King and his religion:
but in troth he was of the Protestant religion, fauouring
them what he could vnder hand; so much, that hee and
his instruments procured the people in great numbers to
present supplications openly to the Gouernesse, for the
libertie of their consciences. Likewise diuers Papists and
Martinists presented her with supplications, to perswade
the king to stay his Duke <hi>D' Alua</hi> and his armies: shewing
her plainly that it was against their liberty and customes,
that strangers should gouerne them. In this time the
Prince and his instruments animated a quarrell betwixt
Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> and Card. <hi>Granuill;</hi> so as after a banquet
at <hi>Brussels,</hi> vpon a dispute with multiplying of words, the
Count tooke the Cardinall a boxe on the eare,<note place="margin">Cardinall <hi>Granuill</hi> taketh a boxe vpon the eare.</note> to the

was so ambitious, that hee thought it his due to bee

Country would vndertake (I meane among the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>)
without comparison he deserued it. He was most
valiant, most liberall, and greatly fortunate in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Amongst the rest of his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the chiefe praise of the
battaile of S <hi>Quintins,</hi> and of <hi>Grauelin</hi> belonged to this
Count.<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> fauour, popular.</note> Notwithstanding the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> carried
all the vogue amongst the popular, by his fine and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
gouernment; and wanne a number of men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
with great courtesies &amp; affable discourses: Insomuch
that these two Chiefes being ioyned, would haue carried
all the Countrey in general to haue done what they had
listed. After this disgrace, the Cardinall very politickly
shewed neither choler nor minde to reuenge, but rather
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20847:8"/>
sought all meanes vnder-hand to stay the Count from
proceeding further with the Prince; and both hee and
the Gouernesse procured lotters from the King, with
great speed to that end. In which letters were contained,
that nothing should be done in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as wel by
Duke <hi>D' Alua,</hi> as by his base sister the Gouernesse,<note place="margin">The Kings letters.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Counts consent; and to repose all trust in the
Count onely for martiall affaires. The King wrote also
vnto the Count, assuring him, that nothing should bee
too deare for him; and that his great seruice should not
be forgotten, but recompenced to the highest degree:
Shewing him, how all these stirres proceeded from the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and his instruments, to ouerthrow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to maintaine his estate and greatnesse. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
they sent counterfeit letters vnto the Count, as
though the Prince or his faction had certified the King
often aginst the Count to his disgrace. Before these posts
arriued, the Prince or his instruments had procured the
Count, and all or most of the Nobility with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of quality, to meet at <hi>Tilmount</hi> in <hi>Brabant:</hi> where,
after a great banquet, most of them signed a letter to the
King, rather to dye than to suffer the gouernment to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This letter was written very humbly to perswade
his Maiestie to stay his Duke <hi>D' Alua,</hi> assuring him to be
loyall in all poynts: desiring his Maiesty to remember
their liberties and customes, which his Maiesty was
sworne to maintaine in as ample manner as his ancestors
before. At this banquet all signed these letters, sauing
the Count <hi>Peter Ernest</hi> of <hi>Maunsfelt,</hi> gouernour of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enburgh,</hi>
and the Lord of <hi>Barlemount,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

promised to doe the like the next morning: excusing
themselues, that at that instant the wine was their master.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20847:8"/>
But at midnight they stole post towards <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi>
excusing themselues by letters vnto the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
that Count <hi>Egmond</hi> would be deboshed from them by
the Spanish instruments; and that they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
the contray, vntill they heard that his person and
men of warre were in battaile against the Spanish. It
seemes <hi>Peter Ernest</hi> was willing to second them, for hee
left his sonne Count <hi>Charles</hi> as deepe as the best. They
had reason to feare the Count, for the next day he began
to repent him of his bargaine;<note place="margin">Count <hi>Egmond</hi> repenteth.</note> taking occasions to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
and to stirre factions against the Prince. But the
Prince politickly courtesied him with all fauours, in such
sort,<note place="margin">Is pacified.</note> that all fell in a banquet the next dinner; at which
feast, according to their custome, there was great carow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
where the basest sort came in great multitudes with
glasses in their hands, crying to the Prince, Count, &amp; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<hi>Viue les gueses, viue les gueses, le diable emporte les

               <hi>God saue the beggers, and the diuell take the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
After ending the banquet, the Prince procured
many of the Nobility and of the best sort, to promise to
second him in the action he would vndertake against the
Spanish.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Egmond</hi> offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> This being discouered vnto Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> he

to bee much offended with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
and his faction, and withall departed toward <hi>Louaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, all murthers are villanous;<note place="margin">Charles Mauns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felts <hi>councell concerning</hi> Egmond.</note> but had the
Prince credited Count <hi>Charles Mansfelt,</hi> Count <hi>Egmond</hi>
had beene dead. I heard the Prince relate his counsaile,
which was; <hi>Let vs kill Count Egmond, then are we sure all
the men of warre will follow you and yours. Also his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
is such amongst them, as at his reconcilement vnto the
Spanish, they will al follow him. But for feare of him my father
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20847:9"/>
and all the rest would ioyne with you.</hi> True it is, this young
Gentleman was the wilfullest amongst them, but spake
the grearest reason to maintaine the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
as it fel out afterwards: for without doubt the reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> lost himselfe and all his friends.
Long afterwards in <hi>Fraunce</hi> I heard Count <hi>Charles</hi> speak
this, &amp; also how he would haue wished the Prince after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to haue marched with all his forces vnto the edge
of <hi>Louain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To take the streights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Duke <hi>D' Alua.</hi>
               </note> there to haue kept the streights betwixt <hi>Louain</hi>
&amp; <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> where Duke <hi>D' Alua</hi> must pass without all
doubt. With the fauour of God, had the Prince &amp; Count
<hi>Egmond</hi> marched thither with their forces, by all reason
they might haue fought with twice Duke <hi>D' Aluaes</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
For there were foure thousand braue Lanciers and
light horsemen vnder their charge, ready alwayes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
besides as many more who would haue moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselues most willingly,<note place="margin">The forces of the <hi>Lowe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi>
               </note> with at least twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
footemen against the Spanish and the Prince, had
they made away the obstinate Count. Besides, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Neatherlanders</hi> is to be very willing to second
any nouelties; much more against a people they hated so
much as the Spanish, whose forces and policies were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
to them at their beginning. Being as high as
<hi>Lovaine,</hi> they had bin sure all the Countries and Townes
behinde them, would haue seconded them with all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
For the humour of the Nation is to bee vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

from the King to dissemble his disgrace

perswaded all the rest to forsake their Prince, assuring
them that hee would vndertake to make all well againe
with the King; in such sort, that most of the Nobilitie
quited the Prince.<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> seeketh conference with <hi>Egmond.</hi>

And this he will not faile to execute to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most;
which he can neuer doe, and suffer vs to liue, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

they who send him with such directions, know your
courage to be too great to endure your Countrimen to
bee made slaues, and to suffer him to wash his hands in
your kinsmens bloud. Beleeue my words, it is true what
I tell you; for there you see his hand, whom diuers of
you know to be in good credite with the King, especially
with his principall Secretary. And herewith hee cast his
letter with other testimonials amongst them, telling the
Count. Cousin resolue on it, if you take armes, I wil ioyne
with you; if not, I must leaue you and quite the Country.</p>

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:20847:10"/>
After pawsing a while, the Count answered. Cousin, I

to iudge the King a tyrant, without proofe of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
he cannot be so vngratefull to recompence our serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

of his predecessors before him haue done. For your selfe,
if it please you to stay, I dare adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture my credit to make

               </note> During these treaties

would bee in armes, sometimes before the Gouernesse

&amp; defacing of Images in many places; Insomuch,
that the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Martinists</hi> drew them of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of <hi>Antwerpe.</hi> Notwithstanding, they gathered

               </note> called <hi>Osterwell;</hi>
where they preached in great numbers: in such sort, that
the Gouernesse and all hers stood in doubt, whether it
were best to hazard their defeate there, or to stay for
more forces. Being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered how they encreased daily,
resolution was taken to charge them where they were;
Intelligence being brought them, that the <hi>Papists</hi> and
<hi>Martinists,</hi> with a number of Souldiers did salie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
them. Notwithstanding they were voyde of any
men of conduct, or souldiers gaged vnder ensignes, or
Cornets; and all or the most Craftesmen, Mechanicks,
or poore peasants; yet they resolued to fight,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight.</note> making
head with good courage against their enemies. But for
want of heads to direct them, default of armes and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20847:11"/>
they were defeated in plaine field. Iudge you what
they would haue done being in the Towne of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi>
hauing with them a Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who had with him
continually two or three hundred Gentlemen, diuers of
charge and conduct. Besides, he was Gouernour of the
Towne, neuer without a good partie, so as the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and hers durst not lay hands on him; although they
knew him an enemy and a fauourer of the Religion.<note place="margin">Hee openly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth part with the Papists.</note> To
say truth, he cloaked it what he could; Insomuch, as all
their parties being often in armes in the great places, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
went to the strongest, which were the <hi>Papists</hi> and
<hi>Martinists:</hi> protesting to them to liue and dye with the
Gouerness &amp; religion. Without doubt his meaning was,
touching the Gouernesse, to be true to his Country, and
to liue and dye with the Religion. For amongst them of
the religion hee had diuers instruments, some of his best
Gentlemen and Captaines, who (God knowes) at that
time had but little skill in warres; notwithstanding they
were assured by them of his good will, in such sort that
they would haue marched often against the others,<note place="margin">Perswadeth the Protestants to quietnesse.</note> but
for the Princes perswasions to the contrary. Sometimes
he would tell them their enemies were more in number,
and in charging them they should ingage their Towne,
wiues, children, and goods: assuring them, if they
would goe forward, the basest sort would ransacke their
houses. Since I heard the Prince say, that if hee had
knowne the warres then so well, as he did since, he would
haue ranged on their sides: wishing then his valiant bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Count <hi>Lodowicke</hi> in his place. Pitie or feare ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the Prince often, as I will shew hereafter. Great

and neuer cruell vntill hee masters his enemie; then hee

must bee bloudy to execute, if hee cannot liue in safetie.
This order continued vntill the newes came that Duke
<hi>D' Alua</hi> was marching: Then it was high time for the

practise; which was, that the Prouost should vse all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

both, hee should doe the King and him great seruice.
Count <hi>Charles</hi> being aduertized of the match, vsed all
meanes possible to meet the Prouost at equall handes.
This Count was rather desperate then valiant in all his

about twenty horsemen; all or the most his owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.
The Count had about twelue, the most or all
Captaines and Souldiers. This encounter (God knows)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20847:13"/>
was farre against the Prouosts wil, considering the match.
For most men of iudgement in those affaires value sixe
chosen men well mounted, worth twenty ramassets, as
the brench tearme them. The Count (as of greatest cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage)
beganne to speake as followeth. Master Prouost,
I doe vnderstand Duke <hi>d' Alua</hi> commands you to bring
my father or my selfe vnto him, and that you gaue your
word you would doe it. All honest men ought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their words and promises, especially great Officers
of qualitie like your selfe. I must confesse you ought to
obey the Kings Lieuetenant, but not to make promise of
more than you are able to performe. You know my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
my selfe, and you, are neighbours children; and
kinsmen a farre of. Wherefore for all your small picke,
you might haue vsed the Duke with lesse assurance. But
to giue him and all his proude Spaniards to vnderstand
that a <hi>Netherlander</hi> carrieth as good resolution as any
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> and to terrifie such base fellowes as thou art
from the like attempt,<note place="margin">Killeth him.</note> there is for thee. And withall
strooke him with a pistoll in his bosome, downe from his
horse. Himselfe and his company mastering the rest, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
no more; all yeelding to his mercy. The Count
told them, vpon condition that some of you will tell
Duke <hi>d' Alua</hi> that I wished him here with his Prouost, I
giue you all your liues, and leaue to goe where you list.
Tell him also I am gone to the French King, and from
him to the Turke, rather then to yeeld to his mercie. The
Count being in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Goeth into <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </note> was greatly fauoured &amp; well vsed

misse rich spoyles at their first entry into the enemies
Countries. In my time I remember fower came to ruine
with those fortunes. Besides this, they did some other
matters about <hi>Zutphen, Ruremond,</hi> and those parts, by

But it proued to small effect. For alwaies the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the field commaund all weake places in a short

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20847:21"/>
must either be enriched presently with spoyles, or else as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by strong seats. But let the seate be neuer so strong,
the master of the field will command it in time, vnlesse it

being wooed and desired by his Master the French

In going with Count <hi>Lodowicke</hi> shee was assured,
that most or all which would goe with him, would bee

some frontier townes to the French for the Kings vse; if

These by the Admirals meanes were to second him

the matter well with diuers of the Religion, which were

And although the Prince were of the religion, his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20847:23"/>
promise was to grant liberty of conscience being victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
for which cause he carried many thousand hearts
more then he should haue done otherwise. In those daies
few of the popular were of the religion, but all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

made vnto them; when they would deuise any meanes,
they should be seconded to doe the Prince seruice, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

hee returned the one partie presently to their fellowes,

how Duke <hi>d'Alua</hi> gathered all the forces he could, with
great speed and preparations to besiege him presently;
he acquainted therewith them of the religion, and such

siege presented not, to deliuer them their armes againe:

with all their horsemen; to giue a camisado vnder the
conduct of Mounsieur <hi>de Roueres.</hi> Being met in one place,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Mendoza</hi> being lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

his horsemen in order, and gaue resolutely into <hi>Vitellies</hi>

this Camizado.<note place="margin">

souldier had left one of his best Captaines short of the
enemies quarter, with some three hundred of his best
shot, and a hundred and fiftie horsemen for his retreit;
which saued him and the most of his troupes. <hi>Mendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>
charged <hi>Roueres</hi> in such sort, that happie was he who
could returne first. Comming vnto his ambush, they pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
<hi>Mendoza</hi> and his horsemen with a salue of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebushes,
that turned them backe vpon the other: At
which instant the hundred and fiftie horsemen charged
them on their backes. By that time, <hi>Vitelly</hi> and the most

pursued no further. At this Camisado the enemie lost six

their guardes before the rest were in armes. The next

day toward night Duke <hi>d'Aluaes</hi> vantguard was in sight
of the Towne; but before his rereguard came to their
quarter it was nine of the clocke the next morning, by
reason they marched very slowly: and not without
reason. For they haled with them two and twentie
pieces of batterie, besides some other field pieces, with
all the munition belonging vnto them. Duke <hi>d'Alua</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arriued,<note place="margin">Duke <hi>D'Alua</hi> arriueth.</note> incamped on the riuer side betwixt the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
and the hills, from the wayes towards <hi>Valentia</hi>
downe to the Cloyster. Along this riuer he made strong
trenches,<note place="margin">Entrencheth himselfe.</note> which assured his armie towards the fields; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the towne he made large deepe trenches, impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be entred. This man would commonly assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with trenches, although the enemies were lodged
three dayes iourney from him. Now before <hi>Mounts</hi> hee
entrenched all his quarters, as though hee meant to bee
besieged; and not without reason, hauing intelligence
how Mounsieur <hi>Ianlis</hi> marched for their succours with
seauen thousand Frenchmen, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
making ready a mighty armie in <hi>Germany.</hi> After his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall,<note place="margin">Battereth the Cloyster.</note>
the next day hee prepared to beate the Cloyster;
vnto which place hee brought sixe pieces of Cannon.
Mounsieur <hi>de Poiet</hi> resolued before not to keep the place,
but to winne time in forcing them to place the Cannon.
This Cloyster was so neere the towne, that none could
encampe betwixt it and the towne, by reason of the
townes artillerie, and of wet meadow grounds which
could not be entrenched.<note place="margin">Payet abydeth one dayes bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by night.</note> Wherefore Mounsieur <hi>de Poyet</hi>
did most brauely abide this whole dayes batterie, and in
the night set the Cloyster on fire with a traine: and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
himselfe and his troupes safely into the towne, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
nothing behinde. Within few dayes Duke <hi>d'Alua</hi>
beganne to make his approaches, in such sort that hee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20847:27"/>
assured the towne from sallying (sauing their secret sallies
through the rampier &amp; bul-workes) before he mounted
his pieces to beate the forts and defences. The towne
plagued him greatly with their counter-battery: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
they often sallyed, and annoyed them with sundry
attempts on their artillery and trenches. With much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
after receiuing great losses, he made three platformes.
The middest did batter the port of <hi>Hauery;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Battereth the towne.</note> the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the flanks and parts of the Curtaines on both sides.
On these three platformes hee placed two and twentie
Cannons, with which, and with his Culuerins that did
beate the defences, he discharged during his siege aboue
24000. shot.<note place="margin">The furie of the batterie.</note> The furie of all batteries are past at the

Himselfe and some two hundred horsemen stoode at the
mouth of the great lane towards the breach; the rest of
his horsemen were in three troupes, making <hi>Patroiles</hi>
(rounds we call it) from place to place round about the
towne. As one troupe came vnto him, hee sent another
out. Mounsieur <hi>de la Noue</hi> stood with the armed men in
the midst of the halfe moone. Mounsieur <hi>de Poyet</hi> stood
on the one quarter of the moone, with halfe the shot.
Mounsieur <hi>de Roueres</hi> on the other with the rest. At e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
corner of the moone they placed diuers pieces of
Ordinance, laden with nayles, small bullets, and stones;
which flanked the mouth of tbe breach. <hi>Iulians</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
would not giue place one to another, more then
the Collonells, but by lot. After knowing who should
lead,<note place="margin">The assault.</note> and the breach discouered saultable, <hi>Iulian</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the poynt to the assault: which were suffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But being in the middest of the moone, they were
murdered like dogs; in such sort, that happie was hee

himselfe with the third; bringing them in his taile vnto

               <hi>Vitelly</hi> like a discreet Captaine, desired <hi>don Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derico</hi>

order that all the munition and victuals that might

that none should sally out of his trenches; giuing the

That night the Prince sent often diuers troupes vnto the
Dukes trenches, thinking to keepe his army in armes;
but none seemed to stirre, or to take an alarme. The next

For if the Prince and his armie had been in armes and in

his armie to runne: and perhaps by that meanes the
Prince might haue succoured the Towne. For without
doubt let two armies incampe one hard by another, the
first that discountenanceth his fellow, is in great hope of
victorie;<note place="margin">The retreite of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and his fine stratageme and speeches to escape from his mutinous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> or at least by all reasons to make his aduersarie

such sort, that the Prince was glad to vse all the policie he
could to retire; thinking the sooner the better, for feare
least his Reisters would grow to their olde custome, to
cry for <hi>gilt,</hi> which he had not. To preuentall mutinies, he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20847:31"/>
caused his officers &amp; many of his best instruments to giue
forth, that his brother Count <hi>Iohn</hi> was arriued with fiue
hundred Reisters by <hi>Ruremount;</hi> and with great treasure
(sufficient to pay all his forces for three moneths) from

And first hee did deliuer some pieces of gould vnto

kept; which could neuer bee without some garrison,

In those dayes the names of Souldiers were odious

there were no waies, or he knew of none. There were

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20847:44"/>
after our arriuall and skirmish, we marched to imbarke
our troupes;<note place="margin">The <hi>Flushing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> retire to their ships.</note> alleaging we wanted artillery &amp; munition,
with all other necessaries that belonged to a siege. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our imbarking, the olde souldiers Captain <hi>Gentoine</hi>
and <hi>Henrie</hi> the French-man vsed a fine stratageme.
They requested <hi>Saras</hi> and Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> to cause all
their ensignes to imbarke,<note place="margin">The ambush by the <hi>French</hi> Captaines.</note> with the baggage, and a good
number of souldiers; and to leaue in a Church, and in
a Church-yard, and in a great Close adioyning, the

day, to see if the enemie would sally, to cut off their
rere-guard and straglers. As they directed, <hi>Saras</hi> and
Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> placed one thousand two hundred of
their best men in that place; which was halfe wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our quarter and the imbarking place, about a
great league from the towne. Our ensignes were not

before their troupes, whereby all was marred. Belike
our armed men gaue them such sound blowes in the

this volley the enemie retired into their towne: and we

none could abide it. Neither could we ioyne with the

At this scalado Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> and <hi>Saras</hi>
serued very valiantly: he that escaped best of both, had
sundry Hagabushadoes on their armours and Camisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does.

Many young Gentlemen and Officers performed also
couragious seruice. Diuers were slaine and hurt: among
others one <hi>Bourege</hi> was taken by the enemy, whom
they commended greatly for his valour: but hee dyed
afterwards of his hurts in their hands. This attempt
so quailed our courage, that we despaired of the towne:

Also he could not bring many hands to fight in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;

of his Generall, fearing the towne to be in
greater wants, then indeed it was; resolued to passe,
and landed without resistance. Notwithstanding, he
lost in his passage neere two hundred. Besides, he and
his troupes were so wet and weary, that they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

they were murdered like dogges. The defendants had

they had done their breach. Another time they bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

they would lodge in it, left rampiring against their

making many trenches round about it, and placing
diuers barrells of powder in their myne, the enemies
offered to enter. The defendants quitted the bulwark,

Commendador Maior <hi>de Castilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a;</hi>
a souldier of great reputation
for counsaile, but no body for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution;
as the battaile of <hi>Lapanta</hi> could witnesse. For
this Commendador being chiefe Counceller to <hi>Don

being in the fight, he aduanced so slowly with a rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarde
of Gallies, that he nor his came to any blowes;
so as both there and in other places, alwaies the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendador
was reputed a coward. But belike in respect
of his wit and mildnesse, the King sent him into the
<hi>Lowe Countries;</hi> perhaps perswaded, that a milde Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
would winne the hearts of the people, farre better
with faire meanes, then Duke <hi>d'Alua</hi> with his cruelty.
But in troth, both King and Councell deceiued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
in calling away Duke <hi>d'Alua,</hi> and in making
choyce of such a Generall as the Commendador Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior.
For by all reason, if the Duke had beene royally
maintained as he ought; he had made his master abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
King ouer all the seauenteene Prouinces. To say
troth, furie and resolution well vsed or executed, had
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20847:64"/>
been the onely waies to supprsse that nation; the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
being resolued to subdue them, as they were. For
all other since, the witty politicke <hi>Neatherlanders</hi> did
alwaies ouer-reach the <hi>Spanish;</hi> especially hauing such
a head to direct them as the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

warres, and resolued to withstand the <hi>Spanish</hi> to
the vttermost, rather then to yeeld to any compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For whether the people bee strongly situated or

<hi>Granuill,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> with the aide of
