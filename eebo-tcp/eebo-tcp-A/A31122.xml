            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE of the Aſſignees of the Goldſmiths, FOR THEIR Intereſt granted to be paid out of the Hereditary Revenue of EXCISE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>IS Majeſty King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, having borrowed great Sums of Money of ſeveral Goldſmiths and others, did for ſatisfaction thereof, in <hi>April</hi> 1677. Grant, and Aſſure, by Patent under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to each of the ſaid Goldſmiths, their Heirs and Aſſigns, and for the Benefit of their Creditors, an yearly Rent for ever upon the Hereditary Revenue of Exciſe, equal in value to the Intereſt of their Debts, after the Rate of Six <hi>per Cent. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> with a Clauſe of Redemption, upon His Majeſties paying the Principal. That before the ſaid Letters Patents were Granted, the Goldſmiths Accompts were exactly ſtated, and examined with the greateſt ſcrutiny, by the Lord Treaſurer, Auditors and other Officers of the Exchequer, whoſe duty it was to be privy to, and inſpect the ſaid Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts; and after the ſaid Accompts were adjuſted and approved, The ſaid Letters Patents were granted: And by Order of the ſaid King, and the Lords of his Council, Copies thereof were ordered to be Printed and Publiſhed.</p>
            <p>The Creditors of the Goldſmiths taking notice of the Letters Patents, did deliver up their Bonds and Securities to the ſaid Goldſmiths, and did accept of Aſſignments from them, for their reſpective Intereſt payable out of the Hereditary Exciſe, which was quarterly paid for ſeveral years; and thereupon the Goldſmiths did Aſſign the far greateſt part of their yearly Rent.</p>
            <p>Since the ſaid Letters Patents were granted, the King having therein reſerved a Power of Redemption, hath paid ſeveral perſons their Principal and Intereſt; particularly <hi>Iſaac Legouch,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Chiffinch,</hi> Dr. <hi>Watſon,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>That in the Reign of the Late King <hi>JAMES,</hi> only Three Quarters Intereſt was paid; And afterwards by the Advice of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or other wicked perſons, amongſt other their Arbitrary proceedings, the Creditors aforeſaid were denied payment of what was juſtly due to them: And it is humbly conceived, that ſuch denial, and ſtoppage of payment of the ſaid Intereſt, is manifeſtly an Invaſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Subject, for the following Reaſons: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe the ſaid Letters Patents are Granted and Secured under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> which is the beſt Security our Kings can give to their Subjects; and by which their Majeſties have ever been Concluded and Boun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>By this Tenure, the whole Magiſtracy in Church and State hold their great Offices and the vaſt Emoluments thereof: All the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Companies of <hi>England</hi> enjoy their Franchiſes and Immunities, tho Granted to them many Ages ago. By this Security alone, the innumerable Purchaſes and Grants from the Crown, both Ancient and Modern, as well Abby Lands, as others, are held to this day without interruption: And the ſaid Security which the King hath given to the Goldſmiths and their Aſſigns for this Debt, is of the ſame validity with thoſe.</p>
            <p>The King did make this Settlement upon a valuable Conſideration of Money really lent to, and received by His ſaid Majeſty, from his Subjects; Which receipt of Money the King doth expreſly acknowledg and affirm in the ſaid Letters Patents; And therefore the King had an adequate and proportionable Compenſation for this Settlement, and ſo could not be deceived in His Grant.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Letters Patents were made in ſatisfaction for Moneys lent by the Subjects to the King upon the Credit and Invitation of a certain Statute-Law made in the 19th Year of His ſaid Majeſty's Reign, King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second: Intituled, <hi>An Act for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Orders in the Exchequer without Revocation.</hi> Wherein it is Enacted, That every Perſon, to whom any Moneys ſhall be due in His Majeſty's Exchequer, and that hath there any Order regiſtred for the payment thereof out of any branch of His Majeſty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, may aſſign his Right and Title in ſuch Order; And thereupon his Aſſignees ſhall be intitled to the benefit of ſuch order and payment thereon: And the Goldſmiths, and their Aſſigns, are within all the Qualification required in the ſaid Statute; And ſo the ſaid Settlement is purſuant to an Act of Parliament, and in maintenance of a Common Faith and Warranty given by the whole Nation for the ſatisfaction of this Debt; And therefore valid in Law. <hi>Which Law was revived in the late King</hi> JAMES<hi>'s Reign for Seven Years, as a good and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid Letters Patents were made for ſatisfaction of Money lent to the King by the Subjects upon the Security of Tallies ſtruck in the Exchequer, which is a good Security in that Caſe to the Subject by the Common Law; And ſo the ſaid Settlement is in affirmance of the Common Law of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Security is founded upon that part of the Exciſe which was granted by the Parliament to the King, His Heirs and Succeſſors: And therefore, as this Caſe is, The King might legally charge this Hereditary part of the Revenue in perpetuity, for ſatisfaction of the ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys ſo to him lent as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>By the expreſs limitation of the ſaid Letters Patents, the yearly Rent granted to the Goldſmiths, and their Aſſigns is to be paid to them without further Warrant, or without any Accompt, Impreſt, or other Charge.</p>
            <p>And by the ſaid Letters Patents the King hath expreſly covenanted for Himſelf, His Heirs and Succeſſors, That if at any time hereafter any Defect or Queſtion ſhould be found or made concerning the validity of the ſaid Letters Patents, That in ſuch Caſe the King, His Heirs and Succeſſors would make ſuch futher Grant, Aſſurance and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſaid Goldſmiths, their Heirs, and Aſſigns.</p>
            <p>But by the late Arbitrary and Illegal Denial of Juſtice, many thouſands have been, and will be undone, without ſpeedy Relief.</p>
