         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THEIR
Moſt Excellent Majeſties
WILLIAM
AND
MARY,
By the Grace of God,
King and Queen
OF
England, Scotland, France and Ireland;
Defenders of the Faith, &amp;c.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>May it pleaſe Your Majeſties,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Should not preſume to lay this Treatiſe
at Your Royal Feet, but that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
a Noble Kingdom, which is
one of the moſt conſiderable Branches of
Your Mighty Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:3"/>
It is of great Advantage to it, that it is a
<hi>Subordinate</hi> Kingdom to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
for it is from that Royal Fountain that
the Streams of Juſtice, Peace, Civility, Riches
and all other Improvements have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to it;<note place="margin">Campion 15.</note> ſo that the Iriſh are (as <hi>Campion</hi>
ſays) beholding to God for being conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:<note place="margin">Davis, 2.</note>
And yet <hi>Ireland</hi> has been ſo blind in this
Great Point of its true Intereſt, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
have managed almoſt a continual War
with the Engliſh, ever ſince the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
thereof; ſo that it has coſt Your Royal
Predeceſſors an unſpeakable Maſs of Blood
and Treaſure to preſerve it in due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>But no Coſt can be too great where the
Prize is of ſuch Value; and whoever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Situation, Ports, Plenty, and other
Advantages of <hi>Ireland,</hi> will confeſs, That it
muſt be retained at what rate ſoever; becauſe
if it ſhould come into an Enemy's Hands,
<hi>England</hi> would find it impoſſible to <hi>flouriſh;</hi>
and perhaps difficult to <hi>ſubſiſt</hi> without it.</p>
                  <p>To demonſtrate this Aſſertion, it is enough
to ſay, That <hi>Ireland</hi> lies in the <hi>Line of Trade,</hi>
and that all the Engliſh Veſſels that ſail to
the <hi>Eaſt, Weſt</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> muſt, as it were,
<hi>run the Gauntlet</hi> between the Harbours of
<hi>Breſt</hi> and <hi>Baltimore:</hi> And I might add, That
the Iriſh Wool being tranſported, would
<pb facs="tcp:65997:3"/>
ſoon ruine the Engliſh-Clothing-Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that all your Majeſties Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
have kept cloſe to this Fundamental
Maxim, Of retaining <hi>Ireland</hi> inſeparablely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> And though
King <hi>Henry</hi> II, may ſeem to deviate from this
Rule, by giving the Kingdom to his Son
<hi>John;</hi> yet this is to be ſaid for him, That
he thought the Intereſt and Expectations his
Son had in <hi>England,</hi> would be ſecurity enough
againſt his Defection; and the rather, becauſe
he could not then keep <hi>Ireland</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Aids and Supplies from hence: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this very Example was thought ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
that <hi>Ireland</hi> was never given away
ſince that time, except once by <hi>Henry</hi> the
Third, and then only to the <hi>Prince,</hi> who was
his Heir apparent, and on this expreſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>Ita quod non ſeparetur a Corona An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not mention that unaccountable
Patent to <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi>
and Duke of <hi>Ireland;</hi> not only becauſe there
was a Tenure by Homage reſerved, ſo that
it was not a total Alienation, and becauſe it
was but for Life, and <hi>cum mixto Imperio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
but chiefly becauſe it never took effect, ſo
that it was but <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbratilis Honor, &amp; cito
evanuit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:4"/>
But it is needleſs to tell your Majeſties,
That <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt not be ſeparated from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
or to ſolicit your ſpeedy Reduction of
that Kingdom, ſince the loſs of it is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
with Your <hi>Glory;</hi> and to ſuffer the
Ruin of four hundred thouſand Iriſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
meerly for their adherence to Your
Majeſties and their Religion, is inconſiſtent
with your <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, in Truth, the Recovery of <hi>Ireland</hi>
was not proper for Your Majeſty's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
until it became difficult beyond the
Hopes of others; any Body can do eaſie things,
but it is Your Majeſty's peculiar Talent to
atchieve what all the reſt of the World think
Impoſſible: Your Majeſty did ſo, in buoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up a ſinking <hi>State,</hi> and reſtoring it to a
more Glorious Condition than ever it was in
before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Your Majeſty did ſo again, in
retrieving from Ruine two expiring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
that were at their laſt Gaſp; and the
Recovery of the third, is all that remains to
conſummate your <hi>Glory,</hi> and make You the
Darling both of Fame and of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>And when that is done, <hi>Madam,</hi> the bright
Example of your Majeſty's Virtue and Piety
will influence that degenerate Nation to ſuch
a degree of Reformation and Religion, as
will reſtore that Kindgdom to its ancient Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,
and <hi>Ireland</hi> will again be called, <hi>Inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:4"/>
That Your Majeſty's Glorious Deſigns,
for the Advantage of <hi>England,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the Propagation of the
Proteſtant Religion, and for the Good of
Mankind, may be bleſſed with Succeſs, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

                  <p>SInce <hi>Ireland</hi> is reckoned among the Principal
Iſlands in the World, and deſerves to be
eſteemed ſo, (whether you conſider the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Country, the Number and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of its Harbours, the Fruitfulneſs of the
Soil, or the Temperature of the Climate); it is ſtrange
that this Noble Kingdom, and the Affairs of it,
ſhould find no room in Hiſtory, but remain ſo very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
that not only the Inhabitants know little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of what has paſſed in their own Country; but
even <hi>England,</hi> a Learned and Inquiſitive Nation,
skilful beyond compariſon in the Hiſtories of all other
Countries, is nevertheleſs but very imperfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the Story of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though it be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſubordinate to <hi>England,</hi> and of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to it.</p>
                  <p>This could never be ſo, if there were extant any
compleat or coherent Hiſtory of that Kingdom; which
indeed there is not, thoſe relating to the Times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conqueſt, being Fabulous; and thoſe ſince, but
Scraps and Fragments.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe Hiſtories that treat of the Times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Engliſh-Conqueſt, Doctor <hi>Keating</hi>'s is the
beſt, and is exceedingly applauded by ſome that did,
<pb facs="tcp:65997:6"/>
and others that did not know better:<note place="margin">Proſpect in Pref. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Peter Walſh</hi>
thinks 'tis the only compleat Hiſtory that we have of
all the Invaſions, Conqueſts, Changes, Monarchs,
Wars, and other conſiderable Matters of that truly
ancient Kingdom: But after all, it is no more than
<hi>an ill-digeſted Heap of very ſilly Fictions.</hi> And
<hi>P. W</hi>'s Proſpect, which is in effect the Epitomy of
<hi>Keating</hi> in Engliſh, with all the Art he could uſe
to poliſh it, will never paſs for more than an <hi>Utopian</hi>
Atchievement. And Mr <hi>Flaherty</hi>'s <hi>Ogigia</hi> muſt
expect the ſame Fate, though he has ſhewn a great
deal of Learning and Induſtry in methodizing the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and fitting a Table of Synchroniſm to it; which,
with ſmall Variation, might ſerve as well for the
Hiſtory of the <hi>Seaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thoſe Tracts that have been written of later
times, have moſt of them another Fault; they generally
write true, but not obſerving Chronology; they jumble
Times, Perſons and Things together, and ſo confound
the Story. Sir <hi>James Ware</hi> was the firſt that mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Error, and is undoubtedly the beſt Author that
has undertaken the Iriſh Hiſtory; but he has only the
four Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> VII, <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, <hi>Edward</hi>
VI, and Queen <hi>Mary. Campion</hi> and the reſt have but
a Scrap here and there, and that it ſelf very imperfectly.
And <hi>Camden</hi>'s Annals, Fryer <hi>Clun</hi>'s, and others,
that were moſtly collected by the Monks, are very faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and have no coherence; <hi>Spencer</hi>'s View of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is very well, and Sir <hi>John Davys</hi> his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is better; but both are Commentaries rather
than Hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>It muſt therefore follow, That an Entire and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt be very acceptable
to the World, and very uſeful to the People of
<hi>England,</hi> and the Refugees of <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:65997:6"/>
at this Juncture, when that Kingdom is to be
re-conquered; and perhaps Time may produce ſuch a
one. But as no Body was born a Man, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
increaſed from his Childhood, ſo you muſt not
expect all the Perfection in the firſt Edition, which
Time and better Information may produce in a Second.
In the mean time this Collection will give you ſuch a
Scheam and Idea of the Iriſh Affairs as will be uſeful
to you, till you can get a better. I will not pretend
this Collection is free from Miſtakes, no wiſe Man
will expect that, for be that Copies after others (as
Collectors of Hiſtories muſt do) cannot always be
ſure he writes Truth; <hi>Who is ſo Skilful</hi> (ſays
<hi>Cambden) that ſtrugling with Time, in the
foggy dark Sea of Antiquity, may not run
upon Rocks?</hi> And whoever writes an Iriſh Hiſtory,
muſt (to make Coherence) ſometimes, <hi>conjecturis
venari,</hi> as Sir <hi>James Ware</hi> ſays; But I aſſure
the Reader, There is no wilful Prevarications herein,
and that if I diſcover any Miſtakes at all, I will at
the End of the Book (or by new Sheets, which may
be bound up with it) publiſh the correction of ſuch
Miſtakes, as ſoon as conveniently may be.</p>
                  <p>And now perhaps the Reader expects I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak
his Favour: But I am far from being ſolicitous
about the Reception this Book will have in the World;
for either the Cenſurer could do it better, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhould have done ſo, and not like a Dog in a Manger,
hinder others and do nothing himſelf; or he could not
do it better, and then by cenſuring me he will but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim

can do me no Prejudice, and the Wiſe and the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will be more Juſt and Ingenuous than to reward the
great Pains I have taken (in collecting and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing
<pb facs="tcp:65997:7"/>
this perplexed Hiſtory) with any thing that
is Cenſorious or unkind.</p>
                  <p>But how ungrateful ſoever the Reader may be to me,
I will nevertheleſs give him the beſt Help I can to
underſtand the Iriſh Hiſtory, which he can never well
do, without penetrating into the true Cauſes of thoſe
innumerable Fewds, Wars and Rebellions that have
been in that Kingdom; moſt of which, I think, were
founded on thoſe great Antipathies which were created
by Difference in <hi>Nation, Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Difference of <hi>Nation</hi> concerned the Iriſh on one
ſide, and the Britiſh on the other; for the Scots,
though ſome of them were extracted from the Iriſh,
yet only ſuch as ſympathized with them in Language,
Manners, Customs, Religion and Interest, were
accounted Iriſh, as <hi>Mac Donald, Mac Connel,</hi>
&amp;c. and the reſt who communicated with the Engliſh
in thoſe five Particulars, are reckoned as ſuch, and
juſtly comprehended under the Appellation of <hi>Britiſh.</hi>
As for the Engliſh, they are undoubtedly a mixt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
compounded of Britons, Danes, Saxons and
Normans: And ſome think the Iriſh are alſo a mingled
People of Britons, Gauls, Spaniards and Eaſterlings,
and therefore called <hi>Scots, i.e.</hi> an Heap: And 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they are at this Day a <hi>mixt</hi> People, if it were
for no other Reaſon, but that there is hardly a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
among them, but has Engliſh Blood in his Veins;
However, the Iriſh Antiquaries do Aſſert, That the
Iriſh are a pure and ancient Nation, and they derive
their Pedigree through the famous <hi>Mileſius,</hi> and by
their Father <hi>Gathelus</hi> are deſcended from <hi>Feinſa
Farſa,</hi> and other great Emperors of <hi>Scithia;</hi> and
by their Mother <hi>Scota</hi> they were extracted from the
mighty Kings of <hi>Egypt:</hi> But the Jeſt of it is, That
ſince only two Sons of <hi>Mileſius</hi> came into <hi>Ireland,
<pb facs="tcp:65997:7"/>
(viz.) Hiber</hi> and <hi>Herimon,</hi> with about three
thouſand Soldiers, if all the Iriſh are of the Race of
<hi>Mileſius,</hi> it muſt follow, That thoſe two Sparks
were <hi>Patres Patriae,</hi> in a literal Senſe, and be got
Children for the whole Army; but however that be,
it is certain there were great Antipathies between the
Iriſh and Engliſh Nations, as uſually there is between
the Conquerors and the Conquered; but by degrees the
Engliſh grew ſo much in love with the Deſpotick Power
of the Lords, and the Licentiouſneſs of the Commons,
that they inſenſibly degenerated not only into
Iriſh Cuſtoms, Habit and Manners, but alſo aſſumed
Iriſh Names, as <hi>Burk Mac William, Fitz-Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens
Mac Sliny, Courcy Mac Patrick,
Hodnet Mac Shery, Barry Mac Adam, Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham
Mac Pheoris,</hi> and many others; ſo
that this Difference of Nation was on the old Engliſh
Side deſigned to be buried in Oblivion. But the Iriſh
would not be ſo ſerved, for they conſidered the firſt
Conquerors but as unjuſt Intruders into, and uſurpers
of other Men's Eſtates, and therefore they expected
ſome favourable Opportunity one time or other, to get
rid of them; though for the preſent they were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to joyn with them; and therefore they carefully
kept up the diſtinction of Nations, and by no Laws or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
could be brought to part with their Language
or Habit, or even the moſt of their barbarous Cuſtoms;
however, the ſecret of this deſign was not divulged,
until <hi>O neal,</hi> in his Triumphs to <hi>Munſter,</hi> blab'd it
out; for being told, That <hi>Barret</hi> of <hi>Caſtlemore,</hi>
though an Engliſhman, was a good Catholick, and
had been there four hundred Years; he replied, That
he hated the Clown as if he had come but Yeſterday.
Since that we have many more Inſtances of it; and
that this Antipathy has extended it ſelf even to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Cattle and Improvements. It was another <hi>O Neal</hi>
that ſaid, It did not become him to writh his Mouth
<pb facs="tcp:65997:8"/>
to chatter Engliſh;<note place="margin">Iriſh Stat. 233.</note> and that executed a Soldier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had Engliſh Bisket in his Pocket.<note place="margin">Sullevan, 67</note> 
                     <hi>O Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levan</hi>
tels us, that from 1168. to the Apostacy of
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII, the Engliſh, though Catholicks, by
continual Tyranny and Rapine destroyed the Diſcipline
of Church and State; and (<hi>fol.</hi> 67.) that the
Engliſh were Irreligious, Inconstant and Heretical,
being in <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s Perſecution Apoſtates, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Arians, then Pelagians, then Heathens, then
Idolaters, then Murderers of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Becket,</hi>
and then Proteſtants: in a Word, wherever they
dare do it, they do not ſpare to aſperſe the Engliſh
Nation and Government with most Malicious and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious
Accuſations; and whoever conſiders, That
the Biſhop of <hi>Clogher</hi> did ſo purge his <hi>Ulſter</hi>-Army,
that he would not ſuffer any Papist to be in it that was
of Engliſh Extraction; and the Advice of Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hony,</hi>
in his <hi>Diſputatio Apologetica,</hi> Not to
make a Priest of Engliſh Race, nor to trust any that
are ſo: Whoever, I ſay, conſiders this and the true
Reaſons of it, will eaſily be convinced, That the
Old Engliſh and the Old Iriſh will one Time or other
ſplit upon the old indelible National Antipathy.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond (<hi>viz. Intereſt</hi>) it concerns the
Iriſh and the Old Engliſh, both of which have Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
incompatible with the New Engliſh; For when
the Engliſh Lords uſurped Iriſh Arbitrary Power, as
aforeſaid, and the Commons (being made Vaſſals
to their Lords, and holding their Properties but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariouſly)
fell naturally into Licentiouſneſs, to the
Ruine of the Commonwealth; The Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi>
in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III, thought to cure this
Malady, by reſuming thoſe Palatinate Juriſdictions
and other great Priviledges thoſe Engliſh Lords had
ſo enlarged and abuſed, whereupon the Earl of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
broached the diſtinction between the Engliſh
<pb facs="tcp:65997:8"/>
of <hi>Blood</hi> and the Engliſh of <hi>Birth;</hi> and the former
did not only confederate together, but alſo brought in
the Iriſh to their Aſſiſtance, and Goſip'd, Foſter'd,
Married and Incorporated with them, ſo that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was obliged to relax their intended Severity,
and to let theſe old Engliſhmen lord it as they pleaſed,
till a better Opportunity ſhould be offered for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reſumption. However, from henceforward,
the Old Engliſh and Iriſh kept a Correſpondence, and
upon the Reformation, became more firmly united by
the common tye of <hi>Religion;</hi> and under Pretence of
defending Religion, and their uſurped Juriſdictions,
they were found together in many Rebellions, and
their Eſtates confiſcated, and given to the new Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;
ſo that they are united in a common Intereſt, to
recover their forfeited Eſtates, if they can; and when
that is done, the Iriſh have their particular Intereſt
apart, to recover their old Eſtates from the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
or Intruders.</p>
                  <p>As for the third, (<hi>viz. Religion</hi>) I need not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the Irreconcilable Antipathy that is between
the Roman Catholick Religion and Hereſie, or between
true Religion and Idolatry; the Differences of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Intereſt may be ſuſpended, leſsned, ay, buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and annihilated, but there is no Reconciliation to
be made between God and Mammon: This great
concern has ſo ſilenced all the reſt, that at this Day
we know no difference of Nation but what is expreſſed
by <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> if the moſt Ancient Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Iriſh-Man be a Protestant, no Man takes him
for other than an Engliſh-Man; and if a Cockny be
a Papiſt, he is reckoned, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as much an
Iriſh-man as if he was born on <hi>Slevelogher;</hi> the
Earls of <hi>Inſiquin</hi> and <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> are Examples
hereof, the one being of the beſt and ancienteſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was yet the beloved General of
<pb facs="tcp:65997:9"/>
an Engliſh Army; and the other being the ſecond
Baron of <hi>England,</hi> was Commander of the Iriſh
Forces.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo another Difference in Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Epiſcoparians and the Diſſenters; which
laſt are branched into ſeveral Sects; but it is not at
all or very little taken notice of in <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe
they do really manage this Affair more prudently than
ſome other more celebrated Nations, and ſacrifice theſe
petty Fewds to the common Intereſt of oppoſing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
                  <p>And that theſe Diſtinctions may appear to be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trivial nor meerly Notional, it will be neceſſary
to give Inſtances of theſe ſeveral Factions, in the
late Iriſh Wars; and firſt there was an Army of all
meer Iriſh (not an Engliſh Papiſt among them) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Biſhop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> and another of
meer Engliſh (all Papiſts) under General <hi>Preſton.</hi>
And ſecondly, There was an Army of Old Engliſh and
Iriſh, under the Lords <hi>Mountgarrat, Taaf,</hi> &amp;c.
and an Army of New Engliſh, commanded by the
Earls of <hi>Ormond, Inſiquin,</hi> &amp;c. And thirdly,
there was an Army of Papiſts under the Nuntio, and
an Army of Proteſtants, commanded by the Marqueſs
of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how ſtand theſe great Differences at this Day?
Why truly worſe than ever, for as to the firſt, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Old Engliſh were heretofore on the Britiſh ſide
in all National Quarrels, they are now ſo infatuated
and degenerated, that they do not only take part with
the Iriſh, but call themſelves <hi>Natives,</hi> in diſtinction
from the New Engliſh; againſt whom they are (at
preſent) as inveterate as the Original Iriſh, though
perhaps Time may open their Eyes and rectifie that
<pb facs="tcp:65997:9"/>
Error. And as to the Second, whereas at Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Death the Proteſtants had not above a
fourth part of the Kingdom; the Eſcheats in <hi>Ulſter,</hi>
in King <hi>James</hi> his time, and the Act of Settlement
ſince, has given them two fourths more, ſo that now
they have three Quarters of the whole, and thereby
more Iriſh are diſobliged than were formerly; and
their Loſs is greater, and conſequently their Intereſt
to regain it is larger and more preſſing than it was in
former Times. As to the third (<hi>viz.</hi> Religion) it's
certain, the Papiſts were never ſo enraged at the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Pestilent Hereſie as of late they have been;
and the Folly, Inſolence and Cruelty of theſe laſt ſeven
Years, has juſtly rendred Popery more odious than ever
to the Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>But was there no way to ſecure <hi>Ireland</hi> without
Sanguinary Laws and Inhuman Perſecutions? Yes
ſure, if People would in time have ſet themſelves to
repair the State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the Jews under <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>
did to re-edifie the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,
viz.</hi> every one build over againſt his own Houſe, the
Matter had been eaſily and quietly accompliſhed, for
the formidable Bulk of Iriſh Papiſts were, for the moſt
part, Servants or Tenants to Proteſtants, and of
their breeding up; and if the Engliſh would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
a little ſordid Profit to the Publick Good, and
have countenanced and indulged Proteſtant Servants
and Tenants inſtead of Papiſts, a very few Years
would have put themſelves and their Religion out of
Danger: But at this Day the Provocations are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo high, and the Iriſh have abuſed the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
to that degree of Barbarity and Ingratitude, that
it will be hard to perſwade the Proteſtants to truſt them
again, or to live neighbourly with the many more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:10"/>
Nevertheleſs, ſince Extirpations are Cruelty in
the Abſtract, and odious to Human Nature, there
muſt be a Method found out to preſerve the Bulk of
that People, and make them ſerviceable to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which will not be practicable, unleſs firſt the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porees
are ſeverely corrected for their paſt Enormities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and afterwards ſtrictly kept in Obedience. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it may be very uſeful both to the Reduction and
Settlement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to make a Difference between
thoſe Papiſts that are of <hi>Engliſh Extraction</hi> &amp; thoſe
that are not; for although at this Day they would
laugh at the Diſtinction, yet upon the first conſiderable
Baffle they meet with, they will certainly leap at the
Qualification.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time it may be demanded, How it
comes to paſs that the Papiſts in three Years have
more weakned the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> in Quantity,
Quality and Eſtate, in a time of Peace, and the Law
on their ſide, than the Proteſtants could weaken them
in forty times that ſpace? But the Anſwer is eaſie,
That the Proteſtants are obliged to Rules of Charity
and Forms of Juſtice, which whether others obſerve
or not will be manifeſt by what they have done; for
whereas it is moſt conſonant to Reaſon, Law and
the Polity of that Kingdom, that the ſmall Colony of
Britiſh, in a conquered Country, ſhould be protected
againſt the numerous Natives by an Army of their own
Nation and Religion, and ſo has it been practiſed for
five hundred Years, and ought rather to be now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Protestant Parliament gave a great yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
to that very End, moſt part of which was alſo
paid by Proteſtants: Yet have we ſeen all this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Law and Polity ſubverted, and that Army diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
with Circumstances as bad as the Fact, and
Enemies introduced to guard us againſt themſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:65997:10"/>
and Mountaneers garriſoned within thoſe Walls, that
were purpoſely built to keep them out.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Force of the Common Law is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
into Tryals by Jury; was it not a ſubverſion
of the Common Law, in a Country where Perjury is ſo
frequent, that <hi>Iriſh Evidence</hi> is become proverbial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſcandalous, to make Judge, Sheriff, Jury, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and Party all of a ſort, what Juſtice a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
could expect in ſuch a Caſe, may appear by thoſe
notorious Murders and other great Crimes that have
paſſed unpuniſhed: And by thoſe many hundreds of
Proteſtants, who without Colour, or Circumstance of
Truth, have been impeached for Treaſon, Seditious
Words, Night-walking or Vnlawful Aſſemblies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as if all this was not enough, unleſs they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
theſe Miſeries upon the Protestants, and even
legitimated them by Act of Parliament, they have in
order to that, ſeized upon all Corporations, and diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, on forged or frivolous Pretences, in ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
a manner, that they did not allow competent
time to draw, much leſs to review the Pleadings;
they reverſed the Outlaries of the Popiſh Lords, and
projected to call their eldeſt Sons by Writ, and ſo made
themſelves ſure of both Houſes of an Iriſh Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But alaſs, theſe Complaints are drowned in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Inſolence and Barbarity of the <hi>Raporees</hi>
is not to be expreſſed; it was tolerable whilſt the
Protestants ſuffered under Pretence or Forms of Law,
but when theſe Wolves were let looſe, the Engliſh were
plundered of all they had at Noon Day, in the face of
the Sun, in Times of Peace, and without Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and (which was a greater Aggravation of this
Crime) it was done in many Places by the Servants
and Tenants they had kept from ſtarving, and the
<pb facs="tcp:65997:11"/>
Neighbours they had moſt obliged; ſo that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
of <hi>Ireland</hi> are entirely ruined by an ungrateful
People themſelves had cheriſhed and ſupported. But
to proceed.</p>
                  <p>I have been curious to give the Vice-Roys of <hi>Ireland</hi>
their proper Titles, and yet I am not ſure that I am
always exact, nor is it of any great Importance whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I am or no, ſince their Power is meaſured by their
Commiſſion, and not by their Denomination.</p>
                  <p>And although I have gathered many Materials to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Second Part, yet it will be ſome time before
I can publiſh it, becauſe I ſhall expect that thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Perſons, that have collected any curious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of the Later Times, will either communicate
them to me, or command mine; which I will readily
part with to any Body that will undertake that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
it being indifferent to me, ſo the thing be
done, whether it be performed by mending mine or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
a new Work.</p>

Advantage by Improvement and good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry:
The Iriſh Rivers are both more
numerous and more Clear; the <hi>Shenin</hi> is big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
than the <hi>Thames,</hi> and might be made Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable
almoſt two hundred Miles; the Air
indeed of <hi>England</hi> is more ſerene, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
more hot in Summer, and more cold
in Winter; nevertheleſs, that <hi>Ireland</hi> is the
healthier Country, may be argued from hence,
That ſeldom any Peſtilential Diſeaſe rages
there, and no part of that Kingdom is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy
as the Fenns of <hi>Huntington, Lincoln</hi> and
<hi>Cambridge</hi> Shires, the Hundreds of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or
the <hi>Wild</hi> of <hi>Kent;</hi> and it may be expected,
That as the Bogs are drained and the Country
grows Populous, the Iriſh Air will meliorate,
ſince it is already brought to that Paſs, That
Fluxes and Diſſenteries (which are the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

as they have been heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Things moſt obſervable of that Country
are, That nothing venomous will live in it;
there are Spiders, but not poyſonous. <hi>Ireland</hi>
breeds the largeſt Grey-hound in the World,
they are called Wolf-Dogs, and will dwindle
and grow much ſmaller in two or three Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in any other Country. The Iriſh
Hawk is reputed the beſt in <hi>Europe;</hi> and the
Iriſh Hobbies or ambling Nags can hardly be
matched; nor do any Seas abound with Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards
more than the Southern Iriſh Sea; it
is very rare to have an Earthquake in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and when it happens it is portentuous; there
are a thouſand Lies reported of wonderful
things in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but the only extraordinary
thing I can aver true, is the ſtrange Quality
of <hi>Logh ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for the Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is not

<pb facs="tcp:65997:14"/>
did not ſucceed either by Deſcent or Election,

                  <p>Nor were their Laws better than their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
it was no written Law, no, digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or well-compiled Rule of Right; no it was
only the Will of the Brehon or the Lord.
They pretended to certain Traditions or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
which they wreſted and Interpreted
(as they do Traditions in Religion) to by-Ends,
and to ſerve a turn. The manner of
deciding Controverſies was equally ridiculous
with the Law they judged by,<note place="margin">Ware de an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. 42.</note> for the <hi>Brehon</hi>

without Canopy or Covering, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Clerks, Regiſters or Records, or indeed
any Formality of a Court of Judicature. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Lord had one of theſe Arbitrary Brehons,
who to be ſure took Care not to diſoblige his
Patron; the greateſt Crimes (as Murder
and Rape) were not puniſhed otherwiſe than
by Fine, whereof the Brehon had the eleventh
Part for his Fees, and Robbery and Theft
were not counted Offences at all, if done to
any Body but their Lords own Followers:
They reckoned all ſuch Stealths to be clear
Gain, and built Caſtles on Iſthmus's and other
inacceſſable Places, purpoſely to ſecure ſuch
Prey and Plunder as they could get, and he
was eſteemed the braveſt Man that was moſt
dextrous at this Sport of Plundering and Cow-Stealing.
Nor is this thieviſh Spirit yet ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
that Nation, nor perhaps never will be
as long as there is a <hi>Raporee</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>Among their Laws may be reckoned the
Cuſtoms of Taniſtry and Gavelkind; <hi>Tani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi>
was a barbarous Cuſtom, which (like
<pb facs="tcp:65997:15"/>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Will) gave the Inheritance to the
Strongeſt; for though the Cuſtom be pleaded
to be (<hi>ſeniori &amp; digniori puero</hi>) yet 'tis certain,
Seniority was little regarded, but for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
that it was accompanied with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and Policy; and therefore when it
was diveſted of thoſe Circumſtances, the
younger Brother proved the better Man; this
Cuſtom was the occaſion of many Murders,
and of frequent Civil Wars in almoſt every
Family; and ſo keeping the Succeſſion uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,<note place="margin">Davis <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, Caſe</hi> de Taniſtry.</note>
and the Poſſeſſion precarious, it was
the greateſt Hindrance of Improvement that
could be, and therefore was juſtly aboliſhed
by Judgment in the King's-Bench in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
in <hi>Hillary Term, 3 Jacobi</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>This Cuſtom was founded upon the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of thoſe Times when <hi>Ireland</hi> was very ill
governed, and every petty Lord and Power
of Peace and War; for if a Child or Woman
ſhould then poſſeſs a Seigniory, it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be expoſed to the Rapine and Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of its circumjacent Neighbours. And it
was this Cuſtom of <hi>Taniſtry</hi> which made the
Iriſh ſeek to be Popular; and to that end were
Hoſpitable even to Profuſeneſs, and above
all things coveted an <hi>outward Appearance,</hi>
thereby to attract the Admiration of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and increaſe the number of their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Abettors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gavelkind</hi> was yet a more ſilly Cuſtom than
the other;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Davis</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</note> and it was, That when any one
died, all the Poſſeſſions of the whole Family
were to be put together (or in Hotch-pot)
and to be anew divided among the Survivors,
by the <hi>Caunfinny</hi> or Head of the Family,
who admitted Baſtards, but excluded Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:65997:16"/>
and Wives; ſo that it differed from Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Gavelkind in five Particulars, 1. The
Kentiſh Gavelkind admitted only the next
of Kin, as Sons, Brothers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Iriſh
admitted the whole Race or Sept. 2. The
Kentiſh Cuſtom excluded Baſtards. 3. It al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Wives Dower. 4. It ſuffered Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to inherit for want of Males. 5. It di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
no Man's Freehold during his Life;
whereas the Iriſh Gavelkind deprived the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Freehold upon every new Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
And this is the true Reaſon why the
Iriſh, though never ſo Poor, will not learn
Trades nor turn Mechanicks, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades
them from their Gentility: And the
<hi>Caufinny</hi> would ſcorn to admit ſuch a one
to any ſhare of the Eſtate, ſince he had as it
were <hi>abdicated</hi> his Family by doing a thing
beneath a Gentleman. Moreover this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of their Poſſeſſion hindred Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
encouraged to Rebellions and Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and therefore was alſo aboliſhed by
Judgment of the King's Bench, 3 <hi>Jacob.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>But it is obſervable, as their Brehons had
their Offices by Deſcent and Inheritance, ſo
alſo had their Phyſitians, Bards, Harpers,
Poets and Hiſtorians; and therefore ſince <hi>ex
quovis Ligno non fit Mercurius:</hi> We may be ſure,
That ſome of theſe Hereditary Judges and
Doctors were but very ſad Tools, and perhaps
all of them will juſtly fall under Suſpicion,
unleſs their Advocates can ſhew ſome Ancient,
Learned Tracts in Law or Phyſick that might
remain as Monuments on Record, That at
leaſt ſome of them were learned in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:16"/>
Nevertheleſs, it muſt not be denied, but
that there was a time when many Learned
Men were by Perſecution driven out of their
own Countries and flocked into <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo that
<hi>Ireland</hi> ſeemed to be a Mart of Learning, and
was for a ſhort time frequented on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
no leſs than <hi>Athens</hi> heretofore; and if
we believe our Authors, there were ſeven
thouſand Students at <hi>Armagh</hi> at one time, and
vaſt Numbers beſides at <hi>Roſs, Carbry, Liſmore</hi>
and <hi>Clonard:</hi> But as this Learning was confined
to the Religious Houſes, ſo it declined with
them; and as the Monks encreaſed in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
and Sloth, ſo they decreaſed in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Knowledge; and when the Doctors
of other Nations had Liberty to return home,
<hi>Ireland</hi> ſoon returned to its former Ignorance,
ſo that long before the Engliſh Conqueſt,
there were hardly any Footſteps of Learning
left in that Kingdom; and to this Day, very
few of the Iriſh aim at any more than a little
Latin, which every Cow-Boy pretends to, and
a ſmattering in Logick, which very few of
them know the uſe of.</p>
                  <p>As for the Riches of the Iriſh Nation before
the Conqueſt, certainly they were very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
for tho Sir <hi>James Ware</hi> mentions,
<hi>That they had a Crown of Gold, and Jewels, and
Gold Rings;</hi> which may be True, (though I
doubt it, becauſe the Iriſh Kings were never
crowned) but however that be, it is certain
their Wealth conſiſted in Cattle, and thoſe
none of the beſt, inſomuch that even ſince the
Conqueſt they paid the King's Revenue in
Cows for want of Money; and yet it may be
true that they might have ſome Money (tho'
very little) brought in by the <hi>Oeſtmen;</hi> but it
<pb facs="tcp:65997:17"/>
is certain they never coyned any themſelves;
And indeed it is impoſſible they ſhould be
Rich, ſince they had little or no Traffick with
any other Nation, neither had they any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers
at home that could ſupport a Trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
Perhaps they had but few other Kinds

he quotes the Teſtimony of S. <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>

and the Saying of <hi>Columbus, ſint tibi divitiae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae

many Inſtances wherein <hi>Sedulius</hi> and

and the Vulgar Latin; and ſhews, <hi>That
<pb facs="tcp:65997:18"/>
all preferred the Original before any Tranſlation
whatſoever.</hi> As for <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> though it was
often cited by them with Reverence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
ſuch as was given to the Writings of
the Fathers and other good Men, yet ſince
they alſo cited the fourth Book of <hi>Eſdras</hi> in
the ſame manner (which the Romaniſts deny
to be Canonical) it will follow that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
proves nothing, or proves too much.
But to make the Matter more clear, he cites
<hi>Marianus Scotus</hi> (born in <hi>Ireland</hi> 1028.) and
the Author of the Book <hi>de Mirabilibus Scripturae,</hi>
(who was alſo an Iriſhman) and they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly

thoſe Books we call <hi>Apocrypha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next Chapter the Primate quotes <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulius</hi>

about Free-Will, Predeſtination and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;

ſo Faith alone juſtifies, yet if it be alone</hi> (that is,
if it be ſeparated from good Works) <hi>it cannot
juſtifie, becauſe ſaving Faith is always a fruitful
Faith;</hi> he ſhews that S. <hi>Patrick</hi> and <hi>Paladius</hi>
oppoſed and confuted the Errors of <hi>Pelagius</hi>
and <hi>Celestius</hi> about the Grace of God, and both
<hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Sedulius</hi> affirmed, <hi>That no Man is
without Sin, except the Man Christ Jeſus, and that
there is no Perfection in this Life, and whatſoever
Men have from God is of Grace, becauſe they have
nothing of due.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Chapter treats of Purgatory and
Prayer for the Dead; and firſt he ſhews the
Cheat of S. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Purgatory, which that
good Man never dream'd of, his Treatiſe <hi>de
tribus habitaculis</hi> relates to Heaven, Earth and
<pb facs="tcp:65997:19"/>
Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and has not the leaſt mention of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
it was a later Invention of the Monks,
and ſo firmly believed by their Votaries, that
S. <hi>Caeſarius</hi> a German Monk has the confidence
to adviſe all thoſe who doubt of Purgatory,
<hi>to go to Ireland</hi> (to S. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s <hi>Purgatory,</hi> in <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirge)
and he ſhall be convinced:</hi> And Doctor
<hi>Tyrry</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That it is famous over all</hi> Europe;
but O <hi>Sullevan</hi> has gone farther,<note place="margin">Sullevan, 23</note> and in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland</hi> has given us the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Rooms and Furniture in this
Purgatory, and the ſeveral ſorts of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
inflicted there; and has acquainted us
with the Methods of getting in and ſafely get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out again: But after all, this has proved
the moſt fulfom Cheat that ever was impoſed
on Mankind, and being about the Year 1636
digged up, by the Order of the Lords Juſtices,
this Purgatory was found to be a ſmall Cave
under Ground, where the Damps ariſing from
the Earth, ſo influenced crazy Melancholy
People, as to make them dream or fancy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were beforehand told they ſhould
ſee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to proceed, the Primate quotes the Saying
of</hi> Sedulius <hi>and the Canon of an ancient Iriſh
Synod,</hi> That after this Life, either Life or Death
ſucceedeth; and that Chriſt has looſed our Guilt and
finiſhed our Puniſhment: <hi>He ſhews the Forgery of a
ſtory on S.</hi> Brendan, <hi>inſerted into the new</hi> Engliſh
Legend, <hi>but not to be found in the Ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript:
He obſerves,</hi> That the Oblations made
for the Dead, in former times, were Sacrifices of
Thankſgiving and not of Propitiation, becauſe they
were made for ſuch as they were confident were in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>as for S.</hi> Brendon, <hi>&amp;c. And he concludes
with the Saying of</hi> Claudius <hi>and</hi> Colombanus, That
<pb facs="tcp:65997:19"/>
when we come to the Judgment Seat, neither <hi>Job</hi>
nor <hi>Daniel,</hi> nor <hi>Noah</hi> can intreat for any one, but
every one muſt bear his own Burthen: <hi>To which I
add the Saying aſcribed by the Synod to S. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,
mentioned</hi> page 36. He who deſerveth not
to receive the Sacrifice in his Life, how can it help
him after his Death?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the fourth Chapter he cites</hi> Sedulius, <hi>tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us,</hi> That 'tis Impiety to adore any other but God,
and reproving the Heathen for Simplicity, in thinking
that the Inviſible God would be worſhipped by a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Image; <hi>to which</hi> Claudius <hi>adds,</hi> That God
is not to be worſhipped in Metal nor in Stone: <hi>And
S.</hi> Patrick <hi>aſſures us,</hi> That no Creature is to be
ſworn by, but only the Creator.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Liturgy, there was no Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
therein; but ſeveral Forms of Divine
Service were uſed in divers Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
that the Roman Uſe began to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the Pope's Legate in the twelfth
Century, and was perfected by <hi>Chriſtianus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Liſmore,</hi> in the Synod of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> and
confirmed by <hi>Henry</hi> II, wherein it was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>That all Divine Offices of Holy Church, ſhould
thenceforward he handled in all Parts of</hi> Ireland,
<hi>according as the Church of</hi> England <hi>did obſerve them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Word <hi>Maſs</hi> is <hi>ſynonimous</hi> to <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and
therefore uſed for Evening Prayer, but it
commonly ſignifies the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> being the
principle Part of <hi>Divine Service;</hi> and the Word
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> did import then, what we underſtand
by the Word <hi>Sacrament</hi> now, and might be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
offered to God or given to the People, and
not as the Maſs is now, wherein the Prieſt
doth all: He farther ſheweth, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Sacrament in both kinds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<hi>Hildmer</hi>'s Wife and S. <hi>Bridget,</hi> and her
<pb facs="tcp:65997:20"/>
Companions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and particularly that the
Popiſh Legends mention, That one of S. <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi>'s
Miracles happened when ſhe was about
to drink out of the Chalice.</p>
                  <p>He ſhews, that the Holy Men of thoſe Ages
did uſe the Phraſe of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and called the
Sacrament the <hi>Body and Blood of our Saviour,</hi>
becauſe they thought the Impoſſibility and
Unreaſonableneſs of Tranſubſtantiation,
would ſecure Mankind from Miſtake; for
Chriſt being <hi>alive</hi> in Heaven cannot be
corporally in the Sacrament, becauſe he is
there repreſented as Dead, and his Body Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and his Blood Shed, and there is no ſuch
thing in <hi>rerum natura, for Chriſt being Raiſed from
the Dead, dyeth no more,</hi> Rom. 6. 9. He quotes
<hi>Sedulius</hi> and <hi>Claudius, Henry Crump</hi> and <hi>Johannes
Scotus,</hi> diſtinguiſhing between the Sacrament
and the Body of Chriſt that was crucified.</p>
                  <p>In Chap. 5 he proves by the Epiſtle of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frank</hi>
to King <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lagh,</hi> That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did not
uſe Chriſm in Baptiſm, and by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> That the Iriſh in his time
did not underſtand or did neglect Confeſſion,
Confirmation and Marriage; he proves that
Confeſſion in former Times was Publick, and
that Penance was but a Teſtimony of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,
and always preceded Abſolution;
and cites <hi>Claudius</hi> to prove, that Sacerdotal Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
is declarative and miniſterial, and
not abſolute; <hi>Sedulius</hi> calls Marriage <hi>a Gift,
but not Spiritual, ergo</hi> 'tis no Sacrament; the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
attributed to S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> prohibits the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
of marrying a Brother's Wife (which was
the Caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII), and <hi>Kilianus</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     </hi> was condemned by the

Judaiſm among Chriſtians, by maintaing ſuch
Inceſtuous Marriages, which <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> ſays
were common in <hi>Ireland;</hi> he proves by <hi>Sedulius</hi>
and S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> That no Divorces were to be
made, except for the Cauſe of Fornication, and
that Coelibacy was ſo far from being enjoyned
the Clergy, That S. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Father was <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurnius</hi>
a Deacon, and his Grandfather <hi>Potitus</hi>
a Prieſt. There was Order taken in the Synod
held by S. <hi>Patrick, Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ilius</hi> and <hi>Iſſerninus,</hi> That
the Wives of the Clergy ſhould not walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
with their Heads uncovered; and <hi>Gildas</hi>
reprehends the Clergy for corrupting their
Children by evil Example; and he proves by
the Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III, That the Sons
and Grandſons did uſe to ſucceed their Fathers
and Grandfathers in Eccleſiaſtical Benefices.
To which I add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That this was ſo true in the
See of <hi>Armagh,</hi> that they feared that Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick
would be made hereditary; no leſs
than ten married Men, and ſome of them
not in Orders, ſucceeding each other in that
See, from the Year 966 to the Year 1130, ſo
that <hi>S. Bernard</hi> ſays, They were <hi>Epiſcopi</hi> but
not <hi>Clerici.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſixth Chapter ſhews, That Monks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
lived by their Labour, and eat their
own Bread; they thought Idleneſs a ſin,
whereas the later Monks and Fryers do rather
extort than beg, ſince their Importunity is
ſo great that no body can deny them, unleſs
he caſt away natural ſhame, as <hi>S. Richard</hi> of
<hi>Dundalk</hi> affirmed, <hi>anno</hi> 1357, at the Synod of
<hi>Avignion;</hi> as alſo that ſuch voluntary Beggery
is ſinful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was not known in the Church
for the firſt 1200 Years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:21"/>
He ſhews, That in Faſts they eat nothing
at all till Evening, but did eat Eggs in Lent,
and <hi>Sunday</hi> was always excepted from Faſting;
and that it is infinitely more Chriſtian to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from Vice than from Meats; and that
the later is vain, if it be not in order to the
former.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh Chapter yields many Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of <hi>Claudius, Sedulius,</hi> &amp;c. That the
Church contains the Tares and the Wheat,
the Erroneous and the Orthodox; That the
Church may be brought ſo low, that ſhe will
ſeem for a time, as if Chriſt had utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
her; that the Enemies of the Church
ſhall be able to do many Jugling Miracles and
Lying Wonders; <hi>Sedulius</hi> warns us againſt
theſe ſeeming Miracles, ſuch as <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
his flying in the Air, and ſays, <hi>That the Faith
having increaſed, Miracles were to ceaſe, That Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
are not a certain Sign of Grace, ſince many
will ſay,</hi> That in Chriſt's name they have caſt
out Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet are not of Chriſt,
<hi>Matth. 7. 22. and that Miracles are not to be done
in vain.</hi> As to the Papacy <hi>Sedulius</hi> aſſures us,
<hi>By the Word</hi> Foundation <hi>is meant Chriſt, and that
the Apoſtles</hi> (who ſometime are intended by
that Word) <hi>are nevertheleſs to be accounted the
Ministers of Chriſt and not the Foundation, becauſe,</hi>
ſays <hi>Claudius, other Foundation can no Man lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that which is laid;</hi> which is Jeſus Chriſt:
<hi>Claudius</hi> interprets Chriſt to be the <hi>Rock, Matt.</hi>
16. 18. but allows <hi>Peter</hi> a Primacy over the
Circumciſion; and alſo avers the like Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in S. <hi>Paul</hi> over the Gentiles; and concludes,
<hi>That one was not inferior to the other;</hi> he ſays,
<hi>The Power of the Keys was given to all the Apoſtles,
and ſo was the Holy Ghost, and that the Church was
<pb facs="tcp:65997:21"/>
founded on S.</hi> John <hi>as well as S.</hi> Peter. S. <hi>Sachlin</hi>
ſays, <hi>the Church was built as well on S.</hi> Patrick <hi>as
on S.</hi> Peter, <hi>and that Chriſt choſe him for his Vicar on
Earth; Ardmagh</hi> is called the Apoſtolick City,
the Biſhop of <hi>Kildare</hi> is called <hi>Summus Pontifex,
ſummus Sacerdos;</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Cahors</hi> in <hi>France</hi> is
ſtiled <hi>Papa &amp; Apoſtolicus;</hi> ſo that theſe Titles
were not peculiar to the Pope in thoſe Days,
but were common to him and other Biſhops,
and promiſcuouſly uſed to any of them.</p>
                  <p>Chap 8. he tells us, That though <hi>Palladius</hi> and
S. <hi>Patrick</hi> did receive their Ordination at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and probably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were ſent thence to preach the
Goſpel (which <hi>Vincentius, l. 8. c.</hi> 7. tells us, <hi>was
planted firſt in</hi> Ireland <hi>by S.</hi> James) yet they did
not come as Emiſſaries or Agents from the
Pope, to promote or eſtabliſh his <hi>Juriſdiction</hi>
there: Nor did their Succeſs give the Pope any
Authority in <hi>Ireland,</hi> any more than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
that went from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to propagate
Chriſtianity in other Countries, did thereby
give Juriſdiction to the Biſhops of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
over the Places or People they converted; or
than the Iriſh Biſhops <hi>Aidan</hi> and <hi>Finan</hi> did give
their Succeſſors, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Juriſdiction over
thoſe Parts of <hi>Britain</hi> they converted; and in
this Senſe the Reader muſt underſtand the
Word Emiſſary <hi>poſtea, pag.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>And in truth that Univerſal Dominion the
Popes have ſince uſurped, or at leaſt challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was not then thought of, neither did the
Popes for ſome Ages afterwards ſend any Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
or Deputy to exerciſe Juriſdiction in
in <hi>Ireland; Gilbertus</hi> was the firſt of that ſort
that was ſent, and he was contemporary
with S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in the twelfth Century; and
therefore although <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo abounded with
<pb facs="tcp:65997:22"/>
Holy Men, that it was called <hi>The Iſland of
Saints,</hi> and alſo had ſeveral Archbiſhops, yet
we hear neither of Pall nor Canonization
till the ſame twelfth Century; and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
proves, They had Archbiſhops in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
before the uſe of the Pall was known
there; and he ſhews, That Biſhops were
ſometimes ordained by one Biſhop alone; that
S. <hi>Patrick</hi> ordained three hundred ſixty and
five Biſhops, and three thouſand Presbyters,
and that the Number of Biſhops ſo increaſed,
that ſometimes there were two or three in a
Town, and ſome had no certain Dioceſs at all:
<hi>Emely</hi> was appointed to be the Archiepiſcopal
See of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Fernes</hi> of <hi>Leinster;</hi> and S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
teſtifies, <hi>That in his Time the Primate of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh
<hi>did constitute another Archbiſhoprick</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>Tuam) ſubject to the Primacy;</hi> whereupon
Primate <hi>Vſher</hi> infers, That the Church of
<hi>Ireland</hi> had no dependance upon <hi>Rome</hi> at that
time, ſince it managed Matters of ſuch great
Importance, without conſulting the Papacy:
He ſhews further, That in thoſe Days the
King, Clergy and People choſe the Biſhop,
and the Pope did not put them in by <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi>
and that the Biſhops of <hi>Dublin, Waterford</hi>
and <hi>Limerick</hi> (which Cities were inhabited by
<hi>Oeſtmen</hi>) uſed to be conſecrated by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and that the Walls and
Dioceſs of <hi>Dublin</hi> were of equal extent; and
that the firſt Biſhop was <hi>Donatus, anno</hi> 1074:
And afterward the People of <hi>Waterford</hi> erected
a Biſhoprick there.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not omit the Writ King <hi>Henry</hi> I. ſent

HEnricus, Rex Angliae Radulpho Cantuarienſ.
Archiepiſcopo Salutem, Mandavit mihi Rex
Hiberniae per breve ſuum &amp; Burgenſes Dubliniae, quod
eligerunt hunc Gregorium Epiſcopum, &amp; eum tibi

                     </gap>ulpho Cancelar. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But as ſoon as the Palls were ſetled in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
this Correſpondence with the Arcbiſhop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> determined.</p>
                  <p>As for the Quotation out of the Old Book
of the Church of <hi>Armagh, That if any Cauſe be
too hard for the Primacy, let it be referred to the See
Apoſtolick,</hi> if it be not forged; yet it proves no
more than that they had a great Regard to the
Piety and Learning of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in
thoſe Days, but does not prove that they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
an Infallibility in that Church.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the Iriſh rejected the
Pope's Judgment as often as they thought
they had Reaſon on their Side; particularly
the Iriſh adhered to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
againſt the fifth Synod, and the Pope's Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
in condemning the <hi>tria capitula:</hi> It
ſeems that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Epiſtle to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Iberia</hi> was directed to <hi>Spain,</hi> and not to
<hi>Ireland;</hi> but 'tis no great matter which.</p>
                  <p>Chap. 9 and 10 ſhews, That the Iriſh dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
from the Romans in the time of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> until the Southern
Part conformed, in the Time of Pope <hi>Honorius</hi>
the Firſt, and the Northern about forty Years
after; and that both ſides pretended to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
and were ſainted, particularly Biſhop
<hi>Aidan, Finan</hi> and S. <hi>Collumkille,</hi> all which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb facs="tcp:65997:23"/>
the Roman Uſage in this Matter; this
Party were called <hi>Quartodecimans,</hi> and were ſo
abhorred by their Adverſaries, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
all that were conſecrated by them,
and ſprinkled the Churches with exorcized
Water, and rebaptized all that deſired it;
and it ſeems the others were as angry with
them, and ſhunned their Company and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
He ſhews, That about the Year
843 the Britiſh See appealed to <hi>Constantinople</hi>
for Inſtructions in this Matter; which City
it ſeems was then counted as oraculous as <hi>Rome.</hi>
But it ſeems to me, That the <hi>Pelagian Hereſie,</hi>
which raged over all <hi>Ireland</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi>
is a Proof beyond Reply, That the Iriſh did
not believe or conſult the Pope as an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Oracle of Truth, becauſe it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
contradiction that can be, (nay 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible)
<hi>to believe a Man Infallible, and yet not to
believe what he ſays.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when he has refuted the Pope's
Pretences to a Temporal Dominion in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and has aſſerted <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> to be the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that Conceſſion, pretended to be made
by the Iriſh on their Converſion, (<hi>quod nota
poſtea, pag.</hi> 2) he aſſerts, That <hi>Ireland</hi> is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ancient Kingdom, and introduces the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Ambaſſador at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
ſpeaking after this manner,</p>
                  <p>It is well known, That according to <hi>Albertus
Magnus</hi> and <hi>Bartholomaeus,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatibus
rerum,</hi> the whole World being divided
into three Parts, <hi>viz. Aſia, Africk</hi> and <hi>Europe,
Europe</hi> is divided into four Kingdoms, namely, the
<hi>Roman</hi> for the first, the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> for
the ſecond, the third the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which
is tranſlated unto the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the fourth the
<pb facs="tcp:65997:23"/>
Kindgom of <hi>Spain. Whereby it appeareth;
That the King of</hi> England <hi>and his Kingdom
are of the more Eminent Ancient Kings and
Kingdoms of</hi> Europe; <hi>which Prerogative the
Kingdom of</hi> France <hi>is not ſaid to obtain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatever the Religion of the Iriſh was
formerly, it is certain that at this Day it is
rather a Cuſtom than a <hi>Dogma,</hi> and is no more
than Ignorant Superſtition; not one in a
hundred of the Common People know any
thing of even the moſt eſſential Articles of the
Creed; but having reſigned their Faith to their
Prieſt, they believe every ſilly Story he tells
them; And as the Primate <hi>Vſher</hi> obſerves, tho
they are ſlow of Heart to believe Saving
Truth of God, delivered by the Prophets and
Apoſtles; yet they with all greedineſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
and with a moſt ſtrange kind of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
entertain thoſe lying Legends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
their Monks and Fryers in theſe later
Days have polluted the Religion, and Lives of
our Antient Saints.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Names of the Iriſh are as in
<hi>England, Hugh, Mahoone</hi> i. e. <hi>Matthew, Teige</hi>
(i. e.) <hi>Tymothy, Dermond</hi> i. e. <hi>Jeremy, Cnoghor</hi>
i. e. <hi>Cornelius, Cormuck</hi> i. e. <hi>Charles, Art</hi> i. e. <hi>Arthur,
Donal</hi> i. e. <hi>Daniel, Goron</hi> i. e. <hi>Jeofry, Magheeſh</hi>
i. e. <hi>Moſes;</hi> and their Sir-names, (which were
aſſumed in the Time of <hi>Bryan Borah</hi>) are
(as in <hi>Wales</hi>) taken from the Chriſtian Name
of the Anceſtor, with an <hi>O</hi> (which is as much
as <hi>ap</hi> in <hi>Welſh</hi> or <hi>de</hi> in Latin) or <hi>Mac (i. e. Fitz</hi>
or Son) placed before it; ſo his Son was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>O Bryan,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Sarah</hi> being
married to one <hi>Mahown,</hi> her Son was called
<hi>Mac Mahown;</hi> ſo <hi>Carah Mac Seerbraghah</hi> was
Father of the <hi>Mac Carahs</hi> or <hi>Mac Cartyes;</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:65997:24"/>
this Diſtinction is obſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That only the
Chief of the Sept is called <hi>Mac Carty</hi> or <hi>O Bryan,</hi>
or the like, and every other Perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
is called by his Chriſtian Name, as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
O Sullevan, Teige Mac Carthy,</hi> &amp;c. but there
is ſcarce one noted Man among them, but has
ſome Nickname or other, as <hi>Moyle, Fune, Fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
Lader, Buy, Buckah, Mauntah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Habit</hi> of an Iriſhman was a Mantle and
Trowſes, and of an Iriſhwoman a Mantle
and Petticoat, both had Broges ſomething
thinner than Pumps on their Feet, and the
Man had a Cappeen and the Woman a Kercher
on their Heads; their Shifts were died in
Saffron to ſave waſhing, and contained 13 or
14 Yards of Cloath, ſo that a Law was made
againſt that Extravagancy; Theſe Mantles
were like Cloaks, only inſtead of a Cape they
had a vaſt quantity of Thrums or yarn-Fring,
ſo that when the Mantle was put up cloſe to
the Nape of the Neck, (as they uſually wore
them) the Fring hung down near a foot long.
Mr. <hi>Spencer, p.</hi> 37. gives too Satyrical a
Character of this Garment, <hi>That it is a fit Houſe
for an Outlaw, a meet Bed for a Rebel, and an apt
Cloak for a Thief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Iriſh <hi>Muſick</hi> was either a Harp (which
is the Arms of the Kingdom) and makes an
excellent Sound if it be skilfully touched; or
a Bagpipe, which is a ſquealing Engine, fit
only for a Bear-Garden; nevertheleſs they
are much uſed at Iriſh Burials to encreaſe the
Noyſe, and encourage the Women to <hi>Cry,</hi>
and follow the Corps, for there is nothing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
more by the Friends of the deceaſed,
than to have abundance of Company at the
Burial, and a great Cry for the Defunct;
<pb facs="tcp:65997:24"/>
which they think argues, That he was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Figure and Merit, and was well-belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Country; therefore they bury their
Dead with great Ululations or <hi>Allelews,</hi> after
the Egyptian manner, and hire Women to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Cry: And I my ſelf have often ſeen
ſtrange Women come into the Crowd at a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and ſet up the Cry or <hi>Allagone</hi> for a
Quarter of a Mile together, and then enquire
of ſome of the Company, <hi>Who it is that is
Dead?</hi> And hence aroſe the Proverb, <hi>To weep
Iriſh, i. e.</hi> to cry without concern.</p>
                  <p>When I ſay, That the Iriſh rode Horſes
without Saddles; and afterwards, even to
our own Days uſed Padds or Pillions without
Stirrops, no Body muſt be ſo fooliſh to think,
That this is a Diſgrace to the Nation, ſince I
affirm the ſame thing of the Ancient Britans,
and that they alſo uſed many of the ſame Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
with the Iriſh, and ſome more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than any of theirs; but what I aim at is
to ſhew, That the Iriſh did continue in their
Barbarity, Poverty and Ignorance until the
Engliſh Conqueſt; and that all the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
themſelves or their Country received,
and their great difference between their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Conditions now and then, is to be
aſcribed to the Engliſh Government, under
which they have lived far happier than ever
they did under the Tyranny of their own
Lords.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt any Body ſo interpret me as if I
included all the Iriſh Gentry in the general
Character of the Rudeneſs, Ignorance and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
of that Nation, ſince many of them
have in all Ages, and ſome to my own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
attained to great Perfections in Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:65997:25"/>
Arts and Arms; and I do avouch, that
even the common ſort are not only capable,
but alſo very apt to learn any thing that is
taught them, ſo that I do impute the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Barbarity of the Iriſh meerly to
their evil Cuſtoms, which are ſo exceeding
bad,<note place="margin">Davis, 150.</note> that as Sir <hi>John Davys</hi> ſays, <hi>Whoever uſe
them muſt needs be Rebels to all good Government,
and deſtroy the Commonwealth wherein they live, and
bring Barbariſm and Deſolation upon the Richeſt and
most fruitful Land in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Iriſh Capacities are not to be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
at this Day, ſince they have managed
their Affairs with that dexterity and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
that they have gotten the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland</hi> into their Poſſeſſion; and by
wheedling ſome and frightning others, they
have expelled the Body of the Engliſh out of
that Iſland: However, let us not be diſmaid,
for they are but the ſame People our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
have ſo often triumphed over; and
although they are not to be ſo contemned, but
that we may expect they will make one good
Effort for their Eſtates and Religion, yet we
may ſtill depend upon it, That their <hi>Nature</hi>
is ſtill the ſame, and not to be ſo changed, but
that they will again vail their Bonnets to a
victorious Engliſh Army.</p>

But this Forgery is yet more manifeſt, Becauſe the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> were not converted by any Emiſſaries from <hi>Rome,</hi> as
appears by the Ancient Difference between the Churches of
<hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſome Baptiſmal Rites, and the Time
of celebrating the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the Pope's Licence, in thoſe Superſtitious
Times, would create Reputation, eſpecially with the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and his Benediction would (as they fancied) facilitate
their Succeſs; and therefore it was thought fit, That the
King ſhould ſend his Embaſſador, <hi>John Salisbury,</hi> to the
Pope,<note place="margin">1156. Sullevan, 59.</note> who was by Birth an Engliſhman, and by Name
<hi>Adrian</hi> IV.</p>
                  <p>And how fond ſoever the Holy See doth now pretend to be
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſince the Engliſh Government and Induſtry have

Apoſtolick Benediction: Your Magnificence hath been
very careful and ſtudious how you might enlarge the
Church of God here in Earth, and encreaſe the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

a good Catholick King, you have and do, by all means,
labour and travel to enlarge and increaſe God's Church,
by teaching the Ignorant People the True and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

Weeds of Sin and Wickedneſs. And wherein you

You have (our well-beloved Son in Chriſt) adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd

Treatiſe met with in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Repetition of the
ſame things by divers others in their bitter Libels, on the
Engliſh People and Government, and particularly by the
Author of <hi>Analecta Hiberniae,</hi> it is manifeſt that there are
ſome Enemies of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſo malicious and
unjuſt, that they would make uſe of the moſt frivolous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
in the World, to wreſt the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> from
the Dominion of the Engliſh Kings: But as God Almighty
has hitherto, (even many times to a Miracle) protected
the Britiſh Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo I doubt not, (unleſs we
are wanting to our own Preſervation) but that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
that Noble Iſland under the Juriſdiction of the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65997:35"/>
In the mean time, though we lay no ſtreſs on the Popes
Bulls, yet becauſe they are <hi>Argumenta ad Hominem,</hi> and if
valid, are a good Title againſt Mr. <hi>Sullevan</hi> and his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
I will therefore endeavour to Reſcue them from his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                  <p>And as to the firſt, though miſinformation or falſe Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
may avoid the Grant of a Prince to his Subjects,
yet that Rule does not hold between Princes, elſe all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
Leagues and Treaties in the World would be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on ſlight Pretences of being miſinformed in one Point or
other. Beſides, the Pope, <hi>Alexander</hi> III. after ſome Years
Experience, and full information of the Engliſh Conduct
and Proceedings, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> gave a new Bull of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as aforeſaid:<note place="margin">Hanmer, 141.</note> And (ſays the Book of <hi>Houth</hi>) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
the Devil to take all thoſe that gainſaid the Kings Title
to <hi>Ireland;</hi> but after all, the Suggeſtions were no other but
that the Country was Barbarous, and needed Reformation,
which was ſo true, that the Iriſh Hiſtorians themſelves do
frequently confeſs it.</p>
                  <p>As to the Second, the very Bull mentions, That the King
ſhall be their Liege Lord and Sovereign: And <hi>Henry</hi> II,
was accordingly received as King by the Clergy, Nobility and
People, and both he and his Succeſſors had always the Title
of Sovereign Lords, and did continually exerciſe and enjoy
Monarchical Authority and Royal Juriſdiction in <hi>Ireland,</hi>

the Name and Stile of Lords: And <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> III, granted
Power to the King to appoint which of his Sons he pleaſed
King of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, by all the Kingdom in Parliament,
was acknowledged and declared King of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which
Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV conſidering, he officiouſly erected <hi>Ireland</hi> into
a Kingdom,<note place="margin">Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> 367.</note> and granted it to Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> that ſo it might
ſeem as if ſhe derived that Title from him or his Authority,
which ſhe had before by a better Right.</p>
                  <p>As to the Third, The <hi>Peter-Pence</hi> (which are but a ſort
of Proxies, <hi>propter Beati Petri viſitationem,</hi> and muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
determine with the Juriſdiction of the Viſitor, which
is long ſince baniſhed out of his Majeſties Dominions) are
mentioned by way of Reſervation, and not by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and are to be paid by the People, and not by the King.
And the Reformation of the Iriſh is propoſed by way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and Advice, and doth not make the Bull Conditional:
Beſides, Converſion is the effect of Grace, and the Act of
God, for which no Man can undertake; and therefore ſuch
a Condition would be Impoſſible and Void. However, the
Engliſh have heartily endeavoured to Reform that People,
and to bring that Noble Country into a general Practice of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65997:36"/>
True Religion and Civility, and though we do not boaſt much
of our Succeſs hitherto, yet now that it is likely better
and more effectual Methods will be uſed than heretofore,
we do not doubt but that they will produce ſuitable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                  <p>But I have ſpent too much time about theſe paltry Bulls,
and therefore I will leave them, and proceed to the ſolid and
legal Titles, which the Crown of <hi>England</hi> hath to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the firſt is that of Deſcent from <hi>Eva,</hi>
Daughter of <hi>Dermond Mac Morough,</hi> who was actually King
of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and whoſe Anceſtors were Monarchs of <hi>Ireland:</hi>
The ſecond is by lawful Conqueſt in a juſt War: The third
is by many ſolemn Oaths, Compacts and Submiſſions of
the Princes, Nobility, Gentry and People of <hi>Ireland:</hi> The
fourth is, by ſeveral Statutes, and Acts of Recognition:
And the laſt (which alone were ſufficient) is, by above
five hundred years Preſcription.</p>
                  <p>But two Things are to be wondred at:<note place="margin">Iſti Reges non fuerunt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ſolemnitate alicujus Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, nec <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nec jure hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditario, vel aliqua prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Iriſh,</hi> who never obſerved the Right of Succeſſion, but
dethroned and ſucceeded one another by force, as they were
able (ſometimes the Poſterity of <hi>Hiber,</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and ſometimes the Iſſue of <hi>Ithy,</hi> getting into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy)
ſhould yet complain of Force in others; or that
<hi>Rotherick O Connor,</hi> who drove <hi>Dermond</hi> out of <hi>Leinſter,</hi>
ſhould think it unreaſonable that <hi>Dermond</hi> ſhould drive him
out of <hi>Connaugh</hi> aſſoon as he could.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, That any body in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould diſpute
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Title to that Iſland, after they and their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
for above five hundred years have been born and bred
under the Allegiance of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> But that
which is moſt ſtrange is,<note place="margin">Burks, Butlers, Breminghams, Barryes, Roch, Condon, Power, Fitzgirald, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> That four parts in five of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
in <hi>Ireland</hi> are of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Extraction, and have
ſetled there ſince the Conqueſt, and by vertue of it, and yet
many of them are ſo blinded with an ignorant Zeal for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
that they have endeavoured to cut the Bough they
ſtand on, and have Aſſociated with Mr. <hi>Sullevan</hi> and his
Complices, to deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and have been frequently in Rebellions to that purpoſe, not
without expreſſing Inveteracy againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name and
Nation; and all for want of duly conſidering, that thereby
they made way for their own Extirpation, ſince the old
<hi>Iriſh</hi> (who ſay the Country was given them by God) would
(if they had power) no more endure the firſt Conquerors
than the laſt,<note place="margin">Settlement &amp; Sale of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </note> nor allow the Title of the <hi>Fitzgiralds,</hi> the

I muſt yet continue this Digreſſion to give an Account of
the Complaints that are made againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and they are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> profan'd the Churches and Sacred
Places; and inſtances <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi>
who took a Braſs Pan from the Prieſts of <hi>Down;</hi> and
<hi>Gerald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> who burnt the Church of <hi>Caſhel,</hi>
and put it off with a Jeſt, <hi>That he would not have done it but
that he thought the Archbiſhop was in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That Offices of Profit, and Places of Truſt
were moſtly given to <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That they ſuffer none of the Potentates to ſit in
Parliament, but ſuch as are qualified by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law,
and therefore the Parliaments are void; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde deducitur omnia
Parliamenta Regum Britannorum authoritate coacta in Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
deincepsque more priſtino celebranda, prorſus inita, infirma,
injuſta &amp; violenta eſſe,</hi> ſays my Author.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That Benefit of Law is not given but to the
<hi>Quinque Sanguines;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are as it were Outlaws
in their own Countrey, and may be ſlain as Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Iriſh</hi> were perſwaded to ſurrender their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
on promiſe to re-grant them in a better and more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Form; whereas really they were cheated, and the King
reſerved a Tenure to himſelf, and gave the <hi>Iriſhman</hi> only
the Poſſeſſions and Profits.</p>
                  <p>And for theſe and other Injuries, ſays Mr. <hi>Sullevan,</hi> pag.
61. the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings could never enjoy <hi>Ireland</hi> quietly, but
were diſturbed with many, and almoſt continual Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Little did this Objector think that his Concluſion had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
three of his Objections; for if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
continual Rebellions, as he ſays, and is true, how could
he expect they ſhould enjoy Offices, ſit in Parliaments, or
have Benefit of the Kings Laws? But the weakneſs of theſe
Objections will yet more plainly appear by the following An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</p>
                  <p>To the Firſt, the Inſtances are few; and it is bad Logick
to draw general Conſequences from the Actions of two or
three particular Men, eſpecially ſuch as ſo bitterly reflect on
a Government or Nation; beſides, all theſe three were <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi>
and their Sacrilege does not concern the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Government of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which is what Mr. <hi>Sullevan</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to aſperſe.</p>
                  <p>To the Second; If this Author had conſulted the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Catalogue, he would have found that the Natives
had more than their ſhare of Biſhopricks and Arch-Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,
and that to the ruine of moſt of the Sees, and in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65997:37"/>
Military Liſt he might have found the Baron of <hi>Dungannon,
Neal, Garuff, Macguire, O Connor,</hi> and many more who had
Pay or Penſion; and yet it is ſo far from being criminal,
to prefer the Colony before the Native to Offices of Truſt
and Profit in a conquered Country, that it is a neceſſary
Duty to do it, <hi>Ne Victi Victoribus Legem darent;</hi> at moſt,
this Partiality is but in matters of Favour, ſo that there is no
wrong, and 'tis founded on good Law and ſound Policy.
But what would this Objecter and his Companions ſay, if
they ſhould ſee a Popiſh Governor in <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt all Law
and Policy, to make it criminal to be an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and a
cauſe of deprivation to profeſs the Religion by Law eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed?</p>
                  <p>To the Third; Several of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Potentates did ſit in
former Parliaments, and particularly in the Parliaments of
the 8th. of <hi>Edw. 2. O Hanlon, O Neal, O Donnel, Macgenis,
O Cahon, Mac Mahon,</hi> and many more <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
but ſince the Parliaments are better regulated, 'tis
true that none are ſuffered to ſit in the Houſe of Lords, but
ſuch as are Lords of Parliament by Law, <hi>viz.</hi> by Writ or
Patent; but 'tis as true, that the principal men of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
have or had Titles that qualifie them to ſit there; as, <hi>O Neal</hi>
Earl of <hi>Tyrone, O Donel</hi> Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel, O Bryan</hi> Earl of
<hi>Thomond, Mac Carthy</hi> Earl of <hi>Clancarthy, O Bryan</hi> Earl of
<hi>Inſiquin;</hi> The Lords <hi>Macguire, Clare, Glanmalira,</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gannon,
Kavenagh</hi> Baron of <hi>Balion, O Carol</hi> Baron of <hi>Ely,</hi>
and many more.</p>
                  <p>To the Fourth; Since the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would not admit their
Countries to be made Shire-Ground, nor ſuffer Sheriffs to
exerciſe any Authority in them, ſo that they were not
ameſnable to the Kings Laws, but were governed by their
own Brehon Laws, ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could have no Juſtice
againſt them; nor could the King puniſh Murder without
ſending an Army to do it; there was no reaſon they ſhould
have the Benefit of that Law they would not ſubmit to:
And this I take to be the true Reaſon why it was
denied them:<note place="margin">Davis 6.</note> 'Tis true, they often Petitioned for
the Liberty to be Plaintiffs, but they would not at the
ſame time put themſelves in a condition to be Defendants,
nor come within the Juriſdiction of the Kings Courts, but
by ſtarts, and for their benefit; and therefore aſſoon as the
Kingdom was throughly ſubdued, and reduced into Shires,
ſo that the Kings Writ did run throughout the Realm, the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> had alſo an equal Benefit of the Law, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Condition of Subjects: So that this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has been long ſince quite taken away.</p>

As to the Fifth; They were not ſo ignorant, but that
they knew the neceſſity of leaving a Tenure in the King;
beſides there was ſome ſmall Reſervation or Crown-Rent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
by Contract or Agreement in every Patent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did not expect it as free as they ſurrendred it; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they got well enough by the bargain; for in lieu of a
precarious Eſtate for Life at moſt, they got legal Titles of
Inheritance by the Kings Grants; and certainly they had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reaſon to complain, whilſt (as our Author confeſſes)
they enjoy'd both the Profits and the Poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>But let us return to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, who found
work enough in <hi>France,</hi> and was adviſed by his Mother <hi>Maud</hi>

he became oppreſſive to his Subjects, and injurious to his

                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Briſtol Dermond</hi> went to St. <hi>Davids</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> where
he prevailed with <hi>Rhees,</hi> Prince of that Country, to enlarge
<hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> who was then in Priſon; and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

<hi>Maurice Fitz-Girald</hi> to engage in <hi>Dermond</hi>'s Quarrel; for
which, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prince was to give them in Fee <hi>Wexford,</hi>

In the mean time he ſent his truſty Servant <hi>Maurice Regan,</hi>

                  <p>But the Engliſh were mindful of their Engagements and
Promiſe; and in purſuance of them <hi>Robert Fitz-Stephens</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

about the Calends of <hi>May,</hi> together with thirty Gentlemen,
ſixty Men in Jacks, and three hundred choice Archers and
Pike-Men, in three Ships: And the next came <hi>Maurice</hi> of

two Barques: As alſo <hi>Hervy</hi> of <hi>Mountmaurice,</hi> whom <hi>Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi>
ſent as his Agent, to be informed of the true ſtate of the
Country.</p>
                  <p>They immediately ſend Notice of their Arrival, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Subjects flockt to him with ſuch celerity, and in ſuch

much inclined to court a prevailing Power.</p>
                  <p>That Night the Engliſh incamped by the Sea-ſide,<note place="margin">Regan.</note> and the

by <hi>Daniel (Dermonds</hi> Natural Son) and five hundred Men,
and ſoon after came <hi>Dermond</hi> himſelf, and renewed the
Leagues and Covenants between him and the Engliſh,<note place="margin">Stainhurſt, 71.</note> and

                  </p>

but when they perceived the Armour, Barbed Horſes, and
other war-like Furniture of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſuch an Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
as they had never ſeen before, they were frighted
therewith, and eaſily perſuaded to retire; nevertheleſs they
burnt their Suburbs, and the adjacent Villages, and manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betook themſelves to defend their Walls. They alſo
briskly repulſed <hi>Fitz Stephens</hi> his firſt Attack, and killed
eighteen of his Men, whereupon the Engliſh were enraged,
and being reſolved either to conquer or dye, they firſt burnt
their Ships, and then made Publick Prayers in the Camp,
and prepared for a Second Aſſault; but by the Mediation of
ſome Biſhops that was prevented, and the fourth Day of
the Siege the Town was ſurrendred on Articles, and together
with two Cantreds adjoyning was given to <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> and
<hi>Fitz-Girald,</hi> according to the former Agreement. And to
oblige the Earl of <hi>Chepſtow, Dermond</hi> beſtowed two <hi>Cantreds</hi>
(ſituate between <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Waterford</hi>) on <hi>Henry</hi> of

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65997:39"/>
But the King of <hi>Leinſter</hi> was overjoyed at this Succeſs,
and to expreſs his Gratitude to the Engliſh Adventurers, he
marched to <hi>Fernes,</hi> to careſs them, where they ſtaid three
Weeks,<note place="margin">Regan. M. S.</note> and ſpent their Time in Feaſting and Jollity. <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
did not fail to applaud their Valour, and tell them,
how much they were dreaded by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to them an Expedition into <hi>Oſſory;</hi> to which they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
conſented.</p>
                  <p>The Army conſiſting of three thouſand Iriſh, beſides the
Engliſh, in purſuance of the former Reſolution, invaded
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Oſſory.</hi> That Prince was <hi>Dermonds</hi> bittereſt Enemy,
and had formerly impriſoned <hi>Dermond</hi>'s Son, and (being

                  <p>That Country being full of Woods and Bogs,<note place="margin">Stainhurſt, 79.</note> might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been defended, and the Prince of <hi>Oſſory</hi> prepared to
do ſo; but <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> counterfeited a Flight, and by that
Stratagem drew out the <hi>Oſſorians</hi> to purſue him; and when
he had got them on the Plain, he charged them with his
Horſe to purpoſe, and routed them, with the Slaughter of
above three hundred Men;<note place="margin">Lib. P. Lamb.</note> whoſe Heads being brought to
<hi>Dermond,</hi> he moſt barbarouſly did bite away the Noſe and
Lips of one of them,<note place="margin">Hanmer, 114.</note> whom he knew and mortally hated:
However, by this Defeat, and the Inroads and Deſolation
they made in the Country,<note place="margin">Lib. P.</note> the Prince of <hi>Oſſory</hi> was forced to
Submit, ſwear Fealty, and give Hoſtages to the King of
<hi>Leinſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Regan</hi> not allowing of this Submiſſion, tells us of
a ſecond Expedition into <hi>Oſſory:</hi> and that after the <hi>Wexford</hi>
Men were three times repulſed, the Engliſh forced the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
beat the Oſſorians, and burnt the Country, and <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
de Prendergaſt</hi> being diſguſted with <hi>Dermond,</hi> reſolved

part with the Prince of <hi>Oſſory;</hi> but finding that Prince deſigned
to murder him, in ſtead of giving him his promiſed Pay,
he got rid of him by a Stratagem, and returned to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and afterward came over again with <hi>Strongbow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however that be, 'tis more certain, That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
being refreſhed, invaded, burnt and prey'd the Country
of <hi>O Phelan,</hi> and afterwards <hi>O Tools</hi> Country up to <hi>Glande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logh,</hi>
and met with ſmall or no Reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Rotherick</hi> (the Monarch of <hi>Ireland</hi>) was
alarm'd at the Advent and Succeſs of the Engliſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſummon'd a General Parliament, or Aſſembly of
all the Princes of the Country; they quickly reſolved to
attack the King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and to expel the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and in order to put their Votes in execution, they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65997:39"/>
united their Forces, and invaded <hi>O Kenſile,</hi> a Territory in
<hi>Leinſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dermond</hi> finding himſelf unable to reſiſt this mighty Force,
and the rather, becauſe he perceived his Subjects began to
ſtagger in their Loyalty,<note place="margin">Stainhurſt, 82.</note> which it ſeems was calculated for
his Good Fortune only, applyed himſelf to <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi>
and nakedly repreſented the Caſe to him, and told him;
That unleſs he ſtuck firmly to him, in this great Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
the Kingdom of <hi>Leinſter</hi> would be loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> anſwered, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had forſaken
their Deareſt Friends and Native Soyl, for his ſake; that
they had burnt their Ships, and had already ventured their
Lives in his Quarrel; and therefore happen how it would,
they would live and dye together. Be you true to us (ſaid
he) and we will not be falſe to you: Your Royal Courage
ſhould contemn theſe Accidents, which will ſoon be at an
End, for either Death (which is the common Fate) will
in a little time deliver us with Honour from theſe Streights,
or a glorious Victory will place us above all thoſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which now ſeem ſo terrible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dermond</hi> was much encouraged by this Speech, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
becauſe his Army was much inferior in number, to
that of his Enemies, he did, by <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> his Advice,
retreat to an inacceſſible Faſtneſs by <hi>Ferns;</hi> which by plaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Trees, and making Entrenchments, he ſoon rendred
impregnable.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Rotherick</hi> wiſely conſidering the Difficulty of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and the incertain Events of War, tryed ſeverally,
and apart both <hi>Dermond</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi> to perſuade them
by fair means to an Agreement: to <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> he ſent
Preſents, in the nature of a Bribe, together with Lett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rs to
this effect.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Britains</hi> may not by Law of Arms,<note place="margin">Hanmer, 115.</note> diſplay their
Enſigns in Foreign Poſſeſſions, nor diſpoſſeſs the Lawful
Heirs of their Inheritance; but they are with Licence of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> to pack Home. It is a Blemiſh to their Nation to give
Aid to a ſhameful Fact: Neither may the Lechery of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
be mantled under Britiſh Cloaks. Wherefore depart, and
forſake him, that is forſaken of God and Man; and here, by my
Meſſenger receive to defray your Charges, and tranſport you to

                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65997:40"/>
But the Monarch was miſtaken in the Man, for <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi>
returned this Anſwer:</p>
                  <p>YOur Preſent I will not accept; nor will I break the Faith
and Troth; I have promiſed to my Friend <hi>Dermond;</hi> he
forſakes not me, I will not forſake him, neither leave him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed.
You ſpeak of Lechery, what is that among Martial
Men? I hear you have Baſtards your ſelf. To what End
is your Embaſſie? If <hi>Rotherick</hi> give Counſel, we need it not;
if he propheſie, we credit not his Oracle; if he command as a
Prince, we obey not his Authority; if he threaten as an Enemy,
a Figg for his Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>So finding himſelf out in his Politicks, he prepares to
force them to that which he could not perſuade them to; and
to encourage his Soldiers, ſuggeſts to them, That <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
deſigned to extirpate the Iriſh Nation, and to that end
had brought in the moſt hateful Enemies they had; that
he was more cruel than a Beaſt, and no Mercy was to be
expected from him; that unleſs this Civil War was by their
Valour immediately ended, it would prove the Ruine of
their Nation; that their Enemies were eaſily to be ſubdued,
whilſt their Number was few, and their Means inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
and that if they loſt this Opportunity, their Country
was loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dermond</hi> in like manner made a Speech to his Followers, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth; That they had Powerful and Brave Aſſiſtants, the
Engliſh, whoſe Valour has been approved; and that their
Faithfulneſs was undoubted, becauſe they had ſworn it, had
burnt their Ships, and could expect no Mercy from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
That their Cauſe was Juſt, in defence of their Prince and
Country; that <hi>Rotherick</hi> was a Tyrant, had three Wives,
then alive, and eleven Baſtards, he murthered his Natural
Brother, was guilty of innumerable Murders, Thefts, Lyes
and Debaucheries; and had no other End in all his ſpecious
Pretences than the enſlaving them and their Children.</p>
                  <p>But after all this, the Reputation of the Engliſh kept
<hi>Rotherick</hi> in Fear, and obliged him to continue his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for Peace; and <hi>Dermonds</hi> Condition, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wants, obliged him likewiſe to make a Peace, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>Thirdly, That his Son <hi>Cothurne</hi> ſhould be Hoſtage for
performance thereof; and as ſoon as the Engliſh were gone,
then <hi>Dermond</hi>'s Son, ſhould be married to <hi>Rothericks</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>The Hoſtage was accordingly delivered, and all quiet,
when <hi>Maurice Fitz-Gerald</hi> landed at <hi>Waxford,</hi> with ten
Knights, twenty Eſquires, and one hundred Archers, with
which Recruit <hi>Dermond</hi> marched to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to reduce that
Rebellious City, which was, without much Reſiſtance, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
upon Articles, and ſo they renewed their Oaths
of Allegiance, and gave Hoſtages for their future Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Rotherick</hi> with his Army went to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Chief Rent of <hi>Danald,</hi> Prince of <hi>Limerick,</hi> who was
<hi>Dermond</hi>'s Son-in-Law; but <hi>Dermond,</hi> under-hand, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> (who ſtay'd behind him, to build his
Caſtle of <hi>Carrick,</hi> near <hi>Waxford</hi>) to ſtep to <hi>Danald</hi>'s Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and the Iſſue was, That <hi>Rotherick</hi> was baffled,
and forced to return without without his Chieffry.</p>
                  <p>With this Succeſs <hi>Dermond</hi> was encouraged to Higher
Deſigns,<note place="margin">Hanmer, 119.</note> and daily conſulted with the Engliſh,<note place="margin">Lib. P. Lamb.</note> how he
might recover the Monarchy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which his Anceſtors
formerly enjoyed, and to which he pretended a Title. He
offered his Daughter <hi>Eva</hi> to <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi>
and made them many large Promiſes, if they would recruit
their Forces, and aſſiſt in the Deſign, but they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and could not accept the Offers, nor were they able to
go through with ſo great an Undertaking; and therefore
they adviſe him to ſolicit <hi>Strongbow</hi> once more to ſo noble an
Exploit.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems <hi>Strongbow</hi> was hindred by the King; for upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of <hi>Dermond</hi>'s Letters, he went to his Majeſty, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The <hi>Waxfordians</hi> and their Neighbours, to the number of

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65997:41"/>
                     <hi>O Rian</hi> of <hi>Odrone,</hi> came down by Land and Water, attack'd

the Engliſh, (rendred deſperate by the Danger) made a

                  <p>
                     <hi>Dermond</hi> hated the <hi>Dublinians</hi> exceedingly, becauſe they
had murthered his Father, and, in Deriſion, buried him with
a Dog: However, at the Interceſſion of the Archbiſhop,
<hi>Laurence,</hi> he treated with them; but the Time allotted for
the Treaty,<note place="margin">Regan. M. S.</note> being expired, <hi>Reymond</hi> and <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> took
Advantage thereof, broke into the City and ſack'd it, with

the Symony of the Prelates, the Ignorance and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence

Loſs: Which his Brother, <hi>Richard Cogan,</hi> perceiving, he
iſſued out of the <hi>South-gate,</hi> and came in the Rear of the
Enemy, which ſo ſurprized them, that after a ſmall Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

taken, and it was deſigned to keep him Priſoner, in Hopes

                  <p>About the Calends of <hi>May, Dermond Mac Morough</hi> King

                     <note place="margin">Regan, M. S.</note> King of the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> and all the

Archbiſhop of that City.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time the Men of <hi>Kenſile,</hi> and the People of

in his Caſtle of <hi>Carrig,</hi> which he was then repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and fortifying, they reduc'd the poor old Britain to the
laſt Extremity: Nevertheleſs, his Courage did not fail, but
with his ſmall Company (being five Gentlemen and a few
Soldiers) he made ſuch a Reiſiſtance, that the Beſiegers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired
to reduce him by Force, and therefore they reſolved
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65997:42"/>
to make uſe of a Stratagem, which proved effectual at this
Time, and therefore hath been too often practiſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> on
other Occaſions: They brought the Biſhops of <hi>Wexford</hi> and
<hi>Kildare,</hi> a Maſs-Book, the Euchariſt, and certain Reliques, and
by them ſolemnly ſwore, That <hi>Dublin</hi> was taken, and that all
the Engliſh found therein were ſlain; and that <hi>Rotherick</hi>
was marching towards them, to finiſh the Siege of <hi>Carrig;</hi>
and that they, in Favour of <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi> and in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of his great Generoſity and Valour, offered him this
Opportunity, to put him and his Company on board a Ship,
that they might ſafely return into <hi>Wales,</hi> before <hi>Rotherick</hi>
and his enraged Army ſhould arrive. The good old Man was
wheedled with this Perjury,<note place="margin">Stainhurst, 120.</note> and ſurrendred his Caſtle;
which being done, ſome of his People were perfidiouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
and himſelf and the reſt were kept in Priſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strongbow</hi> was in the mean time reduc'd to great Diſtreſs,
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> his Engliſh Soldiers not exceeding the Number
of ſix hundred;<note place="margin">Regan, M. S.</note> nevertheleſs, having no Opinion of the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
or Integrity of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> he refuſed to mix with them, or
to admit any of them into his Service, except <hi>Donell Cavenah,
Mac Gely</hi> and <hi>O Carvi;</hi> but being farther preſſed, he would
have accepted of any Reaſonable Conditions; he offered to
hold <hi>Leinſter</hi> of <hi>Rotherick,</hi> and to become his Man (that is,
to do him Fealty); but <hi>Rotherick</hi> would not hear of any
thing but an abſolute Surrender. Hereupon the Condition
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> was ſecure, and that of the Engliſh was deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
<hi>Rotherick</hi> was bathing and ſolacing himſelf and his
Army in a licentious and looſe Poſture, when <hi>Strongbow</hi> and
his ſmall Garriſon (reſolving to ſell their Lives at the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rate they could) made an unexpected Salley into the
Iriſh Quarters; <hi>Reymond le Groſs,</hi> with twenty Knights, and
a ſmall Brigade, led the Van; <hi>Miles Cogan,</hi> with thirty
Knights, and his Party, followed; and <hi>Strongbow</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Girald,</hi>
with forty Knights, and the reſt of the Garriſon,
brought up the Rear. The Conſequence of this bold At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
was an entire Victory; for the Iriſh (being ſurpriz'd
and out of Order) neither could nor did make any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Reſiſtance, but were ſoon put to Flight, with the loſs
of one thouſand five hundred Men.</p>
                  <p>The next Day <hi>Strongbow</hi> marched to <hi>Wexford,</hi> through
the Barony of <hi>Idrone,</hi> to relieve <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi> amongſt the
Faſtneſſes of that Country, at a Place called <hi>the Earls Pace;</hi>
he was briskly aſſaulted by <hi>O Rian</hi> and his Followers; but
<hi>O Rian</hi> being ſlain by an Arrow ſhot at him by <hi>Nichol</hi> the
Monk, the reſt were eaſily ſcattered, and many of them
ſlain. It was here that <hi>Strongbow</hi>'s only Son (a Youth
about ſeventeen Years old) frighted with the Number
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65997:42"/>
and Ululations of the Iriſh, run away from the Battle, and
made towards <hi>Dublin;</hi> but being informed of his Fathers
Victory, he joyfully came back to congratulate that Succeſs;
but the ſevere General having firſt reproach'd him with
Cowardize, cauſed him to be immediately executed, by
cutting him off in the Middle with a Sword; ſo great an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
had they of Daſtardlineſs in thoſe Days, that in
imitation of the Old <hi>Romans</hi> they puniſh'd it with a Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which how commendable ſoever it may be in a General,
was nevertheleſs unnatural in a Father. The Tomb both of
Father and Son, is yet to be ſeen in the Body of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi>
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> whereon formerly was this bald Epitaph, allud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>When <hi>Strongbow</hi> came near <hi>Wexford,</hi> he received the

Iriſh had burnt <hi>Wexford,</hi> and were retired to the Iſland <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
or <hi>Betherni,</hi> and were reſolved to kill <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi> if
they were farther purſued: Wherefore he turned aſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Waterford,</hi> and march'd to that City, where he met
<hi>Hervy,</hi> who was returned with Letters from the King,
wherein the Earl was ordered immediately to repair into
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strongbow</hi> preſently obeyed, and met the King at <hi>Newnham,</hi>
near <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> on his Journey towards <hi>Ireland,</hi> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
The Earl behaved himſelf ſo dutifully, that the King
was ſoon appeaſed, for <hi>Strongbow</hi> did not only renew his
Fealty, but did alſo ſurrender to the King the City of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
and two Cantreds adjoyning, and all Forts and Towns
bordering on the Sea. And on the other ſide, the King was
contented that the Earl ſhould enjoy all the reſt to him and
his Heirs, to be held of his Majeſty and his Succeſſors, and
ſo they marched by <hi>Severn</hi>-ſide, through <hi>South Wales</hi> to
<hi>Pembrook,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">August. 1172.</note> and at length embarqu'd at <hi>Milford Haven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>O Rorick,</hi> and the King of <hi>Meath,</hi> took
Advantage of <hi>Strongbow</hi>'s Abſence in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Reymond</hi>'s
at <hi>Waterford,</hi> and with their united Forces beſieged <hi>Dublin;</hi>
But <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> had the Courage to ſally, and the Good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to defeat them, with the Slaughter of <hi>Orourk</hi>'s Son, and
many of his Followers.</p>
                  <p>On the eighteenth of <hi>October,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Regan. M. S.</note> King <hi>Henry</hi> arrived at <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
with four hundred Knights, and four thouſand Soldiers:
The People of <hi>Wexford</hi> came with the firſt, to make their court,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65997:43"/>
and complimented him with their Priſoner, <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi>
whom the King continued in Priſon, and ſmartly chid him
for invading <hi>Ireland,</hi> without his Majeſties ſpecial Licence:
But this was but a piece of King-craft, to ingratiate with
the Iriſh, and to get the City of <hi>Wexford,</hi> which <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi>
was forc'd to part with, and to make his humble
Submiſſion; and then at the King's ſecond coming to <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,</hi>
he was reſtored to his Liberty, and the reſt of his
Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>To the King, (at <hi>Waterford</hi>) came <hi>Dermond Mac Carthy,</hi>
King of <hi>Cork,</hi> and voluntarily ſubmitted, and ſwore Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance:
He alſo agreed to pay a certain annual Tribute;
which being done, the King marched to <hi>Liſmore,</hi> and
thence to <hi>Caſhel,</hi> near which, on the Banks of the <hi>Shure,</hi>
came <hi>Daniel O Bryan,</hi> Prince of <hi>Limerick;</hi> who in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſubmitted, and ſwore Allegiance. Whereupon Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were ſent to <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Limerick,</hi> and the King returned
to <hi>Waterford.</hi> In like manner ſubmitted <hi>Daniel,</hi> Prince of
<hi>Oſſory, O Phelin</hi> Prince of <hi>Decyes,</hi> and all the great Men of
<hi>Munſter:</hi> And the King gave each of them a Preſent, and
to all of them gracious and kind Reception.</p>
                  <p>All the Archbiſhops,<note place="margin">Brady, 360.</note> Biſhops and Abbots of <hi>Ireland,</hi> came
unto the King of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Waterford,</hi> and received him
as King and Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſware Fealty to him and
his Heirs; and from every Archbiſhop and Biſhop he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Chart, by which they acknowledged and conſtituted
him King, and ſubmitted unto him and his Heirs, as their
Kings, for ever. And according to their Example, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Kings and Princes received him as King and Lord of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and became his Men, and ſwore Fealty to him and his
Heirs againſt all Men.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Charters were tranſcrib'd, and the King ſent the
Tranſcripts to Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> who confirm'd, by Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority, to him and his Heirs, the Kingdom of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Form of thoſe Charters, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
                  <p>The King left <hi>Robert Fitz-Barnard</hi> and his Houſhold at
<hi>Waterford,</hi> and marched to <hi>Dublin,</hi> through <hi>Oſſory;</hi> by
the way he received the Submiſſions of the Prince of <hi>Oſſory,
O Carol, O Rurk, O Chadeſs, O Toole,</hi> and ſeveral others;
but <hi>Rotherick,</hi> the Monarch, came no nearer than the
<hi>Shannon</hi>-Side, where <hi>Hugh de Lacy</hi> and <hi>William Fzadeline,</hi>
by Commiſſion, received his Oath of Allegiance; and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him for a Tribute; and as the reſt did, he likewiſe
gave Hoſtages for his Performance, ſo that there was no
Prince, or great Man in any part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> except <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> but
by his Deputies, or in Perſon, did ſubmit to the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65997:43"/>
Then did the King command to aſſemble a Synod at <hi>Caſhel;</hi>
whereunto the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> conſented afterwards,
though by reaſon of his great Age he was not preſent at the
Synod: Where, after <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> appeared <hi>Chriſtianus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Cambrenſis, cap. 35.</note> It is Decreed, That all Good, Faithful and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
People, throughout <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould forbear and ſhun
to marry with their near Kinsfolk and Couſins, and marry
with ſuch as lawfully they ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, That Children ſhall be Catechiz'd, without
the Church Door, and Baptiz'd in the Font, appointed, in
the Churches for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That every Chriſtian Body do Faithfully and
Truly pay yearly the Tithes of his Cattle, Corn, and other
his Increaſe and Profits, to the Church or Pariſh, where he
is a Pariſhioner.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That all the Church-Lands and Poſſeſſions,
throughout all <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall be free from all Secular Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Impoſitions; and eſpecially, that no Lords, Earls,
or Noblemen, nor their Children, nor Family, ſhall extort
or take any Coyn and Livery, Coſheryes, nor Cuddyes,
nor any other like Cuſtom, from thenceforth, in or upon
any of the Church-Lands and Territories. And likewiſe,
That they, nor no other Perſon, do henceforth exact out of
the ſaid Church-Lands, Old, Wicked and Deteſtable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of Coyn and Livery, which they were wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
upon ſuch Towns and Villages of the Churches, as were
near, and next bordering upon them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That when Earick or Compoſition is made among
the Lay-People, for any Murther, That no Perſon of the
Clergy (though he be kin to any of the Parties) ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
any thing thereunto; but as they be guiltleſs from
the Murther, ſo ſhall they be free from Payment of Mony, for
any ſuch Earick, or Releaſe for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That all and every Good Chriſtian being Sick and
Weak, ſhall, before the Prieſt, and his Neighbours, make his
laſt Will and Teſtament; and his Debts and Servant's Wages
being paid, all his Moveables to be divided (if he have any
Children) into three Parts; whereof one Part to be to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65997:44"/>
Children, another to his Wife, and the third Part to be for
the Performance of his Will. And if ſo be he have no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
then the Goods to be divided into two Parts, whereof
the one Moyety to his Wife, and the other to the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his Will and Teſtament. And if he have no Wife,
but only Children, then the Goods to be likewiſe divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two Parts, whereof the one to himſelf, and the other to
his Children.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, That every Chriſtian, being Dead, and dying
in the Catholick Faith, ſhall be reverendly brought to the
Church, and to be buried as appertaineth.</p>
                  <p>Finally, That all the Divine Service, in the Church of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall be Kept, Uſed and Obſerved, in the like Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Manner, as it is in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> For it is
Meet and Right, That as by God's Providence and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Ireland</hi> is now become Subject, and under the King
of <hi>England;</hi> ſo the ſame ſhould take from thence the Order,
Rule and Manner how to Reform themſelves, and to Live in
better Order: For whatſoever Good Thing is befallen to the
Church and Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> either concerning Religion,
or peaceable Government, they owe the ſame to the King of
<hi>England,</hi> and are to be thankful unto him for the ſame: For
before his coming into the Land of <hi>Ireland,</hi> many and all
ſorts of Wickedneſs, in Times paſt, flowed and and reigned
among them; all which, now by his Authority and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
are aboliſh'd.</p>
                  <p>And ſo (ſays <hi>Cambrenſis</hi>) they having owned the King
Supreme in Church and State, he confirmed their Canons,
by his Royal Authority: And it ſeems to me, That at the
ſame Synod the King declared his Pleaſure to govern <hi>Ireland</hi>
by the Laws of <hi>England:</hi> Whereto they conſented, and ſwore
Obedience accordingly, for thus my Author phraſes it:
<hi>Leges Angliae ſunt ab omnibus gratanter receptae, &amp; juratoria,
cautione praeſtita confirmatae.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Temple, 5.</note> And though others ſay, This was
done at a Synod,<note place="margin">Matth. Paris.</note> held about this Time at <hi>Liſmore:</hi> Yet I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
believe, That the Biſhop of <hi>Liſmore,</hi> his preſiding at
<hi>Caſhel</hi> (as he did, being the Pope's Legate) gave riſe to
the Miſtake of the Place; than that there ſhould be two ſuch
famous Synods celebrated in the ſame Province, in one
Year: But however that be, this is certain, That the King,
ſoon after his return into <hi>England,</hi> cauſed an antient Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,<note place="margin">4 Inst. 12.</note>
called, <hi>Modus tenendi Parliamentum,</hi> to be tranſcribed in
a Parchment-Roll, and to be ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for their better
Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65997:44"/>
The King kept his <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> in as great State as
that Place would admit of; for there was not any Houſe to
be found there, that was capable of his Retinue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was neceſſitated to build a long Cabin, with ſmooth'd
Wattles, after the Faſhion of the Country, and almoſt in
the Nature of a Tent, which (being well furniſhed with
Plate, Houſholdſtuff and good Chear) made a better Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
than ever had been ſeen in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before that
Time, and accordingly it was admired and applauded by
the Iriſh Potentates, who flocked thither to pay their Duty to
the King.</p>
                  <p>But it was Time for <hi>Henry</hi> to mind his Foreign Affairs, and
therefore, in order to his return to <hi>England,</hi> he went to
<hi>Wexford,</hi> and there he ſtaid almoſt three Months, during
which Time, the Weather was ſo tempeſtuous, that Ships
durſt not adventure to Sea; ſo that the King could neither
get to <hi>England,</hi> nor receive any Intelligence from thence:
At length, after Mid-Lent, a Veſſel arrived, with the bad
News, of the King's Sons being in Rebellion; and of the
coming of the Pope's Legates, to Interdict the Kingdom,
for the Murder of <hi>Becket:</hi> He was alſo diſtreſſed, in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
by the Plague, which raged in his Army, and by the want
of Victuals, which now began to be very ſcarce and dear,
ſo that he was neceſſitated to haſten to <hi>England;</hi> although he
was much troubled to leave <hi>Ireland</hi> in that unſetled Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and without ſome Caſtles and Fortreſſes, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd,
and thought neceſſary for its Conſervation.</p>
                  <p>But the Kings Jealouſie was not ſo much of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as it
was of <hi>Strongbow,</hi> whoſe Reputation and Intereſt were very
great: And therefore, to ballance him, the King raiſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Grandees, and gave them large Portions of Land, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with great Juriſdictions and Priviledges; particularly
he gave <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> to the famous <hi>John de Courcy,</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> to
<hi>Hugh de Lacy;</hi> and left <hi>Lacy,</hi> with twenty Gentlemen, and
<hi>Robert Fitz-Stephens</hi> and <hi>Maurice Fitz-Girald,</hi> with twenty
more, Governours of <hi>Dublin. Waterford</hi> was committed to
the Care of <hi>Humphry de Bohun, Robert Fitz-Barnard,</hi> and
<hi>Hugh de Gondeville,</hi> who had twenty Gentlemen to attend
them; and <hi>William Fitz-Adelme, Philip of Haſtings,</hi> and
<hi>Philip de Bruce</hi> had the like number of Gentlemen to keep
<hi>Wexford:</hi> And ſo, in the Morning, on <hi>Eaſter-Monday,</hi> the
King went on Board, and was by Noon, the ſame Day
landed at S. <hi>Davids</hi> in <hi>Wales:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He left <hi>Hugh de Lacy</hi> Chief Governour,<note place="margin">Some call him <hi>O R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap>k.</hi>
                     </note> or Lord Juſtice
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> who kept his Reſidence at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and thither
came to him <hi>O Mlaghlin</hi> of <hi>Meath,</hi> to complain of ſome Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
and Inconveniences, he pretended to ſuffer in that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65997:45"/>
Country, or rather to adjuſt Matters between them, about
their reſpective Intereſts and Eſtates in <hi>Meath;</hi> for he deſired
a Parly at the Hill of <hi>Taragh:</hi> To which <hi>Lacy</hi> very readily
conſented. And ſo, after reciprocal Oaths for each others
Safety,<note place="margin">1173.</note> they met at the Time and Place appointed: <hi>O Mlaghlin</hi>
had treacherouſly prepared an Ambuſh, and when he found
his Opportunity, he gave them the Signal; and upon their
Approach, he with a Pale Grim Countenance, and with a
Spar in his Hand, made up to <hi>Lacy,</hi> and aſſaulted him.</p>
                  <p>But it happened, That one <hi>Griffith,</hi> the Night before the
Parly, had dreamt, That a parcel of Hogs fell upon <hi>Lacy,</hi>
and had killed him, if he had not ſlain the great Boar: This
Dream being told to <hi>Maurice Fitz-Girald,</hi> he gave ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to it, as Superſtitious Men commonly do to ſuch
Whimſies; and believing that it did forbode ſome Danger
to <hi>Lacy,</hi> he cauſed <hi>Griffith,</hi> and ſix more, ſecretly to
arm themſelves, and to ride near the Place of Parley, as it
were for Pleaſure, and to be ready at any Alarm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald</hi> (as ſoon as he diſcover'd <hi>O Mlaghlin</hi>'s
Deſign) gave the Signal to <hi>Griffith,</hi> but before he could
come up, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had kill'd <hi>Lacy</hi>'s Interpreter, who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
to ſave his Maſter, and had his Arm cut off for his
Pains; <hi>Lacy</hi> himſelf was twice knockt down, but <hi>Griffith</hi>
being come, he ſoon ended this Skirmiſh, by the Death of
<hi>O Mlaghlin,</hi> whoſe Head he cut off, and ſent it into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Lacy</hi> being unable to manage the Kingdom, and the
King being ſo perplexed with the Rebellion of his Sons, that
he could not perſonally attend the Iriſh Affairs, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſend for <hi>Strongbow</hi> into <hi>Normandy</hi> (where the King
was) and to give him the Government of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strongbow</hi> being ſent for, did readily wait on the King,
and being made acquainted with his Majeſties Intentions, he
made it his Requeſt, That to avoid Envy and Jealouſie, <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
le Groſs,</hi> might be his Colleague in the Government.
The King replyed, That <hi>Reymond</hi> ſhould be joyned with him,
as an Aſſiſtant, but not in Commiſſion: And ſo having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
much Confidence in the Earl, he gave him the City
of <hi>Wexford</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> and ſent him to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Strongbow,</hi>
Chief Governour, or Lord Juſtice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at his arrival
there, found all things in Diſorder, many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
revolted, and all of them confederated to ſhake off the
Engliſh Yoke; the Army alſo was Mutinous for want of
Pay, and the Generals (<hi>Hervy</hi> and <hi>Reymond</hi>) were at odds.
Immediately he put the Army under the Conduct of <hi>Reymond;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1174.</note>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65997:45"/>
who led them into <hi>Ophaly;</hi> where they met with good Prey:
Thence he advanced to <hi>Liſmore,</hi> and ſpoiled both the Town,
and the Country; and ſo, by the Sea-ſide, he marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Waterford:</hi> At <hi>Dungarvan</hi> he found thirteen Boats;
which he ſeized, and loaded with Prey and Plunder: But
being detained there a long time, by contrary Winds, the
People of <hi>Cork</hi> found means to fit out thirty two Barques,
and manfully aſſaulted the Engliſh in their Boats; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
the Engliſh Bows and Arrows prevailed, and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cagians
were defeated, and their Admiral, <hi>Gilbert mac Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
ſlain: Whereupon the Engliſh, under their Admiral,
<hi>Adam de Hereford,</hi> ſailed triumphantly into <hi>Waterford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dermond mac Carthy,</hi> King of <hi>Cork,</hi> came, with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by Land, to countenance the aforeſaid Attempt of the
Corcagians, by Sea, and to ſeize on the Engliſh Boats, if
perhaps they ſhould be forced aſhore, as he expected; but
<hi>Reymond</hi> met him, and gave him ſuch a Bruſh, that he got a
Prey of four thouſand Cows, by the Bargain, and brought
them ſafe to <hi>Waterford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whilſt <hi>Reymond</hi> was thus buſied in <hi>Munſter,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Advice of the Death of his Father, <hi>William Fitz-Girald;</hi>
which obliged him to take a Voyage into <hi>Wales,</hi> to
get Poſſeſſion of the Inheritance, deſcended to him: By this
Accident the Command of the Army fell to <hi>Hervy;</hi> and
abundance of Trouble and Misfortune hapned to the Earl.</p>
                  <p>For it was not long, before <hi>Hervy</hi> perſwaded the Earl to
an Exploit,<note place="margin">1175.</note> ſomewhere about <hi>Caſhel,</hi> and in order to it, to ſend
for more Forces from <hi>Dublin;</hi> but <hi>Donald,</hi> Prince of <hi>Oſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
having Notice of it, ſurpriz'd them in their March, and
fell upon them in <hi>Oſſory,</hi> where he ſlew four Gentlemen and
four hundred Soldiers, being of that ſort of the Citizens of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> which were called <hi>Eaſterlings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With this great Victory, the Iriſh were elevated beyond
meaſure, and fanſied, They had now got a favourable
Opportunity to extipate the Engliſh: And to that End
they armed every where; and even thoſe Iriſh whom

                  <p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65997:46"/>
three hundred Archers and Footmen, and in twenty Barques
arrived at <hi>Waterford</hi> very ſeaſonably, for the Citizens were

                     <hi>Strongbow</hi> and the Army being at <hi>Wexford, Reymond</hi> was

                  <p>But the Prince of <hi>Limerick</hi> was reſolved to follow his Blow,

ſmote off his Head; and not long after (ſays <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenſis</hi>)
the Men of <hi>Cork,</hi> at a Parlee, not far from the

It ſeems that <hi>Dermond mac Carthy,</hi> King of <hi>Cork,</hi> gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Reymond,</hi> for this Expedition, a large Tract of Land in
the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> then reckoned part of the Kingdom of
<hi>Cork;</hi> there <hi>Reymond</hi> ſetled his Son <hi>Maurice,</hi> who married
<hi>Catherine,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Miles Cogan,</hi> and grew ſo Great and
Powerful, that he gave Name both to his Country and his
Family, this being called <hi>Fitz-Morris,</hi> and that <hi>Clan-Morris,</hi>
and both the one and the other are enjoyed, to this Day, by
his Lineal Heir Male, the Right Honourable <hi>William</hi> Lord
Baron of <hi>Kerry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Reymond</hi> was in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> he received
a Letter from his Wife in theſe Words.</p>
                  <p>KNow, my dear Lord, That my great Cheek Tooth, which
was wont to ake ſo much, is now fallen out; wherefore
if you have any Care or Regard of me, or of your ſelf, come
away with all ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>By this <hi>Reymond</hi> knew that <hi>Strongbow</hi> was dead;<note place="margin">27 May, 1177.</note> but
he wiſely concealed it, and immediately returned to <hi>Limerick.</hi>
And becauſe he wanted the Soldiers to garriſon the Towns
near the Sea, he delivered the City to <hi>Donald,</hi> Prince of
<hi>Thomond</hi> the King's Subject, upon a new Oath and Hoſtages;
but he, as ſoon as the Garriſon was out, perfidiouſly ſet Fire
to the City in four Places, that it might be no more a Neſt
for Engliſh Men.</p>
                  <p>Thence <hi>Reymond</hi> marched to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the Funerals of
the Earl were there ſolemnized by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
The King's Meſſengers returned to <hi>England,</hi> with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the State of Affairs, leaving (with the Conſent of
the Council) the chief Government, with <hi>Reymond;</hi> who
ſoon after ſurrendred to <hi>William Fitz-Adelm</hi> Anceſtor of the
<hi>Burks</hi> or <hi>Burghs</hi> (the King's Sewer or Taſter) with whom
were ſent <hi>Courcy Fitz-Stephens</hi> and <hi>Cogan,</hi> as Counſellors
and Aſſiſtants: He was allowed twenty Gentlemen, and
they ten a piece. He landed at <hi>Wexford,</hi> whither <hi>Reymond</hi>
marched to meet him; he viewed the Sea-Coaſts, and took
Care of the Towns and Caſtles that way, but did not much
mind the Frontiers, againſt the Iriſh.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>William Fitz-Adelm</hi> was related to the Crown, for
<hi>Arlotte,</hi> Mother of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, was married to
<hi>Harlowen de Bourgo,</hi> by whom ſhe had <hi>Robert,</hi> Earl of
<hi>Cornwal,</hi> and <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> half Brothers to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour;
<hi>Robert</hi> had Iſſue, <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> who
had Iſſue, <hi>Adelm</hi> and <hi>John; Adelm</hi> had Iſſue, this <hi>William
Fitz-Adelm;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had Iſſue <hi>Hubert de Burgo,</hi> that was
Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and one of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65997:48"/>
greateſt Men of his Time. And this <hi>William Fitz-Adelm,</hi>
though he be repreſented as an ill Man, by the Hiſtorians of
that Age, yet he founded one of the Beſt and Nobleſt Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
in <hi>Ireland, viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Burks,</hi> which has yielded
many Brave and Worthy Men, that have proved eminently
ſerviceable to their King and Country, whereby their Name,
Eſtate and Family are preſerved in great Honour and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to this Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John de Courcy,</hi> who marryed the Daughter of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred,</hi>
King of the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> had contracted an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and entire Friendſhip with Sir <hi>Armoricus Triſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
alias, de Sancto Laurentio,</hi> who afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Siſter. My Author ſays, they were ſworn Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the Church of <hi>Roan;</hi> but certainly there was ſuch
Kindneſs between them, that <hi>Courcy</hi> was reſolved to ſhare
his Conqueſts in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> with him: And being troubled at
the ſordid Humour of <hi>Fzadelme,</hi> and ſimpathizing with the
Wants and Grievances of the Souldiery, in <hi>February</hi> 1177,<note place="margin">1177.</note>
he led forth twenty Knights and three hundred Foot-Soldiers,
beſides Servants, and marching through <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel,</hi> in four Days
(or rather early the fifth) he came to the City of <hi>Down,</hi>
which, without Reſiſtance, he took and rifled; for the
Citizens were not in any Poſture of Defence, becauſe they
had not the leaſt Fear, or ſo much as a Thought of an Enemy.
The Lord or Governour <hi>Dunlenns,</hi> or <hi>O Donel,</hi> perceiving
the Amazement and Irreſolution of his People, was neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to withdraw, leaving the Legate <hi>Vivianus</hi> to negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
in his behalf, with <hi>Courcy,</hi> and to offer him a Tribute,
if he would peaceably retire; but <hi>Courcy</hi> was tranſported
with ſome blind Phrophecies of <hi>Merlin</hi> and <hi>Columbus,</hi>
which he interpreted of himſelf, and fancied nothing leſs,
than the entire Conqueſt of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> and therefore rejected
all Overtures of Accomodation.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>O Donel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This Battle at large, <hi>Hanmer,</hi> 150.</note> with the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Rotherick,</hi>
and the reſt of his Neighbours (who made it a common
Cauſe) ſoon raiſed an Army of ten thouſand Men, and
with them deſigned to beſiege the City of <hi>Down:</hi> But <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
choſe rather to fight a Battle in the Field, than ſtand a
Siege in the <hi>Town,</hi> and the Succeſs juſtified his Choice, for
he routed the Enemy with great Slaughter, and took the
Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> Priſoner; but at the Interceſſion of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
he was releaſed.</p>
                  <p>About Midſummer following, the Ulſter Men, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of fifteen thouſand, fought another Battle with <hi>Courcy,</hi>
near <hi>Down,</hi> and though it was very Bloody on both ſides,
yet the Honour of the Day is by my Author given to
<hi>Courcy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65997:48"/>
His third Battle was in the <hi>Ferny,</hi> againſt eleven thouſand
Iriſh (the Engliſh not being above the tenth part of their
number): The Occaſion of it was thus; Sir <hi>John de Courcy</hi>
had built many Caſtles in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> eſpecially in that part of
it called <hi>Ferny,</hi> where <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> dwelt; he was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant
of <hi>Courcy,</hi> and made him his Goſſip, and had ſworn
Fidelity to him, and had ſo far inſinuated himſelf into <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s
Favour, that the Britain gave him two Caſtles, with the
Lands belonging to them; but within a Month <hi>Mac Mahon</hi>
demoliſhed both the Caſtles: And being asked the Reaſon,
why he did ſo? he anſwered, That he did not promiſe to
hold Stones, but Land; and that it was contrary to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to live within cold Walls, whilſt the Woods were ſo
nigh. <hi>Courcy</hi> was netled with this ſlight Anſwer; and to
revenge the Affront, entred the <hi>Ferny,</hi> and took ſo large a Prey
of Cows, that he was obliged to divide them into three
Droves, for convenience of Driving; the Ways were bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and alſo ſo narrow, that the Prey filled the Road for
three miles together. The Iriſh, obſerving theſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſet upon the Engliſh, with ſuch Briskneſs, Noiſe and
Clamour, that forced the Cows back, and made them run,
like Devils, upon their Drivers, ſo that they overthrew
both Horſe and Man, and trod more underfoot than were
ſlain by the Sword: In a Word, the Engliſh were routed,
and although they had ſlain nineteen ſcore of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and
their General, <hi>Mac Mahon,</hi> himſelf, yet they were forced
to run for their Lives, and much ado they had to recover an
old Fort of <hi>Courcy</hi>'s; where they made a ſhift to ſecure
themſelves, although the Iriſh were encamped vey near
them.</p>
                  <p>About Midnight Sir <hi>Amorick</hi> went to view the Poſture of
the Iriſh, who (not in the leaſt miſtruſting that a baffled
handful of Men, would dare to attempt them) were in a looſe
and negligent Condition, moſt of them aſleep, even their
very Guards and Centinels. This being reported to <hi>Courcy,</hi>
they eaſily agreed to make uſe of this Advantage; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
with all their Force fell upon the Iriſh, and ſurprized
them to that degree, that they could make no Reſiſtance; ſo
that they were all ſlain, except two hundred, who made their
eſcape; and of the Engliſh there were but two killed in this
Encounter, and four hundred the Day before.</p>
                  <p>About this Time the Legate, <hi>Vivianus,</hi> held a Synod at
<hi>Dublin;</hi> in which he publiſhed the King's Title to <hi>Ireland</hi>
and denounced Excommunication againſt all that ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it: He alſo gave Leave to the Engliſh, to take out of
the Churches and Monaſteries ſuch Corn and other Proviſion
as they ſhould at any time need, paying the true Value
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65997:49"/>
thereof, for the ſame: He gave the People Indulgences, and
they gave him Money; and ſo they parted very well pleaſed on
both Sides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> and young <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> invaded <hi>Connaugh,</hi> as
far as <hi>Tuam,</hi> but could not make any Stay there for want of
Victuals, for the Inhabitants had removed or deſtroyed all
their Proviſion, and fled away, upon the News of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the Engliſh. And here let me obſerve, once for
all, That want of Proviſion hath fruſtrated more great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and well-contrived Expeditions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> than any
other Defect or Accident whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Rotherick</hi> King of <hi>Connaugh,</hi> having Notice of this
March, and knowing the Engliſh would be forced to return
in a little Time for want of Victuals, he placed an Ambuſh
in a covenient Station; which, according to their Orders,
fell upon the Engliſh, in their Retreat, but did no greater
Miſchief than the killing of three Engliſh Men, and that with
the Loſs of many of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>This Governour, <hi>Fitz-Adelm,</hi> was very unkind to <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
and all the <hi>Geraldines,</hi> and indeed to moſt of the firſt
Adventurers: He forced the Sons of <hi>Maurice Fitz-Gerald</hi> to
exchange their Caſtle of <hi>Wicklow</hi> for the decayed Caſtle of
<hi>Fernes;</hi> and when they had repaired that Caſtle of <hi>Fernes,</hi>
he found ſome Pretence or other to have it demoliſhed. He
took from <hi>Reymond</hi> all his Land near <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Wexford:</hi>
He delayed the Reſtitution of <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> to his Lands in
<hi>Ophaly,</hi> till he made him conſent to accept of worſe ſituated
Land, in lieu of it. He made his Nephew, <hi>Walter Almain,</hi>
(a corrupt beggarly Fellow, ſays <hi>Cambrenſis</hi>) Seneſchal of
<hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Waterford,</hi> who received Bribes, from <hi>Mac
Morough</hi> of <hi>Kenſile,</hi> to prejudice the <hi>Fitz-Geralds;</hi> and ſo
Mercenary was <hi>Fitz-Adelm</hi> himſelf, that the Iriſh flock'd
unto him, as to a Fair, to buy their Demands. At laſt,
having neither done Honour to the King, nor Good to the
Country, he was revok'd, and in his Room the King appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1179.</note> Lord Juſtice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to whom <hi>Robert

                  <p>The King,<note place="margin">Lib. G. Lamb.</note> at a Parliament held at <hi>Oxford, anno</hi> 1177,
had given the Kingdom of <hi>Cork,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Patent.</note> from the River next <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65997:49"/>
He alſo gave the Kingdom of <hi>Limerick</hi> to the Brothers and
Nephew of <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwal;</hi> but they finding they
could not get Poſſeſſion, in a little Time ſurrendred their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Grant: Whereupon the King beſtowed it upon
<hi>Philip de Broaſe,</hi> to be held of the King and his Son <hi>John,</hi>
by ſixty Knights Fees; and the City, and a Cantred ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning,
were likewiſe excepted out of this Grant.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three Adventurers joyned their Forces together, and
came to <hi>Waterford</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> and ſo coaſted it to <hi>Cork,</hi>
where they were kindly received by <hi>Richard de Londres,</hi> the
Governour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cogan</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> agreed with <hi>Mac Carthy,</hi> and the
Iriſh Gentry; That they ſhould hold four and twenty Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds,
paying a ſmall yearly Rent; and of the ſeven Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds,
near <hi>Cork, Cogan</hi> had the four Southern, and <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi>
the three that were on the Eaſt-ſide of the City.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Cork</hi> being thus ſetled, they marched with
<hi>Broaſe</hi> to <hi>Limerick,</hi> with ſixty Gentlemen, one hundred and
fifty Horſe, and a ſmart Party of Foot: As ſoon as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
perceived them, they ſet the Town on Fire; at which
deſperate Barbarity, <hi>Broaſe</hi> was ſo offended, that he could
not be prevailed upon, by any Arguments, to ſettle there,
or to have any thing to do with ſuch Raſh and Heatheniſh
People, and therefore they returned to <hi>Cork;</hi> which for ſome
Time after, <hi>Cogan</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> joyntly and happily
governed.</p>
                  <p>This Kingdom of <hi>Cork</hi> deſcended to Daughters,<note place="margin">Hooker, 46. Hanmer, 158. Brady, 369.</note> and ſo
came by Marriage to <hi>Robert de Carew</hi> and <hi>Patrick de Courcy,</hi>
about the twentieth Year of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III. <hi>Courcy</hi>'s
part of it was afterwards ſubdvided among many Daughters,
who were Heirs General of that Family, ſo that a very ſmall
Proportion of it remains with the Heir-Male of that Name,
who was anciently Baron of <hi>Ringrone,</hi> but now has the Title
of <hi>Lord Baron of</hi> Kingſale. As for the <hi>Carews,</hi> they were
Marqueſſes of <hi>Cork,</hi> and built the Caſtles of <hi>Ardtully, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keran</hi>

and others intruded into their Poſſeſſions and Eſtate, and
keep them to this Day, except what they have ſold or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</p>
                  <p>About this Time Sir <hi>Thomas de Clare</hi> obtained a Grant of

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65997:50"/>
Ship, by Streſs of Weather was driven into a Creek, called
<hi>Torſhead; O Hanlon</hi> and his Followers immediately came on
Board the Veſſel, and murdered all that were in it, and
ſeized on the Cargo. As ſoon as <hi>Courcy</hi> had Notice of this
Misfortune, he drew his Men together, being above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
and marched towards the <hi>Newry;</hi> on the Way he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Advice, That the Iriſh were encamped near <hi>Dundalk,</hi>
in a great Body, to the Number of ſeven thouſand: <hi>Courcy</hi>
ſent a Fryer to them, and inſtructed him to tell them, That
there were great Forces arrived at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> from <hi>England,</hi>
and that they were very near them; and to juſtifie this Story,
the Engliſh did march with the greateſt Shew and Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
they could make, and made a great Shout, wherewith
the Enemy was ſo daunted, that they fled towards the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
in great Confuſion; but the Tide being in, many were
drowned, and more were ſlain: However, <hi>O Hanlon,</hi> and
the greateſt part of his Army, got over the River; but the
Frier guided the Engliſh over a Ford, ſo that they came to a
ſecond Encounter, wherein the Iriſh were ſo deſperate, That
the Engliſh Foot were forced to retire; but the Valiant
Sir <hi>Armorick,</hi> came in ſeaſonably to their Reſcue, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
them to rally, and to make another Charge, which
they performed ſo briskly, that the Iriſh were obliged to
withdraw to the <hi>Fews,</hi> as the Engliſh alſo did to <hi>Dundalk,</hi>
neither Party much boaſting of the Victory, becauſe the
Slaughter was great on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>About this time two Cardinals come to <hi>England,</hi> to invite
the Engliſh and Iriſh Biſhops to the Council of <hi>Lateran:</hi> There
went from hence <hi>Lawrence</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin, Catholicus</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> and others; but all of them firſt
ſwore, Not to procure any Damage to the King or his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:<note place="margin">Sullevan.</note>
Which Oath <hi>Lawrence</hi> did not very religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
for he not only ſpoke vehemently, in the Council,
againſt the King's Adminiſtration of Affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
(as the Iriſh ſay) he obtained a Bull of Revocation from the
Pope, annulling the former Bulls granted to the King: But
this is not probable, becauſe no ſuch Bull is extant, and if
there were, it would be void; but it is certain he was an
inveterate Enemy to the Engliſh, and gave them all the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
and Diſquiet he could. However, he was reputed a
very Holy Man, being zealouſly addicted to the Superſtitious
Devotion,<note place="margin">Hanmer, 163.</note> ſo that he was canonized by Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> III.
This is recorded of him, That he was ſo grateful to the See
of <hi>Rome</hi> for his Pall, or ſo great an abhorrer of Immodeſty,
that he refuſed to abſolve the Prieſts convicted of that Sin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that he ſent one hundred and forty of them to <hi>Rome,</hi>
to pay for their Abſolution there.</p>

But it is time to return to the Lord Juſtice <hi>Lacy,</hi> who
govern'd very well, and built many Caſtles in convenient

<hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> a Clergy-man, his Aſſiſtant; and

that it got him both the Land and Title of <hi>Hoath;</hi>
which laſt continues to this Day in his Name and Family.</p>
                  <p>We left <hi>Cogan</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> in the peaceable Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

that were between them; they were to lodge at <hi>Mac Tirid</hi>'s

fell upon them, and murdered them and five of their
Company.</p>
                  <p>Immediately the whole Country was up in Arms, and
conſpired a general Rebellion, <hi>Donald More</hi> in <hi>Curraugh, Mac
Carthy</hi> (whom the Iriſh ſtill called King of <hi>Cork</hi>) got his
Forces together, and laid Siege to the City, not doubting
but that he had now a favourable Opportunity to expel the
Engliſh thence.</p>
                  <p>The Poor Old <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> was in a ſad Condition, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
by Enemies without, and Suſpicions of Traytors

twenty Gentlemen, and one hundred Archers, and entred

                  <p>Nevertheleſs, as ſoon as the King heard of the aforeſaid

<hi>Fitz-Stephens;</hi> by their Aſſiſtance the City and Kingdom of

                  <p>But <hi>Lacy,</hi> the Lord Juſtice, was again become ſuſpected;

ſold them: He alſo went a Circuit, to viſit the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,

from the Clergy a great Sum of Mony; thence he went to
<hi>Down,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Dublin,</hi> loaden both with Curſes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions.
<hi>Tirrel</hi> took a Brewing-Pan from the poor Prieſts
at <hi>Armagh,</hi> and carried it to <hi>Down,</hi> but the Houſe where he
lay was burnt, and ſo were alſo the Horſes in the Stable, ſo
that he was fain to leave the Pan, for want of Carriage; and
<hi>Philip</hi> had a ſevere fit of the Gripes, like to coſt him his Life;
both which Puniſhments (they ſay) were miraculouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

                  <p>In <hi>July</hi> came over <hi>John Comin,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to

                  <p>Earl <hi>John</hi> was then about twelve Years old, when on

                  </p>
                  <p>The Iriſh Potentates flock'd to their new Prince; but
their Trouſes and Mantles, their Glibbs and Behaviour, were
derided by the Normans, who uſed them ſcurrilouſly; one
pats the Iriſh Prince on the Pate, another pulls him by the
Mantle, a third pricks him in the Breech with a Pin, a fourth
ſhuts the Door upon his Heels; every Body abuſes them:
Wherefore away they get as faſt as they can, and every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
publiſh'd the Ill Uſage they received at Court. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therick
O Conner, Mac Carthy</hi> and <hi>O Bryan,</hi> were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for their Journey; but upon this News, they better
conſidered it, and confederated to raiſe a general Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
                  <p>There were many Reaſons why Earl <hi>John</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was not ſucceſsful. The Superſtitious People obſerv'd,
That he had not pay'd his Devotions at S. <hi>Davids,</hi> before he
imbarqued; and attributed it to that. Others blamed him
and his Followers more for their Rude and Ungenteel Abuſe
of the Iriſh Lords and Gentlemen. Others imputed all to
the Debauchery of the Soldiers, who, by the example of
their Captains, were grown Idle and Inſolent: Wherein
they were the more indulged, becauſe they were ill paid.
To theſe may be added the Litigiouſneſs of the Natives in
Towns and Cities; who were perpetually wrangling with
and ſuing ſuch new Inhabitants as came to ſettle among
them. But there was a greater Cauſe than all theſe; which
aroſe from the different Intereſts then in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>luenced
the Normans, Engliſh, Welch, and the Natives.
The Normans were moſt in Favour, and conſequently lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious;
they always followed the Court, and hated to be
put in Frontier Garriſons or Places of Danger: They were
(ſays <hi>Cambrenſis</hi>) great Talkers, Boaſters and Swearers,
very Proud, and Contemners of all others, greedy of Places
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65997:52"/>
of Places of Honour and Profit, but backward in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
any hazardous and dangerous Action, or performing
any Service that might deſerve them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, many of the Engliſh and Welch were diſpoſſeſt
of their beſt and ſafeſt Caſtles, to make Room for the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and forc'd to take others, in Exchange, on the Frontiers;
by which means they were impoveriſh'd and diſcourag'd.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, That ſeveral of the faithful Iriſh, who had
ſubmitted to the Engliſh Government, and lived within their
Quarters; and thereby became acquainted with the Engliſh
Converſations, Humors, Strength, Policies, Seats and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
were likewiſe diſpoſſeſs'd, to make Room for the
Normans, and thereby forced to revolt to the Iriſh, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the moſt Dangerous of all the Enemies, as being moſt
Knowing and moſt Provok'd. And thus it came to paſs,
that after Earl <hi>John</hi> had waſted his Army in ſmall and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Skirmiſhes, and had ſtaid eight months, and done no
other Good, than that he built the Caſtle of <hi>Tybrach</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

And ſoon after his arrival, he made a Progreſs into <hi>Munſter</hi>

four Knights, and a great part of the Garriſon of <hi>Ardfinin:</hi> And
ſoon after, by a Slight, drew that Garriſon into an Ambuſh,
by expoſing a Prey to their View, which they thought to
have taken; but he fell upon them and ſurprized and ſlew
moſt of them. But the Iriſh had not ſo good luck in <hi>Meath,</hi>
where they of <hi>Kenally</hi> had made Incurſions and taken a Prey,
for <hi>William Petit</hi> reſcued the Prey, defeated them with great
Slaughter, and ſent an hundred of their Heads to <hi>Dublin.</hi>

revenged the Murder, and reduced all things to quiet.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems, afterwards there grew ſome Diſtaſt between
<hi>Courcy</hi> and <hi>Lacy,</hi> ſo that <hi>Lacy,</hi> who was the better Courtier,
ſupplanted <hi>Courcy,</hi> who was the better Soldier, and got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

This <hi>Courcy</hi> came from <hi>Stoke-courcy,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Stoguſſy,</hi>

Iriſh perceiving, and alſo that the King of <hi>England</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring

to yield any Obedience to the Engliſh again.<note place="margin">Ibid, 162.</note> And to begin
the Buſineſs, they fell upon <hi>Roger Poer,</hi> Governour of <hi>Leigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>

able to aſſemble twenty thouſand Men of his own and the

S. <hi>Lawrence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who made more Haſte than good Speed, for
he came away with thirty Horſe and two hundred Foot, and
at <hi>Knockmoy,</hi> in the County of <hi>Galway,</hi> fell into an Ambuſh,
the King of <hi>Connaught</hi> had laid for him; and tho' they fought
ſo valiantly, that they killed one thouſand Iriſh Men, yet the
Iſſue was, That this ſmall Army was totally deſtroyed, not
one eſcaping.</p>

And tho' <hi>O Connor,</hi> in Remembrance and Oſtentation of

                     <hi>anno</hi> 1203.) confirmed <hi>Ralph le Petit</hi> in the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick:
Nevertheleſs <hi>Owen</hi> ſo managed the Matter, that he
enjoyed the Archbiſhoprick, and was reſtored to the King's
Favour: He had the Character of an Honeſt and Worthy
Prelate; and was preſent at the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> in Quality
of Primate of all <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King had given to <hi>William de Braos</hi> and his Heirs, the
Honour of <hi>Limerick,</hi> with the Appurtenances, as <hi>Henry</hi> II,

                  <p>But I do not find that <hi>William de Braoſa</hi> had any great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

and abhorring the Murder of Duke <hi>Arthur,</hi> the King's Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew;
which he verily believed was done by the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

                  <p>And as for <hi>Courcy,</hi> the King, to mortifie him, appointed
his Inveterate Enemy and Competitor,
<hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1203.</note> Lord Juſtice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and gave him Order
to arreſt <hi>Courcy,</hi> and ſend him Priſoner to <hi>England:</hi> But
<hi>Courcy</hi> had ſome Intelligence, or at leaſt Jealouſie, of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;

and therefore kept upon his Guard ſo cautiouſly, that

                  <p>After this Bloody Victory, <hi>Courcy</hi> offered the Combat,
which the Lord Juſtice (in his Politick Capacity) refuſed
to undergo againſt a Subject and a Traytor; wherefore he
took a wiſer Courſe, and by his Proclamation offered a large
Reward to him that ſhould bring in <hi>Courcy</hi> alive or dead:

the Slaughter of two of the <hi>S. Lawrences,</hi> who attended
their Unkle <hi>Courcy</hi> that Day: But the Traytors paid dear
for their Perfidiouſneſs; for <hi>Courcy,</hi> with a Wooden Croſs,
which he got in the Church-Yard, killed thirteen of them;
and the reſt were ſent by the Lord Juſtice into <hi>England,</hi> with
this Paſport (which they were obliged not to open, till they
were in Neceſſity of it.)</p>

                     <hi>I Hugh de Lacy,</hi> Lord Juſtice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Servant to my

                  <p>Know ye, That theſe Men, whoſe Names are underwritten,
ſometimes ſerved Sir <hi>John de Courcy,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Ulſter,</hi>
but now in Durance, in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and for a Sum
of Mony betraied their own Maſter into my Hands, I deem them
no better than <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor: How hardly ſoever I have
conceived of <hi>Courcy,</hi> I hold them to be a thouſand times more
damnable Traytors. Wherefore let no Subject in the King's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
give them any Entertainment; but ſpit in their Faces,
and ſuffer them to rogue and wander about as Jews.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Juſtice provided a Barque and Victuals for them,
but denyed them Pilots or Seamen; ſo that being ſufficiently
toſſed at Sea, they were driven into <hi>Cork,</hi> and were there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and afterward hanged, by Order of <hi>Lacy;</hi> who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf Generous in this one thing, That though he loved
the Treaſon, he hated the Traytor.</p>
                  <p>And thus was the Valiant <hi>Courcy</hi> condemned to perpetual
Impriſonment in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and that <hi>Lacy</hi> might
perſonally ſolicit a Reward for this great Service, he had
leave to come to Court: And,</p>

of the unſetledneſs of the Country, and the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>
                     <q>Not long after,<note place="margin">Hanmer, 184.</note> there fell ſome Difference between <hi>John</hi>
King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> for the Right of
ſome Fort in <hi>Normandy;</hi> who to avoid the ſhedding of
Chriſtian Blood, agreed of each Side, to put it to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat:
Of King <hi>Philip</hi>'s part there was a French-man in
Readineſs; King <hi>John,</hi> upon the ſudden, wiſt not what to do
for a Champion to encounter with him; at length one
attending upon his Perſon, enformed him, That there was
one <hi>Courcy</hi> in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> the only Man in his
Dominions (if he would undertake it) to anſwer the
Challenge. King <hi>John</hi> joyful of this, ſent the firſt, yea
the ſecond and third Time, promiſing large Rewards and
rich Gifts; and that it ſtood him upon, as far as the Honour
of his Crown and Kingdom did reach, to make good
the Combat. <hi>Courcy</hi> anſwered very frowardly, (the
which was taken in good Part, in regard of the urgent
Neceſſity) That he would never fight for him, neither for
any ſuch as he was: That he was not worthy to have one
Drop of Blood ſpilt for him: That he was not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
him the Wrongs he had done him; neither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
him the Hearts-Eaſe he had bereav'd him of: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Premiſes, he was willing, and would
with all Expedition be ready to venture his Life in Defence
of the Crown and his Country. Whereupon it was agreed,
He ſhould be dyeted, apparelled and armed to his Content;
and that his own Sword ſhould be brought him out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The Day came, the Place appointed, the Liſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
the Scaffolds ſet up, the Princes with their Nobility
of each Side, with thouſands in Expectation; forth comes
the French Champion, gave a turn, and reſts him in his
Tent: They ſent for <hi>Courcy,</hi> who all this while was truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of himſelf about with ſtrong Points; and anſwered
the Meſſengers, That if any of their Company were to go
to ſuch a Banquet, he would make no great haſte: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
forth he comes, gave a Turn, and went into his
Tent.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When the Trumpets ſounded to Battle, forth came the
Combitants, and viewed each other: <hi>Courcy</hi> beheld him
with a wonderful ſtern Countenance, and paſſed by: The
French-man not liking his grim Look, the ſtrong Proportion
and Feature of his Perſon, ſtalked ſtill along; and when the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65997:58"/>
Trumpets ſounded the laſt Charge, <hi>Courcy</hi> drew out his
Sword, and the French-man ran away, and conveyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to <hi>Spain.</hi> Whereupon they ſounded Victory, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
clapt their Hands and caſt up their Caps. King <hi>Philip</hi>
deſired King <hi>John,</hi> That <hi>Courcy</hi> might be called before them,
to ſhew ſome Part of his Strength and Manhood, by a Blow
upon a Helmet; it was agreed, a Stake was ſet in the
Ground, and a Shirt of Male, and a Helmet thereon;
<hi>Courcy</hi> drew his Sword, looked wonderful ſternly upon the
Princes, cleft the Helmet, Shirt of Mail, and the Stake ſo
far in, that none could pull it out but himſelf. Then the
Princes demanded of him, What he meant to look ſo
ſowerly upon them? His anſwer was, If he had miſſed his
Blow upon the Block, he would have cut off both the Kings
Heads. All that he ſaid was taken in good Part; and
King <hi>John</hi> diſcharged him of all his Troubles, gave him
great Gifts, and reſtored him to his former Poſſeſſions in
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is written further, That hereupon he ſailed into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
came to <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> offered himſelf to the Sea, and
was put back again fifteen times, by contrary Winds,
which roſe upon a ſudden to the Engliſh Shore.</q> And in the
Book of <hi>Houth</hi> it is delivered, That upon every Repulſe, the
Night following, he was admoniſhed in a Viſion, Not to
attempt the Seas, for to ſail into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that he ſhould
never ſet Foot upon any Land there; and withal, that the
Reaſon was yielded thus; <hi>Courcy</hi> thou haſt done very ill,
for thou haſt pulled down the Maſter, and ſet up the Servant
(for he had tranſlated the Cathedral Church, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries
of the Bleſſed Trinity in <hi>Dune,</hi> into an Abbey of
Black Monks, brought thither from <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and conſecrated
the ſame to the Honour of S. <hi>Patrick).</hi> Whereupon remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
himſelf, That he had done very ill, in taking the

upon himſelf, That he was worthily puniſhed; and
immediately he altered his Courſe, went into <hi>France,</hi> and
there died.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis Time to return to our Lord Juſtice who was ſent

to build a Bridge over the <hi>Liffy,</hi> where they pleaſed:
And not long after, they alſo got a Fee-Farm of the City of

                  </p>
                  <p>About this Time, <hi>viz. 2 Hen.</hi> 3. the King wrote to <hi>Ireland</hi>

which made many good Canons. But the Lord Juſtice had
diſpleaſed the King by his male-adminiſtration of Affairs in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> or perhaps had undertaken the <hi>Cruſado;</hi> I cannot
determine which; but for the one reaſon or the other he
was removed; and,
<hi>Henry de Londres</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">April 23. 1219.</note> was made Lord

his Tenants Leaſes, and other Writings which they brought
to ſhew him, but this ſilly Story is not to be believ'd of ſo
Learned a Man, and ſo good a Governour, as every body
allows this Archbiſhop to have been; eſpecially ſince it is
not denied, but that he ſuffered all his Tenants to enjoy
their Farms, even according to their Claims: It was this
Lord Juſtice that built the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin, anno</hi> 1220.<note place="margin">1220.</note> And
about the ſame time died at <hi>London, William,</hi> Earl Marſhal,
Protector of the King and his Kingdoms. Some <hi>Iriſh</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65997:61"/>
He was ſucceeded by his Son <hi>William;</hi> againſt whom the
Biſhop of <hi>Fernes</hi> complained to the King, That his Father had
diſſeis'd the Church of two Mannors; for which reaſon he
was excommunicated, and ſo died. The King commanded
the Biſhop to go to the Earls Tomb, and to abſolve him; and
promis'd that he would endeavour his Satisfaction.<note place="margin">Hanmer, 176.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
the Biſhop, accompanied with the King, went to the
Grave, and ſaid, <hi>O</hi> William, <hi>that here lieſt wrapped in the
Bonds of Excommunication, if what thou haſt injuriouſly taken,
be reſtored by the King, or thy Heir, or thy Friends, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
ſatisfaction, I abſolve thee; otherwiſe, I ratifie the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that being wrapped in thy Sins, thou maiſt remain damned
in Hell for ever.</hi> The King was diſſatisfied with the rigour
of the Biſhop, but could not prevail with the young Earl to
part with any thing of his Eſtate; wherefore the Biſhop
confirm'd his Curſe, and it brought no ſmall Veneration to
the Clergy, that this Earl and his four Brethren died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Iſſue; which the Superſtitious People thought to be the
Effect of that Execration.</p>
                  <p>The young Earl Marſhal had great Conteſts with <hi>Hugh de
Lacy</hi> Earl of <hi>Vlſter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1221.</note> ſo that <hi>Meath</hi> was wonderfully haraſs'd
between them; <hi>Trim</hi> was alſo beſieged, and reduced to an
ill condition; but it had the good Fortune to eſcape this
Bruſh,<note place="margin">Hanmer, 189.</note> and to have a ſtrong Caſtle built ſoon after, to
prevent the like Calamities for the future.<note place="margin">6 Hen. 3.</note> About this
time,<note place="margin">Davis, 15. 123.</note> the King granted to <hi>O Brian</hi> King of <hi>Thomond,</hi> the
Country of <hi>Thomond, habendum</hi> during the Kings Minority,
rendring an hundred and thirty Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> which is
the only Grant made by the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to any meer
<hi>Iriſhman</hi> to that time, except that to the King of <hi>Connaught.</hi>
And before this,<note place="margin">Davis, 124.</note> 
                     <hi>viz. 3 H. 3. Richard de Burgo</hi> for one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

                  <p>The Lord Juſtice (who was alſo Archbiſhop and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate)
did in his Spiritual Capacity too much encroach on
the Temporal Jurisdiction; and therefore upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the Citizens of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. 9. 7 H. 3.</note> he had a notable increpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

the King ſent another Writ to the Juſtice, to redreſs a Nuſance

                  </p>
                  <p>I find ſome Reaſons to believe, that the Lord Juſtice <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres</hi>

by <hi>Geofry de Mariſco</hi> till his Return, <hi>Octob.</hi> 28. the ſame

                  <p>About the ſame Time the King prohibited Appeals to be

                     <note place="margin">Lamb. 19.</note> ſeverely reprimanded him for ſending to the Pope,

                  <p>The King, in the fifth Year of his Reign, had granted
to the Citizens of <hi>Dublin,</hi> towards walling their City,
three Pence out of every Sack of Wool, ſix Pence for every
Laſt of Hides, and two Pence out of every Barrel of Wine
ſold in their City;<note place="margin">1225.</note> and now, 9 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. he gave them fifty
Marks in Mony to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>On the tenth Day of <hi>June, 10 Hen.</hi> 3. A Writ was ſent
to the Lord Juſtice, to ſeize on the Country of <hi>Connaught,</hi>
forfeited by <hi>O Connor,</hi>

for the Conveniency and Support of that Garriſon:
But on the firſt Day of <hi>Auguſt, 10 Hen. 3.
Geofry de Mariſco</hi> was made Lord Juſtice, and had a Sallary
of five hundred Marks, payable out of the Exchequer, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him. It is probable, That ſoon after his Arrival,
his Predeceſſor <hi>William,</hi> Earl Marſhal, repaired to Court,
to give the King an Account of his Adminiſtration: And the
Iriſh were forward to take Advantage of his Abſence, and
the ill Poſture of the King's Affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore,
to make the beſt Uſe they could of this Opportunity, they
made ſo general a Confederacy, that their Army amounted
to twenty thouſand Men, <hi>Sperantes</hi> (ſays my Author) <hi>ſe

But all this Oſtentation came to nothing, and this numerous
Rabble were without much Difficulty defeated by <hi>Hugh de

Alledging, That he was a loyal Subject, and payed for his

King, That he would rid him of that baſe Upſtart or new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer,<note place="margin">1235.</note>

immediately ordered the Lord Juſtice, To pluck up by the
Root the Fruitleſs Plant which <hi>Hubert de Burgo</hi> (whilſt he
was in Ruff) had planted in thoſe Parts, that it might bud
no more. The King alſo wrote to the Nobility of <hi>Ireland,</hi>

                  <p>It is certain the Anſwer to this Writ was in the Negative;
and I ſuppoſe the Reaſon was, That ſince the Iriſh generally
were not amenſnable to the Law, but ſtill uſed, and would

                  </p>
                  <p>It is to be remembred, That the Oaſtmen or Eaſterlings,
had generally the benefit of the Engliſh Laws, by Charters
from King <hi>Henry</hi> to each City: That of <hi>Waterford</hi> is to be
ſeen in Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> his excellent Diſcourſe, pag. 94. And
it was this Year confirmed by King <hi>Edward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great part of the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> was this Year burnt,<note place="margin">1283.</note> and

                  <p>The Lords and Potentates of <hi>Ophaly</hi> were grown ſtrong
enough to take and burn the Caſtle of <hi>Ley;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1285.</note> and it ſeems
<hi>Theobald Verdon</hi> going to revenge that Injury, loſt both his
Men and his Horſes; which was followed with a greater
Misfortune, for the next Morning <hi>Girald Fitz-Maurice</hi> was
betrayed by his Followers, and taken Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>Nor had the Engliſh better Succeſs at <hi>Rathdod,</hi> for in an
unfortunate Skirmiſh there, Sir <hi>Gerard Doget, Ralph Petit,</hi>
and many more were ſlain; and the Lord <hi>Geofry Genevil</hi> had
much ado to ſave himſelf by Flight.</p>
                  <p>Amidſt theſe Diſturbances,<note place="margin">Burlace, 31.</note> the Lord Juſtice obtained
from the King a Penſion of five hundred Pound <hi>per annum,</hi>
for his Expence and Charge in the Government, to continue
as long as his Juſticeſhip; but if any extraordinary Accident
ſhould require more Expence, than the Writ preſcribes,
That a Vice-Treaſurer be appointed, to receive and pay the
Revenue, as the Lord Juſtice and the Court of Exchequer
ſhall think fit.</p>
                  <p>But the next Year was more favourable,<note place="margin">1286.</note> ſo that <hi>Philip
Stanton,</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> burnt <hi>Norwagh</hi> and <hi>Ardſcol,</hi> and
other Towns; and the great Rebel <hi>Calwagh</hi> was taken at
<hi>Kildare;</hi> which ſuperſeded theſe Stirs for a Time.</p>

Nevertheleſs, this Year was fatal to many Noblemen,

Army as far as <hi>Trim:</hi> However, this was in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
recompenced, by the Plenty of the Year, which was
ſo great, (even in <hi>England</hi>) that a Buſhel of Wheat was
ſold for four Pence.</p>
                  <p>It was uſual in this King's Reign, To ſend the new Engliſh
Statutes, in ſome reaſonable time after they were made, to
be proclaimed and obſerved in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Thus, in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Year of his Reign, he ſent by <hi>Roger Bretun</hi> the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the firſt, of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> of Merchants,
and of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the ſecond, to the Lord Juſtice (<hi>Fulborne</hi>)
to publiſh and notifie them to the People: And this Year the
like was done by the Statute called, <hi>Ordinatio pro Statu Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berniae,</hi>
which was enacted in <hi>England,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Ireland,</hi>
to be obſerved there; and is to be ſeen in French, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of the Ancient Statutes, printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1532.
And the Statutes of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and of <hi>York</hi> were alſo ſent to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ex lib. Alb. Scac. Hib.</note>
to be enrolled in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and to be publiſhed and
notified to the People, 20 <hi>Novemb. 17 Edw.</hi> 1. And it is to
be obſerved, That after Parliaments were held in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
yet the Engliſh Statutes did extend to <hi>Ireland;</hi> as the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>Edward</hi> III,<note place="margin">Lib. M. Lamb.</note>

the Promotion of Clerks of the Iriſh Nation;</hi> and
many more.</p>
                  <p>But it is time to return to the Lord Juſtice, whoſe Service
the King had occaſion to make uſe of in <hi>England,</hi> and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Foreign Embaſſies; in all which he behaved himſelf
honourably: He was ſucceeded in <hi>Ireland</hi> by</p>

                     <hi>William Veſcy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">15 Novemb. 1290.</note> Lord Juſtice: Whoſe Government was
diſturbed by <hi>O Hanlon</hi> in <hi>Vlſter,</hi> and <hi>O Mlaghlin</hi> in <hi>Meath,</hi>
who were again in Rebellion; but <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Vlſter</hi>
had the good Fortune to ſuppreſs <hi>O Hanlon</hi> with a few Blows;
and the Lord Juſtice did as much for <hi>O Mlaghlin,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
him ſo cloſe, that at laſt he was taken and ſlain by <hi>Mac
Coughlan;</hi> who grew ſo proud, upon that Service, that he
ſet up for himſelf, and gave a great Defeat to <hi>William Burk,</hi>
at <hi>Delvin,</hi> and to the Engliſh in <hi>Ophaly.</hi>

And tho' the King, in the thirteenth Year of his Reign,
had a Grant from the Pope of the Tenth of all Eccleſiaſtical
Revenues in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for ſeven Years, toward the Holy War,
which was followed with a Grant of a Fifteenth, from the
Temporality; yet now, upon the Expiration of that Grant,
he wrote to the Biſhops and Clergy for a Diſm of their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualities,
to defray his Debts in redeeming his Nephew
<hi>Charles.</hi> But they unanimouſly anſwered, <hi>Quod conceſſioni

                     <hi>Baliol</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> did Homage,

                  <p>But now there aroſe great Feuds between <hi>John Fitz-Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Fitz-Girald,</hi> Lord of <hi>Ophaly,</hi> and the Lord Juſtice;
whereupon the Lord Juſtice did (underhand) encourage the
Iriſh to do all the Prejudice they could to <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> and his

I <hi>John Fitz-Girald,</hi> Baron of <hi>Ophalie,</hi> do tell thee <hi>William
Veſcie,</hi> a ſinge-Sole Gentleman, that I am no Traytor, no
Felon; and that thou art the only Buttreſs, by which the
Kings Enemies are ſupported: the mean and Inſtrument by
which his Majeſties Subjects are daily ſpoiled: Therefore,
I, as a Loyal Subject, ſay Traytor to thy Teeth; and that
ſhalt thou well underſtand, when we both ſhall be brought
to the Rehearſal of theſe Matters before our Betters. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
during the time you bear Office, I am reſolv'd to give

on both ſides were raiſed, with high and mighty words and

than <hi>Veſcie</hi> (after he had ſubſtituted <hi>William Hay</hi>

the occaſion of their ſudden Arrivals, to the end the Truth

                           <q>AS I muſt acknowledge my ſelf ſomewhat aggrieved,
to be entangled in ſo intricate a Matter; ſo I am glad
as heart can think, that ſo weighty a controverſie is brought
to the deciding of ſo upright an Umpire: And whereas it
ſtood with your Majeſties Pleaſure, with the Advice of this
your Honourable Council, That I, as unworthy, ſhould have
the Government of your Realm of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and during my
Time, your Majeſties Subjects have been, (I may not deny
it) diverſly annoyed, for my Diſcharge, as I ſaid, in <hi>Ireland:</hi>
                              <pb n="81" facs="tcp:65997:72"/>
So I avow here in <hi>England,</hi> that he kneeleth here before
your Highneſs (pointing to the Baron of <hi>Ophaelie</hi>) that is
the Root and Crop of all theſe Enormities; for it is well
known that he beareth that ſtroke with the Iriſh, as if he
once but frown at them, they dare not be ſo hardy as once
to peak out of their Cabbins: And whereas his Force doth
greatly amaze them, think you but his Countenance doth
wonderfully encourage them? To the furtherance of which,
it is apparently known, and it ſhall be proved, that he hath
not only in hucker mucker, by ſundry Meſſages imboldned
your Majeſties Enemies, to ſpoil your Subjects; but alſo by
his perſonal Preſence, in ſecret Meetings, he gave them
ſuch Courage, as neither the Royalty of your Highneſs,
nor the Authority of your Deputy, neither the force of your
Laws, nor the ſtrength of your puiſſant Army, was able
to quench the Flame of theſe Hurly-burlies, that through
his traiterous drifts were enkindled: Theſe, and the like
Enormities, through his privy packing with Rebels, being
daily committed, to bring me, your Majeſties Governour in
the hatred of the People, his Adherents both ſecretly mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and openly exclaimed againſt me and my Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as though the Redreſs of all theſe Harms had wholly
lain in mine hands.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Whereupon, being in conference with ſuch as were the
Chieftains of your Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> albeit I took it to be
expedient, to point with my Finger to the very Sink or
Head-ſpring of all the Treaſons that by ſecret Conſpiracies
were pretended and practiſed againſt your Majeſty and your
Subjects; yet notwithſtanding having more regard to Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
than to the Deſerts of the Baron of <hi>Ophalie,</hi> I did but
glance at his packing in ſuch ſecret ſort, as none, or very
few of the Company could gueſs, whom with my miſty
Speeches I did touch. And as commonly the galled Horſe
doth ſooneſt kick; ſo this Gentleman, being prickt, as it
ſhould ſeem, with the ſting of his guilty Conſcience, brake
out on a ſudden, and forgetting his Allegiance to your
Highneſs, and his Duty to me, your Deputy; he took me
up ſo roughly, as though I had been rather his Underling,
than his Governor: The Sum of which deſpightful Speeches
I refer to the Teſtimony of the honourable Audience where
they were delivered. As for his manifold Treaſons, I am
aſhamed to rehearſe ſuch things as he did not ſtick to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
And if it ſhall ſtand with your Majeſties Pleaſure,
to adjourn the Trial for a few days, I will charge him with
ſuch apparent <hi>Items,</hi> as were his Face made of Braſs, he
ſhall not be able to deny any one Article that ſhall be book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

he ſpake, ſhould be holden for Goſpel, this had
been no fit Place for ſo arrant a Traitor, as he, with his feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
gloſſing, would gladly prove me to be. But ſith it pleaſed
your Majeſty, with ſo indifferent Ballance, to ponder both
our Tales; I am throughly perſwaded, that my loyal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
ſhall be able to overpoize his forged Treachery.
Your Majeſty hath heard many Words to ſmall purpoſe;
and as his Complaint hitherto hath been generally hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up, ſo my Anſwer thereto may not particularly be
framed. Whereas therefore, he termeth me a Supporter
of Thieves, a Packer with Rebels, and a Conſpirator with
Traitors; If I ſhould but with a bare word deny the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
all his gay Gloſs of glittering Speeches would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
fade away: Yea, but he craveth reſpite for the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Articles: Truly ſo he hath need; for loitering and
lingring is the only way he may deviſe to cloak his Feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Forging; wherein he ſheweth himſelf as crafty, as
the Philoſopher was accounted wiſe, that promiſed a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
upon menacing words, to School his Aſs in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
ſo he had ſeven years reſpite; becauſe that in that
ſpace he was perſwaded, that either the Tyrant, the Aſs,
or he would die. In like wiſe Mr. <hi>Veſcie,</hi> upon reſpite
granted him, would hang in hope, that either the Life of
your Majeſty (which God forbid) ſhould be ſhortned, or
that I, in tract of time, would be disfavoured; or that
he by one ſubtile Prank or other ſhould be of this heavy
Load disburthened,</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But if I have been as many years a Malefactor, as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth,
how happeneth it, that his Tongue was tied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this late Diſſention begun? Why did he not from time
to time advertize the Council of my Treaſons? Whereas
now it may be probably conjectured, that he was edg'd to
this Service rather for the hatred he beareth me, than for
any love he oweth your Royal Majeſty,</q>

                        <p>
                           <q>Touching the Words I ſpake in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I purpoſe not
for ought I heard as yet, to eat them in <hi>England.</hi> And
when I ſhall be call'd to teſtifie ſuch Speeches as I delivered
there, I will not be found ſo raw in my Matter, as to loſe
my Errand in the Carriage, as Mr. <hi>Veſcie</hi> hath done, or to
crave further reſpite for the regiſtring of his manifold Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
As for my ſecret Meetings with Iriſh Rebels, were
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65997:73"/>
I perſwaded (Mr. <hi>Veſcie</hi>) that you were able to prove
them; I would be found willing to acknowledge them;
for if my Conſcience were ſo deeply ſtung, as you pretend,
I would take it for better policy, by acknowledging my
Treſpaſs, to appeal to my King's Mercy, than by denying
my Faults, to ſtand to the rigour of his Juſtice.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And as for Meetings, I never had ſo many in Woods with
Rebels, as you, Mr. <hi>Veſcie,</hi> have had in your Chamber with
Cows; For it hath been manifeſtly apparent, that when the
Baron of <hi>Ophaly,</hi> and the beſt of the Nobility of <hi>Ireland</hi> have
been imbarr'd from entring your Chamber, an Iriſh Cow
ſhould have at all times acceſs unto you. No, Mr. <hi>Veſcie,</hi> a
Cow, an Horſe, an Hawk, and a Silver Cup have been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of your Slackneſs: when the Subjects were preided,
you would be content to wink at their Miſery, ſo that your
mouth were ſtopt with Bribery. And when you had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
your Crumbs ſufficiently together, you held it for
a pretty Policy (and yet it was but a bare ſhift) to charge
the Nobility with ſuch packing, as you daily did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.
But you muſt not think that we are Babes, or that
with any ſuch ſtale Device, or groſs jugling Trick, you
may ſo eaſily dusk or dazle our Eyes. Can any man that
is but ſlenderly witted, ſo far be carried, as to believe, that
Mr. <hi>Veſcie,</hi> being the King's Deputy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having his
Majeſties Treaſure, having the Nobility at his Beck, the
Kings Army at his Commandment, but that if he were
diſpoſed to beſtir himſelf, he were able to ferret out ſuch
bare-breech Brats as ſwarm in the Engliſh Pale? If he
ſaid, he could not, we muſt ſmile at his ſimplicity; if he
could and would not, how may he colour his Diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Yea, but I bear ſuch a ſtroak with the Iriſh, as, that upon
any private Quarrel, I am able to annoy them. What then?
Becauſe the Baron of <hi>Ophalie</hi> can revenge his private Injuries
without the aſſiſtance of the Deputy, therefore the Deputy
may not vanquiſh weak and naked Rebels without the
furtherance of the Baron of <hi>Ophalie;</hi> whereas the contrary
ought to be inferr'd, that if a private perſon can tame the
Iriſh, what may then the publick Magiſtrate do that hath
the Princes Pay? But indeed it is hard to take Hares with
Foxes. You muſt not think, Mr. <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſcie,</hi> that you were
ſent Governor into <hi>Ireland</hi> to dandle your Trulls, to pen
your ſelf up within a Town or City, to give Rebels the
Gaze, to peel the Subjects, to animate Traytors, to fill
your Coffers, to make your ſelf by marring true men, to
gather the Birds, whilſt others beat the Buſhes, and after
to impeach the Nobility of ſuch Treaſons as you only have
committed.</q>

                           <q>But for ſo much as our mutual Complaints ſtand upon the
one his Yea, and the other his Nay, and that you would
be taken for a Champion, and I am known to be no Coward,
let us, in God's Name, leave Lying for Varlets, Berding
for Ruffians, Facing for Crackers, Chatting for Twatlers,
Scolding for Callets, Booking for Scriveners, Pleading
for Lawyers; and let us try with the Dint of Sword, as
becomes Martial Men to do, our mutual Quarrels. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to juſtifie that I am a true Subject, and that thou

in Preſence of his Highneſs, and in the hearing of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

Whereupon both the Parties being diſmiſt, until the King's
Pleaſure were further known, It was agreed, at length, by
the Council, That the fitteſt Trial ſhould have been by Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
Wherefore the Parties being as well thereof advertized,
as the Day by the King appointed, no ſmall Proviſion was
made for ſo eager a Combat, as that was preſuppoſed to have
been. But when the prefixed Day approached near, <hi>Veſcie</hi>

diſappointed their good Expectations, and not
only recalled <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> contrary to his Fathers
Expreſs and Laſt Commands, but alſo gave him the thirty

on the twenty ſecond Day of <hi>January</hi> 1307, without any Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

both he and ſhe were crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by <hi>Henry,</hi>

                  <p>As to the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they were little regarded at this

                  <p>Sir <hi>John Wogan</hi> ſtill continued Lord Juſtice; and in <hi>Decem.</hi>
received an Order to ſuppreſs the Knights Templars; which

ſo that the King got four hundred Pounds Worth of

                  <p>This Year proved very unfortunate, as well by the Death
of the famous <hi>Peter de Breminghan,</hi> on the twelfth of <hi>April,</hi>
as by the Rebellious Diſturbances of the Iriſh; amongſt
whom <hi>William mac Balthar</hi> was moſt active, for he and his

and ſlew moſt of the Ward; they alſo burnt the Town of
<hi>Courcowly,</hi> and on the ſixth of <hi>June</hi> diſcomfited the Lord
Juſtice, near <hi>Glandelory,</hi> where <hi>John de S. Hogeline, John
Norton</hi> and <hi>John Breton</hi> were ſlain; and being elevated with
this Succeſs, on the ſixteenth of <hi>June</hi> they burnt <hi>Tobir,
Danlavan,</hi> and many other Villages.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord Juſtice was ſo vigilant, that before the end

                  <p>IV. That the Lord Juſtice take but four Pence for the

By reaſon of the fourteen Years Truce the King had made
with the Scots,<note place="margin">1325.</note> there was not much other Diſturbance in

                     <note place="margin">Holingſhead, 69.</note> the Lady <hi>Alice
Kettle,</hi> whom the Biſhop aſcited to purge her ſelf of the Fame
of Inchantments and Witchcraft, impoſed unto her, and to
one <hi>Petronil</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> her Complices: She was charged to
have nightly Conference with a Spirit called <hi>Robin Artiſſon,</hi>
to whom ſhe ſacrificed in the High-way nine red Cocks and
nine Peacocks Eyes: Alſo that ſhe ſwept the Streets of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi>
between Complin and Twilight, raking all the Filth
towards the Doors of her Son <hi>William Outlaw,</hi> murmuring
and muttering ſecretly with her ſelf theſe Words;
<q>
                        <l>To the Houſe of <hi>William</hi> my Son,</l>
                        <l>Hie all the Wealth of <hi>Kilkenny Town.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>At the firſt Conviction they abjured and did Penance;
but ſhortly after they were found in Relapſe, and then was
<hi>Petronil</hi> burnt at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> the other twain might not be heard
of; ſhe at the Hour of her Death accuſed the ſaid <hi>William,</hi>
as privy to their Sorceries; whom the Biſhop held in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
nine Weeks, forbidding his Keepers to eat or drink
with him, or to ſpeak to him more than once in the Day;
but at length, through the Suit and Inſtance of <hi>Arnold le
Powre,</hi> then Seneſchal of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> he was delivered; and
afterwards he corrupted with Bribes the Seneſchal to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
the Biſhop, ſo that he thruſt him into Priſon for
three Months.</p>
                  <p>In rifling the Cloſet of the Lady, they found a Wafer
of Sacramental Bread, having the Devil's Name ſtamped
thereon: And a Pipe of Oyntment, wherewith ſhe
greaſed a Staff, upon which ſhe ambled and galloped
through thick and thin, when and in what manner ſhe
liſted.</p>
                  <p>This Buſineſs about theſe Witches troubled all the State
of <hi>Ireland</hi> the more, for that the Lady was ſupported by
certain of the Nobility; and laſtly conveyed into <hi>England,</hi>
ſince which Time it could never be underſtood what became
of her.</p>

At Whitſontide,<note place="margin">1326.</note> the Parliament met at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and
thither the Earl of <hi>

what they did does not appear,<note place="margin">Lib. GGG.</note> ſaving that five thouſand
Quarters of Corn were ſent out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Aquitain,</hi>
for the King's uſe about this time; and it is probable they
raiſed Mony to pay for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us, That the Earl of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> made a great
Feaſt, at this Parliament, and that not long after he
died.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt make a ſtep to <hi>England</hi> before we can come
to an end of this Unfortunate Reign; and there we ſhall
find the King (for his Male adminiſtration) in Diſgrace
with his People; and which was worſe, reduced under
the Power and Scorn of an Adulterous Wife; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of theſe things was, That he was firſt impriſoned,
and afterwards murthered in <hi>Berkly</hi>- Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>In this King's Reign flouriſhed the famous Iriſh Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<hi>Johannes Dunus Scotus,</hi> commonly ſtiled <hi>Doctor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis:</hi>
And it was in the ſame Reign that the Lord <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer,</hi>
Owner to Proprietor of <hi>Leix</hi> (now <hi>Queens County</hi>)
being obliged by his Inclination or Buſineſs to reſide in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
did entruſt one of the <hi>Omores</hi> with the management
of his Eſtate; but, in proceſs of time, the Iriſhman ſets up
for himſelf, and for a long time enjoyed that Country, and
ſtill pretends a Right to it, although his Claim is built on
this perfidious and ungrateful Foundation.<note place="margin">Davis, 198, 175.</note> In like manner
did one of the <hi>Cavenaghs</hi> ſerve <hi>Carew,</hi> about the Barony of
<hi>Idrone;</hi> and if I thought that no Body elſe would ever
be ſerved ſo hereafter, I would have omitted this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It appears by the Writ mentioned (<hi>Pryn,</hi> 263.) that the
denized Iriſh would not puniſh Felony with Death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Writ enjoyns them that are,<note place="margin">14 Edw. 2.</note> and them that ſhall
be denized for the future, to ſubmit to the Engliſh Laws in
that particular; which confirms my former Obſervation,
That the Iriſh were fond of the Benefit of the Engliſh
Laws, but were very averſe from the Penalties of
them.</p>

And by another Writ (recited, <hi>Pryn,</hi> 263.) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,

They grew ſo formidable, even to the Cities and
Towns, that they fortified and provided againſt them; but
upon notice of this, the Confederates immediately ſent word
to the Lord Juſtice, that they deſign'd no prejudice to the
King or his Towns; but had aſſembled, to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

And now the Lord <hi>William Burk</hi> and <hi>Arnold Poer</hi> returned
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a Parliament was call'd at <hi>Dublin,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the Reconciliation between them on the one ſide, and
the <hi>Butlers, Geraldines</hi> and <hi>Birminghams</hi> on the other; which, it
ſeems, was begun at the aforeſaid Parliament at <hi>Northampton,</hi>
and now effected at this Parliament in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Whereupon,
the Earl of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> made a great Feaſt in the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and the next day after, the Lord <hi>Maurice Fitz-Thomas</hi> did
the like at St. <hi>Patricks</hi>-Church, although it was in the time
of Lent.</p>
                  <p>But a ſtrange Accident fell out at this Parliament; for the
Lord Juſtice was forc'd to purge himſelf of Hereſie,<note place="margin">Camb. 182.</note> which
the Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory</hi> laid to his Charge, becauſe he had abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one Sir <hi>Arnold Poer,</hi> whom the Biſhop had condemned
of certain Heretical Opinions; But the Lord Juſtice made
appear, that the Biſhops Proceedings were partial and unjuſt,
in favour of a Kinſman of the Biſhops, who began the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with <hi>Poer;</hi> and that therefore he (the Juſtice) ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Cauſe of the Oppreſſed; and ſo, after a very ſolemn
Purgation, the Lord Juſtice was acquitted, and declared a
true Son of the Church; whereupon, he made a great Feaſt
for all Comers.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the unfortunate <hi>Poer</hi> (who had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

Mercy, the Prieſt was the firſt Man they wounded, and after
they had ſpurned the Hoſt with their Feet, they compleated
their Sacrilege by burning the Church, Prieſt, People and all.
Nor did they regard the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, nor the
Pope's Interdict, which afterwards iſſued againſt them; on
the contrary, in all their Actions they manifeſted an entire
contempt both of Ethicks and Chriſtianity, ſo that one
would think the Poet propheſied of theſe Men, when he
ſaid,

Sir <hi>Philip Stanton</hi> had the ill Luck to be ſlain by the

                     <note place="margin">3 June, 1331.</note> a Man of great Authority in <hi>England,</hi>
was ſent over Lord Juſtice; he brought with him the Lord

others of the Nobility, to give their beſt aſſiſtance to him

                  <p>The Lord Juſtice deſigned by a ſevere Government to
correct and reform the Diſtempers of thoſe Times; but, alaſs,
it was too great an Undertaking for one Man, and required
more time than he had to ſpend in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, his Government was auſpicated with a Victory,
which thoſe of the Engliſh Pale (on the eleventh of <hi>June</hi>)
obtained over the Iriſh at <hi>Finnagh</hi> in <hi>Meath.</hi> And though there
was a great Dearth and Scarcity ſtill continuing, yet it was
ſomewhat moderated by the great Plenty of large Fiſhes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

in a prodigious number, for the relief of the Poor.</p>
                  <p>A Parliament was ſummoned to meet at <hi>Dublin</hi> at Mid-ſummer
(by which it is manifeſt, that they did not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
practiſe the formality of forty Days Summons); the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
was ſo thin, that the Parliament was adjourned to
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to the ſeventh of <hi>July:</hi> And thither came <hi>Thomas</hi>
Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and others that were not at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
were freely pardoned what was paſt, being firſt ſworn on

and Preſervation of the peace for the future:</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Lord Juſtice received the bad News,

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:65997:88"/>
Whereupon he grew jealous, That ſome of thoſe Engliſh
Lords that abſented themſelves from the Parliament at <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi>
did underhand abet the Iriſh, or elſe they durſt not ſo
frequently rebel; and therefore he reſolved to apprehend as
many of them as he could get: And firſt, <hi>Henry Mandevil</hi>
was, by Warrant from the Chief Juſtice, taken in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember;</hi>
and <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Deſmond</hi> (being arreſted in <hi>Limerick,</hi>

and afterwards ſent to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems there was more than bare Suſpicion in this Matter,
for the Lord <hi>William Birmingham,</hi> who had often done good
Service for his King and Country, was nevertheleſs executed
the eleventh of <hi>July</hi> 1332. and his Son <hi>Walter</hi> had not eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                  <p>But let us look back to the third of <hi>March</hi> 1331. at which

to pay a Fine of one thouſand Crowns for that Miſdemeanour;
but the Archbiſhop died before the Fine was paid. And
about this time Proceſs iſſued to levy the ſame on the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities

the former were properly Parliaments, and in them
the three Eſtates were aſſembled; and this ſort of Parliament
is intended in the Submiſſion of <hi>Mac. Mahon, 25. Hen.</hi> 6.
whereby he promiſeth, that in time of Arch-Parliaments, he
will carry nothing away out of the Engliſh Pale, contrary to

after all, there were but very few Cities or Corporations that
were concerned in, or ſummoned to an Iriſh Parliament, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
of later Days. The Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> did indeed aſſociate
with the Deputies of many Towns, in his Aſſembly at <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny;</hi>

                  <p>But let us return to the Lord Juſtice,<note place="margin">1345.</note> who ſummoned a

                  <p>It is probable that <hi>Deſmond</hi> was ſo mortified with this

it was eſtreated into the Exchequer; and though the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and ſome of the Knights, made a ſhift to get rid of this
matter, yet eighteen of the Knights loſt their Eſtates, and
were utterly ruined thereby.</p>
                  <p>This Lord Juſtice did alſo uſe means to apprehend the Earl
of <hi>Kildare,</hi> which at laſt he effected, and kept him in Priſon,
where he continued till the twenty ſixth of <hi>May,</hi> 1346. and
then he was diſcharged by the new Juſtice, on the Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance
of twenty four Lords and Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>About this time, <hi>viz. 18 Edw.</hi> 3. Seals were made for the
Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And
the King pardoned the Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> (late Treaſurer

be able to do great Feats without the aſſiſtance of the old
Engliſh; and therefore he alſo proclaimed, That none of

Caſhel, Tuam, Liſſmore, Waterford, Killaloo, Oſſory, Leigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
and <hi>Cloyne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. D.</note> (who were preſent at this Parliament) did
fulminate an Excommunication againſt the Tranſgreſſors of
that Law. The Lords and Commons ſat together, at the
making of it; and the Statute it ſelf is in French, and to be
ſeen at large in the Library at <hi>Lambeth, libro</hi> D. but the effect
of it is,</p>
                  <p>That the Brehon Law is an evil Cuſtom,<note place="margin">Davis, 112, 191.</note> and that it be
Treaſon to uſe it: That Marriage, Nurſing and Goſſiping
with the Iriſh be Treaſon: That the uſe of Iriſh Name, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
or Language be puniſhed with the loſs of Lands or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
until the Party give Security to conform: That
the Engliſh ſhould not make War upon the Iriſh, without
Order of the State: That the Engliſh ſhould not permit the
Iriſh to Creaght or graze upon their Land: Nor preſent an
Iriſhman to an Eccleſiaſtical Benefice: Nor receive them into
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65997:96"/>
Monaſteries or Religious Houſes: Nor entertain any of their
Minſtrels, Rhimers or News-tellers: Nor ceſs Horſe or Foot
upon the Engliſh Subject, againſt his Will, on Pain of Felony:
And that Sheriffs might enter any Liberty or Franchiſe,
to apprehend Felons or Traytors: And that four Wardens
of the Peace ſhould be appointed in every County, equally
to aſſeſs every Man's Proportion of the publick Charge for
Men and Armour.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems this Statute did not affect the Iriſh, becauſe
they were not ameſnable to Law, for notwithſtanding this
Act, the Iriſh did always uſe their Brehon Law, until the
third Year of King <hi>James</hi> I.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs this Law,<note place="margin">Davis, 193.</note> together with the Preſence of the
King's Son, and the Diſcipline he uſed, did very much reform
the degenerate Engliſh; ſo that the Revenues certain and
caſual of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> and <hi>Connaught</hi> were thenceforward accounted
for, in the Exchequer, and the King's Writ did run in both
thoſe Provinces, and therefore this Statute was revived and
confirmed by 10 <hi>Hen. 7. cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted,<note place="margin">Lib. D.</note> That at this time the Price of a Cow was
but ten Groats; and the Pay of a Foot-Soldier was but two
Pence a Day, whereof he paid a Penny for his Victuals.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt it be forgot, That about this time it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in <hi>England,</hi> That the King could not by Law alienate
his Dominions: And that King <hi>John</hi> his Submiſſion to the

was utterly void.</p>

Wars: Both which Sums were for ſome time forborn, by the

This Lord Lieutenant vigorouſly proſecuted the War

and the Lord <hi>Thomas Fitz-John,</hi> and many others Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Lord Lieutenant was obliged to march to

that <hi>John Macnamarra</hi> (a great Man in <hi>Thomond</hi>) was forced
to ſubmit,<note place="margin">

one of which was, To keep the Peace, eſpecially towards

annoy the City or Caſtle of <hi>Limerick,</hi> nor hinder that City
in their Fiſhing, or in cutting down Woods in <hi>Thomond,</hi> to
build or repair their Houſes. And a third was, That he
ſhould reſtore the Books, Ornaments and Chalices he

be obſerved, That Sacriledge was well known and practiſed
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the Reformation. But to proceed, The

proſecute the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

                  <p>And now the State of <hi>England</hi> began to think ſeriouſly of
the Recovery of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and finding that that Country was
poor, and almoſt depopulated, by the mighty Concourſe of
Iriſh into <hi>England,</hi> whereby the Kings Revenue was decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Power of the Iriſh Rebels increaſed, it was
thought fit to revive the Law againſt Abſentees, and to iſſue
a Proclamation, requiring all thoſe whoſe Habitations were
in that Kingdom, to repair home: Alſo, ſome Recruits of
Men and Money were ſent to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the King had (by
Indenture) agreed with <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> to be
Lord Lieutenant of that Land, and to go perſonally thither,
and an Army was deſign'd for him, and he was created Duke
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in order to that Expedition; and notwithſtanding
all this, on the twenty third of <hi>July</hi> 1393. the King ſent him
a Letter to ſtop his Voyage, becauſe his Majeſty intended to
go to that Kingdom in perſon.</p>
                  <p>For the King was netled with an Anſwer his Ambaſſadors
received in <hi>Germany,</hi> when they were ſolliciting for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown (that they did not think him fit to be their
Emperor, who could not keep what his Anceſtors had gain'd
in <hi>France,</hi> nor rule his inſolent Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> nor tame
his rebellious Vaſſals in <hi>Ireland</hi>) and therefore partly to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
his Reputation, and partly to divert the Melancholy,
which had ſeiz'd him on the Death of his Wife, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
a Royal Voyage to <hi>Ireland,</hi> with four thouſand Men at
Arms, and thirty thouſand Archers, under S. <hi>Edwards</hi> Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems that Sir <hi>Thomas Scroop</hi> was ſent before him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

                     <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, King of <hi>England,</hi> Landed at <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>

for the Iriſh betook themſelves to their old Stratagems of

times: However, <hi>Mowbray</hi> (Earl of <hi>Notingham,</hi> and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal

by vertue whereof, <hi>Girald O Birne, Donald O Nolan, Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias

falling down at his Feet upon their Knees; which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
the Marſhal gave each of them <hi>Oſculum Pacis.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
they were bound by ſeveral Indentures upon great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
to be paid to the Apoſtolick Chamber (<hi>viz. O

all the Lands and poſſeſſions which they held in <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and
(taking with them only their moveable Goods) ſhould ſerve
him in his Wars againſt his other Rebels: In conſideration
whereof, the King was to give them Pay and Penſions du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Lives, and to beſtow the inheritance of all ſuch
Lands upon them as they ſhould recover from the Rebels in
any other part of the Realm: And thereupon a Penſion of
eighty Marks <hi>per annum</hi> was granted to <hi>Art Mac Murrough,</hi>

ſorts of People in <hi>Ireland, viz.</hi> Iriſh Savages, or Enemies, Iriſh
Rebels, and Engliſh Subjects, and that perhaps the Rebels
had cauſe and provocation to do as they have done, and that
therefore he has given them Truce till <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and deſigns to
pardon them generally; and concludes with a Deſire of his
Advice in this Particular.</p>
                  <p>The Duke and the Council on the 19th of <hi>March</hi> return
an Anſwer,<note place="margin">Lib. M.</note> That they had formerly given their Opinion to

Voyage, and alſo took out their particular Pardons within a
limited Time;<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>G.</hi>
                     </note> and not long after, finding that the King

                  </p>
                  <p>Several of the Iriſh Hiſtorians (one of them miſleading

and about <hi>Shrovetide</hi> return'd to <hi>England;</hi> but as I am ſure
he did not return in many Weeks after <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he held no other Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time, than
that there being a great Concourſe of the Chief Men of the
Land to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to attend the King, it is probable the King
conſulted with them about the publick Affairs, and that they
complained to his Majeſty of ſuch Grievances as needed to
be redreſs'd;<note place="margin">Lib. G.</note> and particularly, That whereas the Chancery
us'd to pay into the Exchequer two thouſand Marks <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>

that Court, it now hardly pays its own Officers their Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

That <hi>James Cotenham,</hi> Deputy Admiral of <hi>Ireland,</hi>

On the twenty fifth Day of <hi>March</hi> the King knighted four
Iriſh Kings,<note place="margin">1395. Selden tit. hon. 842.</note> and ſome other great Lords; whereof Mr <hi>Selden</hi>
(out of <hi>Froiſart</hi>) gives the following Account. Four Kings
of ſeveral Provinces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that ſubmitted themſelves to
<hi>Richard</hi> II, were put under the Care of <hi>Henry Caſtile,</hi> an
Engliſh Gentleman, who ſpake Iriſh well, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them for Knighthood; by the Kings Command he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
them of the Engliſh Manners in Diet, Apparel, and
the like; He asked them, If they were willing to take the
Order which the King of <hi>England</hi> would give them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Cuſtoms of <hi>England, France,</hi> and other Countries.
They anſwered, They were Knights already, and that the
Order they had taken was enough for them; and that they
were made Knights in <hi>Ireland</hi> when they were ſeven Years
Old; and that every King makes his Son Knight, and if the
Father be dead the next of Kin does it; and that the manner
is thus; The new Knight, at his making, runs with ſlender
Lances againſt a Shield, ſet upon a Stake in a Meadow, and
the more Lances he thus breaks, the more Honour continues
with his Dignity. But Mr. <hi>Caſtile</hi> told them, They ſhould
receive a Knighthood with more State in the Church; and
afterwards (being perſwaded and inſtructed, eſpecially by
the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>) they did receive Knighthood at <hi>Chriſt-Church,
Dublin,</hi> after their Vigils performed in the ſame
Church, and a Maſs heard, and ſome others were knighted
with them; but the four Kings, in Robes agreeable to their
State, ſate that Day with King <hi>Richard</hi> at the Table.</p>
                  <p>And ſo,<note place="margin">Davit, 202.</note> when the King had ſupplied the Courts of Juſtice
with able Men, particularly with Sir <hi>William Hankford,</hi>
Chief Juſtice (who was afterwards Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi>
and done his Endeavor to eſtabliſh a Civil Plantation in the
Mountains of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> he returned to <hi>England</hi> (about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer,<note place="margin">1394.</note>
as I ſuppoſe); for on the fourth of <hi>July</hi> 1394</p>
                  <p>

And not long after, the aforeſaid excellent Ordinances

ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be more duly obſerved than hitherto they
had been.</p>
                  <p>But the Scene was changed, and the Iriſh deſpiſing the
weak Forces the King had left behind him, began to lay
aſide their Mask of Humility, and to make Incurſions into
the Borders of the Pale: Nevertheleſs, the Engliſh were not
daunted, their Valour ſupplyed what was wanting in their
Number;<note place="margin">Cambd.</note> particularly Sir <hi>Thomas de Burgh</hi> and <hi>Walter de
Birmingham,</hi> with their Forces ſlew ſix hundred of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>

of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
of King <hi>Richard,</hi> procured him
to be depoſed in Parliament, and himſelf
to be elected King, and the Crown to be
entailed on him and the Heirs of his Body: His Claim was,
as Heir to <hi>Henry</hi> III; but finding that Pretence was Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
becauſe there were others of the ſame Lineage before
him in the Pedigree; and it was notorious, That the Right
of Succeſſion was in <hi>Ann,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> Earl
of <hi>March,</hi> Son of <hi>Philippa,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
third Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> III. and accordingly her
Grand-ſon afterwards poſſeſt the Kingdoms by the Name of
<hi>Edward</hi> IV. And alſo finding that it was more vain to claim
by Conqueſt, when there was no fighting, he was at laſt
forced to rely on the Conſent and Election of the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which was the Title his Embaſſadors inſiſted upon, in the
Courts of Foreign Princes.</p>

And this good Act was followed by good Succeſs, for in <hi>May</hi>
two Scotch Barks were taken near <hi>Greencaſtle,</hi> and another
near <hi>Dalkye,</hi> with their Captain <hi>Macgolagh:</hi> Moreover the
Merchants of <hi>Droghedae</hi> made Incurſion into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and

alſo entred <hi>Scotland</hi> at <hi>S. Ninian,</hi> and behaved themſelves
valiantly: They alſo did the Welſh much harm, and brought
from thence the Shrine of S. <hi>Cubins,</hi> which they placed
in <hi>Chriſt-Church, Dublin:</hi> However, the Iriſh burnt <hi>Oghgard,</hi>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Stephen Scroop,</hi> Lord Deputy: He held a Parliament

at firſt the Iriſh had the better, but at length the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
and Reſolution of the Engliſh prevailed, and <hi>O
Nolan</hi> and his Son, and others were taken Priſoners; and
after this was done, they marched ſpeedily to <hi>Calan,</hi> in
the County of <hi>Kikenny,</hi> upon ſome Intelligence they had
of the Rebels being thereabout, and they ſo ſurprized
them, that the whole Party was routed, and <hi>O Carol</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lord Juſtice: In whoſe time
a barbarous Tory called <hi>Mac Gilmore</hi> (who is reported
to have deſtroyed forty Churches, and was never Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened)
had taken Priſoner <hi>Patrick Savage,</hi> a Gentleman
of great Eſteem in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> they agreed upon his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

was to become Hoſtage for it: But this Subtle Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
managed the matter ſo, that he received the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
according to Agreement, and afterwards he murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both the Brethren.</p>
                  <p>This Lord Juſtice held a Parliament at <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1408.</note> which

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> came over Lord Lieutenant:
It ſeems that the Terms on which he undertook the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
were theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Lib. G.</note> He was to hold the Place for ſeven Years.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He was to have five hundred Men at Arms and

                  <p>Thirdly, To have a Years Pay in Hand, and afterwards
to be paid every half Year.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, One thouſand Marks <hi>per annum</hi> for himſelf,
and to be paid the Charge of Tranſportation to and from
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That a certain Fund be appointed for their
Pay.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That at the King's Charge he might have a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
or two out of every Pariſh in <hi>England</hi> to inhabit
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, To have Power of granting Benefices, and of
making a Deputy. And,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the Demeſnes of the Crown may be reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Acts of Abſentees may be executed.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Lieutenant (within a Week after he came to
<hi>Dublin</hi>) cauſed the Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and three of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
to be arreſted, and ſuffered the Earls Goods to be
rifled and ſpoiled by the Duke's Servants, and kept the
Earl himſelf in Priſon, in <hi>Dublin</hi> Caſtle, until he paid three
hundred Marks.</p>
                  <p>It is recorded that the Lord Lieutenant was deſperately
wounded in an Encounter at <hi>Kilmainham,</hi> and hardly
eſcaped with Life, but it is not mentioned how nor by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65997:105"/>
whom: but it ſeems he deſign'd to revenge it, and to make
a general Hoſting; for he made Proclamation that all ſuch
as ought by their Tenures to ſerve the King, ſhould aſſemble
together at <hi>Roſs:</hi> He alſo held a Parliament at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> for
a Tallage to be granted; but what Succeſs he had in theſe
Aſſemblies, is not ſo manifeſt, as it is that he went to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
on the 13th of <hi>March,</hi> leaving</p>
                  <p>

time, the King gave the Sword to the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
changed their PROVOST into a MAYOR; and not
long after, the Barbarous <hi>Mac Gilmore</hi> being routed, and
purſued by the <hi>Savages,</hi> fled to the Church of the Friers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
at <hi>Carigfergus,</hi> which he had formerly defaced; but
they got into the Windows, whence this <hi>Tory</hi> had formerly
taken the Iron Bars, and there they put an end to his Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and his Life.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter, Jenico de Artois,</hi> the famous <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                     <note place="margin">1410.</note> and made it Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to take Coyn and Livery;<note place="margin">Lib. D.</note> and on the tenth of <hi>July</hi> the
Lord Juſtice took the Caſtles of <hi>Mibraclide</hi> in <hi>Offerol,</hi> and
<hi>De-la-mare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems he proceeded to invade <hi>O Birns</hi> Country, with
fifteen hundred <hi>Kerns,</hi> or Iriſh Souldiers; and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
was, that they betrayed him, and half of them went
over to the Enemy; ſo that it had gone hard with the Lord
Juſtice, if the Power of <hi>Dublin</hi> had not been there; and
yet he eſcaped not without loſs, for <hi>John Derpatrick</hi> was
there ſlain.</p>
                  <p>The next Year was probably more quiet;<note place="margin">1411.</note> for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <p>On the tenth of <hi>April,</hi>

and <hi>Thomas Fitz-Maurice</hi> Sheriſſ of <hi>Limerick,</hi> kill'd each
other in a Duel.</p>
                  <p>About this time the King granted the Town and Ferry of

died ſo very poor, that his Executors refuſed to adminiſter,

and therefore the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (who is Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> is ſaid to have been Lord Juſtice,

                  <p>Sir <hi>John Talbot,</hi> Lord <hi>Furnival,</hi> Lord Lieutenant, Landed
at <hi>Dalkye,</hi> and immediately made a Circular Progreſs round
the Pale in warlike manner: He began with the <hi>Birns, Tools,</hi>
and <hi>Cavenaghs</hi> on the South, and ſo paſſing to the <hi>O Moors,
O Connors,</hi> and <hi>O Ferrals</hi> in the Weſt, and ending with the
<hi>O Relyes, Mac Mahons, O Neals</hi> and <hi>O Hanlons</hi> in the North;
he brought them all to the Kings Peace; but he brought no
Forces with him out of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore though he
had Strength enough to make them ſeek Peace, yet he was
in no wiſe able to reduce them to the Obedience of Subjects,
or enlarge the Limits of the Pale; however what he did,
was held ſo conſiderable, that the Lords and Gentlemen of
the Pale made Certificate of this great Service in French, to
the King: Nevertheleſs the Army was ſo ill paid in this
March, that the Subject ſuffered more from the Ceſs of the
Souldier, than they gained by this ſmall and temporary mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the Iriſh; and this was the common Calamity
from hence forward; ſo that Neceſſity revived Coyn and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
again by degrees, notwithſtanding that it remained
Treaſon by Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Parliament met at <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1415.</note> and ſate ſix weeks,
during which time, the Iriſh followed their uſual Courſe of
falling upon the Engliſh, and killed <hi>Thomas Ballymore</hi> of
<hi>Ballyquelan,</hi> and many others; and on the 22th day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:65997:107"/>
the King obtained a moſt glorious and entire Victory
over the French, at the Battel of <hi>Agincourt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Parliament was adjourned to <hi>Trym,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1416.</note> and there it
ſate on the 11th of <hi>May,</hi> and continued ſeven days, and
gave the King a Subſidy of four hundred Marks in Money;
and the next year the Prior of <hi>Kilmainham</hi> with ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Iriſh went to aid the King in <hi>France;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1417.</note> they Landed at
<hi>Harſlew</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and did the King very good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhould have remembred, That the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Weſtminſter, anno</hi> 1413. did Enact, That for the
Peace and Quietneſs of <hi>England,</hi> and for the encreaſe and
enſtoring of <hi>Ireland,</hi> That all Iriſhmen, Iriſh Clerks, Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
and Chamberdekins, be voided out of <hi>England</hi> before
<hi>All-Saints</hi> next,<note place="margin">Lib. M.</note> except Graduates in Schools, Sergeants and
Apprentices at Law, and ſuch as be Inheritors in <hi>England,</hi>
and Religious Perſons profeſſed, and Merchants of good
Name, and Apprentices now dwelling in <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe
whom the King will diſpenſe with, and that all Iriſhmen,
who have Offices or Benefices in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall dwell in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for the defence of the Land.</p>
                  <p>And now 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Lib. M.</note> It was likewiſe Enacted in <hi>England,</hi>
that all Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots and Priors, of the Iriſh
Nation, Rebels to the King, that ſhall make any Collation,
or Preſentment to Benefices in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or bring with them
any Iriſh Rebels, among the Engliſhmen, to the Parliament,
Councils, or other Aſſemblies, within the ſame Land, to
know the Privities or States of the Engliſhmen, their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities
ſhall be ſeized, till they fine to the King, and that
the Governors of <hi>Ireland</hi> be defended, and reſtrained, to
grant ſuch Benefices or Pardons, in the caſe, to Iriſh Perſons,
not Engliſh, and that ſuch Licenſes ſhall be void.</p>
                  <p>There is very little recorded of the Year 1418,<note place="margin">1418.</note> and it is
ſcarce worth mentioning, That the Lord Lieutenant did
ſpoil the Tenants of <hi>Henry Crus</hi> and <hi>Henry Bethel,</hi> probably
for ſome Miſdemeanor by them committed againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>But the Year 1419.<note place="margin">1419.</note> will afford us more Matter; for on
the laſt Day of <hi>May,</hi> the Lord Lieutenant (accompanied
by the Archbiſhop and Mayor of <hi>Dublin</hi>) razed the Caſtle
of <hi>Kenun,</hi> having a little before in the ſame Month, taken
Priſoner <hi>Mac Morough,</hi> the chief Captain of his Nation, and
on the 20th of <hi>June,</hi> the Lord <hi>William de Burgh</hi> took <hi>O Kelly,</hi>
and ſlow five hundred Iriſh in <hi>Connaught;</hi> but the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
was ſent for to <hi>England,</hi> and ſubſtituted his Brother</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard Talbot,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Lord Juſtice (or
Deputy.) He held a Royal Council (<hi>i. e.</hi> a Parliament) at
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65997:108"/>
the <hi>Naas,</hi> which gave a Subſidy of three hundred Marks.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Maundy-Thurſday, O Tool</hi> took four hundred Kine from
<hi>Ballymore,</hi> and ſo broke the Peace, contrary to his Oath;
but it fared worſe with the Iriſh at <hi>Rodiſton,</hi> where thirty
of them were ſlain by the Engliſh, under the Command of
the Lord Juſtice; but on the 4th day of <hi>April,</hi> Landed at
<hi>Waterford</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>James,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1420.</note> Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lord Lieutenant: His Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is very large, and beareth Date the 10th of <hi>Febr. 7 Hen.</hi> 5.
and is to be ſeen, <hi>Pryn</hi> 412. He held a Council at <hi>Dublin,</hi>
the 23th of <hi>April,</hi> and ſummoned a Parliament to meet the
7th of <hi>June;</hi> which did accordingly then meet, and ſate
ſixteen days, and gave the King a Subſidy of ſeven hundred
Marks, and adjourned to <hi>Monday</hi> after S. <hi>Andrews Day;</hi> and
at that Seſſion, they gave another Subſidy of three hundred
Marks, and the publick Debts contracted by the Lord <hi>Talbot,</hi>
were paid; and then they were Adjourned to the <hi>Monday</hi>
after S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s Day.</p>
                  <p>But it will be convenient to ſhew the Reader who paid
theſe Subſidies, and what their reſpective Proportions were;
and thereby he will perceive the vaſt Alteration (for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
that is made in the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince thoſe Days:
This Subſidy was called <hi>Tertium Subſidium,</hi> and was applot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

on <hi>Monday</hi> after S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s Day, and ordered, that
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Preſton,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ſhould go Commiſſioners to the King, to deſire a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

                  <p>At this Parliament <hi>John Geſe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Liſmore</hi> and <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
accuſed <hi>Richard O Hedian,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> of
Thirty Articles; the Principal of which were,</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Ware de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul. 170.</note> That he loved none of the Engliſh Nation, nor gave
any Benefice to any Engliſhman, and that he counſelled
other Biſhops to do the like.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he had counterfeited the Great Seal.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That he deſigned to make himſelf King of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That he had taken a Ring from the Image of
S. <hi>Patrick</hi> (which the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> had offered) and
gave it to his Concubine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was alſo a Conteſt between <hi>Adam Pory,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Cloyne,</hi> and another Biſhop; but it is probable that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Accuſation was ſuppreſſed, becauſe we find no farther
Proceedings upon them; and becauſe the Archbiſhop ſeems
to have been a more generous ſort of Man; for he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repaired the Cathedral of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> and a Manſion-Houſe or
two, for his Succeſſors, but alſo was otherwiſe a great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
to that See, and liberal to Pious Uſes; and the later
Conteſt was tranſmitted to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we ſhould return to the Lord Juſtice,<note place="margin">1422.</note> whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were, on the Seventh of <hi>May</hi> attacked and defeated by
the Iriſh; <hi>Purcel Grant,</hi> and five and twenty Engliſh more
were ſlain, and ten taken Priſoners, and two hundred eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to the Abby of <hi>Leix;</hi> and to revenge this, the Lord Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
invaded <hi>O Mores</hi> Country, and defeated his terrible
Army in the red Bog of <hi>Asby;</hi> he relieved his own Men,
and burnt and preyed the Rebels Lands for four days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
themſelves came and ſued for Peace. And it ſeems <hi>O
Dempſy,</hi> notwithſtanding his Oath of Obedience, invaded
the Pale, and took the Caſtle of <hi>Ley</hi> from the Earl of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi>
which the Lord Juſtice had juſtly reſtored to the Earl;
whereupon <hi>Campion</hi> makes a ſevere Remark on the Iriſh;
That notwithſtanding their Oaths and their Pledges, they
are no longer true, than they feel themſelves the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>

In the mean time, <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> play'd the Devil in <hi>

in ſolemn Proceſſion, praying for his Victory over thoſe

had apoſtatiz'd to their old Trade of Life, and repined at

                  <p>And when I have mentioned a Deed made 9 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. which
is to be found <hi>Lib. GGG.</hi> 24. at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> whereby this Earl of

oppreſſed the other,<note place="margin">23 Hen. 6. in Turri London. pars 2. m. 12.</note> to the utmoſt degree. It was about this

And alſo to purchaſe any Lands he pleaſed, by whatſoever Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

ſent ſeveral Subjects Priſoners to <hi>O Dempſy's</hi> Caſtle, and forced

                  <p>Hitherto the Engliſh had made but a bordering War in

was, to remove this Duke from the Regency of <hi>France,</hi> to

                  <p>But the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who fathomed their Deſigns, and

which were reduced to Writing by Indenture, betwixt
the King and him, and are recorded by Act of Parliament in

                  <p>I. That he ſhould be the King's Lieutenant in <hi>Ireland</hi> for

                  <p>I do not find that this Lord brought over any conſiderable
Forces with him, or that he was able to keep any ſuch on

years, with their White-Meat, till at the laſt, theſe Engliſh Lords
fell at variance among themſelves, and then the weakeſt part took
certain Iriſhmen to take his part, and ſo vanquiſhed his Enemy;
and thus fell the Engliſh Lords at variance among themſelves,
till the Iriſhmen were ſtronger than they, and drave them away,
and now have the whole Country under them, but that the Lord

and that the Patents be of the ſame Date, or elſe be

                  <p>And the ſame Day twelve month he held another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Drogheda;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1460.</note> wherein it was enacted,</p>
                  <p>That no Man ſhould ſue in the Exchequer, but a Miniſter
of that Court, on pain of ten Pound.</p>
                  <p>This Duke and his Abettors were in a Parliament at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi>
declared Traytors; and thereupon the Earl of <hi>March</hi>
came to his Father into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſoon after returned to
<hi>Calice,</hi> and thence invaded <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Sandwich;</hi> and on the
ninth of <hi>July</hi> he fought and defeated the King at <hi>Northampton,</hi>
and took him Priſoner; whereupon the Duke of <hi>York</hi> went
to <hi>England,</hi> and called a Parliament in the King's Name;
and in that Parliament boldly claimed his Title; and ſo it
was enacted, That King <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould keep the Crown du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Life, and the Duke ſhould be declared Heir apparent,
and in caſe of Oppoſition or farther Buſtle about it, ſhould
have preſent Poſſeſſion: But not long after the Duke was
defeated, and ſlain at the Battle of <hi>Wakefield.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Duke behaved himſelf exceeding well in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he
appeaſed the Tumults there, and erected Caſtles on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Louth, Meath</hi> and <hi>Kildare,</hi> to ſtop the Iriſh Incurſions,
and was ſo well eſteemed in that Kingdom, that Multitudes
of the Iriſh Subjects attended him into <hi>England,</hi> to purſue
his Claim to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs the Publick Revenue was but very low, becauſe
the whole Kingdom was in Poſſeſſion of the Iriſh, except the
Pale, and ſome few Places on the Sea-Coaſt in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> and
even that was ſo far from being quiet, that they were fain
to buy their Peace by yearly Penſions to the Iriſh, and to pay
Tribute and Contributions to them for Protection; which
nevertheleſs was but very ill obſerved to the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be expected I ſhould give the Reader an exact

By vertue of this Act of Parliament,<note place="margin">Davis, 186.</note> the great Earl of
<hi>Deſmond</hi> was beheaded at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
1467. Report makes his Crime to be, That of extorting
Coyn and Livery: And the Iriſh ſay it was for an affront he
put upon the Queen, for being of a noble Race, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
(or rather proud) Spirit; he deſpiſed the King's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with ſo mean a Subject as the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Grey,</hi> and
often ſaid, She was a Taylors Widow: Perhaps he had more
reaſon than any Man, to ſpeak bitterly againſt ſuch Matches,
becauſe he had no other Title to the Earldom of <hi>Deſmond,</hi>
than by the Marriage of his Nephew (<hi>Thomas</hi> the fifth Earl
of <hi>Deſmond</hi>) to <hi>Katherin ni William mac Cormock,</hi> one of his
Vaſſals; for which that Earl was ſo perſecuted by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
that he was forced to reſign his Earldom to this his
Unkle, who is commonly called by the Iriſh, <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda:</hi>
And it would be a very hard caſe, that the Nephew
ſhould be ſo abuſed for an Act which the King had juſtified by
following the Example, and therefore the Unkle exclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that Action as a thing too baſe to be imitated or excus'd.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo another Vulgar Tradition about this matter,
which ſeems very unlikely,<note place="margin">Lib. P.</note> if not impoſſible; and that is,
That the Queen ſhould ſteal the Privy Signet, and put it to
an Order for his Execution.</p>
                  <p>But it is well worth our Obſervation,<note place="margin">Davis, 185.</note> That as the Earls of
<hi>Deſmond</hi> were the firſt Introducers of Coyn and Livery
among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the firſt that broached the diſtinction
between Engliſh of Birth and Engliſh of Blood, and the firſt
Peers that refuſed to come to Parliament upon Summons,
ſo they were the only Peers that ever were executed in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the only Noble Engliſh Family that was by the
Hand of Juſtice extinguiſhed there; ſo that this degenerate
Family, which of all others was moſt injurious and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Engliſh Government, did ſuffer more by the ſame
Government, than any other Family in that Kingdom; and
thoſe Exactions of Coyn and Livery, which were the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of their Grandure, did at laſt prove the cauſe or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of their Ruine, in the perſon of <hi>Gerald</hi> the fifteenth Earl
of <hi>Deſmond.</hi>

Cauſe of Suſpicion, and Reaſons of Jealouſie, to ſuch
as doubted, that ſo numerous an Attendance was entertain'd
upon Deſigns prejudicial to them. And ſo having luckily
mounted this firſt ſtep to the Throne, the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>
proceeded to confederate with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and
the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and by their aſſiſtance, he firſt ſeized on
the Earl <hi>Rivers,</hi> and others of the Kings Relations and
Friends, and then got the King himſelf into his power, and
brought him to <hi>London,</hi> uſing a thouſand Artifices to make
the People believe, that the Queen-Mothers Kindred deſigned
the extirpation of the Ancient Nobility, the Slavery of the
People, and the Ruine of the Kingdom.</p>

This Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> wheedled or bribed to that degree,
that he was choſen Protector by the unanimous Conſent of
the Council, and afterwards got the Kings Brother out of
Sanctuary at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and under ſpecious Pretences of
their Security, both the Princes were conveyed to the Tower
of <hi>London,</hi> in a moſt pompous and ſplendid manner, and
there they were afterwards murdered, by the Appointment,
if not by the Hands of their Unkle.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> took upon him the Regal Office on the 18th

the Iriſh had a wonderful Reſpect, as indeed they had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
for all the Family of <hi>York.</hi> This Youth had learned his
Leſſon ſo well, that <hi>Margaret</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy</hi> reſolved
to ſet him up againſt King <hi>Henry,</hi> although there were two
great Flaws in this Contrivance: The one was, That the
true Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Hands, in the
Tower of <hi>London:</hi> The other, That he was not right Heir
to the Crown, becauſe there were Children of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Fourth ſtill living. Nevertheleſs, ſhe ſent this Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Prince to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he met with all the Countenance
he could deſire, as well from the Lord Deputy, as from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the reſt of the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> and
the Families of <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>S. Lawrence,</hi> and the City of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford</hi>
only excepted.</p>
                  <p>And though the King cauſed the true Earl to be taken out
of the Tower, and ſhewn publickly in <hi>London,</hi> which marred
all their Deſigns there; yet the Iriſh were not thereby Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
but confidently accuſed the King of Impoſture, as
he did them, and therefore that Project was not ſo effectual
to him, as was another of getting a Bull from the Pope, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the Clergy to excommunicate the Rebels, as often
as the King ſhould deſire it; which did him a great deal of
Service.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> took advantage of theſe Stirs, and invaded
<hi>Louth,</hi> which he burnt and preyed, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of making War in thoſe Days; he deſtroyed twenty
eight Villages in that Country. And the Tempeſt was no
leſs fatal to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> where it rooted up Trees and threw down

In <hi>May</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy</hi> ſent over two thouſand
Germans, under the Command of <hi>Martin Swart,</hi> an old
Soldier; with them there came the Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Lovel,</hi> and others, and were kindly received, and lovingly
entertained by the Nobility, Gentry and People of <hi>Ireland;</hi>
they proceeded to crown this Impoſtor at <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> in
<hi>Dublin,</hi> with a Crown, which they took from the Statue of
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in S. <hi>Mary</hi>-Abby; and this Ceremony was
rendred more ſolemn by a Sermon preached by the Biſhop of
<hi>Meath</hi> on the occaſion, and by the Attendance of the Lord
Deputy, the Chancellor, Treaſurer, and other the great
Officers of <hi>State:</hi> And after he was crowned, they carried
him in Triumph, upon the Shoulders of Great <hi>Darcy</hi> of <hi>Platten.</hi>
But the good Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> refuſed to be preſent at
this ridiculous Pageantry; for which they gave him all the
Trouble they could.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems they were conſcious of their Miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in this Matter, and they knew how to purchaſe Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore they called a Parliament (or Aſſembly)
in the Name of their new King; and the Clergy gave the
Pope a Subſidy to abſolve them.</p>
                  <p>So eager were theſe People to follow the Fortunes of this
Mock-King, that <hi>Thomas Fitz-Girald</hi> reſigned the Chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to the Lord of <hi>Portleſter,</hi> the better to be at liberty; and
ſo together they went for <hi>England,</hi> and landed in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi>
where Sir <hi>Thomas Broughton</hi> and his Party joyned them; they
marched through <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> to <hi>Newark;</hi> and being ſtopt there,
they turned aſide to <hi>Notinghamſhire,</hi> and near the Village of
<hi>Stoke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1487.</note> on the the eleventh of <hi>June,</hi> after a deſperate Fight for

his Maſter <hi>Symon</hi> were taken Priſoners, and the latter was

It ſeems ſtrange, That hitherto the King did not ſend any
Soldiers into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſuppreſs the remainder of the Faction
of <hi>York;</hi> perhaps he knew, That if he took any ſevere courſe
with them, it would utterly deſtroy the Pale, and by weakning
the ſmall Colony of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would turn to the Advantage of
the Iriſh, and therefore he contented himſelf with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of thoſe that had been Faulty; and ſent over Sir <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Edgcomb</hi> to take new Oaths of Allegiance of the Nobility
and Gentry, and to bind them in Recognizance to perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and thereupon to give them a Pardon. He brought
with him five hundred Men, which was rather a Guard than
an Army; and he arrived at <hi>Kingſale</hi> with five Ships, on the
twenty ſeventh Day of <hi>June;</hi> he did not intend to come on
Shoar there, and therefore the Lord <hi>Thomas Barry (i.e. Barry
oge</hi>) came on Board, and there did his Homage for his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony,
and took his Oath of Allegiance; but the next Day,
Sir <hi>Richard Edgcomb,</hi> at the Importunity of <hi>James</hi> Lord
<hi>Courcy,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Kingſale,</hi> did come into the
Town, and in their Pariſh Church, dedicated to S. <hi>Multotius,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Courcy</hi> did Homage, and he and the Townſmen
ſwore Allegiance, and entred into Recognizance for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of it, whereupon they were pardoned: And ſo,
after Dinner, <hi>Edgcomb</hi> ſailed toward <hi>Waterford;</hi> where he
arrived the laſt Day of <hi>June,</hi> and having applauded the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of that City, and aſſured them, That the King would
liberally remunerate their Fidelity, he ſet Sail for <hi>Dublin;</hi>
and there he arrived the fifth Day of <hi>July,</hi> and was received
by the Mayor and Citizens, in moſt humble and ſubmiſſive
manner, at the Gate of the Abby of the Friers Preachers,
where he was to lodge: The Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> was then upon
ſome Exploit againſt the Iriſh, ſo that he did not come to
<hi>Dublin</hi> until the twelfth of <hi>July;</hi> and then he ſent the Biſhop
of <hi>Meath,</hi> the Lord <hi>Slane</hi> and others unto <hi>Edgcomb,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him to <hi>S. Thomas</hi>-Court, where the Lord Deputy lay:
Thither did Sir <hi>Richard</hi> come, and with a ſtern Countenance
delivered the King's Letters to the Lord Deputy; after which
they had a Private Conference, but many of the Nobility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abſent, nothing more was done at that time, and ſo
they departed, the Lord Deputy went to <hi>Minooth,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Richard Edgcomb</hi> returned to the Abby. The next Day
(being <hi>Sunday) Edgcomb</hi> cauſed to be read in <hi>Chriſt Church,</hi>
after Sermon, the Abſolution of the former Excommunication,
which the Pope had lately granted (at the King's Requeſt)
unto all thoſe that ſhould thenceforward continue loyal to his
Majeſty; and after ſome time, and many Expoſtulations
between the Commiſſioners and the Nobility, they did at laſt
agree on the Form of an Oath, to be found at large in Sir <hi>James
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65997:123"/>
Wares Annals,</hi> p. 17. Wherein this is obſervable, that they
ſwore not to hinder or diſturb the excommunication of all ſuch
as ſhould oppoſe the King, of what Quality ſoever they ſhould
be: And in the Oath of the Clergy, it was added, that they
ſhould publiſh the Popes Excommunication, againſt all the
Kings Rebels or Enemies in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as often as they ſhould
be thereunto required; <hi>Salvo Ordine Epiſcopali, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo on the 21ſt of <hi>July,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> (being
firſt abſolved from the former Excommunication, after the
uſual manner in time of Divine Service) did Homage to the
Kings Commiſſioner, in the great Chamber in <hi>Thomas</hi> Court,
and ſwore Allegiance, and entred into Recognizance for the
due Obſervation of it, and then <hi>Edgecomb</hi> gave him his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and put a Gold-Chain about his Neck, which the King
had ſent him for a Preſent, to ſignifie his Majeſties entire
Reconcilation to him.</p>
                  <p>The like Oaths and Recognizances were made by <hi>Rowland
Euſtace,</hi> Baron of <hi>Portleſter,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer, <hi>Robert

<hi>James Cogan,</hi> Prior of <hi>Holm-Patrick,</hi> and then Sir <hi>Richard
Edgecomb</hi> entertain'd them all at a ſplendid Banquet at his

took their Oaths at the Tolſel, and remitted a Copy of
the Oath under the City-Seal, to the King, to certifie His
Majeſty that they had taken it.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, on the 23d day of <hi>July, Edgecomb</hi> went to <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda,</hi>
and thence to <hi>Trim,</hi> and both thoſe Towns, as alſo the
Prior of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> near <hi>Trim,</hi> and the Abbots of <hi>Navan</hi> and
<hi>Beclif,</hi> did in like manner bind themſelves to Allegiance by
Oath and Recognizance, and when he returned to <hi>Dublin,</hi>
on the 26th, <hi>Octavianus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh, Philip Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham,</hi>
Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, and <hi>Thomas
Dowdal</hi> Maſter of the Rolls, followed the ſame Example:
There was great interceſſion made for Prior <hi>Keating</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Plunket,</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas; and at
length <hi>Plunket</hi> was pardon'd, but <hi>Keating</hi> was not only left
unpardoned, but was alſo removed from the Command of the
Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> whereof, it ſeems, he was Governour or
Conſtable, and <hi>Richard Archbold,</hi> whom he had formerly
ejected, was now reſtored, and perhaps <hi>Keating</hi> had been
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65997:124"/>
uſed worſe, if his Habit and Order had not protected him;
for the King hated him more than all the reſt, being (as it
ſeems) one of the moſt violent, and moſt powerful Abettors
of the Impoſtor <hi>Symnel;</hi> and ſo Sir <hi>Richard Edgecomb,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faithfully executed his Commiſſion, embarked at <hi>Dalky</hi>
the 29th of <hi>July,</hi> and arrived in <hi>Cornwal</hi> on the 8th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after this, the Lord Deputy and Council ſent over
the Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> to obviate the Deſigns of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and to thank the King for his Favours, and to aſſure
him of their future Allegiance; and he managed his Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
ſo ſucceſsfully, that although the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi>
who was of the Kings ſide, and a Favourite, did uſe
his utmoſt Endeavours to get the Chancellorſhip, yet he
could not obtain it, leſt thereby <hi>Kildare</hi> and his Party might
be diſobliged, and the Kingdom juſt now appeaſed, and
growing towards a Settlement, might again be diſturbed by
new Jealouſies and Commotions.</p>
                  <p>And now the Lord Deputy is at leiſure to call <hi>Macgeoghan</hi>
to account for all his Depredations in the Pale;<note place="margin">1489.</note> he invaded
his Country, and took the Caſtle of <hi>Bileragh,</hi> and preyed
and waſted the whole Territory of <hi>Moycaſſel,</hi> and being load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
with Booty, he returned to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the King being ſtill jealous of the Nobility of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
whom he knew to be exceedingly addicted to the Houſe of
<hi>York,</hi> ſent for moſt of them to come over to him into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and thither went the Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> the Viſcounts
<hi>Buttevant</hi> and <hi>Fermoy,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Athenry, Kingſale,
Gormanſtown, Delvin, Hoath, Slane, Killeen, Trimleſton</hi> and
<hi>Dunſany;</hi> They waited on the King at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where
<hi>Lambert Symnel</hi> ſerved as Butler, purpoſely to ridicule and
expoſe their Folly, who would Crown ſuch a Fellow for their
King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but after ſome ſharp Reproofs, they were all taken
into Favour, and graciouſly diſmiſs'd, I ſuppoſe not without
ſome Preſents, though only that of three hundred Pieces of
Gold to the Lord of <hi>Hoath,</hi> be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt theſe things were doing in <hi>England, Maurice
Buckagh</hi> Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> obtained two Victories in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
the one againſt <hi>Morough O Carol,</hi> who was ſlain in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,

againſt <hi>Dermond Mac Teige Carty,</hi> whom he alſo killed.</p>
                  <p>On the 6th of <hi>July</hi> a Provincial Synod was held at <hi>Athird,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ware, 24.</note>
by <hi>Octavianus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh;</hi> at which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

at this Synod between <hi>Thomas Brady</hi> and one <hi>Cormock,</hi> about

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65997:124"/>

<hi>Ardagh,</hi> and what End they made of it, <hi>non conſtat;</hi> but
ſix years after, both of them were called Biſhops of <hi>Kilmore,</hi>
and as ſuch, both of them were permitted to ſit in the Synod
of <hi>Drogheda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Summer and Harveſt were ſo wet in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1491.</note> that
the Corn could not be ſaved, and therefore a great Dearth
enſued, which was accompanied with a Diſeaſe called the
<hi>Sweating Sickneſs,</hi> which now came to be firſt felt and known
in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it ſeems that a Parliament was held at <hi>Trim,</hi> on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
after <hi>Epiphany;</hi> but none of their Acts are extant: But
in <hi>March</hi> a Proclamation iſſued againſt bad Money, and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Flyn</hi> was made Superviſor of the Mints at <hi>Waterford</hi>
and <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was about this time, that <hi>O Neal</hi> wrote this ſhort and
famous Letter to <hi>Hugh Roe O Donel,</hi> from whom he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chief-Rent, which the other denied, and refuſed to pay:
<hi>Cur hoom mi Keeſh no monna Curhir; i.e.</hi> Send me my Rent,
or if you don't (as much as to ſay, he would force him to
it.) But <hi>O Donel</hi> replied, <hi>Neel Reeſh a gut urm, agus dabeh;
i.e.</hi> I owe you no Rent, and if I did (meaning that he would
not pay it;) ſo to Blows they go, and after ſome Bickerings
and Loſſes on both ſides, they agreed to refer all their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
to the Lord Deputy; but in vain; for all that he
could do, could not reconcile them; So to Blows they fall
again, and came to a bloody Battel, wherein the Loſs was
almoſt equal; but if there were any diſadvantage in that
Point, it was of <hi>O Donel</hi>'s ſide; but that was more than ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
by the Death of <hi>O Neal,</hi> who in <hi>January</hi> 1492 was
Murdered by his Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> ſo that <hi>Tyrone</hi> became divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
between <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Daniel O Neal,</hi> betwixt whom there
was continual Wars until the year 1497. and then, upon the
Reſignation of <hi>Daniel, Henry</hi> became ſole Proprietor, and
the ſame year of 1497, <hi>O Donel</hi> likewiſe being ſuperannua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and decrepit, gave up his Principality of <hi>Tirconnel</hi> to his
Son <hi>Con.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the King finding, that the Ducheſs of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was
again buſie at work, about ſetting up another Impoſtor,
thought it neceſſary to put the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the
hands of ſuch as he might confide in; and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

who had enjoyed that Office eight and thirty years: This
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65997:125"/>
new Lord Treaſurer came to <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> with a ſmall
Band of Souldiers; and it ſo hapned, that upon ſome Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
between him and the Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> near <hi>Dublin,</hi> there
was a Skirmiſh, which proved very prejudicial to both the
Families of <hi>Butlers</hi> and <hi>Giraldines,</hi> and the more, becauſe
the Iriſh took advantage thereby to infeſt the Pale, and to
diſturb the Engliſh Borders: However, in <hi>September</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
more Alterations were made in the great Offices of
State; <hi>Alexander Plunket</hi> was made Lord Chancelor; <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Butler</hi> Maſter of the Rolls; and <hi>Nicholas Turner</hi> was
conſtituted Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas in <hi>Auguſt</hi>
before; and the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Prior of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
were ſent Ambaſſadors to the French King.</p>
                  <p>This Summer was ſo dry, that abundance of Cattel periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

a multitude of People, and particularly the Lord of <hi>Slane</hi>
died of the Plague.</p>
                  <p>But a greater Miſchief than this hapned to the unfortunate
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Arrival of <hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> who
to ſupply the Defects of the former Impoſture, did pretend
to be <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Second Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Fourth, to whom the Crown did really belong, if he were
living, and this <hi>Perkin</hi> did perſonate him ſo well, that there
remains ſome doubt to this day, whether he were an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor

to let him firſt appear in <hi>Portugal,</hi> as a Child that had in

beſides, <hi>Portugal</hi> was a Place with which the Ducheſs
of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had not much Correſpondence, and therefore
it could not be ſuſpected that ſhe had a hand in the Cheat;
but however that be, young <hi>Perkin</hi> ſet Sail from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and
arrived ſafely at <hi>Cork,</hi> where he was kindly received by the
Citizens, and particularly by <hi>John Walters,</hi> an eminent
Merchant of <hi>Cork,</hi> who probably was then Mayor (and

                     <note place="margin">1493.</note> on <hi>Friday</hi> after <hi>Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
which (it ſeems) vacated ſome Indictments and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions,
that had formerly been made to the prejudice of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65997:125"/>
this Lord Deputy, by the Means of the Lord <hi>Portleſter</hi> (and
now the Tables being turn'd, and the Votaries of the Houſe
of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> at Helm, the Lord <hi>Portleſter</hi> himſelf was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
in the Exchequer, for the miſs-management of his
Office of Treaſurer.) This Parliament did alſo repeal a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Act made againſt the City of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and reſtored
that City to all its ancient Liberties and Priviledges, and it
is probable that there was alſo an Act of Parliament now
made for the general Reſumption of all the Crown Lands, that
were alienated or granted away, ſince the firſt year of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; but none of the Acts of this Parliament
are Printed, except one, for the cleanſing of the Water-Courſe
in St. <hi>Patrick</hi>-ſtreet in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and ſo this Parliament
being diſſolved in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Lord Deputy, on the ſixth of
<hi>September</hi> following, reſigned to</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Preſton,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Gormanſtown,</hi> Lord Deputy to
the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> who (it ſeems) had not Commiſſion
to call a Parliament; nevertheleſs he did call one, which
met at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and made ſeveral Statutes which were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
void, for the Defect aforeſaid; however they were
expreſly repeal'd by 10 <hi>Hen. 7. cap.</hi> 23. And theſe farther
Reaſons were given for it.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Lord Lieutenant had ſurrendred his Patent
before the Summons. And,</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe the Parliamentary Summons did not iſſue to all
the Shires, but to four Shires only.</p>
                  <p>On the Twelfth of <hi>September,</hi> this Lord Deputy called ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Nobility to <hi>Trim,</hi> where they ſubſcribed Articles
for the Peace of the Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man ſhould make
War without the Deputies Conſent; and that ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions
and Tributes that were uſed and demanded, ſhould
be abrogated and ſuppreſſed, and that Murderers, Thieves and
Vagabonds ſhould be puniſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There were preſent at
this Aſſembly, <hi>Alexander Plunket,</hi> L. Chancellor, <hi>Girald,</hi> Earl
of <hi>Kildare,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Meath</hi> &amp; <hi>Kildare,</hi> the Lords of <hi>Slane,
Delvin, Killeen, Houth, Trimletſton</hi> and <hi>Dunſany, &amp;c.</hi> And they
gave Recognizanſe and Hoſtages for the obſervation of thoſe
Articles; and after this, he called the Parliament aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>October</hi> the late Lord Deputy <hi>Fitz-Symons</hi> went into
<hi>England,</hi> to give the King a full Account, as well of his
own Government, as of the preſent State of the Kingdom of
<hi>Ireland;</hi> and not long after, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>November</hi> following, the
Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> hearing he was impeach'd in <hi>England,</hi> went
alſo thither to juſtifie himſelf before the King, but the L. Deputy
(leaving the Government in the Hands of his Son) followed
the Earl to <hi>England,</hi> and by the Aſſiſtance of Sir <hi>James Ormond,</hi>
Lord Treaſurer of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he ſo far prevailed, that <hi>Kildare</hi>'s
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65997:126"/>
Juſtification was rejected, and himſelf ſent over Priſoner to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to the end the Matter might be more fully exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon the place,<note place="margin">1494.</note> by</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> Knight of the Garter, Lord Deputy,
whoſe chief Errand was to ſuppreſs the Abettors of <hi>Perkin
Warbeck;</hi> he came over the thirteenth of <hi>September,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
made great Alterations amongſt the Miniſters of
State; <hi>Henry Dean,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> he conſtituted Lord
Chancellor, Sir <hi>Hugh Conway</hi> was appointed Treaſurer, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Bouring</hi> was made Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, as
<hi>John Topcliff</hi> was of the Common Pleas, and <hi>Walter Ever</hi>
was made Chief Baron of the Exchequer, all which were
Engliſhmen born, and good Lawyers, and were ſworn of
the Privy Council of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Deputy brought over with him about one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Souldiers, and reſolved to invade <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> to purſue
ſome of <hi>Perkins</hi>'s Friends that fled thither; it is ſtrange
he ſhould uſe the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi>'s aſſiſtance in this
Expedition; however, together they went, accompanied
with Sir <hi>James Ormond,</hi> who had reſigned the Office of
High Treaſurer; they did great Execution on the Iriſh, and
haraſs'd the Territories of <hi>O Hanlon</hi> and <hi>Mac Genis,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
It was ſuggeſted, That <hi>Kildare</hi> did ſecretly treat and
conſpire with <hi>O Hanlon,</hi> to deſtroy the Lord Deputy; for
which he was Attainted, as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter; but
it ſeems he was innocent of that Matter, not only becauſe <hi>O
Hanlon</hi> cleared him upon Oath two years after; but alſo,
becauſe he was acquitted in <hi>England,</hi> upon full hearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Kildare</hi>'s Brother did at this time ſeize on
the Caſtle of <hi>Caterlogh;</hi> whereupon the Lord Deputy was
neceſſitated to clap up a ſort of a Peace with <hi>O Hanlon</hi> and
<hi>Macgenis;</hi> and ſo having taken their Oaths and Hoſtages, he
immediately marched to <hi>Caterlogh,</hi> which, after ten days
Siege,<note place="margin">1494.</note> was ſurrendred unto him.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in <hi>November,</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> before the Feaſt of St.
<hi>Andrew,</hi> ſate that famous Parliament at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> which
Enacted,</p>
                  <p>I. That the Treaſurer might appoint his under-Officers
here, as is uſed in <hi>England,</hi> and ſhall account once a year
here, before the Barons of the Exchequer, and ſuch of the
Council as the Lord Deputy ſhall appoint; and the ſame
Accounts to be certified into <hi>England,</hi> and finally determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſetled there.</p>
                  <p>II. That no Miniſter of Juſtice, <hi>viz.</hi> The Chancellor,
Treaſurer, Judges, Clerk, or Maſter of the Rolls, nor any
Officer Accomptant, ſhall have their Places but during the
King's Pleaſure.</p>

                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:65997:126"/>
III. An Act adnulling a Preſcription which Traytors and
Rebels claimed in <hi>Ireland:</hi> The Reaſon of this Act was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> (at his laſt being in <hi>Ireland</hi>)
did Cauſe an Act to be made, That <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
for Refugees, and that it ſhould be Treaſon to diſturb
any body there, by any Writ, Privy Seal, or other Matter
from <hi>England;</hi> and this he did, becauſe he was then in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and to encourage his Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans
to repair to him in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and by vertue of this Act,
he Executed <hi>William Overy</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was Servant to the
Earl of <hi>Ormond.</hi> And now the Abettors of <hi>Lambert Symnel</hi>
and <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi> (which are the <hi>Lads</hi> mentioned in the
new Statute) excuſed themſelves upon the aforeſaid Act;
and therefore it was now repealed, and all Receivers and
Maintainers of Traytors, are by this Act made guilty of
Treaſon; and Obedience is commanded to be paid to the
Great Seal and Privy Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and to Letters Miſſive
under the Kings Signet.</p>
                  <p>IV. The Famous Statute, commonly called <hi>Poyning</hi>'s <hi>Act,</hi>
That no Parliament ſhould for the future be holden in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
until the Chief Governor and Council do firſt certifie
the King, under the Great Seal of that Land, as well the
Cauſes and Conſiderations, as the Acts they deſign to paſs,
and till the ſame be approv'd by the King and Council, and
a Licence thereupon do iſſue from the King to ſummon a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and that all Parliaments hereafter holden in other
manner, be void and of none effect. And it is to be noted,
That this Act was by the Statutes of 28 <hi>Hen. 8. c.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 20.
ſuſpended as to that Parliament, and by the Statute of 3, &amp; 4.
<hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> it is very excellently and at large explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and by the Statute of 11 <hi>Eliz. c. 1. Poyning</hi>'s <hi>Act</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ſuſpended or ſuperſeded, as to that Parliament, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
that their moſt worthy Governour (Sir <hi>Henry
Sydny</hi>) would not paſs any Bills prejudicial to the
Queen or the Kingdom; but becauſe they had not the ſame
Aſſurance of their future Governours, they did upon ſecond
thoughts, and in another Seſſion, make a Law (11 <hi>Eliz.
c.</hi> 8.) That no Bill ſhould for the future be certified into
<hi>England,</hi> for the Repeal of <hi>Poyning</hi>'s <hi>Act,</hi> until firſt ſuch Bill
ſhould be approved of by the Majority of both Houſes of
Parliament in <hi>Ireland;</hi> nevertheleſs whenever it ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that the Engliſh and Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall
overtop its Enemies, and make a Majority in Parliamentary
Aſſemblies, that <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Poyning</hi>'s, which was made only to
help the Engliſh when too weak for the Iriſh, will be obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete
and uſeleſs, when the Iriſh Popiſh Intereſt becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.</p>

V. That all the Statutes againſt Proviſors, made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

Conſultations, except their Recorder, on pain of an hundred
Marks, and all their By-Laws contrary to the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Juriſdiction, to be void; and that this Act be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in every Corporation.</p>
                  <p>VIII. That the Statutes of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> be confirm'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,

                  <p>X. That the Captains of Marches do preſent the Names
of their Retinue, by Indenture, that they may anſwer for
their Defaults, and that it be Felony to ſuccour, or willingly
ſuffer Rebels or Enemies to paſs and re-paſs the Marches, and
that every Proprietor of Land in the Marches, do reſide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or appoint a ſufficient Deputy to do ſo, on pain of loſing
his Eſtate, during his Abſence; and that all People near the

their beſt defenſible Array, to defend the ſame.</p>
                  <p>XI. That no man compound for the Death or Murder of
his Friend or Relation, nor revenge it but according to
Law.</p>
                  <p>XII. That no man keep Fire-Arms after Proclamation, on

Wicklow, Green-Caſtle, Carlingford, Caſtlefergus</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd
11 <hi>Car. 1. c.</hi> 6.) And hence aroſe the vulgar Error, That
no man can be Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
born.</p>
                  <p>XV. An Act about the Records of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter, Conaught</hi> and
<hi>Trim.</hi>

                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:65997:127"/>
XVI. That the Lords appear in their Robes every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                  <p>XVII. That no man ſhall make Peace or War without the

                  <p>There were many other Statutes made at this Parliament,<note place="margin">Lib. D.</note>
although they are not Printed;<note place="margin">Davis, 171.</note> One was, That the King ſhould
have a Subſidy of twenty ſix ſhillings and eight pence out of
every ſixſcore Acres of Arable Land, in lieu of Purveyance,
which, it ſeems, was (together with Coyn and Livery) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
by that Act; <hi>Rot. Parl. c.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>And another Act gave Power to the Lord Treaſurer to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the Kingdom, on the Death or Surrender of the Chief
Governor, until the Kings Pleaſure were known.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo an Act made, in favour of the Knights of
St. <hi>John</hi>'s of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to reſume all their Poſſeſſions aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Prior <hi>Keating,</hi> or his Predeceſſor <hi>Thomas Talbot,</hi> and
to reſtore the Jewels and Reliques they had pawn'd, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Preceptors they had placed in the Commanderies,
and that no man but an Engliſhman ſhould be Prior for the
future.</p>
                  <p>Another Act made a general Reſumption of all the Grants
made by the Crown ſince the laſt day of the Reign of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">Lib. G.</note> except ſome Particulars mentioned in
the Act; and another Act, <hi>Rot. Parl. c.</hi> 41. attaints the Earl
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65997:128"/>
of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and his Brother <hi>James,</hi> for High Treaſon, for
correſponding with <hi>O Hanlon,</hi> and ſeizing the Caſtle of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlogh,</hi>
for extorting Coyn and Livery, and for treating
with the King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> however he was afterward acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>England,</hi> and received into favour; and perhaps there
was another Act, to diſſolve the Fraternity of S. <hi>George;</hi> for
it is certain that about this time that Brotherhood fell; and
ſo I have done with this Famous Parliament, when I have
told you that it is a Miſtake in the Printed Statute-Book, to
place it <hi>anno</hi> 1495, becauſe it is manifeſt, That <hi>November,</hi>
1494, was in the tenth Year of this King's Reign.</p>
                  <p>It is ſcarce worth mentioning,<note place="margin">Ware, 43.</note> That during this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Lord Deputy made another Expedition into <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi>
becauſe the Iriſh fled into their Faſtneſſes, ſo that he reaped
but ſmall Fruit for his Journey. In his Abſence he left a
Commiſſion with the Chanchellor, to continue, adjourn,
prorogue or diſſolve the Parliament, as he ſaw cauſe.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Cormock mac Teige mac Carthy</hi> of <hi>Muskry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1495.</note>
was baſely murdered by his Brother <hi>Owen</hi> (Anceſtor of the
<hi>Mac Carthyes</hi> of <hi>Cloghroe),</hi> and was buried in the Abby of
<hi>Kilcrea,</hi> which he himſelf had founded.</p>
                  <p>But let us return to <hi>Perkin Werbeck,</hi> who ſet ſail from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
with about ſix hundred Men, and arrived on the Coaſt
of <hi>Kent;</hi> but he found ill treatment there, for one hundred
and ſixty of his Men were taken Priſoners, and afterwards
executed: Thence he ſailed to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he ſtaid ſome
time in <hi>Munſter,</hi> (probably at <hi>Cork</hi>) but finding the Iriſh
unable to give him any conſiderable Aſſiſtance, and fearing
the Forces of the Lord Deputy, he went thence into <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and by that King's Conſent married the Earl of <hi>Huntly</hi>'s
Daughter, who was nearly related to the Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
The King of Scots did invade <hi>England,</hi> in favour of <hi>Perkin,</hi>
but finding that none of the Engliſh came to aſſiſt the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
he waſted <hi>Northumberland</hi> and returned.</p>
                  <p>And thus Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> drove <hi>Perkin</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and ſuppreſſed his Abettors, and eſtabliſhed many good Laws,
which though for the preſent they extended no further than
the Pale, yet their Effect and Influence increaſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
as faſt as the King's Authority did, ſo that thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
are at this day in full force over all the Kingdom: And
the King finding <hi>Ireland</hi> in ſo quiet a condition, recalled the
Lord Deputy, and for his good Service made him Knight of
the Garter; And in his place appointed</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry Dean,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1495.</note> Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
afterwards Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1496.</note> to be Lord Juſtice, and
on the twenty ſixth of <hi>April, William Ratcliff</hi> was made
Vice-Treaſurer and <hi>John Pimp</hi> Treaſurer at War; and on the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65997:128"/>
twenty fifth of <hi>June</hi> the Lord <hi>Delvin</hi> was made General, for
defence of the Pale; and in <hi>July Octavianus</hi> Archbiſhop of
<hi>Armagh</hi> held a Synod at <hi>Droghedah,</hi> the Acts whereof are
not to be found; and in <hi>Auguſt Hugh O Donel</hi> being returned
out of <hi>Scotland</hi> encountred and defeated <hi>O Connor,</hi> near <hi>Sligo.</hi>
Whereupon he beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Sligo,</hi> but without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
for being frightned with the News of the Approach of
the <hi>Burks</hi> of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> he raiſed the Siege, and retired in
haſt towards <hi>Tyrconnel:</hi> But <hi>Burk</hi> was not ſo ſatisfied, but
burnt and deſtroyed all the adjacent Territories, that belonged
to <hi>O Donel</hi>'s Partiſans.</p>
                  <p>But the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> was ſtill kept in Priſon, in <hi>England,</hi>
for Grief whereof his Counteſs died. The Earl was accuſed
of burning the Church of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> and many Witneſſes were
ready to prove it, when contrary to all their Expectations,
he readily confeſſed the Fact, and ſwore by Jeſus, That he
would never have done it, but that he thought the Archbiſhop
was in it: Which being uttered with a bluntleſs, peculiar to
this Lord, did exceedingly work upon the King; for whilſt
the Earl did ſo earneſtly urge that for his Excuſe, which was
the greateſt Aggravation of his Crime, the King eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
That a Perſon of that Natural Simplicity and Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
could not be guilty of thoſe Fineſſes and Intrigues that
were objected againſt him. It is reported of this Earl, That
he deſired the King to permit him to have Council to manage
his Cauſe, ſince he was altogether unqualified to deal with
ſuch cunning Knaves as his Adverſaries. The King told him,
He ſhould have what Counſel he would chooſe; and that it
concerned him to get Counſel that were very good, for that
he doubted his Cauſe was very bad. The Earl replied, That
he would pitch upon the beſt Counſel in <hi>England.</hi> Who is
that? ſaid the King. Marry even your Majeſty, quoth the
Earl: Whereat the King laughed. But nevertheleſs, he ſo
requited <hi>Kildare,</hi> for his Complement, that when the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
concluded his Oration, That all <hi>Ireland</hi> could not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
this Man; the King took that occaſion to make reply,
That therefore he was the fitteſt Man to govern <hi>Ireland:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ware, 49.</note> And
ſo for his Jeſt-ſake made him Lord Lieutenant of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by his Letters Patent of the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
him to his Honour and Eſtate. Nevertheleſs, the King
kept the Earls eldeſt Son, <hi>Girald,</hi> as Hoſtage of the Father's
Fidelity; which proved to be a matter of Caution rather than
of Neceſſity, for no body could behave himſelf with more
Loyalty to his Prince, nor more Vigor againſt the Iriſh,
than the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> did from henceforward. But to

<hi>Thomond</hi> againſt <hi>O Brian;</hi> he went through the City of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi>

and afterwards took and raſed the Caſtle of <hi>Ballyniti,</hi> or
<hi>Ballynice,</hi> and ſo returned to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and was reconciled to
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> to their mutual Eaſe and Quiet,
and to the great Advantage of Publick Affairs, which often
ſuffer (eſpecially in <hi>Ireland</hi>) by the private Animoſities of
the Grandees.</p>
                  <p>But the Biſhop of <hi>Bangor</hi> was recalled into <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Walter</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> was made Lord Chancellor, in his
ſtead. This good Archbiſhop, in a Synod at <hi>Dublin anno</hi> 1492,
procured a Penſion for a Divinity-Reader there, to be paid
by him and his Suffragans, and their Succeſſors for ever: And
it is reported of him, That being preſent when a famous Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
made a moſt eloquent Speech to the King, his Majeſty
asked the Archbiſhop, How he liked the Oration? The good
old Man replied, That he ſaw no other Fault in it but <hi>Flattery.</hi>
As God ſhall love me (quoth the King) That is the very
Fault I my ſelf eſpied.</p>
                  <p>The King, by advice of the Lord Lieutenant, reſolved to
pardon thoſe great Men that had been concerned with <hi>Perkin
Warbeck,</hi> leſt Deſpair might induce them to new Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And accordingly the Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> the Archbiſhop
of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Waterford,</hi> and many other
of the principal Men of <hi>Munſter,</hi> were pardoned; and the
Liberties and Charters of <hi>Youghal</hi> were reſtored and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and their Priviledges enlarged.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time dyed <hi>Rowland Fitz-Euſtace</hi> Baron of <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſter,</hi>
who at ſeveral times had been Deputy, Chancellor,

the Cuſtom of Taniſtry.</p>
                  <p>But it is time to return to <hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> whom we left
in the Arms of a fair Lady in <hi>Scotland;</hi> that King had already
made ſeveral Eſſays in favour of this ſuppoſititious Prince;
but now his Affairs preſſed him to make a Peace with the

were delivered up: It was therefore neceſſary for the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
to ſeek new Quarters:<note place="margin">1497.</note> And therefore being ſecretly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with Neceſſaries for his
Voyage, he embarqued with his Wife and Family, and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſafely at <hi>Cork</hi> the twenty ſixth of <hi>July;</hi> he could not have
pitcht upon a Place more prone to Rebellion at that time,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65997:129"/>
but curſt Cows have ſhort Horns, and their Ability was not
ſuitable to their Inclinations; however, he liſted one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty Soldiers, and by the Aid (or at leaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance)
of the Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> he got Conveniences for
their Tranſportation: And ſo finding the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> ſo
firm and potent, that no good was to be done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
receiving an Invitation from the Corniſhmen, he ſailed direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Cornwal</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> and landed ſafely at <hi>Whitſand-bay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Waterford</hi> (which for its loyalty to the Crown
againſt <hi>Lambert Symnel,</hi> had received great Favours and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
from his Majeſty) was now altogether as vigorous
againſt <hi>Perkin;</hi> and by its diſcreet behaviour in this Affair,
well deſerved the Motto, <hi>Intacta manet Waterfordia;</hi> That
City manned out four Ships, and ſent them in purſuit of
<hi>Perkin,</hi> but Fortune did not favour that Generous and Loyal
Deſign.</p>
                  <p>This Impoſtor being thus arrived in <hi>England,</hi> took upon
him the Name of <hi>Richard</hi> IV, King of <hi>England;</hi> and as ſuch
behaved himſelf, and acted his Part ſo well, that he would
often lament the Deſtruction of his People, and would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
bemoan the Tyranny and Oppreſſions they lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which ſort of Deportment took with the common People
exceedingly, inſomuch that ſome thouſands of them came to
him at <hi>Bodmin,</hi> &amp; with them he beſieged <hi>Exceſter,</hi> and aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the City with great vigour and Reſolution, which the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
and Loyal Citizens, by the help of ſome of their
Country Neighbours, as valiantly defended: Hereupon <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>
raiſed the Siege, and marched to <hi>Taunton,</hi> and although
the Corniſhmen continued reſolute to conquer or dye, yet
<hi>Perkin</hi> perceiving their Courage was greater than their
Strength, and finding that the King's Army did daily increaſe,
whilſt his did decreaſe, he privately withdrew to the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
of <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> and afterwards ſurrendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and being impriſoned in the Tower, he made his eſcape
once, and attempted it the ſecond time, and was therefore,
together with his Friend <hi>John Waters,</hi> Mayor of <hi>Cork,</hi> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Tyburne,</hi> where he confirmed the Confeſſion he had
formerly made, which was to this effect,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Being born in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Campion, 104.</note> in the Town of <hi>Turney,</hi> put my
ſelf in Service with a Britton, called <hi>Pregent Meno;</hi> the
which brought me with him into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and when we were there
arrived, in the Town of <hi>Cork,</hi> they of the Town (becauſe I
was arrayed with ſome Cloaths of Silk, of my ſaid Maſters)
threeped upon me, That I ſhould be the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi>'s Son,
that was before time at <hi>Divelin;</hi> and foraſmuch as I denyed it,
there was brought unto me the Holy Evangeliſts and the Croſs,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65997:130"/>
by the Mayor of the Town, called <hi>Ino Lavallin,</hi> and there I
took my Oath, That I was not the ſaid Duke's Son, nor
none of his Blood. After this came to me an Engliſhman,
whoſe Name was <hi>Stephen Poytow,</hi> with one <hi>John Walter,</hi>
and ſware to me, That they knew well that I was King <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>'s
Baſtard-Son, to whom I anſwered with like Oaths, That I
was not; and then they adviſed me not to be afraid, but that I
ſhould take it upon me boldly: And if I would ſo do, they would
aſſiſt me with all their Power, againſt the King of <hi>England;</hi>
and not only they, but they were aſſured, That the Earls of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
and <hi>Kildare</hi> ſhould do the ſame, for they paſſed not what
part they took, ſo they might be avenged on the King of <hi>England;</hi>
and ſo againſt my Will they made me to learn Engliſh, and
taught me what I ſhould do and ſay: And after this they called
me <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> ſecond Son to <hi>Edward</hi> IV, becauſe
King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Baſtard-Son was in the Hands of the King of
<hi>England.</hi> And upon this they entred into this falſe Quarrel;
and within ſhort time after, the French King ſent Embaſſadors
into <hi>Ireland, viz. Lyot Lucas</hi> and <hi>Stephen Frayn,</hi> and ſo I
went into <hi>France,</hi> and thence into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and thence into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1498.</note> which were

at <hi>Trim,</hi> which met on the twenty ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
in the fourteenth Year of the King's Reign, which muſt be
<hi>anno</hi> 1498. (and not 1499. as it is miſtaken in the printed
Statutes, for the King began his Reign the twenty ſecond Day
of <hi>Auguſt, 1485.).</hi> There is but one Act of this Parliament
extant; and that is, To make all the Statutes in <hi>England,</hi>
about the Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe, to be of force in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
after Proclamation at <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Drogheda.</hi> A very

retro-ſpect, all former Engliſh-Statutes being ratified here,
by <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Act of 10 <hi>Hen. 7. cap.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Henry O Neal,</hi> who had murdered his

at Liberty all the Priſoners that <hi>Neal mac Art O Neal</hi> kept

forced the Inhabitants of that City, and of <hi>Kingſale,</hi> to ſwear
Allegiance, and to bind themſelves thereunto both by Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Hoſtages; which it ſeems he thought were ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

                  <p>After his return, in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi>

                  <p>The Lord Deputy began the Year 1499 with an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Death of <hi>Gil-duff</hi> was Chief or Lord of <hi>Thomond</hi>) had great
Conteſts with Sir <hi>Pierce Butler,</hi> about Preys and Bounds of

in a Battle, wherein the <hi>Butlers</hi> were defeated, and the

                  <p>It ſeems that there was another Parliament held at <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermond</hi>
(which Town, I ſuppoſe, was then, and ſtill is,

which gave the King and his Heirs an Impoſt of twelve

hours very dubious; but at laſt, the Lord Deputy got the
Victory, with the Slaughter of four thouſand of his Enemies,
(nine thouſand, ſays the Book of <hi>Houth</hi>) and he alſo took
ſome Priſoners; amongſt whom the two Sons of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick Burk,</hi>
were the chiefeſt; it is prodigious, that not one Engliſhman

the white Book of the Exchequer it is ſo recorded.<note place="margin">Holingſhead, 79</note> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this great Victory, was the Surrender of <hi>Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>

and the overloading the Conquerors with Prey and Booty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kildare</hi> being returned, beſtowed thirty Tun of Wine
upon his Souldiers, and the King beſtowed a <hi>Garter</hi> on him,

                     <hi>Walter Fitz-Symons,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> was ſent by
the Lord Deputy and Council; to give his Majeſty an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this prodigious Succeſs, and to treat with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
about other Matters of State: He departed the 20th
of <hi>September,</hi> and performed what he had in Charge, to the
great ſatisfaction, as well of the King, as of thoſe that ſent
him, and in a little time return'd to <hi>Ireland,</hi> with honour
and applauſe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the King was importunate with Pope
<hi>Julius</hi> the Second, to Canonize his Predeceſſor King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Sixth, and in order to it, he cauſed a Book to be written
of his Virtues and Miracles, and had it Printed: And
the Pope recommended the Examination of the Matter

<hi>Wincheſter,</hi> by his Bull, which the Curious may find at large
in Sir <hi>James Ware</hi>'s Annals, <hi>pag.</hi> 73. But it ſeems nothing

                  <p>This Plague was followed with a Famine,<note place="margin">1505.</note> by reaſon of

OF
HENRY VIII.
KING OF
England and France,

                  <p>
                     <hi>HENRY</hi> the Eighth, the only, ſurviving
Son of his Father, ſucceeded, peaceably, to
the Throne of his Anceſtors,<note place="margin">April, 22. 1509.</note> in the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Year of his Age: In him both
Roſes were united, for by his Father he
was Heir to the Lancaſtrian Line, and by
his Mother to the Houſe of <hi>York;</hi> and ſo being without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor,
was the more capable to effect thoſe great Deſigns,
which he afterwards undertook. He found in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Ireland Gerald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> whom he continued
Lord Juſtice, (and the Year following made him Lord Deputy)
and on good Reaſons, for though <hi>Kildare</hi> was counted Raſh
and Unpolitick, yet he was a Man of great Intereſt and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and his Name was more terrible to the Iriſh than an
Army. And here let me obſerve, once for all, That no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Word is more governed by Reputation and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
than the Iriſh, the Common People are dejected by
a Trifle and elevated for leſs than nothing: And this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is manifeſtly juſtified by their frequent Submiſſions,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65997:133"/>
and their as frequent Rebellions; and if any object their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Obſtinacy to the Iriſh Intereſt and Popiſh Religion,
it is eaſily anſwered; That as their Fears are without Cauſe,
ſo their Hopes are without Reaſon, and that their Hopes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
their Fears, is partly to be attributed to the Nature of
Man, (<hi>facile credimus quod volumus</hi>) but chiefly to the
Noblemen and Clergy, whoſe Intereſt and Buſineſs it was
to keep the Mobile always in Expectation, and to make them
believe, That one Day or other the Popiſh Intereſt would
prevail.</p>
                  <p>The King unwilling to diſturb an infant Government, by
unneceſſary and diſobliging Changes, did likewiſe continue
all the Officers of State in their Dignities; who together
with the Deputy, and the Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> immediately proclaimed him, King of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with as much Formality and
State as the time could afford; which was followed with the
Shouts of the People, ringing of Bells and Bonfires, as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
and the like was done in the other chief Cities and
Towns: After which, on the twenty fourth Day of <hi>June,</hi>
the King and the Queen were crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by

both Sides were reſolved to fight, which they did deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to the great loſs of both Parties, eſpecially of the Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
who were tired with long Marches, and overburthened
with too much Prey; and perhaps it had been fatal to them,
if the Night had not ended the Conflict, which gave <hi>Kildare</hi>
the Opportunity to make a ſafe Retreat the next Day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further Damage.</p>
                  <p>This Year there were ſo great Floods and Inundations,<note place="margin">1511.</note> that
Trees, Houſes and Bridges were overturned in ſeveral Places.
<hi>Cahir O Connor,</hi> Prince of <hi>Offaly,</hi> was murdered by his own

                  <p>

<hi>Kildare</hi> met with much oppoſition, ſo that he had little to do
but to burn and waſte the Country, and to gather the Preys
together; moſt part whereof he divided among his Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rokeby</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> held a provincial Synod at

buried.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Citizens of <hi>Dublin</hi> did aſſault the Earl

thoſe Houſes very incident, ever ſince the ninth Year of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, bred ſome trouble in <hi>Ireland:</hi> The Plot
of which mutual Grudge was grounded upon the factious
Diſſention, which was in <hi>England</hi> between the Houſes of
<hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter, Kildare</hi> cleaving to <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Ormond</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
to <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> to the upholding of which Diſcord, both
theſe Noblemen laboured with Tooth and Nail to overcrow,
and conſequently to overthrow one the other: And for ſo
much as they were in Honour Peers, they wrought by Hook
and by Crook, to be in Authority Superiors. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therefore, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, being
caſt on the Houſe of <hi>Kildare, James</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> a deep
and far reaching Man, giving back like a butting Ram, to ſtrike
the harder Puſh, deviſed to inveagle his Adverſary by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
and Courteſie, being not then able to over-match him
with Stoutneſs or Preheminence: Whereupon <hi>Ormond</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
his Letters to the Deputy, ſpecifying a Slander raiſed
on him and his, That he purpoſed to deface his Government,
and to withſtand his Authority: And for the clearing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Adherent, ſo it ſtood with the Deputy his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
he would make his ſpeedy Repair to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
there, in an open Audience, would purge himſelf of all
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65997:134"/>
ſuch odious Crimes, of which he was wrongfully Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
                  <p>To this reaſonable Requeſt had the Lord Deputy no ſooner
condeſcended, than <hi>Ormond</hi> with a puiſſant Army marched
towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> incamping in an Abby in the Suburbs of
the City, named <hi>S. Thomas Court;</hi> The approaching of ſo
great an Army, of the Citizens ſuſpected, and alſo of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare</hi>'s
Counſellors, greatly diſliked. Laſtly, the Extortion
that the lawleſs Soldiers uſed in the Pale, by ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
detected. Theſe three Points, with divers other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious
Circumſtances laid and put together, did miniſter
occaſion rather of further Diſcord, than of any preſent Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>Ormond</hi> perſiſting ſtill in his humble Suit, ſent his
Meſſenger to the Lord Deputy, declaring, That he was preſt,
and ready to accompliſh the Tenor of his Letters, and there
did attend (as became him) his Lordſhip his Pleaſure; and
as for the Company he brought with him from <hi>Munſter,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
ſuſpicious Brains did rather of a malicious craftineſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
the worſt, than of charitable Wiſdom did judge the
beſt; yet notwithſtanding, upon Conference had with his
Lordſhip, he would not doubt to ſatisfie him at full, in all
Points, wherewith he could be with any Colour charged,
and ſo to ſtop up the Spring, from whence all the envious
Suſpicions guſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kildare,</hi> with this mild Meſſage intreated, appointed the
Meeting to be at S. <hi>Patrick</hi> his Church; where they were
ripping up one to another their Mutual Quarrels, rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
the Damages they ſuſtained, than acknowledging
the Injuries they offered: The Citizens and <hi>Ormond</hi> his Army
fell at ſome jar, for the Oppreſſion and Exaction with which
the Soldiers ſurcharged them; with whom as part of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
bickered, ſo a round knot of Archers ruſhed into the
Church, meaning to have murthered <hi>Ormond,</hi> as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and Bell-Wether of all this lawleſs Rabble. The Earl of
<hi>Ormond</hi> ſuſpecting that he had been betraied, fled to the
Chapter-Houſe, put too the Door, ſparring it with Might
and Main. The Citizens, in their Rage, imagining, That
every Poſt in the Church had been one of the Soldiers, ſhot
hab nab, at random, up to the Rood-Loft, and to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
leaving ſome of their Arrows ſticking in the Images.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kildare</hi> purſuing <hi>Ormond</hi> to the Chapiter-Houſe-door, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
on his Honour, That he ſhould receive no Villany.
Whereupon the recluſe craving his Lordſhips Hand, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
him his Life, there was a Clift in the Chapiter-Houſe-Door
pierced at a trice, to the end both the Earls ſhould have
ſhaken Hands and be reconciled. But <hi>Ormond</hi> ſurmiſing that
this Drift was intended for ſome further Treachery, that if
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65997:135"/>
he would ſtretch out his Hand, it had been percaſe chopt
off, refuſed that Profer, vntil <hi>Kildare</hi> ſtretch'd in his Hand
to him, and ſo the Door was opened, they both embraced,
the Storm appeaſed, and all their Quarrels for that preſent
rather diſcontinued than ended. In this Garboil one of the
Citizens, ſurnamed <hi>Blanchfield,</hi> was ſlain. This latter Quarrel
being like a green Wound, rather bungerly botcht than
ſoundly cured, in that <hi>Kildare</hi> ſuſpected, That ſo great an
Army (which the other alledged to be brought for the
Guard of his Perſon) to have been of purpoſe aſſembled, to
outface him and his Power, in his own Country, and <hi>Ormond</hi>
miſtruſted, That this tracherous Practice of the Dublinians,
was by <hi>Kildare</hi> deviſed. Theſe and the like Surmiſes, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by both the Noblemen miſdeemed, and by the continual
twatling of Fliring Clawbacks in their Ears, whiſpered, bred
and foſtered a Malice betwixt them and their Poſterity, many
Years incurable; which cauſed much Stir and Unquietneſs
in the Realm, until the Confuſion of the one Houſe, and the
nonage of the other, ended and buried their mutual Quarrels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ormond</hi> was nothing inferior to the other in Stomach, and
in reach of Policy far beyond him. <hi>Kildare</hi> was in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
mild, to his Enemies ſtern, to the Iriſh ſuch a Scourge,
that rather for deſpite of him, than for Favour of any part,
they relyed for a time to <hi>Ormond,</hi> came under his Protection,
ſerved at his Call, performed by Starts (as their manner is)
the Duty of good Subjects. <hi>Ormond</hi> was ſecret, and of great
forecaſt, very ſtaid in Speech, dangerous of every Trifle
that touched his Reputation. <hi>Kildare</hi> was open and
plain, hardly able to rule himſelf, when he was moved to
Anger; not ſo ſharp as ſhort, being eaſily diſpleaſed and
ſooner appeaſed; being in a Rage with certain of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
for Faults they committed, one of his Horſemen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Maſter <hi>Boice</hi> (a Gentleman that retained to him) an
Iriſh Hobby, on condition, That he would pluck an Hair
from the Earl his Beard. <hi>Boice</hi> taking the Profer at rebound,
ſtept to the Earl (with whoſe good Nature he was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted) parching in the Heat of his Choler, and ſaid,
So it is, and if it like your good Lordſhip, one of your
Horſemen promiſed me a choice Horſe, if I ſnip one Hair
from your Beard. Well, quoth the Earl, I agree thereto,
but if thou pluck any more than one, I promiſe thee to bring
my Fiſt from thine Ear.</p>
                  <p>But after all, this ſimple Story is founded on a Miſtake, for
the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> (whoſe Name was <hi>Thomas</hi>) lived in
<hi>England,</hi> in great Repute, all the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh,
and afterwards until his Death, <hi>anno</hi> 1515, and therefore

took up more time than he thought they would require; but

but at <hi>Athy</hi> he fell ſick, and from thence was removed to
<hi>Kildare,</hi> where on the third Day of <hi>September</hi> he died, and
was buried in <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> to which he had been
a liberal Benefactor: And thus were the great Deſigns of this
mighty Lord defeated, even in the midſt of his Career, and
at the very time when he promiſed himſelf moſt Glory and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gerald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> Son of the deceaſed Earl, and Lord
Treaſurer, was by virtue of the Act of Parliament formerly

                        <hi>Spelm.</hi> Gloſ. 334.</note>
made Lord Juſtice by aſſent of the Council: But it
ſeems, that afterwards, <hi>viz. 32 Hen.</hi> 8. there was a Statute
made, intituled, <hi>An Act for the electing of the Lord Juſtice;</hi>
which reſtrained the Council from electing any body but an
Engliſhman born, and not in Orders.</p>
                  <p>The Lord of <hi>Slane</hi> was made Lord High Treaſurer, and
Sir <hi>William Crompton</hi> Lord Chancellor, and all other publick
Matters were ordered as well and expeditiouſly as they could;
nevertheleſs, ſo much time was taken up in theſe Alterations,
and in the Formalities of State, that the Seaſon was too far ſpent
for any military Action this Year, ſo that <hi>Daniel Mac william</hi>
met with little Interruption in taking the Caſtle of <hi>Dunluce;</hi>
nor did the reſt of the Iriſh find any Oppoſition this Winter,
but ravaged over the Country as they pleaſed: However,
they paid dearly for it the next Spring.</p>
                  <p>For the valiant Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1514.</note> who was Heir to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Courage, as well as to his Honour, grew impatient at the
Inſolencies of <hi>O More</hi> and <hi>O Reyly,</hi> and therefore reſolved to
attack them ſucceſſively: He began with <hi>O More,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the county of <hi>Leix,</hi> and beat that Rebel and his Party
into the Woods; which being done, he turned aſide into the
<hi>Brenny,</hi> and took the Caſtle of <hi>Cavan,</hi> and having ſlain <hi>Hugh
O Reyly</hi> and many of his Followers, he chaſed the reſt into
their inacceſſible Faſtneſſes, and then burnt and deſtroyed
the Country, and returned loaden with Booty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Gormanſtown</hi> was the thirteenth of <hi>June</hi>
made Lord Juſtice,<note place="margin">1515.</note> probably in the Abſence of the Earl of
<hi>Kildare,</hi> who might then go to <hi>England</hi> to confer with the
King about the Parliament deſigned to be holden in the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65997:136"/>
Spring: But however that be, it is certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Girald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> was by the King made Lord Deputy,
and on the twenty fifth Day of <hi>February</hi> held a Parliament
at <hi>Dublin,</hi> which by ſeveral Prorogations continued until the
<hi>Thurſday</hi> after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> 1517.<note place="margin">Ware, 92.</note> This Parliament gave
the King a Subſidy, and made one good Act for thoſe times,
<hi>viz.</hi> That no Man ſhall be compelled by Privy Seal to anſwer
any Complaint in <hi>England,</hi> until the Accuſer enters into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance
in the Chancery of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to pay the Defendant
his Coſts and Damages, if he be acquit; which very much
abated that vexatious Courſe of Proceeding, ſo that it is now
obſolete and quite out of uſe.</p>
                  <p>On the third Day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ware, 93.</note> died <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
at <hi>London;</hi> he had been Embaſſador into <hi>France,</hi> Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor
in <hi>England,</hi> and had Place in the Engliſh Parliament
above all the Barons: He was the richeſt Subject the King
had, and left forty thouſand Pound in Money, beſides Jewels,
and as much Land to his two Daughters in <hi>England,</hi> as at
this Day would yield thirty thouſand Pound <hi>per annum;</hi> but
he left no Iſſue Male to enjoy his Iriſh Eſtate, which therefore
deſcended to his Kinſman, Sir <hi>Pierce Butler</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord Deputy to repreſs the Incurſions of the bordering
Iriſh,<note place="margin">1516.</note> and to ſhew himſelf as fit for War as Peace, invaded
<hi>Imaly,</hi> and ſlew <hi>Shane O Toole</hi> in Battle, and ſent his Head to
the Mayor of <hi>Dublin:</hi> Thence he marched into <hi>Ely O Carol,</hi>
where he was joyned by ſeveral Noblemen of <hi>Munſter</hi> and
<hi>Leinſter</hi> of Engliſh Extraction, and particularly by <hi>Pierce</hi> Earl
of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> eldeſt Son of the Earl of <hi>Deſmond;</hi>
and being ſtrengthned with this Supply, he undertook the
Seige of <hi>Lemevan</hi>-Caſtle, which the Garriſon defended for a
Week, and then by Night deſerted, and left it to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
(as it was) by the Lord Deputy. With this good
Succeſs he was encouraged to attempt the Town of <hi>Clonmel;</hi>
which he did with ſo much celerity, that the Townſmen
(being ſurprized) immediately ſurrendred upon Conditions:
And ſo the Deputy ended this Campeign, and returned loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Hoſtages, Prey and Glory.</p>
                  <p>It is worthy obſervation, That the Iriſh had great Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Advantage this Year, by reaſon of a blind Prophecy,
generally believed among them,<note place="margin">Ware, 95.</note> That the pooreſt and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Sept in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould this Year prove the moſt Powerful
and Warlike: It is probable that they were encouraged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to provoke the Lord Deputy to the aforeſaid Expedition:
But however that be, this is certain, <hi>That Superſtition hath
been often fatal to the Iriſh Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Kildare</hi> finding it neceſſary to advance his Victorious
Arms in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1517.</note> reinforced his Troops, and marched into
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65997:136"/>
                     <hi>Lecale,</hi> where he took the Caſtle of <hi>Dundrum,</hi> which had
been very offenſive to the neighbouring Engliſh; thence he
marched againſt <hi>Fylemy Macgenis,</hi> whom he eaſily conquered
and took Priſoner, with the Slaughter of many of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers:
And ſo having waſted that Country, he marched
into <hi>Tyrone,</hi> where he took and burnt the Caſtle of <hi>Dungan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and preyed and burnt all the Country thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>But the Citizens of <hi>Dublin</hi> had not ſo good luck, for a
Company of them (thinking that the very Name of the
King's Forces, could obtain Victories over the Iriſh) made
an Incurſion into <hi>Imaly;</hi> but being (as we ſay) Freſh-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Soldiers, upon the Slaughter of a few of them, the reſt
were frightned back to their Shops.</p>
                  <p>The Winter this Year was exceeding Cold, and the Ice
ſtrong enough to bear all manner of Carriages, which is very
unuſual in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And this Winter Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was born,
whoſe Superſtitious Zeal proved as extream Hot, as the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was Cold.</p>
                  <p>The Fortune and Victories of the Lord Deputy, influenced
the Iriſh to be quiet this Year, and the Reputation of the
Government was ſomewhat augmented, by the Honourable
Peace which the King made with the French,<note place="margin">1518.</note> in <hi>September,</hi>
which was afterwards proclaimed in <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time,<note place="margin">

between Sir <hi>James Ormond,</hi> a Man of great Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and Sir <hi>Pierce Butler,</hi> a valiant Gentleman, about
the Earldom of <hi>Ormond;</hi> the former was a Natural Son of
<hi>John</hi> (by ſome called Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>) elder Brother of
<hi>Thomas,</hi> the laſt Earl; and the other was Son of Sir <hi>James

was Brother to <hi>James,</hi> the Fifth Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> ſo that <hi>Pierce</hi>
his Grandfather (Sir <hi>Edmond</hi>) was Cozen German to the
Deceaſed Earl <hi>Thomas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereby it appears that the Right to that Earldom, was in
Sir <hi>Pierce,</hi> who had married the Lady <hi>Margaret Fitz-Girald,</hi>
the Lord Deputies Siſter; nevertheleſs, Sir <hi>James,</hi> having
formerly been Lord Treaſurer, and a very popular Man, and
probably the Manager of this Eſtate, for his Unkle <hi>Thomas,</hi>
who always reſided in <hi>England,</hi> by the help of the Tenants,
got into poſſeſſion, and by the ſame aſſiſtance, and his own
vigor, he kept what he had got, without allowing any thing to
the right Heir towards his maintenance; whereby that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pair (Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> and his Wife) were reduced to great
extremity.</p>
                  <p>It is ſcarce credible that Perſons of that Quality, and ſo

That ſhe ſhould have Wine enough within twenty four

                  </p>
                  <p>The Enemies of the Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> had the laſt year done
what they could underhand to diſgrace him in <hi>England;</hi>
but he had ſo well defended himſelf by his Friends there,<note place="margin">1519.</note>
that their Deſign was ineffectual; wherefore they addreſs'd

                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Ware, 98.</note> That he had enriched himſelf and Followers by the

<hi>Ireland</hi> too long, and that ſome worthy man ought to
be ſent over, that was impartial to any Faction or Party, and
was able to keep them not only more peaceable amongſt

that the Blood and Vigor, which elſe would be ſpent in their

he came over the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> with
an hundred of the Guards, and a thouſand others, Horſe and
Foot; by this the Cardinal obtained a double Advantage;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65997:137"/>
firſt, In diſappointing his Enemy, the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> of the
Government of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ſecondly, In removing the Earl
of <hi>Surry</hi> from the Court of <hi>England,</hi> where he was a great
Favourite.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Whitſunday</hi> the Lord Lieutenant was alarum'd with a
Report, That <hi>Con Buckah O Neal</hi> (who by Popular Election
ſucceeded his Brother <hi>Art</hi>) had invaded <hi>Meath</hi> (with four
thouſand Horſe, and twelve thouſand Foot, ſays <hi>Paulus Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
but falſly:) <hi>Surry</hi> was in haſte to encounter the Rebel,
not doubting but that the Victory would be an honourable
and happy Omen of his future Government; and therefore
adding to his ſmall Army ſuch of the Militia (called <hi>The
Riſings out</hi>) of City and Country, as he could get on ſo
ſhort warning, he marched to <hi>Slane;</hi> but <hi>O Neal</hi> was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Name of this General, and retir'd ſo faſt, that
the Lord Lieutenant could neither find him nor his Army;
but not long after, <hi>O Neal</hi> ſent Letters to implore Pardon;
which was granted him, on promiſe of future Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>On the ſixth of <hi>September,</hi> the Lord Lieutenant wrote to
the Cardinal, That ſome Soldiers had ſeized on a Boat, with
deſign to be Pyrates; but being prevented and apprehended,
they continued in Gaol, becauſe they could not be capitally
puniſhed by the Common Law, and he had no Clauſe of
Martial Law in his Commiſſion (as indeed he had not, nor
of conferring Knighthood, which is ſtrange) and the better
to ingratiate with the Cardinal, he added, That the Earl of
<hi>Kildare</hi> will be found guilty of ſending Letters to <hi>O Carol,</hi>
to raiſe a Rebellion; and that if <hi>Kildare</hi> ſhould be ſuffered to
come to <hi>Ireland,</hi> the whole Kingdom will be undone; and
he concludes, That there is ſo great a Scarcity and Dearth
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Soldier cannot live on four pence a day,
and therefore deſires that a penny a day may be added to their
Pay.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>October,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. CCC.</note> the King wrote to the Lord Lieutenant, That
there will never be a thorough Reformation in <hi>Ireland,</hi> until
all the Iriſh are ameſnable to Law, and have the Benefit of
it; and not long after a Commiſſion of Martial Law, and
of conferring Knighthood, was ſent to the Lord Lieutenant;
and he was ordered to Knight <hi>O Neal</hi> and other Iriſh Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,
and the King ſent a Collar of Gold to <hi>O Neal,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Lord Lieutenant to prevail with them (if poſſible)
to viſit the King and Court of <hi>England,</hi> in hopes to inure him
to Civility, and a regular way of Living; and the ſame Letter
orders <hi>Surry</hi> to propoſe a Match between the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s

In the mean time, the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> was ſet at liberty
on Bail, his Adverſaries not being able to prove any thing to
the purpoſe againſt him; and ſoon after he was received into
Favour, and attended the King into <hi>France,</hi> and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the Interview of both Kings, near <hi>Calice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maurice Fitz-Thomas</hi> of <hi>Lackagh,</hi> was baſely murdered by

at <hi>Waterford,</hi> where the Earls of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Deſmond,</hi>
by his means were reconciled, and mutually perfected In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures
of Agreement, and gave Hoſtages for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of them.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> was brisk upon the <hi>Birns,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1521.</note> and in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
drove them from place to place, into their Faſtneſſes and
lurking holes; which gave Quiet to the reſt of the Pale;
and it had need of it; for by the wetneſs of the Harveſt,
Corn became very ſcarce. This Lieutenant was reſolved to
make the Army ſerviceable, and as an inſtance of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
he disbanded Sir <hi>John Bulmer</hi>'s Troop, for their Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
or Cowardize.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Surry</hi> calls a Parliament, which met at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the fourth
of <hi>June,</hi> and Enacted many good Laws, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That wilful Burning of Houſes or Reeks of Corn, be
Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Tranſporter of Wool or Flocks, ſhall forfeit
double Value.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe there are but few Free-holders in the four
Shires where the King's Law is uſed, therefore he that has
ten Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> may be Juror in Attaint.</p>
                  <p>This Parliament ended (after ſeveral Prorogations) the
twenty firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1522, and not in <hi>March,</hi> as it is in Sir

                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Surry</hi> was at Dinner in the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
News was brought him, that the O <hi>Mores,</hi> who had confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with the O <hi>Conners,</hi> O <hi>Carol,</hi> and other Iriſh, againſt
the Engliſh, (which they counted the common Enemy)
were on the Borders of the Pale; wherefore, as well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
them, as to revenge the aforeſaid Murder of <hi>Maurice
Fitz-Thomas,</hi> the Lord Lieutenant, accompanied with the
Mayor of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and a choice Band of Citizens, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Nobility, and their Attendants, invaded <hi>Leix,</hi>
(which is a Country full of Woods and Bogs.) The Iriſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
their Forces into ſeveral Parties, and having Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that the Carriages and Baggage of the Army was
ſlenderly guarded, they took their opportunity to attack
that part, and did it ſo briskly, that ſeveral of the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's
Soldiers fled; but the Valour of <hi>Patrick Fitz-Simons</hi>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:65997:138"/>
is recorded by the Hiſtorian, to have preſerved that neceſſary
Concern of the Army, and to have cut off, and brought to
the Mayor's Tent two of the Rebels Heads.</p>
                  <p>Nor perhaps had ſo ſmall a thing been known to the Lord
Lieutenant, or recorded in Hiſtory, but by the means of
<hi>Fitz-Simons</hi>'s his Enemies; for the cowardly Soldiers that
fled, laid the blame on <hi>Fitz-Simons;</hi> who, to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
produced the two Heads, and retorted the Crime of
Cowardiſe upon his Accuſers, and ſo obtained both Reward
and Honour, by a great, but frequent Providence of Divine
Juſtice, that turns even the Malice of our Enemies to our
Advantage.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be obſerved, That in theſe Iriſh Wars, it was harder
to find the Enemy than conquer them. O <hi>More</hi>'s Army,
that was juſt now in a Body formidable to the Pale, is now
divided into ſmall Parties, and thoſe ſculking in thick Woods
and deep Bogs.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Lord Lieutenant marched through theſe Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes,
a Rebel that lay in Ambuſh on the ſide of a Wood,
ſhot at him, and ſtruck the Vizor off his Helmet, but did
not hurt him. Much ado they had to find the ſtubborn Tory,
but at laſt they got him, and <hi>Fitz-Williams</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi>
were forced to hew him to piecs; for he would not
yield.</p>
                  <p>This Accident manifeſted the Danger of the March, and
turned their Arms into <hi>Offaly,</hi> where they beſieged <hi>Monaſter-pheoris,</hi>
but after a Day or two, the Garriſon frightned with
the great Guns, ran a way by Night: So <hi>Surry</hi> left a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
there, and burnt the Country till the twenty third of
<hi>July.</hi> But <hi>O Conner</hi> had not only removed the Corn and
Cattle beforehand, to deprive the Engliſh of Suſtenance and
Prey, but very wiſely invaded <hi>Meath,</hi> hoping by that Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to preſerve his Country.</p>
                  <p>But whether <hi>Surry</hi>'s Expedition and Intelligence occaſioned

                     <hi>O Carol</hi> pretended that the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> had inſtigated

In the mean time Cardinal <hi>Wolſy,</hi> who was Legate <hi>de latere</hi>

                  <p>I have ſeen a Patent of Denization, to <hi>Charles Mac Carthy</hi>

                  <p>This Year was fatal to <hi>Ireland,</hi> no leſs by the Plague than
the Sword, it raged eſpecially at and about <hi>Limrick,</hi> the

And now Jealouſies and Diſcords began to ariſe between
the Earls of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Kildare,</hi> which were ſo maliciouſly
fomented by evil Inſtruments, that the Affinity between
them was little conſidered, nor did their Animoſities deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

                  <p>Among all their Followers <hi>James Fitz Gerald</hi> had moſt

<hi>James Fitz Gerald</hi> near <hi>Ballymore,</hi> was by him ſlain, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that he immediately ſent to <hi>England</hi> an Impeachment againſt
<hi>Kildare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon a Commiſſion iſſued to Sir <hi>Ralph Egerton,</hi>

examine that Matter; with Inſtructions, That if the Earl of
<hi>Kildare</hi> purged himſelf of the Crimes objected, that then
they ſhould depoſe the Deputy, and place <hi>Kildare</hi> in his
room. This Commiſſion and Inſtructions were procured by
the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet, Kildare</hi>'s Father-in-Law, and the
Succeſs was according to his Deſire, for after a ſlight Enquiry
into this Affair, the Commiſſioners made a formal Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between both <hi>Earls,</hi> by an Indenture dated the twenty
eighth of <hi>July,</hi> and in a little time after deprived <hi>Ormond</hi> of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gerald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> Lord Deputy. It ſeems that his

                  <p>That the Earl ſhall ſupport the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> with

Livery,<note place="margin">Lib. H.</note> but at Hoſtings, and then his Soldiers ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with Fleſh, Bread and Ale on Fleſh-Days, or two
Pence in lieu of it, and Fiſh or Butter on Fiſh-Days, or two
Pence in lieu of it; the Foot Soldiers ſhall be content with
three half Pence a Day, in lieu of the ſaid Allowance; and
Boys ſhall be content with what they can get, or a Penny in
lieu of it; and each Trooper ſhall take but twelve Sheaves of
Oats a Night, or two Pence in lieu thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Day this Lord Deputy was ſworn <hi>Con O Neal</hi> carried
the Sword before him to <hi>Thomas-Court,</hi> where he entertained

And ſo theſe Commiſſioners having determined this great
and ſome leſſer Controverſies, returned into <hi>England,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Inſtructions, carried with them the aforeſaid
<hi>James Fitz-Gerald,</hi> as a Priſoner. The Cardinal (<hi>Wolſy</hi>) the
implacable Enemy of the <hi>Giraldines,</hi> was glad of this occaſion
to affront that Noble Family, and therefore cauſed this <hi>James
Fitz-Gerald,</hi> to be carried through the City of <hi>London,</hi> to
Priſon, with a Rope about his Neck. Nevertheleſs, it ſo
happened afterwards, that by the Interceſſion of the Dean of
<hi>Litchfield, James</hi> obtained his Pardon, and was ſent back

                     <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> a Man of great Power and Eſtate
in <hi>Munſter,</hi> had for ſome time deſigned a Rebellion, and to
that end, by his Agent <hi>Anthony Doily,</hi> had ſolicited <hi>Francis</hi>
the Firſt, the <hi>French</hi> King for Aſſiſtance, and entred into
Covenants with him, <hi>anno</hi> 1523. however, it came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
becauſe of the Peace that enſued between both Kings,
upon which this Intrigue was fully diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>The Deputy had Orders to apprehend <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and to
that end did march into <hi>Munſter;</hi> but either that Earl's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
or <hi>Kildare</hi>'s Correſpondence with him prevented
the Arreſt; the latter was vehemently ſuſpected, and not
without Reaſon, becauſe of the great Friendſhip and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity

                  <p>After this, the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> and <hi>Con O Neal,</hi> invaded

                  <p>The laſt Year there was a great Dearth, by reaſon of a

                  <p>Upon this, <hi>Kildare</hi> was impriſoned in the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
and being brought to the Council-Table, Cardinal
<hi>Wolſy,</hi> then Lord Chancellor, as the Mouth of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Board, ſpoke to him as followeth.</p>
                  <p>I wot well (my Lord) that I am not the meeteſt at this
Board to charge you with theſe Treaſons, becauſe it hath pleaſed
ſome of your Pew-fellows to report, That I am a profeſſed enemy
to all Nobility, and namely to the <hi>Giraldines;</hi> but ſeeing every
ſhrewd Boy can ſay as much when he is controlled, and theſe
Points ſo weighty, that they ſhould not be diſſembled of us, and
ſo apparent, that they cannot be denied of you; I muſt have
Leave (notwithſtanding your ſtale Slander) to be the Mouth of
theſe Hononrable Lords, at this preſent, and to trump your
Treaſons in your way, howſoever you take me. Firſt, You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how the lewd Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> your Kinſman, (who
paſſeth not whom he ſerveth, might he change his Maſter) ſent
his Confederate with Letters of Credence unto <hi>Francis,</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> King; and having but cold Comfort there, went to
<hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, proffering the Help of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi>
towards the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if either of them
would help to win it from our King: How many Letters, what
Precepts, what Meſſages, what Threats have been ſent you to
apprehend him, and yet not done? Why ſo? forſooth I could not
catch him: Nay, nay, Earl, forſooth you would not watch
him. If he be juſtly ſuſpected, why are you partial in ſo great
a Charge? if not, why are you fearful to have him tried? Yea,
for it will be ſworn and depoſed to your Face, that for fear of
meeting him, you have winked wilfully, ſhunned his Sight, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
your Courſe, warned your Friends, ſtopped both Ears and
Eyes againſt his Detectors; and whenſoever you take upon you to
hunt him out, then was he ſure aforehand to be out of your Walk.
Surely this jugling and falſe Play little became either an honeſt
Man, called to ſuch Honour, or a Nobleman put in ſo great
Truſt: Had you loſt but a Cow or a Horſe of your own, two
hundred of your Retainers would have come at a Whiſtle, to
reſcue the Prey from the uttermoſt edge of <hi>Ulſter:</hi> All the Iriſh
in <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt have given you the way. But in purſuing ſo
needful a Matter, as this was, merciful God, How Nice, how
Dangerous, how wayward have you been? one while he is from
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65997:141"/>
Home, and another while he keepeth Home, and ſometimes fled,
ſometimes in the Borders, where you dare not venture. I wiſs,
my Lord, there be ſhrewd Buggs in the Border, for the Earl of
<hi>Kildare</hi> to fear; the Earl, nay the King of <hi>Kildare:</hi> For
when you are diſpoſed, you Reign more like than Rule, in the
Land. Where you are pleaſed the Iriſh Foe ſtandeth for a juſt
Subject; Hearts and Hands, Lives and Lands are all at your
Courteſie; who fawneth not thereon, cannot reſt within your
Smell; and you ſmell ſo rank, that you track them out at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Cardinal was ſpeaking, the Earl chafed and
changed Colour; and at laſt brake out, and interrupted
him thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My Lord Chancellor, I beſeech you pardon me, I am
ſhort-witted, and you, I perceive, intend a long Tale; if
you proceed in this order, half my purgation will be loſt
for lack of Carriage. I have no School-tricks, nor Art of
Memory; except you hear me, while I remember your
Words, your ſecond Proceſs will hammer out the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords aſſociate, who for the moſt part loved <hi>Kildare,</hi>
and knew the Cardinal's manner of Taunts ſo ready, being
inured therewith many years together, humbly beſought his
Grace to charge him with Particulars, and to dwell in ſome
one Matter, until it were examined throughly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That granted, it is good reaſon (quoth the Earl) that
your Grace bear the Mouth of this Board: But (my Lord)
thoſe Mouths that put theſe things into your Mouth, are
very wide Mouths, ſuch as have gaped long for my wreck;
and now at length for want of better Stuff, are fain to fill
their Mouths with Smoak. What my Cozen <hi>Deſmond</hi>

Heart for holding out ſo long. If he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

proof by the thing it ſelf within theſe few days. But go too;
ſuppoſe he never be had; What is <hi>Kildare</hi> to blame for it,
more than my good Brother of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> who, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his high Promiſes, having alſo the Kings Power, is yet
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65997:142"/>
content to bring him in at leiſure? Cannot the Earl of
<hi>Deſmond</hi> ſhift, but I muſt be of Council? Cannot he hide
him, except I wink? If he be cloſe, am I his Mate? If
he be befriended, am I a Traytor? This is a doughty kind
of Accuſation, which they urge againſt me, wherein they
are gravell'd and mir'd at my firſt denial. You would not
ſee him (ſay they:) Who made them ſo familiar with
mine Eye-ſight? Or, when was the Earl within my view?
Or, who ſtood by when I let him ſlip? Or, where are the
Tokens of my wilful Hoodwink? But you ſent him word
to beware of you: Who was the Meſſenger? Where are
the Letters? Convince my Negatives; ſee how looſe this
idle Gear hangeth together. <hi>Deſmond</hi> is not taken; well,
you are in fault: Why? Becauſe you are: Who proveth
it? No body: What Conjectures? So it ſeemeth: To
whom? To your Enemies. Who told it them? They will
ſwear it. What other Ground? None. Will they ſwear it,
my Lord? Why then of like they know it; either they
have my hand to ſhew, or can bring forth the Meſſenger,
or were preſent at a Conference, or privy to <hi>Deſmond,</hi> or
ſome body bewrayed it to them, or they themſelves were
my Carriers or Vicegerents therein: Which of theſe Parts
will they chuſe? For I know them too well; To reckon my
ſelf convict by their bare Words, or heedleſs Sayings, or
frantick Oaths, were but meer Mockery. My Letters were
ſoon read, were any ſuch Writing extant; my Servants
and Friends are ready to be ſifted: Of my Cozen <hi>Deſmond,</hi>
they may lie loudly, ſince no man here can well contrary
them. Touching my ſelf, I never noted in them ſo much
Wit, or ſo faſt Faith, that I would have gaged on their
ſilence the Life of a good Hound, much leſs mine own. I
doubt not, may it pleaſe your Honours, to oppoſe them,
how they came to the knowledge of theſe Matters, which
they are ſo ready to depoſe; but you ſhall find their Tongues
chained to another mans Trencher, and as it were, Knights
of the Poſt, ſuborn'd to ſay, ſwear and ſtare, the utmoſt
they can, as thoſe that paſs not what they ſay, nor with
what face they ſay it, ſo they ſay no truth: But on the
other ſide, it grieveth me, That your good Grace, whom
I take to be wiſe and ſharp, and who, of your bleſſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
wiſheth me well, ſhould be ſo far gone in credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe corrupt Informers, that abuſe the ignorance of
your State and Countrey, to my peril. Little know you,
(my Lord) how neceſſary it is, not only for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
but alſo for every Nobleman in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to hamper the
uncivil Neighbors at diſcretion, wherein, if they waited
for Proceſs of Law, and had not thoſe Lives and Lands you
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65997:142"/>
ſpeak of, within their reach, they might hap to loſe their
own Lives and Lands without Law. You hear of a Caſe, as
it were, in a Dream, and feel not the ſmart that vexeth us.
In <hi>England</hi> there is not a mean Subject that dare extend his
hand to fillip a Peer of the Realm: In <hi>Ireland,</hi> except the
Lord have Cunning to his Strength, and Strength to ſave
his Crown, and ſufficient Authority to take Thieves and
Varlets when they ſtir, he ſhall find them ſwarm ſo faſt,
that it will be too late to call for Juſtice. If you will have
our Service take effect, you muſt not tie us always to thoſe
judicial Proceedings, wherewith your Realm (thanked be
God) is inured. Touching my Kingdom, I know not what
your Lordſhip ſhould mean thereby: If your Grace ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that a Kingdom conſiſteth in ſerving God, in obeying
the Prince, in governing with Love the Commonwealth,
in ſupporting Subjects, in ſuppreſſing Rebels, in executing
Juſtice, in bridling blind Affections, I would be willing to
be inveſted with ſo Vertuous and Royal a Name; but if
therefore you term me a King, in that you are perſwaded
that I repine at the Government of my Sovereign, or
wink at Malefactors, or oppreſs civil Livers, I utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
that odious Term, marvelling greatly, that one of
your Graces profound Wiſdom, would ſeem to appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
ſo ſacred a Name to ſo wicked a thing: But howſoever
it be (my Lord) I would you and I had changed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
but for one Month, I would truſt to gather up more
Crumbs in that ſpace, than twice the Revenues of my poor
Earldom; But you are well and warm, and ſo hold you,
and upbraid not me with ſuch an odious Term. I ſlumber
in a hard Cabin, when you ſleep in a ſoft Bed of Down;
I ſerve under the King's Cope of Heaven, when you are
ſerved under a Canopy; I drink Water out of my Skull,
when you drink Wine out of Golden Cups; my Courſer
is train'd to the Field, when your Jennet is taught to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
when you are Graced, and Belorded, and Crouched,
and Kneeled unto, then find I ſmall Grace with our Iriſh
Borderers,</q> except I cut them off by the Knees.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Cardinal finding that <hi>Kildare</hi> was no Fool,
adjourned the Cauſe till farther Proof could be produced;
however, being fretted at this Speech, he remanded the Earl
to the Tower, contrary to the Opinion of moſt of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;<note place="margin">Speed, 775.</note>
it ſeems he was afterwards Bayl'd on the Recognizance

a Mandate was ſent by the Cardinal to execute <hi>Kildare</hi> the

Earl ſwore by S. <hi>Bride,</hi> That there was ſome mad Game in
that Scroll; but fall how it will, this Throw is for a huddle,
ſays he:<note place="margin">Speed, 775.</note> And being told of the Contents of the Letter, he
deſired the Lieutenant to know the King's Pleaſure therein;
which he did, and the King was ſurpriz'd at the thing; for
he knew nothing of it: and to controll the Sawcineſs of the
Prieſt (as he phraſed it) gave the Lieutenant his Signet
for a Countermand; whereat the Cardinal ſtormed: But it
ſeems to me that this Story is a meer Fiction, becauſe I find
not one Word of <hi>Kildare</hi>'s Trial; and it is not credible that
they would execute a Man of his Quality, before he was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally

                  <p>When the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> went to <hi>England,</hi> he ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                     <note place="margin">1527.</note> Lord Baron of <hi>Delvin,</hi> Lord Deputy,
who could the eaſier keep the Kingdom quiet, becauſe the
great Enemies and Competitors, the Earls of <hi>Kildare</hi> and
<hi>Ormond,</hi> were both in <hi>England;</hi> and about this time it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that the Title of <hi>Ormond</hi> was taken from Sir <hi>Pierce

Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi>

                  <p>About the ſame time, Sir <hi>Thomas Bullen</hi> (who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
one of the Daughters and Co-heirs of <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of

for both Titles, yet there are ſeveral Clauſes of Inveſtiture,

                  <p>It has been already obſerved, That many Iriſh Potentates
had received Penſions for many years, on the account of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65997:143"/>
giving Protection to the King's Subjects, or at leaſt, of ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them from Plunder; and although this ſcandalous and
diſhonourable Tribute was duly paid, yet the Iriſh did not
perform their Engagements, but made frequent Sallies and
Incurſions as they had opportunity, and particularly this
very Spring, <hi>O Connor</hi> made an irruption into the Pale,<note place="margin">1528.</note> and
carryed away much Prey and Plunder into <hi>Offaly;</hi> it ſeems the
L. Deputy was too weak to revenge this Outrage by force,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ware</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, 121.</note> all
that he could do, was to withold <hi>O Connor</hi>'s Penſion; which
he did: Hereupon the Rebel complained, as if he had received
the greateſt Injury, and deſired to have a Parly with the Lord
Deputy about it on the 12th of <hi>May;</hi> the Lord Deputy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and came at the time appointed, not doubting but
that he ſhould convince all the World, and even <hi>O Connor</hi>
himſelf, of the unreaſonableneſs of his Demand; but alas,
he was miſtaken; <hi>O Connor</hi> did not intend to argue the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fairly, but was reſolved to help himſelf by a <hi>Stratagem,</hi>
(as they call it) for he perfidiouſly ſet upon the Deputy, and
took him Priſoner, and killed and wounded many of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants:
And thereupon the Council choſe</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pierce</hi> Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> Lord Deputy; who being returned
from <hi>England,</hi> came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> accompanied with <hi>O More,
O Carol,</hi> and one of the <hi>O Connors,</hi> and a numerous Train:
The firſt thing he did, was to ſend a Meſſage to <hi>O Connor</hi> to
enlarge the Lord <hi>Delvin;</hi> but he received a flat Denial, and
therefore the Lord Deputy and Council did by Act of State
ſuſpend the aforeſaid Penſion, and not long after, all thoſe
Penſions, and the like Iriſh Exactions were ſuppreſſed, and
for ever extinguiſhed by Act of Parliament.<note place="margin">Ware, 122.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sweating Sickneſs (called <hi>Sudor Anglicus</hi>) was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

<hi>Alan,</hi> a Creature of <hi>Wolſy</hi>'s, raiſed by him to this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
purpoſely to oppreſs the Earl of <hi>Kildare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That unfortunate Earl, continuing his Enmity againſt
the Earl of <hi>Oſsory,</hi> ſent his Daughter (the Lady <hi>Slane</hi>)
from <hi>Newington</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to excite his Brothers and
Friends <hi>O Neal</hi> and <hi>O Connor,</hi> and whomſoever elſe ſhe
could, to oppoſe the Lord Deputy; and ſhe was unhappy in
being ſucceſsful in her Negotiation; for ſhe procured much
Miſchief to the Lord Deputy, and great Devaſtations on
his Lands, which afterward occaſion'd great Trouble and
Danger to her Father, as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>The Famous Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, ſent his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor

But this Embaſſie was ineffectual, becauſe that Earl died at
<hi>Dingle</hi> the eighteenth of <hi>June,</hi> 1529. He left one only
Daughter, who was afterwards married to <hi>James</hi> (the ſixth
of that Name) Earl of <hi>Ormond;</hi> ſo that he was ſucceeded
in the Earldom of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> by his Unkle and Enemy <hi>Thomas
Moyle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now was the King's Divorce publickly ventilated in
<hi>England,</hi> and the Pope revoked his Legates, and reſumed
the Cauſe to himſelf, which enraged the King, and was the
Ruine of Cardinal <hi>Wolſy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time the King made his Natural Son, <hi>Henry

of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ſent over</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Willian Skeffington,</hi> Lord Deputy; he arrived in <hi>Auguſt</hi>
with Mony, and with two hundred Horſe, accompanied by
the Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> freed from all his Troubles, and were
received by the Citizens of <hi>Dublin</hi> with great Joy: His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
were,

                        <item>I. To preſerve the Peace between the Earls of <hi>Kildare,

                  <p>About the ſame time <hi>Edmond Butler,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Caſhel,</hi>

of which Conſtitution or Canon the inferior
Clergy grievouſly complained; alledging, That it was a Breach

                  <p>But let us return to the Lord Deputy, who invaded the
Territory of <hi>Leix,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1530.</note> to ſuppreſs the Inſolencies of <hi>O More</hi> and
<hi>O Connor,</hi> and their Confederates; he deſtroyed <hi>O More</hi> by
ſlight but frequent Skirmiſhes: And ſo having preyed the
Country, he returned with theſe happy Firſt-Fruits of his

                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:65997:144"/>
In the mean time the great Minſter of State, Cardinal <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi>
came to Diſgrace in <hi>England,</hi> and died the laſt Day of
<hi>November:</hi> And about the ſame time great Jealouſies and
Miſunderſtandings began to ariſe, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> between the
Lord Deputy and the Earl of <hi>Kildare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, The Lord Deputy took that Earl to his
Aſſiſtance, in his Expedition into <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and there they took
the Caſtle of <hi>Kinard,</hi> and returned loaden with Prey and
Plunder, according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Times. And
with this Atchievment <hi>Hugh O Donel</hi> was frighted into a

and ſwore Fealty to the King, in preſence of the
Lord Deputy,<note place="margin">Davis, 105.</note> at <hi>Tredagh,</hi> on the ſixth of <hi>May,</hi> 1531. And
at the ſame time, it is probable, he made the Propoſal, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Sir <hi>John Davis, Quod ſi Dominus Rex velit reformare
Hiberniam,</hi> He and His would gladly be governed by the
Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Sullevan</hi> tells us a Story,<note place="margin">Sullevan, 77.</note> with great Oſtentation, That an
Engliſh Ship took a Spaniſh Veſſel that was fiſhing on the
Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> near the <hi>Durſies:</hi> And that his Grand-Father,
<hi>Dermond O Sullevan,</hi> Prince of <hi>Bear</hi> and <hi>Bantry,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
notice of it, manned out a ſmall Squadron of Ships, and
took both the Engliſhman and the Spaniard, and hanged
the Engliſh Captain, but ſet the Spaniard at Liberty: By
which may be eaſily perceived, What ſort of Inclinations
that ſort of Men bear to an Engliſhman, and what kind of
Loyalty they paid to their King, when they murdered his
Subjects and cheriſhed his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>But the Animoſities and Feuds between the Lord Deputy
and the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> did every Day increaſe, and at length
came to that height, that they reciprocally impeached each
other in <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Kildare</hi> did wiſely to ſail thither, and
perſonally ſolicite his own Affairs, which he managed ſo
ſucceſsfully, that <hi>Skeffington</hi> was ſuperſeded, and</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Girald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> made Lord Deputy in his ſtead:
He alſo procured <hi>Alan,</hi> the Lord Chancellor (a Creature of
<hi>Wolſies</hi>) to be removed, and <hi>Cromer,</hi> Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi>
to be placed in the Chancery,<note place="margin">July 5. 1532.</note> in his room. Nevertheleſs,
leſt <hi>Kildare</hi> ſhould grow too powerful, the King, to ballance
him, gave the Lord High Treaſurers Staff to <hi>James</hi> Lord
<hi>Butler;</hi> who, notwithſtanding that he was <hi>Kildare</hi>'s Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
was nevertheleſs his bitter Enemy, and heartily
eſpouſed the Quarrels of his Father, the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> as it
was his Intereſt and Duty to do.</p>

                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:65997:145"/>
But the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> having again gotten the Supreme
Power into his Hands, little valued the Oppoſition of his
Enemies. On the contrary, he was tranſported with the
Contemplation of the prodigious Succeſs he had hitherto met
with, and preſumed ſo far on its continuance, that he preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated
himſelf into many vain and unaccountable Actions;
for he not only married two of his Daughters, to <hi>O Connor</hi>
and <hi>O Carol</hi> (obſtinate Enemies to the Crown of <hi>England),</hi>
but alſo with his Forces invaded <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and deſtroyed all
he found belonging to the Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi> and his Friends; he
alſo perſuaded his Brother, <hi>John Fitz-Girald</hi> and <hi>O Neal,</hi> to
invade the County of <hi>Louth;</hi> which they burned and preyed,
without Reſiſtance: And all theſe Extravagances contributed
to the Deſtruction of a Noble Family, and to leave this Earl
of <hi>Kildare</hi> an Example to Poſterity, of the great folly of uſing
Power immoderately.</p>

which the Lord Deputy, in favour of his Son-in-Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to beſiege, and did ſo, but it was in vain, for at that
Siege he received a Shot in his Head, which ſent him back
faſter than he came out; and though he regained his Health,
yet he never recovered his Intellectuals, but was ever after (as
we ſay) A little crackbrained.</p>
                  <p>It is reported, That when he was wounded he ſighed deeply;
which a Soldier (that was by) obſerving, he told his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<hi>That himſelf had been ſhot three times, and yet was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:</hi>
To whom the Earl replyed, <hi>Would to God thou hadſt

About this time <hi>John Allen,</hi> who had been Clerk of the
Council, and was now Maſter of the Rolls, (a Creature of
the depoſed Chancellor <hi>Alans</hi>) was ſent by the Council into
<hi>England</hi> about Publick Affairs:<note place="margin">Lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> His Inſtructions were, To
acquaint the King with the Decay of the Land; and that
neither Engliſh Order, Tongue or Habit, nor the King's
Laws are uſed above twenty Miles in compaſs: That this
Decay is occaſioned by the taking of Coyn and Livery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Order, after Men's own ſenſual Appetites; and taking
Cuddees, Garty and Caan for Felonies, and Murder, Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
Bienges, Saults and Slanciaghs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that they
want Engliſh Inhabitants, who formerly had Arms and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to defend the Country; but of late, <hi>the Engliſh Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor
hath taken Iriſh Tenants,</hi> that can live without Bread or
good Victuals; and ſome for Lucre, to have more Rent;
and ſome for Impoſitions and Vaſſalage, which the Engliſh
cannot bear, have expelled the Engliſh, and made the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
all Iriſh, without Order, Security or Hoſpitality. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
Engliſh Gentlemen kept a Retinue of Engliſh Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
according to the Cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi> to the great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Country, but now they keep Horſmen and
Kernes, who live by oppreſſing the poor People. The great
Juriſdiction of the Nobility is another Cauſe of deſtroying
the King's Subjects and Revenue: And the Black Rents,
which the Iriſh exact, enriches them, and impoveriſheth
the Engliſhman. Alſo the making of a Native chief Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and often change of the Lord Deputy are great Faults:
And ill keeping of the King's Records, and putting unskilful
Clerks in the Exchequer, do occaſion much Miſchief: But
the Alienation of the Crown Lands, ſo that the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
is not ſufficient to defend the Realm, is the greateſt
Grievance of all.</p>
                  <p>It is probable that theſe Inſtructions were kept ſecret from
the Lord Deputy; for it cannot be imagined, That he would
have conſented, that Articles, which in effect were an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of himſelf, ſhould be communicated to the King;
and in truth <hi>Allen</hi>'s Errand was to accuſe the Deputy, and
he was imployed ſo to do by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the
Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ware, 131.</note> Sir <hi>William Skeffington</hi> and others; and he
performed his Commiſſion ſo effectually, that the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
was ſent for (by the King's Letter) to repair to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and anſwer the Crimes that were objected againſt
him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kildare</hi> did all he could to evade, or at leaſt procraſtinate
that Voyage which was to be fatal to him and his Family;
he ſent his Wife to uſe the Intereſt of her Friends, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and to alledg ſeveral vain Pretences; and particularly,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65997:146"/>
That the ill Poſture of Affairs, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> could not permit
his Abſence: But all theſe Contrivances proving ineffectual,
at laſt he ſeriouſly prepared to begin the Voyage.</p>
                  <p>But before he went, he furniſhed all his Caſtles, eſpecially
<hi>Minooth</hi> and <hi>Ley,</hi> with Guns and Ammunition out of the
King's Store, although he had the King's expreſs Command
to the contrary, imparted to him by the Maſter of the Rolls
(<hi>Allen</hi>) in the preſence of the Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> and others;
and the Act of Attainder alſo mentions, That he furniſhed
the Wild Iriſhmen, being the King's Mortal Enemies, with
Arms and Ammunition out of his Majeſty's Stores; which is
not improbable, becauſe of his Allyance with <hi>O Connor</hi> and
<hi>O Carol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certain, That, <hi>Quos Deus vult perdere dementat;</hi> and
the brave Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> is a plain Example of it, for being
ordered by the King to leave a Deputy, for whoſe Fidelity he
would anſwer, he ſubſtitutes his own Son, <hi>Thomas Fitz-Girald,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1534.</note>
a forward raſh Youth, ſcarce one and twenty Years
old; who nevertheleſs had Qualities worthy of his Houſe,
and perhaps would, in time, have exceeded all his Anceſtors,
if by laying this too great Burthen on his weak Shoulders,
ſo early, they had not broken his Back in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems the Earl had ſome Jealouſies of what afterwards
hapned, and therefore to qualifie his Son's youthful Paſſions,
in ſome meaſure, before he delivered him the Sword, he
ſpoke to him as followeth, before the Council, at <hi>Drogheda,</hi>
where he preſently after imbarqued, and ſet ſail for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Son <hi>Thomas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Holingſh. 88.</note> I doubt not, but you know, That my Sovereign
Lord the King hath ſent for me into <hi>England,</hi> and what ſhall
betide me God knoweth, for I know not; but howſoever it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
both you and I know, That I am well ſtept in Years: And
as I may ſhortly dye, for that I am Mortal, ſo I muſt in haſte
deceaſe becauſe I am old: Wherefore, inſomuch as my Winter is
well near ended, and the Spring of your Age now buddeth, my
Will is, That you behave your ſelf ſo wiſely in theſe your Green
Years, as that to the Comfort of your Friends, you may enjoy the
Pleaſures of Summer, glean and reap the Fruits of your Harveſt,
that with Honour you may grow to the catching of that hoary
Winter, on which you ſee me your Father faſt pricking. And
whereas it pleaſeth the King his Majeſty, That upon my Departure
here hence, I ſhould ſubſtitute in my room ſuch a one for whoſe
Government I would anſwer: Albeit I know that your Years are
tender, your Wit not ſetled, your Judgment not fully rectified;
and therefore I might be with good cauſe reclaimed from putting
a naked Sword in a young Mans Hand: Yet notwithſtanding,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65997:146"/>
forſomuch as I am your Father, and you my Son, I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
to bear that Stroke with you, in ſteering your Ship as that
upon any Information, I may command you as your Father, and
correct you as my Son, for the wrong handling of your Helm.</p>
                  <p>There be here that ſit at this Board, far more ſufficient Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages,
for ſo great Charge than you are; But what then? If I
ſhould caſt this Burthen on their Shoulders, it might be, That
hereafter they would be ſo far with Envy carried, as they
would percaſe hazzard the loſs of one of their own Eyes,
to be aſſured that I ſhould be deprived of both mine: But
forſomuch as the caſe toucheth your Skin as near as mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(as I ſaid before) I reſt in the Winter, and you in the
Spring of your Years, and now I am reſolved Day by Day to learn
rather, How to die in the Fear of God, than to live in the Pomp
of the World. I think you will not be ſo brain-ſick, as to ſtab
your ſelf through the Body, only to ſcarifie my Skin with the
Point of your Blade; wherefore, my Son, conſider, That it is
eaſie to raze and hard to build; and in all your Affairs be ruled
by this Board, that for Wiſdom is able, and for entire Affection
it beareth to your Houſe, will be found willing, to leſſon you with
Sound and Sage Advice; for albeit in authority you rule them,
yet in Council they muſt rule you. My Son, you know that my
late Maims ſtifle my talk, otherwiſe I would have grated lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
on this Matter, for a good Tale may be twice told, and a
ſound Advice, eftſoons iterated, taketh the deeper Impreſſion in
the attentive Hearer's Mind. But although my fatherly Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
requireth my Diſcourſe to be longer, yet I truſt your good
Inclination asketh it to be ſhorter: And upon that Aſſurance, here in
the preſence of this Honourable Aſſembly, I deliver you this Sword.</p>
                  <p>Thus he ſpake for his laſt Fare-well, with trickling Tears;
and having ended, he roſe up, imbraced the Council, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them to God, and immediately after imbarked,
leaving</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Fitz-Girald</hi> Lord Deputy;<note place="margin">1534.</note> to whom both the
<hi>Allens</hi> were bitter Enemies: One of them being Maſter of
the Rolls, told the Lord Deputy, at a Banquet where they
were, diſcourſing of Heraldry, That his Lordſhips Houſe
gave a Marmoſet, whoſe Property it was to eat her Tail: To
whom the Deputy replyed, That he had been fed by his Tail,
and ſhould take care, that his Tail did not eat him. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time the Council waited three or four Hours for the
Lord Deputy's coming; whereat the Archbiſhop being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied,
he asked the Lords, Whether it were not a pretty
Matter, that all they ſhould ſtay ſo long for a Boy? Which
Words the Lord Deputy over-heard, being juſt coming up
Stairs; and as ſoon as he entred, he told their Lordſhips, He
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65997:147"/>
was ſorry they ſhould ſtay ſo long for a Boy; whereat the
Archbiſhop was ſomewhat out of countenance.</p>
                  <p>The Enemies of the <hi>Giraldines</hi> had ſpread abroad a Report,
that the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> was Beheaded in the Tower, and
that the ſame Fate was deſigned for the Lord Deputy and all
his Unkles, and Letters were purpoſely ſpread abroad to
that effect; one of which, by a ſtrange Accident came to
the hands of <hi>James de la Hide,</hi> Principal Counſellor to the
Lord Deputy; by whoſe perſwaſion the Lord Deputy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
with <hi>O Neal, O Connor,</hi> and others, and on the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day of <hi>June</hi> rode through the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>Damſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
accompanied with ſeven ſcore Horſemen in their Shirts
of Mayl, and there croſſed the River, and went to S. <hi>Mary</hi>
Abby, where the Council, according to Appointment, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his coming; and whilſt he was ſitting in Council, ſome
of his Followers rudely ruſh'd into the Council-Chamber,
Armed as they were, and fell to talking aloud; until at length,
Silence being commanded, the Lord Deputy ſpake as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth;</p>
                  <p>Howſoever injuriouſly we be handled,<note place="margin">Holingſhead, 90.</note> and forced to defend our
ſelves in Arms, when neither our Service, nor our good Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards our Prince's Crown, availeth; yet ſay not hereafter,
but in this open Hoſtility which here we profeſs and proclaim, we
have ſhewed our ſelves no Villains nor Churls, but Warriors and
Gentlemen. This Sword of Eſtate is yours, and not mine; I
received it with an Oath, and uſed it to your Benefit; I ſhould
ſtain mine Honour if I turned the ſame to your Annoyance: Now
have I need of mine own Sword, which I dare truſt. As for the
common Sword, it flattereth me with a painted Scabbard, but
hath indeed a peſtilent Edge already bathed in the <hi>Giraldines</hi>
Blood, and now is newly whetted in hope of a farther deſtruction.
Therefore ſave your ſelves from us, as from open Enemies; I
am none of <hi>Henry</hi>'s Deputies, I am his Foe: I have more mind
to Conquer than to Govern, to meet him in the Field, than to
ſerve him in Office: If all the Hearts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
that have Cauſe thereto, would joyn in this Quarrel (as I hope
they will) then ſhould he ſoon be made ſenſible (as I truſt he
ſhall) of his Tyranny and Cruelty, for which, the Age to come
may lawfully ſcore him up among the Ancient Tyrants, of moſt
abominable and hateful Memory.</p>
                  <p>Having added to this ſhameful Oration,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> many other ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
and foul Terms, which, for divers reſpects I ſpare to
mention, he would have ſurrendred the Sword to the Lord
Chancellor; who, being provided for the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> his
coming, and alſo being loth that his Slackneſs ſhould ſeem
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65997:147"/>
diſloyal in refuſing the Sword, or his Frowardneſs over-cruel
in ſnatching it upon the firſt Proffer, took the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi>
by the Wriſt of the Hand, and requeſted him for the Love
of God (the Tears trickling down his Cheeks) to give him
Audience for two or three Words; which granted, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Father ſpake as enſueth;</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My Lord, although Hatred be commonly the Handmaiden
of Truth, becauſe we ſee him that plainly expreſſeth his
Mind, to be for the more part of moſt men diſliked; yet
notwithſtanding I am ſo well aſſured of your Lordſhip's
good inclination towards me, and your Lordſhip ſo certain
of my entire Affection towards you, as I am emboldned
(notwithſtanding this Company of Armed Men) freely
and frankly to utter that, which by me declared, and by
your Lordſhip followed, will turn (God willing) to the
Avail of you, your Friends, Allies, and this Country. I
doubt not (my Lord) but you know that it is Wiſdom
for any man to look before he leap, and to ſound the Water
before his Ship hull thereon; and namely where the Matter
is of weight, there it behoveth to follow ſound, ſage and
mature Advice: Wherefore (my Lord) ſith it is no
May-game for a Subject to levy an Army againſt his Prince,
it lieth your Lordſhip in hand to breath longer on the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as well by forecaſting the hurt, whereby you may fall,
as by revolving the hope by which you are fed. What
ſhould move your Lordſhip to this ſudden Attempt, I know
not: If it be the Death of your Father, it is as yet but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
mutter'd, not manifeſtly publiſh'd; and if I ſhould
grant you, that your Zeal in revenging your Father's Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were in ſome reſpect to be recommended; yet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
would you ſhould ſuſpend the Revenge until the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
were known. And were it that the Report were
true, yet it ſtandeth with the Duty and Allegiance of a
good Subject (from whom, I hope in God, you mean not
to diſſever your ſelf) not to ſpurn and kick againſt his
Prince; but contrariwiſe, if his Sovereign be mighty, to
fear him; if he be profitable to his Subjects, to honour
him; if he command, to obey him; if he be kind, to love
him, if he be vicious, to pity him; if he be a Tyrant, to
bear with him; conſidering, that in ſuch caſe it is better
with patience to bow, than with ſtubbornneſs to break:
For ſacred is the Name of a King, and odious is the Name
of a Rebellion; the one from Heaven derived, and by God
ſhielded; the other in Hell forged, and by the Devil exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted:
And therefore whoſo will obſerve Hiſtories, or
weigh the Juſtice of God, in puniſhing Malefactors, ſhall
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65997:148"/>
eaſily ſee, that albeit the Sun ſhineth for a time on them
that are in Rebellion, yet ſuch ſweet beginnings are at length
claſped up with ſharp and ſour Ends. Now that it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
you ought not to bear Armour againſt your King, it
reſteth to diſcuſs whether you be able (though you were
willing) to annoy your King: For, if among mean and
private Foes, it be reckoned for Folly, in a ſecret Grudge,
to profeſs open Hatred, and where he is not able to hinder,
there to ſhew a willing mind to hurt; much more ought
your Lordſhip in ſo general a Quarrel as this, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
the King, that toucheth the Nobility, that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
to the whole Commonwealth, to foreſee the King's
Power on the one ſide, and your Force on the other; and
then to judge if you be able to cock with him, and to put
him beſide the Cuſhion; and not whilſt you ſtrive to ſit in
the Saddle, to loſe (to your own undoing) both the Horſe
and the Saddle.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>King <hi>Henry</hi> is known to be in theſe our days, ſo puiſſant
a Prince, and ſo victorious a Worthy, that he is able to
conquer Foreign Dominions, and think you that he cannot
defend his own? He tameth Kings, and judge you that
he may not rule his own Subjects? Suppoſe you conquer
the Land, do you imagine that he will not recover it?
Therefore (my Lord) flatter not your ſelf overmuch, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
not ſo great Affiance either in your Troop of Horſemen,
or in your Band of Footmen, or in your multitude of your
Partakers, what Face ſoever they put now on the Matter, or
what Succeſs ſoever for a ſeaſon they have; becauſe it is eaſie
for an Army to vanquiſh them that do not reſiſt; yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
when the King ſhall ſend his Power into this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
you ſhall ſee your Adherents, like ſlippery Changlings,
pluck in their Horns, and ſuch as were content to bear you
up by the Chin as long as you could ſwim, when they eſpy
you ſinking, they will by little and little ſhrink from you,
and percaſe will duck you over head and ears. As long as
the Gale puffeth full in your Sails, doubt not but divers
will cleave unto you, and feed on you as Crows on Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion;
but if any Storm happen to bluſter, then will they
be ſure to leave you poſt alone ſticking in the Mire or Sands,
having leaſt help when you have moſt need. And what
will then enſue of this? The Branches will be pardoned,
the Root apprehended, your Honour diſtained, your Houſe
attainted, your Arms reverſed, your Mannors razed, your
Doings examined; at which time, God knoweth what an
Heart-burning it will be, when that with no colour may be
denied, which without ſhame cannot be confeſſed. My
Lord, I pour not out Oracles as a Soothſayer; for I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65997:148"/>
a Prophet nor Son of a Prophet: But it may be that I
am ſome frantick <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> being Partner of her Spirit in

whom God defend from being <hi>Priamus.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Weigh therefore (my Lord) the Nobility of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors;
remember your Father's late Exhortation; forget
not your Duty to your Prince; conſider the Eſtate of this
poor Country; with what heaps of Curſes you ſhall be loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
when your Souldiers ſhall rifle the poor Subjects, and
ſo far endamage the whole Realm, as they are not yet born
that ſhall hereafter feel the ſmart of this Uproar. You
have not gone ſo far, but you may turn home; the King
is merciful, your Offence as yet not over-heinous; cleave
to his Clemency, abandon this headlong Folly; which I
crave in moſt humble wiſe of your Lordſhip, for the Love
of God, for the Duty you ow to your Prince, for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
you bear the Country, and for the reſpect you have
to your own Safety, whom God defend from all traiterous

his Horſemens Jacks were gorgeouſly embroidered with Silk;

Whereat the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> being quickned, did caſt his Eye

                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord Chancellor,</hi> I come not hither to take Advice what
I ſhould do, but to give you to underſtand what I mind to do. It
is eaſie for the ſound to counſel the ſick; but if the Sore had
ſmarted you as much as it feſtereth me, you would be percaſe as
impatient as I am. As you would wiſh me to honour my Prince,
ſo Duty willeth me to reverence my Father: Wherefore he that
will with ſuch Tyranny execute my innocent Parent, and withal
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65997:149"/>
threaten my deſtruction, I may not, nor will not hold him for
my King. And yet in truth he was never our King, but our
Lord, as his Progenitors have been before him. But if it be my

may; I will take the Market as it riſeth, and will chuſe rather
to die with Valiantneſs and Liberty, than to live under King
<hi>Henry</hi> in Bondage and Villany. And yet it may be, as ſtrong as
he is, and as weak as I am, I ſhall be able like a Fleſh-worm, to
itch the Body of his Kingdom, and force him to ſcratch deeply
before he be able to pick me out of my Seam: Wherefore, my

                  <p>Now was the Sword drawn, and the Scabbard flung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and no room left for an Accommodation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Fitz Girald</hi> did all he could to ſtrengthen his Party; and
thinking that if his Cozen, the Lord <hi>Butler,</hi> could be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to enter into the Confederacy, that all the Kingdom
would either ſide with them, or fall before them, he wrote
a preſſing Letter, ſtuffed with large Premiſes, to invite the
Lord <hi>Butler</hi> into the Aſſociation; to which, the Loyal <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
returned this unexpected Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Taking Pen in hand to write you my reſolute Anſwer,<note place="margin">Holingſh. 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the very firſt Line by what Name to call you, <hi>My Lord,</hi> or
<hi>My Cozen;</hi> ſeeing your notorious Treaſon hath diſtain'd your
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65997:149"/>
Honour, and your deſperate Lewdneſs ſhamed your Kindred, you
are ſo liberal in parting Stakes with me, that a man would ween
you had no Right to the Game, ſo importunate in craving my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
as if you would perſwade me to hang with you for good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip:
Do you think that <hi>James</hi> was ſo mad as to gape for
Gudgeons, or ſo ungracious, as to ſell his Truth for a piece of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
Were it ſo (as it cannot be) that the Chickens you
reckon, were both hatched and feathered; yet be thou ſure, I had
rather in this Quarrel die thine Enemy, than live thy Partner:
For the Kindneſs you proffer me, and good Love in the end of
your Letter, the beſt way I can propoſe to requite that, is in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing
you, though you have fetch'd your Feaze, yet to look
well ere you leap: Ignorance and Error, with a certain Opinion
of Duty, have carried you unawares to this Folly, not yet ſo
rank but it may be cured: The King is a Veſſel of Bounty and
Mercy; your Words againſt his Majeſty, ſhall not be counted
Malicious, but rather belched out for Heat and Impotence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
your ſelf, by heaping Offences, diſcover a miſchievous and
wilful meaning.</p>
                  <p>Netled with this round Anſwer, <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> deſigns to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the County of <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> but firſt he forces an Oath of
Fidelity on the Inhabitants of the Pale; and thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
he impriſoned as faſt as he caught them, and ſends
<hi>Charles Rynold,</hi> Arch Deacon of <hi>Kells,</hi> his Ambaſſador to
Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, and <hi>Dominick Poer</hi> to the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth; to whom he ſent twelve great Hawks, and
fourteen fair Hobbies; but theſe Ambaſſadors came too late,
and not till their Maſter was executed.</p>
                  <p>And ſo great was this Rebellion, and the King's Authority
ſo weak, that even the Territory of <hi>Fingal,</hi> which was wholly
a Stranger to Depredations, now lay expoſed to the <hi>Tools</hi> and
other Iriſh; wherein they were aſſiſted by <hi>John Burnel,</hi> a
Gentleman of good Eſtate in <hi>Fingal</hi> who favoured this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                  <p>But the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> could not ſuffer this without their
own Deſtruction; for <hi>Fingal</hi> was their Granary, and moſt
of their Proviſion came from thence; wherefore a Body of
the Citizens ſallied to intercept a Prey at the Bridge of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainham;</hi>
but in the Skirmiſh, near the Wood of <hi>Salcock,</hi>
(overpowered either in Number or Valour) they were
beaten, and fourſcore of the Citizens killed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> makes the beſt of this Victory, and whilſt
the Conſternation is on the City, he ſends them word, that
although he could deſtroy their City, yet he will do them no
harm, if they will permit him to beſiege the Caſtle. The
Citizens wiſely ſend one of their Aldermen (<hi>Francis Herbert</hi>)
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65997:150"/>
to the King, to know his Pleaſure; and another to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
of the Caſtle, to have his Advice. The Conſtable
made a virtue of Neceſſity, and not thinking it poſſible to
defend the City, conſented to the Demand, provided he were
firſt furniſhed with Men and Victuals, which was done, and
Alderman <hi>John Fitz Symons</hi> ſent into the Caſtle twenty Tun
of Wine, twenty four Tun of Beer, two thouſand dry
Ling, ſixteen Hogſheads of Beef, twenty Chambers, and
an Iron Chain for the Draw-Bridg.</p>
                  <p>But the unfortunate Archbiſhop afraid of the Succeſs of
this Siege, got on board a Ship that Night, near <hi>Dames gate,</hi>
in order to paſs for <hi>England;</hi> but the Veſſel was ſtranded at
<hi>Clantarfe,</hi> and the Archbiſhop was forced to a Village hard
by, called <hi>Tartain,</hi> thither came <hi>Thomas Fitz-Girald,</hi> and
his Unkles <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Oliver,</hi> Sir <hi>James Delahide</hi> and many
others, early the next Morning, having firſt had notice of
the Archbiſhops being there: The Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> commands
<hi>John Teling</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Wafer</hi> to bring out the Archbiſhop;
whom they haled out of his Bed, naked in his Shirt, as he
was, bare-footed and bare-headed. The poor Biſhop, on his
Knees, and with a pitiful Voice and Countenance, begged
Pity for the Love of God, on a Chriſtian and an Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
                  <p>The Noble <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> was too generous to behold that
Spectacle without Compaſſion, and therefore turned aſide,
ſaying, <hi>Ber owm a Buddagh,</hi> (which is, <hi>Take away the Clown</hi>)
intending to impriſon him; but the Servants wilfully miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruing
their Maſter's Words, knockt out the Biſhop's
Brains, and left a Revenge on themſelves, which overtook
them all, for <hi>Teling</hi> afterwards Died of the Leproſie, and
<hi>Wafer</hi> of the French Pox, and <hi>Fitz Girald</hi> and all his Unkles
were publickly executed by the Common Hangman.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it to be omitted, that all the Murderers were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated;
and in the Excommunication are theſe
ſtrange Paſſages, That no man may be merciful to them, but
their Memory to be forgotten: That God would rain Flames
of Fire and Sulphur on them: That they may cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the Malediction and high Curſe, as they daily
put on their Garments: That the Water of Vengeance may
be in their inner Parts, as Marrow in their Bones: Be they
girded with the Girdles of Malediction, and Partakers with
<hi>Pharoah, Nero, Herod</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> the Proditors of Jeſus
Chriſt, and with <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> deſcend into Hell quick:
Good Lord ſend them Hunger and Thirſt, and ſtrike them
with Peſtilence, that they may be conſumed, and their
Generation clear eradicate: Strike them with Leproſie, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Blindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we Interdict all the Places where
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65997:150"/>
they go, and the Place where the Archbiſhop was murdered.
But to proceed,</p>
                  <p>The Rebels took Priſoners from their own Houſes, the
Lord of <hi>Howth,</hi> and <hi>Luttrel,</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Common
Pleas; and the Caſtle being furniſhed, the Citizens of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
conſented to <hi>Fitz Girald</hi>'s former Demands, Of Liberty
to beſiege the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon he ſent <hi>James Field</hi> of <hi>Lusk, Teling, Wafer,
Broad, Rouks</hi> and <hi>Purcel,</hi> with one hundred Soldiers each,
attending on them as their Captains; they planted two or
three Falcons near <hi>Preſton</hi>'s <hi>Innes,</hi> over againſt the Caſtle,
and entrenched themſelves with ſtrong Ramparts, threatning
to place the Youth of the City thereon, if they in the Caſtle
ſhould ſhoot that way.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Fitz-Girald,</hi> accompanied with <hi>O Neal,</hi>
Sir <hi>Richard Walſh,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Loughſewdy, Burnel</hi> of <hi>Bally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griffin,</hi>
and ſeveral others, invaded and burnt the County of
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> even to <hi>Thomas Town:</hi> The Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi> and his
Party were at the ſame time near <hi>Jeripont,</hi> conſulting what
to do; and during their Conſultation, one of the <hi>Butlers</hi>
ſtole away with ſixteen Horſe to make a Bravado; <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi>
eſpying them, ſent an equal number, which were ſoon
followed with one hundred and forty Horſe; the <hi>Butlers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to their main Body, which was ſurprized by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Accident, and eaſily ſcattered: The Lord <hi>Butler</hi>
was hurt, but made ſhift to eſcape to <hi>Dunmore,</hi> where he
was cured.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Alderman <hi>Herbert</hi> returned with an
Anſwer from the King, encouraging the Citizens to a manly
Defence, and promiſing Aid immediately: Whereupon it
was reſolved by the Citizens, That Faith was not to be kept
with Traytors; That their League with <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> was
void: And they ordered their Gates to be ſhut; And that
the Traytors that beſieged the Caſtle ſhould be apprehended.</p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Field</hi> and his Companions having Notice hereof,
began to ſhift for themſelves, ſome ſwam over the River,
but the moſt of them were taken Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>Immediately <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> leaves <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and ſummons
the Pale to meet him, with all their Power, near <hi>Dublin</hi>—
And in his way he ſeized upon ſeveral <hi>Dublin</hi>-Children, that
were at School in the Country, and particularly <hi>Fitz-Simons</hi>
and <hi>Stainhurſt;</hi> and ſent Doctor <hi>Traverſe, Peter Linch</hi> of the
<hi>Knock,</hi> and <hi>Oliver Grace,</hi> to the Citizens, to expoſtulate the
Breach of the League, and to require, That it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
or at the leaſt the Priſoners enlarged; but they met
with a croſs Anſwer to all their Demands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:65997:151"/>
Whereupon <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> began in <hi>Sheep-ſtreet</hi> to beſiege
the Caſtle, but was driven thence by the Ordnance, and the
Houſes being thatcht were burnt by Wild-Fire, caſt in from
the Caſtle; he ſtopt all the Rivers about the Town, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to <hi>Thomas-Court,</hi> pulled down that Street, and made
a ſort of a Gallery to ſhelter his Men; he alſo burnt the
<hi>New Street,</hi> and planted a Gun againſt <hi>Newgate,</hi> which
pierced that Gate, and killed an Apprentice of Alderman
<hi>Stephens</hi>'s, fetching Water from the high Pipe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard Stanton,</hi> Goaler of <hi>Newgate,</hi> being an excellent
Markſman, did great Damage to the Enemy, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
perceiving one of the Rebels level his Gun at the
Loop-Hole where he ſtood, he was ſo nimble, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him, and ſhot the Rebel in the Forehad, and was ſo
hardy, as to iſſue out at the Wicket and to ſtrip the Varlet,
and brought in with him his Gun and his Cloaths. This
enraged the Rebels and excited them to Revenge; wherefore
they immediately brought Fire and Faggot to the Gate, in
hopes to burn it.</p>
                  <p>The Citizens wiſely conſidered, That Expectation of
Spoil would encourage the Rebels to enter the City, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
them more to fight within than without the Walls;
and they alſo believed, That very many of <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi>'s
Army (being Inhabitants of the Pale, and forced to the
Camp) were in their Hearts for the City; and this they
were induced to believe, becauſe moſt part of the Arrows
ſhot over the Walls were unheaded. Upon theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they reſolved to ſally, and gave out from the Walls,
That new Succours were come from <hi>England,</hi> and as if it had
been ſo, immediately ruſhed out through Fire and Flame, and
the Enemy believing they were new-arrived Soldiers, and
that the Citizens durſt not adventure ſo briskly, immediately
fled, leaving one hundred Gallowglaſſes ſlain, and their Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
taken. <hi>Thomas Fitz-Girald</hi> himſelf lurked at the <hi>Grey-Fryers,</hi>
in <hi>Francis-ſtreet,</hi> till next morning, and then he got
to the remainder of his ſhattered Army.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> was committed to
the Tower,<note place="margin">Holingſhead, 88</note> becauſe he had contrary to the King's expreſs
Command furniſhed his Caſtles out of his Majeſty's Stores:
And though he anſwered, That it was done to defend the
Pale againſt the Borderers; and that if he deſigned Treaſon,
he was not ſuch a Fool as to fortifie his Caſtles, and at the
ſame time to adventure his Perſon into their Hands; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſtuttered ſo much, and delivered his Speech in ſuch
ſtaggering and maffling manner, that they concluded him
Guilty, and committed him: And now hearing of his Son's
Extravagancies, he broke his Heart, and died in the Tower
in <hi>September.</hi>

                     <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> being in great want of Artillery and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſomewhat cooled by the late defeat, ſent <hi>James
Delahide</hi> and others to treat with the City upon theſe Articles,
<list>
                        <item>(I.) That his Men that were Priſoners, ſhould be enlarged.</item>

                        <item>(IV.) To interceed with the King for his Pardon and his

                        <item>Mr <hi>Fitz-Symons,</hi> Recorder, was appointed to anſwer to the</item>
                        <item>I. That if he would deliver their Children, they would
enlarge his Men. To the</item>

not ſpare either Wares or Mony. To the</item>
                        <item>III. If he intended to ſubmit he had no need of them; if he
did not, they would not give him Rods to whip themſelves:
That they expected he would requeſt good Vellam Parchment
to ingroſs his Pardon, and not Artillery to withſtand his Prince.
To the</item>
                        <item>IV. They promiſed all Interceſſion they could, by Word

                  <p>Whilſt they were treating thus, one <hi>William Bath,</hi> of <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>-Town,
a Lawyer, ſtepped forward, and ſaid, <hi>My Maſters,
What need all theſe Circumſtances? Let us all drink of one Cup:</hi>
Which Words coſt him his Life the next year.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> agreed with the Citizens on their own
Terms, and Hoſtages being given on both ſides, he raiſed
his Siege, and ſent his Artillery to <hi>Houth,</hi> but went himſelf
to <hi>Minnooth,</hi> to ſee that Caſtle fortified and furniſhed.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the two <hi>Hamertons,</hi> with one hundred and
eighty Soldiers, arrived out of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Houth,</hi> and on
their March to <hi>Dublin</hi> were encountred near <hi>Clantarf</hi> by
<hi>Thomas Fitz-Girald,</hi> and two hundred Horſemen; and though
they fought valiantly, and one of the <hi>Hamertons</hi> wounded
<hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> in the Forehead, yet being over-powered, they
were all ſlain or taken Priſoners; and their Ships were forced
from <hi>Houth,</hi> and a Veſſel freighted with choice Engliſh Geld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
was alſo taken by Captain <hi>Rouks, Fitz-Girald</hi>'s Pirate,
and the Horſes were ſent to <hi>Fitz Girald.</hi>

Sir <hi>William Skeffington,</hi> Lord Deputy, he was Maſter of
the Ordnance in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore was by the Iriſh,
(who put Nick-names upon every Body, even of themſelves,
as <hi>Dermond Buckagh, Tiege Mauntagh,</hi> &amp;c.) in deriſion,
called, <hi>The Gunner;</hi> he was received with great Joy by the
City, and had the Sword delivered to him by the Lord of
<hi>Trimletſtone,</hi> who was made Chancellor in the place of
Archbiſhop <hi>Cromer;</hi> Baron <hi>Finglaſs</hi> (who wrote a <hi>M. S.</hi>
Treatiſe of the Decay of <hi>Ireland</hi>) was made Chief Juſtice of
the King's Bench, as <hi>Luttrel</hi> was of the Common Pleas,
and <hi>Girald Ailmer</hi> Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and
<hi>William Brabazon</hi> Vice-Treaſurer. This Deputy alſo brought
with him <hi>Leonard</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> (deſigned Marſhal of <hi>Ireland</hi>)
and Gracious Letters from the King to the City of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That part of the Engliſh Fleet, which ſailed near <hi>Tredagh,</hi>
met with <hi>Brode</hi> the Pyrate, and forced him a Ground, ſo that
he and nine of his Men were taken at <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and ſent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
to <hi>Dublin;</hi> whereat <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> was ſo much enraged,
that he threatned to beſiege <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and it is probable he
marched that way, for it was averr'd at <hi>Dublin,</hi> That he was
actually before the Town: And therefore the Lord Deputy
immediatly, <hi>viz.</hi> the twenty eighth of <hi>October,</hi> marched out,
to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Tredagh;</hi> and he ſtaied in and about that
Town, till the fourth of <hi>November,</hi> and then finding no
Enemy near that Place, he returned to <hi>Dublin,</hi> having firſt
proclaimed <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> Traytor, at the High Croſs of
<hi>Tredagh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord Deputy would have purſued <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> and his
Confederates, but that the Winter was too near, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was indiſpoſed; moreover, he daily expected Supplies of
Men and Mony from <hi>England;</hi> and he knew that <hi>Fitz Girald</hi>
had ſtrengthned his Party by a new Confederacy with <hi>O Neal</hi>
and <hi>O Connor:</hi> And therefore being neceſſitated to poſtpone
his Deſigns till the Spring, ſome ſay he made a Truce with
<hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> until <hi>January;</hi> but that ſeems improbable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Pale ſuffered exceedingly this Winter, the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of which, muſt have been the chief Conſideration for
a Truce, if there were any.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> had in his Poſſeſſion ſix principal Caſtles, <hi>viz,
Minooth, Portleſter, Rathingan, Catherlagh, Ley</hi> and <hi>Athy;</hi>
and having well manned and furniſhed them, he took a
Journey into <hi>Connaught,</hi> not doubting but that his Caſtle of
<hi>Minooth</hi> would hold out till his Return; but he was very
much out in his Calculation, for the Lord Deputy on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>March,</hi> laid Siege to that Caſtle, and placed his
Battery on the North Side of the ſame, towards the Park,
and Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> who had ſlain one hundred of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65997:152"/>
                     <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi>'s Men on the ſixth of <hi>March,</hi> did now ſummon
the Caſtle of <hi>Minooth,</hi> with Offers of Pardon and Reward;
to which a ſcoffing and ludibrious Anſwer was returned, with
much boaſting, after the Iriſh manner: Whereupon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
began to play, but made no conſiderable Breach in a
Fortnights time; and therefore though it was ſo cloſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,
that there was neither egreſs or regreſs from or to the
Caſtle; yet being ſufficiently provided of all Neceſſaries,
and particularly of a good Garriſon of an hundred choice men,
it might have held out until <hi>Fitz Girald</hi> could come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it.</p>
                  <p>But the perfidious Governor <hi>Chriſtopher Pareſe (Fitz-Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi>'s
Foſter-Brother) a white-Liver'd Traytor, reſolved to
purchaſe his own ſecurity with his Lord's Ruine; and to
that end, got Letters conveyed to the Lord Deputy, import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he would ſurrender the Caſtle upon certain Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
by him propos'd, all which concerned only his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
without mention of his Safety. The Lord Deputy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
accepted of the Offer, and agreed to the Conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired:
Whereupon, <hi>Pareſe,</hi> after ſome ſmall Advantage
they had got in a Sally, caus'd the Garriſon to rejoyce and
carouſe to that degree that they were all dead drunk; and
then upon a Signal given, the Engliſh ſcaled the Walls, and
entred the Caſtle; Captain <hi>Holland</hi> being one of the firſt,
hapned to leap down into a Pipe of Feathers, and there ſtuck,
and Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> being got in, cried out, S. <hi>George,</hi>
S. <hi>George;</hi> whereat one of the Garriſon awakened, and ſhot
at Captain <hi>Holland;</hi> but he being reſcued out of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by his Companions, killed the Souldier: After that,
there was little or no reſiſtance; and Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi>
ſoon advanced his Standard on the Top of the Turret: The
Spoil and Plunder of this Caſtle was exceeding great and rich,
this being accounted the beſt furniſhed Houſe belonging to

                  <p>The Lord Deputy entred in the Afternoon, before whom,
two Varlets, <hi>James de la Hide</hi> and <hi>Hayward,</hi> both Choriſters,
proſtrated themſelves, warbling a ſweet Sonnet, call'd <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Amica;</hi> their Melody ſav'd their Lives, which, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of Chief Juſtice <hi>Ailmer,</hi> the Deputy pardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pareſe</hi> expecting ſome great Reward, with abundance of
Confidence and Familiarity preſented himſelf before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty;
who told him, That he was to thank him, on the
King's behalf, for his Service, which ſaved much Charge
and many Lives, and doubted not, when the King was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
therewith, he would provide for him during his
Life; and the better to adviſe the King how to reward him,
he deſired to know what <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> had done for him: <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſe</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:65997:153"/>
ſet agog with this Diſcourſe, recounted the moſt minute
inſtances of <hi>Fitz Girald</hi>'s Liberality to him; upon which,
the Deputy reply'd; <hi>And how</hi> Pareſe, <hi>couldſt thou find in thy
heart to betray the Caſtle of ſo kind a Lord?</hi> And turning to
his Officers, he bids them pay him the Mony, and then
to chop off his Head. <hi>Had I known this,</hi> quoth <hi>Pareſe, your
Lordſhip ſhould not have had the Caſtle ſo eaſily.</hi> Whereupon,
one Mr. <hi>Boyſe</hi> being by, cried out, <hi>Auntraugh,</hi> i. e. <hi>too late;</hi>
which occaſion'd the Saying often us'd in <hi>Ireland, Too late,</hi>
quoth <hi>Boyſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Fitz-Girald,</hi> by the aid of <hi>O Connor</hi> and
others, had got an Army of ſeven thouſand Men, with which
he deſign'd to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Minooth;</hi> but upon News of
its Surrender, his Army deſerted him daily, and mouldred
away almoſt to nothing (Reputation, as I obſerved before,
much governing the Iriſh, and perhaps all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide;)
with the few that were left, he marched to <hi>Clane,</hi>
and the Deputy (leaving <hi>Brereton</hi> Governor of <hi>Dublin</hi>)
marched to <hi>Naas,</hi> where he took ſevenſcore of the Rebel
Gallowglaſſes, whom, (upon notice of <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach)
the Deputy commanded to be ſlain, only <hi>Edmond
Oleme</hi> eſcaped ſtark naked to his Maſter <hi>Fitz-Girald.</hi> There
was a Bog between both Armies, ſo that the Horſe could
not skirmiſh; but the Deputy, with his Artillery eaſily broke
and ſcattered <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi>'s inconſiderable Troops, put them
to flight, ſlew many, and took ſome Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>After this Defeat,<note place="margin">1535.</note> 
                     <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> never appeared at the Head
of any conſiderable Army; but by ſmall Parties would now
and then make ſome ſlight Excurſions, and particularly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Surrender of <hi>Rathingan</hi> (which hapned in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Year) he cauſed a Drove of Cattel to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
near the Town early in the Morning, and the Engliſh
believing that the Cattel ſtrayed that way, and might eaſily
be made Booty, moſt of the Garriſon ſallied to that intent,
and were intercepted by an Ambuſh, and ſlain. Another
time he burnt a Village near <hi>Trim,</hi> and ſent two or three of
his Men, clad like the Engliſh Soldiers, to <hi>Trim,</hi> and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they were Captain <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Men, they told the
Garriſon that the Rebel <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> was burning the Village:
Whereupon, moſt part of the Soldiers ſallied out, and were
killed.</p>
                  <p>On the 11th of <hi>May,</hi> the Lord <hi>Butler</hi> was created Viſcount
<hi>Thurles,</hi> and Admiral of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and on the twenty firſt
his Father (the Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi>) and he were made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of the Counties of <hi>Kilkenny, Waterford</hi> and <hi>Typerary,</hi>

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> H. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note>
which is the firſt Engagement I have met with of that
kind.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems that the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> had been ſent to <hi>England</hi> for
Supplies, and that he now returned with Horſemen and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
under Sir <hi>William Senlo,</hi> Sir <hi>Rice Manſel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Griffith,</hi> who were conveniently garriſoned in the Pale;
for I find by a Letter of the twenty firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the
Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> from Chief Juſtice <hi>Ailmer,</hi> and <hi>Allen</hi> Maſter
of the Rolls, that the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> Landed the twenty ninth of
<hi>July,</hi> and that they came on ſhoar the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and
were exceedingly ſurpriz'd at the alteration they found in
the Country; for that ſix of eight Baronies in the County of
<hi>Kildare,</hi> were burnt and depopulated; and ſo likewiſe was
part of <hi>Meath,</hi> and that Sir <hi>William Brabazon</hi> at the <hi>Naas,</hi>
was the Man that prevented the total Ruine and Deſolation
of the Country: That <hi>Powerſcourt,</hi> which coſt five thouſand
Marks was ruin'd by the <hi>Birns</hi> and <hi>Tools:</hi> That <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi>
had regain'd <hi>Rathingan,</hi> by the Treachery of the Ward; but
that he quitted it upon approach of the Army, and the Lord
Deputy might have ſurpriz'd him in it, if he would, or had
been as diligent as he ought: That <hi>O More</hi> (who joyn'd
with the Engliſh) had ſo poſted his own Men and the Kings,
that the Rebels were ſurrounded, and <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> could not
have eſcaped, if a Brigade of the Engliſh had not quitted
their Station; however, <hi>Burnel</hi> of <hi>Balligriffin,</hi> was taken,
(and was afterwards hang'd at <hi>Tyburn:</hi>) That the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
raged at <hi>Dublin;</hi> and that the Lord Deputy deſigned
to quarter a thouſand <hi>Kerns</hi> for three Months on the Pale,
which would ruine it; but their Arrival with Money, alter'd
that to a Ceſs for this Expedition only, whereunto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
chearfully conſented: That they had engaged <hi>Cahir O
Connor</hi> againſt his Brother, by allowing him twelve Horſe,
and one hundred and ſixty <hi>Kerns</hi> in his Majeſties Pay: That
the Deputy is ſick, and not able to defend <hi>Minooth,</hi> where he
lodges; but ſuffers his own Cattle to be taken from the very
Gates: That there is no hope of <hi>O Neal</hi>'s Loyalty, ſince he
gave no Hoſtages; and finally, this Letter highly extols Sir
<hi>William Brabazon</hi> (the worthy Anceſtor of the Earl of
<hi>Meath</hi>) as the Saviour of the Kingdom, and concludes with
Commendations of the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and deſires he may be
Lord Deputy, and have Orders to call a Parliament.</p>
                  <p>What that Letter mentions of <hi>O Neal,</hi> has reference to a
Treaty between the Lord Deputy and him; for when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
that the Lord Deputy deſign'd an Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him into the North, to prevent it, he deſired a Parly,
and on the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> by his Agent <hi>Gillaſpick O Donel,</hi> he
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65997:154"/>
concluded an Agreement with the Lord Deputy, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
was confirmed by <hi>Con O Neal</hi> himſelf at <hi>Drogheda,</hi>
on the twenty fifth of the ſame Month.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Lord Deputy, finding that <hi>Fitz-Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi>
had retired to <hi>Munſter,</hi> ſent after him the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi>
Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> and others, who had ſeveral Skirmiſhes
with his Party, wherein nothing was got but Blows; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Brereton</hi>'s Advice on the one ſide, and <hi>Fitz, Girald</hi>'s
Neceſſity on the other ſide, produced a Parly; the effect
whereof was, That <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> ſurrendred to the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi>
and rode with him to <hi>Dubliu,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Lord Deputy's Letter to the King, of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24.
he acquaints his Majeſty, That <hi>Fitz Girald</hi> and <hi>O Connor</hi> had
ſubmitted; the former without any Condition or Promiſe of
Life, Lands or Goods, and that he intends to ſend him over
by the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> whilſt himſelf in perſon goes to aſſiſt <hi>O
Donel</hi> againſt his Son <hi>Manus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Council by their Letter from the Camp to the
King, of the 27th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> inform his Majeſty, That <hi>O
Connor,</hi> an Abettor of <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi>'s, has given Hoſtages to
abide the King's Pleaſure, and that <hi>Fitz-Firald</hi> ſubmitted
on the encouragements they gave him to expect Pardon for
his Life: That the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> is going with him, leaving the
Lord <hi>Butler</hi> in his room; and they deſire the King to thank
the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> for his good Service.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, others ſay, That <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> was by the
Lord <hi>Grey</hi> abſolutely promiſed his Pardon; but if it was ſo,
it was more than he had Comiſſion for, and therefore no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
was given to that Pretence; but the King being impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably
enraged at this dangerous Rebellion, cauſed <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi>
to be arreſted in the way to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and afterwards, <hi>viz.
Febr.</hi> 3. 1537. he and five of his Unkles were executed at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi>
although three of them had for a long time oppoſed
their Nephews Extravagancies.</p>
                  <p>And thus ended a Rebellion,<note place="margin">Lib. CCC. 85.</note> which coſt the King twenty
thouſand, ſome ſay forty thouſand Pound: At which great
Expence the King was ſo diſturb'd, that he called this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a new Conqueſt; and put the Queſtion to his Council,
how <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be managed to bear the charge of its own
Preſervation; and whether by Act of Parliament every mans
Eſtate ſhould not be made liable to contribute its proportion;
or, whether, by vertue of this Conqueſt, the King might
not ſeize on all the Eſtates in that Kingdom Temporal and
Spiritual?</p>
                  <p>By a Letter from <hi>Stephen ap Harry</hi> (who was afterward
a great man with the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>) of the ſixth of <hi>October,</hi>
from <hi>Waterford,</hi> directed to Mr. <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> Secretary
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65997:154"/>
of State; he informs his Honour, That the Lord <hi>Leonard
Grey</hi> was gone to <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Fitz Girald,</hi> and that the
Lord <hi>James Butler</hi> marched to <hi>Clonmel,</hi> where his Lordſhips
Brother-in-Law <hi>Garret Mac Shane</hi> (who could not ſpeak one
Word of Engliſh) met him; That thence they marched to
<hi>Dungarvan,</hi> which ſurrendred unto him, and thence to <hi>Youg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal,</hi>
where he had a Gallon of <hi>Gaſcoyn</hi> Wine for four pence;
and thence to <hi>Cork,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Barry</hi> made great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of <hi>Cormock Oge</hi> of <hi>Muskry,</hi> and <hi>Mac Carty Riagh;</hi> the
former was willing to ſubmit to the Award of the State;
but <hi>Mac Carty Riagh</hi> anſwered, That <hi>what he got by the Sword,
he would keep by the Sword.</hi> The like Controverſie was between
<hi>James,</hi> Grandſon of <hi>Thomas,</hi> laſt Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and Sir
<hi>John,</hi> Brother of that Earl; the young man offered to go to
<hi>England,</hi> and to ſubmit to his Majeſties Pleaſure; but Sir
<hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>He ſcorned to conteſt with a Boy:</hi> That they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thence to <hi>Mallow,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Kilmallock;</hi> and thence to
<hi>Lymerick,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Butler</hi>'s Brother-in-law (<hi>O Brians</hi>
Son) deſired Aid againſt his Father and Unkle, and that
the Lord <hi>Butler</hi> would beſiege <hi>Carrigonel;</hi> but he could not
do it for want of Artillery, and therefore marched to <hi>Caſhel,</hi>
and thence to <hi>Clonmel,</hi> having worthily behav'd himſelf all
this Journey.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems the Lord Deputy had ſollicited for the King's leave
to return to <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of his Age and Infirmities;
but the King in his Anſwer, thanked him for the taking <hi>Fitz-Girald;</hi>
but wiſhed it had been done in another manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
by force; and tells him, That he muſt continue in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> notwithſtanding his Age and Sickneſs;
and orders a Parliament to be called as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on as conveniently
might be; but it is probable that ſoon after thoſe Letters ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
the Lord Deputy died at <hi>Kilmainham,</hi> in the latter
end of <hi>December,</hi> and was honourably buried in St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s
Church: And thereupon, the Council choſe</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leonard</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1535.</note> Lord Deputy; who was but newly
returned from <hi>England,</hi> and probably did not bring over ſo
much Treaſure as the Army both expected and needed, and
therefore the Souldiers mutined in <hi>January;</hi> and thereupon
the King, by his Letter of the twenty fifth of <hi>February,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to know who were the Ringleaders of it, and orders,
that as many of the Army as can be ſpared, may be disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:<note place="margin">Lib. H.</note>
To which Letter the Lord Deputy and Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
for Anſwer, That after the impriſonment of <hi>Fitz-Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi>
they had disbanded five hundred men; but that his
Unkles being at that time out, and the Earl of <hi>Deſmond, O
Brian</hi> and <hi>O Connor</hi> linked in a Confederacy, it was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
time then to diſmiſs any more; but that they have now
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65997:155"/>
borrowed four hundred Pounds Iriſh, and therewith have
disbanded two hundred and fifty Foot, and fifty Horſe;
That the Revenue of the Kingdom was but five thouſand
Pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> whereof a thouſand Pound was then
inſolvent; they adviſe the King to grant a Pardon to the
County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> to the end the People of that County
may return to their Habitations; and they adviſe, That the
Kings Lands may be ſet for a Term of one and twenty years,
and that a Mint may be erected in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and none but Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Money be currant, and thereby every Mark of the King's
Revenue will be a Pound.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt interrupt the Series of this Diſcourſe, to give
the Reader an Account of the miraculous preſervation of one
of the remaining Branches of the Noble Family of <hi>Kildare,</hi> a
Child of thirteen years old, Brother of the Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> and
Son of the deceaſed Earl, who happened to be ſick of the
Small Pox at <hi>Donoare</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> when his
Unkles were apprehended; whereupon, his careful Tutor,
<hi>Thomas Leverouſe</hi> (afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Kildare</hi>) had the
Child wrapt up warm, and in a Cleef or Basket conveyed
him into <hi>Offaly,</hi> and after he was recovered, he travelled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Thomond,</hi> and after half a years abode there, they went to
<hi>Kilbritton</hi> in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> where <hi>Elianor Fitz-Girald
(Mac Carty Riagh</hi>'s Widow) then lived: Soon after ſhe
married with <hi>O Donel,</hi> and made it one of the Articles of
her Agreement, That he ſhould protect, her Nephew the
young <hi>Fitz-Girald;</hi> which he faithfully promiſed, and
thereupon they went together to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> but they were not
there a Twelve-month, before the Lady underſtood that her
perfidious Husband had agreed to betray her Nephew; and
therefore ſhe ſent him privately into <hi>France,</hi> and gave him
ſevenſcore Pieces of Gold, call'd <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> to bear his
Charge; and afterwards upbraided <hi>O Donel</hi> with his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery;
and told him, That, as nothing but the Preſervation
of her Nephew, could have prevailed with her to marry
ſuch a clowniſh Curmudgen, ſo ſince he villanouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to betray her in that Particular, ſhe would ſtay with
him no longer; and ſo away ſhe went, and never ſaw him
more.</p>
                  <p>But the Young <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> arrived ſafely at <hi>S. Maloes,</hi> and
being ſent for up to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Engliſh Embaſſador there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him of the French King, by virtue of the Peace late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concluded: The French King gave him a dilatory Anſwer,
and in the mean time <hi>Fitz Girald</hi> eſcaped to <hi>Flanders;</hi> at
<hi>Valencienes</hi> he was overtaken by <hi>James Sherlock,</hi> whom the
Embaſſador ſent to purſue him; but the Governour of that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65997:155"/>
Town committed <hi>Sherlock,</hi> and ſo <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> got ſafe to
<hi>Bruſſels;</hi> but the Engliſh Embaſſador demanded him there
alſo, ſo that he was forced to remove to <hi>Leige,</hi> and was by
the Emperor recommended to the Biſhop of <hi>Leige,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a hundred Crowns a Month for his Expence: But he
ſtaid there not above half a Year, before his Kinſman Cardin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Poole</hi> ſent for him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and placed him ſucceſſively
with the Biſhop of <hi>Verona,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and allowed him an Annuity of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> gave him
the like Penſion: With them he ſtaid a Year and a half, and
then removed to Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi>'s Palace in <hi>Rome,</hi> where he
continued three Years: The next Year after he ſpent in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
with the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and behaved himſelf exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
valiantly: Then he became Maſter of the Horſe to the Great
Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and continued in that Office three Years.</p>
                  <p>One Day as he was hunting,<note place="margin">Holingſhead, 99.</note> in the company of Cardinal
<hi>Farneze,</hi> he fell into a Pit twenty nine Fathom deep, and had
the good Luck, within two Fathom of the Bottom, to quit
his Horſe, and take hold of ſome Roots or Buſhes that were
on the Side of the Pit, and by degrees he let go his Hold,
and gently deſcended upon his Horſe, which was dead in the
Bottom of the Pit; and there he ſtood three Hours, up to the
Ankles in Water, until his Grey-hound (called <hi>Griff-hound</hi>) miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Maſter hunted him to the Pit, and there fell a howling,
till the Company came in, and with a Rope and a Basket drew
him up alive and well, to all their Admirations, &amp; to mine too,
if I did not think this part of the Story to be a little Monkiſh.</p>
                  <p>And ſince I am upon Digreſſions,<note place="margin">Analecta Hib. Sullevan, Cath. Hist. 71.</note> it will be fit to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
That Doctor <hi>Traverſe,</hi> who was an active Man in <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi>'s
Rebellion, and was therefore executed at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> as
the Traytor well deſerved, has nevertheleſs found a Room in
the Iriſh Martyrology, and is mentioned, as an Inſtance of the
Engliſh Cruelty, by the Iriſh Hiſtorians.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we will conclude the Year 1535 with the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of <hi>George Brown</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ware, de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulibs.</note> which was
performed by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the Biſhops
of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> on the nineteenth (or rather
twenty ninth) of <hi>March;</hi> he had formerly been Provincial
of the Fryers of the Order of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Biſh. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Life.</note> in <hi>England:</hi> And
whilſt he was ſo, he uſed to Preach, That Salvation was to
be obtained by the Merits of Chriſt, and adviſed to make
Application to him only; for which Doctrine he was much
taken notice of. He became the firſt Proteſtant Convert of
the Clergy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was an exceeding Charitable and
Meek Man: He was the firſt that cauſed Images and other
Superſtitious Reliques to be removed out of the two Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65997:156"/>
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and out of the reſt of the Churches within
his Dioceſs: And he cauſed the Ten Commandments, the
Lord's Prayer and the Creed to be placed in gilded Frames
about the Altar, in <hi>Chriſt-Church, Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems that the King did ſend Commiſſioners into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
to remove the Pope's Authority thence, and to reduce it to
conformity with <hi>England;</hi> if ſo, undoubtedly Archbiſhop
<hi>Browne</hi> was one of the Commiſſioners, as will appear by the

of his Highneſs their Supreme Head, as well Spiritual as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
and do find much oppugning therein, eſpecially by my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Armagh,</hi> who hath been the main Oppugner, and ſo hath
withdrawn moſt of his Suffragans and Clergy within his See and
Juriſdiction: He made a ſpeech to them, laying a Curſe on the
People, whoſoever ſhould own his Highneſs's Supremacy; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That this Iſle, as it is in their Iriſh Chronicles, <hi>Inſula
Sacra,</hi> belongs to none but the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it was
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Predeceſſors gave it to the King's Anceſtors.
There be two Meſſengers by the Prieſts of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and by that
Archbiſhop, now lately ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
may inform his Highneſs, That it is convenient to call a
Parliament in this Nation, to paſs the Supremacy by Act; for
they do not much matter his Highneſs's Commiſſion, which your
Lordſhip ſent us over. This Iſland hath been for a long time
held in Ignorance by the Romiſh Orders: And as for their Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Orders, they be in a manner as ignorant as the People, being
not able to ſay Maſs, or pronounce the Words, they not knowing
what they themſelves ſay in the Roman Tongue: The common
People of this Iſle are more Zealous in their Blindneſs than the
Saints and Martyrs were in the Truth at the beginning of the
Goſpel. I ſend to you, my very good Lord, theſe things, that
your Lordſhip and his Highneſs may conſult what is to be done.
It is feared <hi>O Neal</hi> will be ordered by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
your Lordſhips Order from the King's Highneſs; for the
Natives are much in Numbers within his Powers. I do pray the
Lord Chriſt to defend your Lordſhip from your Enemies.</p>
                        <p>On the twenty eighth of <hi>April</hi> the King ſent Orders to the

                        <p>And ſo we come to the Parliament, which began at <hi>Dublin</hi>
on the firſt Day of <hi>May,</hi> and on the laſt Day of that Month
was adjourned to <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> and did there ſit the twenty
fifth Day of <hi>July;</hi> and on the twenty firſt was adjourned to

                        <p>I. The Attainder of the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> and his Complices:
This Act recites all their Treaſons, and Retroſpects to the
eighth Day of <hi>July, 20 Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>II. The Parliament reciting, That <hi>Ireland</hi> is appending
and belonging to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> doth make void
and nullifie the King's Marriage with the Princeſs <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>
his Brother's Wife, and doth ratifie the Divorce
judicially made between them, by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury:</hi>
It alſo confirms the King's Marriage with <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi>
and prohibits Marriage within the Levitical Degrees, and
orders that Perſons ſo married ſhall be divorced, and their
Children after ſuch Divorce ſhall be illegitimate: Then it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails
the Crown on the King's Heir Males by Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and
for want of ſuch to his Heirs Males by any other Wife; and
for want of ſuch, to the King's Heirs Female by Queen <hi>Anne,</hi>
and particularizes the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Heirs of
her Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that it ſhall be Treaſon to Write or Act
againſt the aforeſaid Marriage, or the Settlement of the
Crown; and Miſpriſion of Treaſon to ſpeak againſt either of
thoſe things, and deprives the Offenders of Benefit of Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;
it makes the Queen and ſuch Counſellors as the King
ſhall appoint Guardians of the Infant King or Queen (if it
ſo happen) till their reſpective Ages of ſixteen, if a Queen,
and eighteen if a King; and preſcribes an Oath for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of this Settlement, to be taken by the Subject; and
makes it Miſpriſion of Treaſon to refuſe it.</p>
                        <p>III. The Act of Abſentees, recites the Inconveniences that
have happened by reaſon of the Abſence of thoſe that have
Eſtates in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and then veſts in the King the Honours
and Eſtates of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Lord <hi>Berkly,</hi> the Earl

the Abbot of <hi>Oſny,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Bath,</hi> and the Maſter of
<hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Dacres:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">4 Inſt. 354.</note> And it was reſolved, <hi>anno</hi> 1612. That
the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> did loſe the Title of Earl of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
and Viſcount <hi>Dungarvan,</hi> by this Statute: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
he had a very good Recompence in <hi>England</hi> for his Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And it is not unworthy our Remembrance, How this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
came to be made; and the Occaſion was thus, The
King being inclined to make Mr. <hi>Ailmer</hi> (who was then
Lord Chief juſtice of the Common Pleas) Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the King's Bench; the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> (at the
inſtance of ſome of his Tenants in <hi>Waterford</hi> or <hi>Wexford</hi>)
oppoſed his Preferment, alledging, <hi>That</hi> Ailmer <hi>was a ſilly
fellow, and unfit for ſuch a Place;</hi> whereupon the King repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> for recommending ſuch a Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb
to him; the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> begs the King to diſcourſe
with <hi>Ailmer,</hi> aſſuring his Majeſty, That he was miſinformed.
The King conſented, and <hi>Ailmer</hi> being come, the King asked
the true reaſon of the Decay of <hi>Ireland: Ailmer</hi> Anſwered,
<hi>That it was becauſe the Eſtated Men (who uſed to Reſide and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their own Eſtates and countenance their Tenants) did now
generally dwell in</hi> England <hi>and left</hi> Ireland <hi>a Prey to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:
But that if his Majeſty would oblige the Eſtated Men to
Reſidence, or ſeize their Eſtates to his own uſe, he would
ſoon find a Reformation.</hi> The King tickled with this Advice,
gave <hi>Ailmer</hi> Thanks, and aſſured him Care ſhould be taken
of it next Parliament.</p>
                        <p>IV. A Suſpenſion or Repeal of <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Act <hi>pro hac

                        <p>VI. That there ſhall be no Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> on Pain of

VIII. That the Clergy ſhall pay Annates or Firſt-Fruits,

The Chancellor, Maſter of the Rolls and Vice-Treaſurer,

to be one, (or any others commiſſioned by the King) may
compound and give Inſtalments: That the Bonds for Firſt-Fruits
ſhall have the Effect of Bonds of the Staple, and eight
Pence to be paid for a Bond, and four Pence for an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

                        <p>IX. An Act to veſt in the King Sir <hi>Walter Delahide</hi>'s Lands
in <hi>Carbry,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>X. That if the Robber or Felon be found Guilty, upon an
Indictment, by means or Proſecution of the Party robbed,
that then he ſhall have Reſtitution, as if it had been done
upon an Appeal.</p>
                        <p>XI. An Act to ſuppreſs all Tributes, Penſions, and Iriſh

Oath of Supremacy mentioned in the Act, and the Refuſal

                        <p>It ſeems there was much Difficulty to get this Act, and
the former Act for the King's Supremacy, to paſs both Houſes,

<hi>Brown</hi> made the following Speech; which being well
ſconded by Juſtice <hi>Brabazon,</hi> ſo ſtartled the reſt, that at
length both Bills paſſed. The Archbiſhop's Speech was

                        <p>And theſe are all the Acts of this Parliament to be found
in the printed Statute-Book; which I do not pretend to have
critically or exactly abridged; becauſe I think it neceſſary
for every man that will be nicely inſtructed in any Statute-Law,
to read the Statute at large, and not to truſt to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment;
but I have endeavoured to give ſuch an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Account of theſe Acts, as may illuſtrate this Collection,
and give the Reader ſome Light into the Affairs of thoſe times.
Nor muſt it be forgotten, that many of theſe Statutes are
made in the later Seſſions of this Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1537.</p>
                        <p>And beſides theſe Printed Acts, there was another Law
made at this Parliament againſt Foſterings and Marriage
with the Iriſh; and it was thereby made Treaſon to marry
with the Child of any Man who had not ſwore allegiance,
and entred into Recognizance to obſerve it; but this ſevere
Law was repeal'd, 11 <hi>Jac. 1. cap.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p>But whilſt the Nobility and Gentry were at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>O Connor</hi> made uſe of the opportunity, as he uſed to
do, and invaded the Pale; his Fury lighted moſt on the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony
of <hi>Carbry</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> which he preyed
and burnt; and to revenge it, the Lord <hi>Trimletſtown,</hi> and
the Vice-Treaſurer <hi>Brabazon,</hi> with ſuch men as they could on
the ſudden get together, made an Incurſion into <hi>Offaly,</hi> and in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65997:159"/>
like manner waſted and deſtroyed that Country, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<hi>O Connor</hi> to return home as faſt as he could.</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> was likewiſe ſent to the Confines of

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> to parly with <hi>O Neal,</hi> who complained, That the
League (made between the Lord Deputy <hi>Skeffington</hi> and him)
was not duly obſerved on the Engliſh ſide; ſo after ſome
Expoſtulations upon that Point, the ſame Agreement was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
and confirmed.</p>
                        <p>And about the ſame time, the King, to reward the City of
<hi>Waterford,</hi> for its Loyalty and firm adheſion to the Crown,
ſent to that City a gilt Sword, and a Cap of Maintainance.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>John,</hi> Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> being dead, the new Earl,
<hi>James</hi> (who was a very active, or rather a turbulent man)
began new Diſturbances in <hi>Munſter;</hi> but he was timely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the Lord <hi>Butler,</hi> who waſted his Lands in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and repair'd and Garriſon'd the Caſtle of
<hi>Loghguir,</hi> and it ſeems that the Lord Deputy came to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi>
the twenty fourth of <hi>July,</hi> and having adjourned the
Parliament,<note place="margin">Lib. D.</note> as aforeſaid, he came to <hi>Loghguir</hi> the laſt of <hi>July,</hi>
and the next day he went to <hi>Carrigonel,</hi> and took it the ſecond
of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and they ſay, for ſome private Advantage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivered
it to the former Owner; on the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they
marched to <hi>Bryans-bridge,</hi> and took the Caſtles, and broke
the Bridge; but by the improvidence of thoſe in Authority,
there was ſo great ſcarcity of Victuals, that a halfpeny Loaf
was worth a Shilling. And within four or five days the
ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Carrigonel</hi> was loſt by treachery; but it was
preſently retaken, with the Slaughter of ſixty Rebels; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Wants of the Army occaſioned a Mutiny, ſo that
the Soldiers refuſed to march for want of Pay, and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of <hi>Loghguir</hi> deſerted, and a thouſand other Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

                        <p>On the twenty third of <hi>April,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1537.</note> the Lord Deputy began
his Expedition into <hi>Offaly,</hi> againſt <hi>O Connor,</hi> to revenge the
Inſolencies of the laſt year; but he was hindred by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Rain that fell at that time, from doing the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he deſign'd,<note place="margin">Ware, 147.</note> ſo that he was fain to end this Quarrel by a
diſhonourable ſort of Arbitration; for although the Damages
which <hi>O Connor</hi> had done, were eſtimated at five thouſand
Marks, yet the Lord Deputy compounded for eight hundred
Beeves, or ſix ſhillings and eight pence apiece in lieu of them;
but not long after, he attack'd the <hi>Cavenaghs</hi> and <hi>O Carol,</hi>
with better Succeſs, and forced them to ſubmit, and give
Hoſtages.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems that the Lord Deputy had new Inſtructions to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
all the Iriſh by Indenture to own the King's Supremacy,
and to renounce the Popes Uſurpations, and to contribute
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65997:159"/>
ſomething towards the ſupport of the Government, and to
ſend a Quota of Men to every Hoſting; and to effect this,
the Lord Deputy marched to <hi>Offaly</hi> the ſeventeenth of <hi>June,</hi>
and on the eighteenth, encamped in <hi>O Mulmoyes</hi> Country,
and took the Caſtle of <hi>Eglis;</hi> on the nineteenth, he took <hi>Bir</hi>
and <hi>Modrimye</hi> in <hi>O Carols</hi> Country; on the twenty fourth, <hi>O
Kenedy</hi> ſubmitted to him in <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the twenty fifth,
<hi>Mac Brian Arra</hi> likewiſe ſubmitted. On the twenty ſixth, the
Lord Deputy came to <hi>Abby Owny,</hi> where <hi>O Mulrian, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick
Burk</hi> of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and <hi>Tybot Burk Mac William</hi> made their
Submiſſions; and ſo on the twenty eighth, he came to <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
where the Mayor and Aldermen took the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
and ſwore to renounce the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Authority, and the Biſhop of <hi>Limerick</hi> did the like, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſcruple or heſitation; and Order was left for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and Commonalty of that City, to follow that Example,
and that Certificates of their performance be returned into
Chancery: And it is obſervable, that here one of the <hi>O Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
made Peace for a year, and promiſed to do Service againſt
his Brother <hi>Mortagh:</hi> On the fourth of <hi>July</hi> the Army came
to <hi>Bryans-Bridge,</hi> and had a Skirmiſh with the Rebels, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Loſs; and on the ſixth, demoliſhed the Caſtles and
Bridge; and on the eighth, the Lord Deputy marched into
<hi>Thomond,</hi> and took the Caſtles of <hi>Clare</hi> and <hi>Ballycolome;</hi> and
on the ninth, he came into <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and took the Caſtle
of <hi>Ballyclare,</hi> and delivered it to <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick Burk;</hi> and on the
eleventh, he came to <hi>Galway,</hi> where the Corporation treated
the Lord Deputy and all the Engliſh Soldiers <hi>gratis</hi> for ſeven
days, and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick Burk</hi> did the like to the Iriſh; and the Mayor
and Aldermen followed the example of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and took
the Oath of the King's Supremacy, and renounced the Pope's
uſurped Authority: And here <hi>O Flaherty, O Maddin,</hi> and <hi>Mac
Yoris</hi> made their Submiſſions: On the twenty firſt the Lord
Deputy removed to <hi>O Kelly</hi>'s Country, where <hi>O Connor Mac
Henry</hi> ſubmitted; and thence he went to <hi>Mac Coughlan</hi>'s
Country, where he took a Caſtle, becauſe <hi>Mac Coughlan</hi>
had not kept his Word with him; and ſo, on the twenty
fifth, he returned to <hi>Minooth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And it is to be noted, That all thoſe that ſubmitted, were
bound by Indenture, as well as Oath, to own the King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
and to renounce the Popes Uſurpations; but when
the King had an Account of what was done, be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Letter to the Lord Deputy, That their Oaths, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
and Indentures were not worth a Farthing, ſince

The Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> mollified by the Misfortunes of the
laſt Year,<note place="margin">Ware, 147.</note> and fearing the Power of the Lord Deputy, who
was in the Field with his Army, as I have already related,
ſent Letters to the Deputy, with Offers of Submiſſion upon
Terms; but the Expoſtulations about it, were ſo tedious,
that the Army, for want of Proviſions, was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
however, Commiſſioners were employed to continue
the Treaty, and conclude an Agreement if they could; and
in order to it, they went to <hi>Clonmel;</hi> but the Earl of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
refuſed to come into a walled Town, inſiſting upon a
Fantaſtical Priviledge which he claimed; and thereupon the
Commiſſioners forgetting the Dignity of their Character,
and the Royal Perſon they repreſented, diſhonourably conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
to go to <hi>Deſmond</hi>'s Camp, and there they took his
Oath of Fidelity, and received his Baſtard Son <hi>Thomas Roe,</hi>
as a Hoſtage for his performanoe.</p>
                        <p>But now the Jealouſies between the Lord Deputy and the
Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> broke out into open Hoſtility, and the Deputy
was ſo extravagantly tranſported, that he ſent part of the
Army to ſpoil the Territories of the <hi>Butlers;</hi> he alſo quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
with Archbiſhop <hi>Brown,</hi> and <hi>Allen</hi> Maſter of the Rolls;
and although,<note place="margin">Lib. D.</note> by the King's Order, their Complaints were
heard, before the Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the new Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
hereafter named, and a Reconciliation made between
them, at leaſt in appearance, yet ſome of them ſtuck ſo
cloſe to him, that at length they procured his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</p>
                        <p>But it ſhould have been remembred, that on the firſt of
<hi>May, Fylemy Roe</hi> ſubmitted, and on the twelfth of <hi>May,
Cavenagh,</hi> alias <hi>Mac Murrough</hi> did the like; but <hi>O Neal</hi> was
ſo far from it, that deſpiſing the Agreement he had not
long before made with the Lord Deputy, he undertook to
reduce <hi>Arglaſs,</hi> and in order to it, ſent an Army under his
Son to attack that Town and Caſtle; but aſſoon as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Lord Deputy was ready to take the Field, he
immediately propoſed a Treaty; and on the fifteenth of <hi>June,</hi>
he made an Agreement with the Lord Chancellor, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Meath,</hi> and Chief Juſtice <hi>Ailmer,</hi> (Commiſſioners

King <hi>contra omnes homines Mundi;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and not long after died
Sir <hi>Hugh O Donel,</hi> Lord of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and was ſucceeded by

on the Rock near <hi>Kilmacronan</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>But in <hi>September</hi> there came over four Commiſſioners, <hi>viz.</hi>
Sir <hi>Anthony Saintleger,</hi> Sir <hi>George Pawlet,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moyle,</hi>
and Sir <hi>William Barnes;</hi> their buſineſs was to enquire into
the Abettors of the late Rebellion, and afterwards to give a
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65997:160"/>
General Pardon: And though they were very moderate, yet
it fell heavy on many of the Pale, who were compelled to
joyn with the Rebels; they had alſo Authority to aſſiſt the
Lord Deputy and Council in ſetling the Revenue, and to ſet
the Crown Lands for one and twenty Years, for a yearly Rent.
It was to theſe Commiſſioners that <hi>Bernard Fitz Patrick</hi>
made his Submiſſion;<note place="margin">October 8.</note> and they indented with him, That he

the Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi> was reſtored to the Title of Earl of

                        <p>On the twenty fifth of <hi>July,</hi>

who was alſo Lord Chancellor, departed this Life, and
in his ſtead Sir <hi>John Allen,</hi> Maſter of the Rolls, was firſt
made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, by the Lord Deputy
and Council; and afterwards, on the eigteenth Day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
was made Lord Chancellor by the King.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, (in the beginning of <hi>May</hi>) the Lord
Deputy marched from <hi>Trim,</hi> to purſue <hi>O Reyly;</hi> but he
prevented it by his Submiſſion: And thereupon the Deputy
marched againſt <hi>Savage,</hi> a degenerate Engliſhman, into <hi>Ards</hi>
and <hi>Lecale,</hi> and there he took <hi>Mac Genis</hi> his Caſtle of <hi>Dundrum,</hi>
and ſeven Caſtles more, and waſted and preyed all that
Country; and which was worſe, he burnt the Cathedral
Church of <hi>Downe,</hi> and defaced the Monuments of the Saints,
<hi>Patrick, Bridget</hi> and <hi>Columbus,</hi> and committed many other
Sacriledges. And about the ſame time Images were every
where defaced or taken away, and particularly the famous
Image of the Bleſſed Virgin at <hi>Trim</hi> was burnt, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Treaſures, which many ſuperſtitious Votaries
had offered there, were alſo taken and carried away.</p>
                        <p>And it ſeems, That whilſt the Lord Deputy was engaged
in the North, <hi>O Connor</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>O Toole</hi> on the
other, fell upon the Inhabitants of the Pale, and committed
what Robberies and Depredations they pleaſed, and returned
Home without Loſs: But when the Lord Deputy came back,
and underſtood what they had done, he reſolved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
of <hi>O Connor;</hi> and immediately invaded <hi>Ophaly,</hi> and
took the Caſtles of <hi>Braghnal</hi> and <hi>Dingen:</hi> And in his Letter
to the King, of the twelfth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he writes, That he
forced <hi>O Carol</hi> and <hi>O Magher</hi> to give Hoſtages; and that <hi>O
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65997:161"/>
Carol</hi> paid him three hundred Marks to redeliver his Son, and
deſired to take a Patent from the King for his Country; but
it is not fit to grant it to him, becauſe he is Falſe: And that
the Engliſh do now ſo well underſtand the Iriſhmen and
Country, that if the King will ſend them Mony, they will
manage the Iriſh as he Pleaſes. And in his Letter of the
twenty firſt of <hi>March</hi> he acquaints the King, That <hi>Brian O
Connor,</hi> ſubmitted in the open Fild; and that he purſued <hi>Cahir
O Connor,</hi> until he forced him to come to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to make
his Submiſſion there.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Reformation of Religion went on but
very ſlowly in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for although Archbiſhop <hi>Brown</hi> was
very zealous for it, yet the Primate <hi>Cromer</hi> was as induſtrious

I pray God to give me his Grace to execute the ſame to his

The People of this Nation be Zealous, yet Blind and
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknowing: Moſt of the Clergy (as your Lordſhip hath had
from me before) being Ignorant, and not able to ſpeak right
Words in the Maſs or Liturgy; as being not skilled in the
Latin Grammar, ſo that a Bird may be taught to ſpeak with as much
Senſe as ſeveral of them do in this Country; theſe Sorts, though
not Scholars, yet crafty to cozen the poor Common People, and
to diſſwade them from following his Highneſs's Orders: <hi>George,</hi>
my Brother of <hi>Armagh,</hi> doth under-hand occaſion Quarrels, and
is not active to execute his Highneſs's Orders in his Dioceſs.</p>
                              <p>I have obſerved your Lordſhip's Letter of Commiſſion, and do
find ſeveral of my Pupils leave me for ſo doing; I will not put
others in their Livings, till I do know your Lordſhip's Pleaſure;
for it is meet I acquaint you firſt, The Romiſh Reliques and
Images of both my Cathedrals, in <hi>Dublin,</hi> took off the Common
People from the true Worſhip; but the Prior and the Dean find
them ſo ſweet for their Gain, that they heed not my Words;
therefore ſend in your Lordſhip's next to me, an Order more full,
and a Chide to them and their Canons, that they might be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Let the Order be, That the Chief Governors may aſſiſt me in
it. The Prior and Dean have written to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged;
and if it be not hindred, before they have a Mandate
from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the People will be bold, and then tug
long, before his Highneſs can ſubmit them to his Grace's Orders.

                        <p>And it is not to be doubted,<note place="margin">Ware, 151.</note> but the Iriſh had Solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from many others beſides the Biſhop of <hi>Mets;</hi> for in
the beginning of the following Year, <hi>O Neal</hi> began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himſelf the Champion of the Papacy, and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a Confederacy with <hi>O Donel, Macgenis, Ocahane,
Mac William, O Hanlon,</hi> and others, they joyntly invaded
the Pale, and marched to <hi>Navan,</hi> burning that and <hi>Athirde,</hi>
and all the Country as they marched, and thence they came
to the Hill of <hi>Taragh,</hi> where they muſtered their Army with
great Oſtentation; and ſo having taken a vaſt Prey, and
done abundance of Miſchief, they deſigned to return home.</p>
                        <p>But the Lord Deputy, who foreſaw this Storm,<note place="margin">1539.</note> had ſent
to <hi>England</hi> for Aid;<note place="margin">Holingſh. 101.</note> and Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> who was
newly returned to <hi>England,</hi> was immediately ſent back with
two hundred and fifty <hi>Cheſhire</hi>-Men: It is reported of him,
That he broke his Thigh in two Places, by a Fall from his
Horſe, as he was exerciſing his Men; and that nevertheleſs
he was ſo Valiant and Zealous, that he cauſed himſelf to be
halled into the Ship by Pullies, that the Succours might not
be detained any longer.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Deputy,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> with the Forces of the Pale,
and the Mayors and Citizens of <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Drogheda</hi> (in
<hi>May</hi>) marched to <hi>Bellahoa,</hi> where <hi>O Neal</hi> was encamped
on the other ſide the River, they marched all Night to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the Enemy, and came to the River by break of Day.</p>
                        <p>The valiant Baron of <hi>Slane</hi> led the forlorn (and having
firſt ſubſtituted <hi>Robert Betoa</hi> his Standard-bearer, inſtead of
the cowardly <hi>Robert Halfpenny,</hi> who declined the Adventure,
becauſe of the Danger) he ruſhed into the River, and being
well ſeconded by <hi>Mabe</hi> of <hi>Mabeſtown</hi> (who was there ſlain)
though the Inconveniencies of paſſing the River were very
great, yet they at length got over, routed the <hi>Gallowglaſſes,</hi>
                           <pb n="260" facs="tcp:65997:163"/>
ſlew <hi>Macgenis,</hi> defeated <hi>O Neal,</hi> and recovered all the Prey
of the Pale, and continued the Purſuit till Sunſet.</p>
                        <p>The Deputy exceeded the reſt as much in Courage as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and behaved himſelf exceeding bravely; and after
the Battle knighted Chief Juſtice <hi>Ailmer, Talbot</hi> of <hi>Malahide,
Fitz-Simons</hi> Mayor of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Michael Curſy</hi> Mayor of
<hi>Drogheda,</hi> in the Field; and well they deſerved it, for their
good Service in obtaining ſo great a Victory, which broke
the Power of the North, and quitted the Borders for ſome
Years; and yet there were not above four hundred of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
ſlain.</p>
                        <p>But whilſt the Deputy was in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter O Connor</hi> and <hi>O Toole</hi>
made Incurſions into the Pale, and though they did much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
yet the Country ſuffered more by unſeaſonable Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the Summer was ſo hot, that even ſome Rivers were
almoſt dried up; and the Autumn was very Sickly and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome;
and the Winter ſo exceſſive cold, that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of Cattle periſhed by reaſon thereof.</p>
                        <p>And now began the Abbots and Priors upon Aſſurance of
Penſions,<note place="margin">Ware, 152.</note> during their reſpective Lives, to ſurrender their
Abbies and other Religious Houſes, to the King; it would be
too tedious to give a Catalogue of all that did ſo; but theſe

                        <p>In the cloſe of the laſt Year,<note place="margin">Ware, 154,</note> it happened that a <hi>Waterford</hi>-Ship,
loaden with one hundred Tun of Wine, was in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from <hi>Portugal</hi> put into <hi>Baltimore;</hi> no ſooner was it heard
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65997:163"/>
of, but <hi>Finil O Driſcol</hi> came on Board, and very kindly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Merchant and Mariners on ſhoar, to refreſh themſelves
at his Houſe, after the Hardſhips they had ſuffered at Sea;
they readily accepted of his Invitation, but met with another
ſort of entertainment than they expected; for contrary to
the Rules of Hoſpitality, he moſt perfidiouſly kept them all
Priſoners, and diſtributed moſt part of the Cargo between
himſelf and his Followers, as he thought fit: But as ſoon as
the Citizens of <hi>Waterford</hi> were inform'd of this Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they mann'd two Sips and a long Boat, and although Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Dobins</hi> did eaſily recover the former Ship, and all the
Goods that were left, which were about the fourth part of
the whole, and all the Priſoners, yet the Citizens of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
were not contented with that, but ſayl'd to <hi>Inisherkin,</hi>
and took <hi>O Driscol</hi>'s Caſtle there, and razed it to the ground,
and deſtroyed the Iſland as much as they could, and thence
they went to <hi>Inchypyle,</hi> which they ſerved in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and at length, after they had deſtroyed <hi>Baltymore,</hi>
and the Country adjacent, they carried away <hi>O Driſcol</hi>'s
beſt Boat, and abundance of Plunder, and returned ſafely to
<hi>Waterford.</hi>

the Bloody Law of the Six Articles, and not long after revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

                           <note place="margin">1540.</note> Lord Juſtice, in whoſe time the Iriſh
Potentates began generally and publickly to own themſelves
Champions of the Papacy, and to aſſume the ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> the better to cloak their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of Robbery and Rebellion;<note place="margin">Ware, 156.</note> for ſome of them (being
of a temper impatient to live as Subjects any longer than
they are diſabled to be Rebels) were glad of any Pretence
that might ſeem to juſtifie their illegal Proceedings; and
therefore many of them confederated together, and eſpecially
<hi>O Neal, O Bryan, O Donel,</hi> and <hi>O Carol,</hi> and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>July</hi> appointed their Rendezvouz all four in <hi>Weſt-Meath,</hi>
in order to invade and plunder the Pale; but the
Lord Juſtice got his ſmall Army together, and was joyned
by two thouſand of the Inhabitants of the Pale, whereof
many were Clergy-men, who very well knew, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was pretended by the Iriſh, yet Plunder and Depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was meant and intended; and therefore they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and active to defend their Country; but as ſoon as the
Rebels had notice of this Preparation (which was counted
great in thoſe days) thoſe holy Champions diſperſed their
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65997:164"/>
Forces into Woods and Faſtneſſes; ſo that this terrible Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
vaniſhed without Blows.</p>
                        <p>But the Lord Juſtice would not be ſo ſatisfied; for he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<hi>O Connor</hi> into <hi>Ophaly,</hi> and made ſeveral of the Faſtneſſes
of that Country paſſable for Carriages, and brought <hi>O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
to that paſs, that he was forced to give his Son <hi>Cnoghor</hi>
for a Hoſtage of his future Behaviour; but not long after,
<hi>viz.</hi> on the 25th of the ſame Month of <hi>July,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>Anthony Saintleger,</hi> Knight of the Garter, Lord Deputy,
was ſworn (as was uſual) in <hi>Chriſt-Church, Dublin,</hi> and
the Form of his Oath is to be found in <hi>Burlace</hi>'s Reduction of
<hi>Ireland, pag.</hi> 106. and <hi>Ware</hi>'s Annals, 157.</p>
                        <p>This Lord Deputy, by the help of <hi>Thomas Walſh,</hi> one of
the Barons of the Exchequer, <hi>John Myn</hi> and <hi>William Caven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,</hi>
two Auditors, well vers'd in the Treaſury, did bring
the publick Revenue into good Order, and more to the King's
advantage than ever it had been before.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe ſome People have written extravagantly,<note place="margin">Preſent State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> 12.</note> That
the Revenue in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's Days, amounted
unto thirty thouſand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and that the Earl of

it will not be inconvenient to give the Reader an Account
both of the publick Expence and Income for one Year, during
<hi>Saintleger</hi>'s Government, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Year 1543.</p>

                        <p>It ſeems the reaſon why they had ſo little Foot was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Lords and Gentlemen of the Country were bound
by their Tenures to aſſiſt the King with a certain number of
Men at every Hoſting, or riſing out (as they call it;) and
as for the Artillery, it was ſo contemptible, that I find by
one of the Letters from the Council at the Camp, that the
Army had but one broken Piece, and therefore they deſire
another may be ſent them.</p>
                        <p>But before we proceed farther in the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it
will be fit to pay that reſpect to the Memory of the late
Lord Deputy (the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>) as to give ſome Account of
his Misfortunes and Deſtiny; He had certainly performed
conſiderable Atchievments in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of him are contained in moſt of the Letters from the
Council to the King; and his Majeſty did ſo well approve of
his good Services, that he Created him Viſcount <hi>Grany;</hi> and
although the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Lord Chancellor <hi>Allen,</hi>
the Vice-Treaſurer <hi>Brabazon,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Travers,</hi> went
with him, or immediately followed him into <hi>England,</hi> to
impeach him, yet he was kindly received by the King, and
and carried the Sword before him on <hi>Whitſunday:</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
he was in a ſhort time after impriſoned in the Tower,
and accuſed of very many Articles; the principal of which
are theſe;</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That <hi>O Connor</hi> feaſted him, and mended <hi>Togher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croghan</hi>
for him; and that in favour of <hi>O Molloy,</hi> a Rebel, he
took a Caſtle from <hi>Dermond O Molloy,</hi> whoſe Father-in-Law
O <hi>Carol</hi> was a good Subject; for which the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> had a
Bribe, and <hi>Stephen ap Harry</hi> had twenty Cows.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That he took the Caſtle of <hi>Bir</hi> from a Loyal O
<hi>Carol,</hi> and gave it to a Rebel <hi>O Carol,</hi> who married the Earl of
<hi>Kildare</hi>'s Daughter, and alſo took <hi>Moderhern,</hi> a Caſtle belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and gave it to the Rebel O <hi>Carol,</hi>
and waſted the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Lands: for which, he had
an hundred and forty Kine, and <hi>Stephen ap Harry</hi> had forty, and
<hi>Girald Mac Gerrot</hi> had a black Hackny.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That he took forty Kine from O <hi>Kenedy,</hi> a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s and his Son for Hoſtage.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, That he held ſecret and private familiar Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and went to viſit him
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65997:165"/>
in his Tents in his Night-Gown, and forced the Abbot of
<hi>Owny</hi> to give him forty Pounds ſterling to preſerve that Abby
from Ruine, and O <hi>Brian</hi> to give him thirty Kine and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages;
&amp; <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick Bourk,</hi> a Baſtard, gave him 100 Marks to have
<hi>Ballimacleere</hi>-Caſtle, and to be made <hi>Mac William;</hi> and
that he carried the Artillery in a ſmall Veſſel to <hi>Galway,</hi>
and made the Town of <hi>Galway</hi> pay thirty four Pounds for
that Carriage.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, That the Exploits at <hi>Bryans</hi> Bridge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in
favour of O <hi>Bryan</hi> a Rebel, <hi>Deſmond</hi>'s Son-in-Law, and to
the prejudice of <hi>Donough</hi> O <hi>Bryan,</hi> a good Subject; and that
he took a Bribe of eighty Kine from <hi>Macnemarra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sixthly, That truſting <hi>Deſmond</hi> and O <hi>Bryan,</hi> he hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King's Army in a long and dangerous Journy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Deſmond</hi> quarrelled, and deſerted him, and O <hi>Bryan</hi> ſent
but one man with a Battle-Ax to guide him.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, That he rifled the Abby of <hi>Ballyclare,</hi> and left
neither Chalice, Croſs nor Bell in it.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, That he deſtroyed the Caſtles of <hi>Lecagh</hi> and
<hi>Derriviclaghny,</hi> in favour of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick Burk,</hi> though the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Proprietor offered Submiſſion and Rent to the King.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, That he had ſecret Conference with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Horſe from O <hi>Connor Roe,</hi> who was the chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in conveying away the young <hi>Fitz-Girald.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Tenthly, That he took eighty Kine from <hi>O Maddin,</hi> and
forced <hi>O Mlaghlin</hi>'s Son from Mr. <hi>Dillon,</hi> whoſe lawful Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
he was; for which he had ſeventy Kine.</p>
                        <p>And there was a Commiſſion ſent to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to examine
Witneſſes; and they ſay that theſe Articles were proved by
the teſtimony of above ſeventy Perſons; whereof ſome were
of Quality, that is, ſome of them ſwore to one Article, and
ſome to another; ſo that the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> (who was Son to
the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and Viſcount <hi>Grany</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
no Peer in <hi>England</hi>) being tried by a common Jury, thought
it his beſt way to confeſs the Indictment, in hopes of the
King's Grace and Pardon; but in that he was miſtaken;
and although his Services did infinitely over-balance his
Faults, yet he was publickly Executed on the twenty eighth
day of <hi>July</hi> 1541.</p>
                        <p>There are four other Articles mentioned by others,<note place="margin">Holingſh. 102.</note> to be

for that purpoſe; and there he renewed his Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
and delivered his Son <hi>Girald</hi> to be Hoſtage of his
Loyalty, and to be bred after the Engliſh manner; and by
Indenture he renounced that fantaſtical Privilege, which he
and his Predeceſſors had for a long time claimed, of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged to appear at the Parliament,<note place="margin">Lib. D.</note> or come within

                           <hi>The Second Covenant is,</hi> To ſubmit all their Controverſies
to the Determination of the Biſhops of <hi>Waterford, Cork</hi> and
<hi>Roſs,</hi> the Mayors of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Youghal,</hi> Suffrain of <hi>Kingſale,

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Third is,</hi> About their future Controverſies, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
by the Earl and the ſaid Biſhops or two of them, <hi>quorum
Deſmond</hi> to be one, and they may fine or amerce Wrong-doers;
of which Fine the King ſhall have one third, and the Judges the
reſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Fourth is,</hi> That if the Caſe be too difficult for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
it ſhall be determined by Juſtices of Aſſize, and
no Force ſhall be uſed nor Peace broken, on Pain of a Fine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Fifth is,</hi> That they ſhall help and defend the Collectors of
the King's Revenue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Sixth is,</hi> To obey the Ordinances made by the Nobility,
and annexed to the Indenture (which probably were the Ordinances
already mentioned).</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Seventh Article is,</hi> That if any of their Followers break
the Peace, they will proſecute and purſue him till he make amends.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And the Eighth is,</hi> That they will not exact any Black Rents
for the future from the Inhabitants of <hi>Cork, Youghal</hi> or <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And it ſeems that about this time Commiſſioners were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in every Province, to decide the Controverſies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Brehons, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Connaught,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Tuam</hi> and
<hi>Clonfert,</hi> and the Captains <hi>Wakely</hi> and <hi>Ovington,</hi> in <hi>Munſter</hi>
the Biſhops of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Waterford,</hi> and the Mayors of <hi>Cork</hi>
and <hi>Youghal,</hi> and in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> and
Lord of <hi>Louth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And it is to be noted,<note place="margin">Davis, 215.</note> That theſe Submiſſions were ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
made, all over the Kingdom, that there was not a
Lord or Chieftain of any note in <hi>Ireland</hi> but ſubmitted in this
or the like Form, for they made no ſcruple to renounce the
Pope, when once they had reſolved to obey the King: And
by theſe Means the Kingdom was ſo quiet, and there was ſo
great a Proſpect of a Settlement, that ſeveral of the Principal
Lords of the Iriſh took Patents for their Eſtates, and deſired
Titles of Honour, according to the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which
hitherto they had deſpiſed: But, alaſs, <hi>Ireland</hi> is an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Country, that cannot be happy any conſiderable time,
and notwithſtanding theſe dawnings of Felicity, it muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65997:170"/>
nothing but War and Deſolation; and this fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Submiſſion of the Iriſh will be as vain and ineffectual as
the other three, and will manifeſt to the World, That that
Kingdom is not to be governed by Kindneſs but by Force:
But let us not anticipate our Miſery by dreadful Prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of War, but rather enquire into the management of
Affairs, during the ſhort interval of Peace.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, we ſhall find the great <hi>O Neal,</hi> in <hi>September,</hi>
ſailing toward <hi>England,</hi> accompanied with the Biſhop of
<hi>Clogher,</hi> and attended with many Gentlemen, his Followers:
He came to the King at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where he was well receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and having ſurrendred his Eſtate to the King and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted,

                              <item>1. To renounce the Name of <hi>O Neal.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. That he he and his Followers ſhould uſe Engliſh Habit,

                              <item>3. That their Children ſhould learn Engliſh.</item>
                              <item>4. That they ſhould build Houſes and husband their Land
in Engliſh manner.</item>
                              <item>5. That they ſhould obey Engliſh Laws, and not Ceſs
their Tenants, nor keep more Gallowglaſſes than the Lord
Deputy allows. And,</item>
                              <item>6. That they ſhould anſwer all general Hoſtings, as thoſe
of the Pale do, and ſhall not ſuccour any of the King's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the firſt of <hi>October,</hi> his Eſtate was regranted to him by
Patent, and he was created Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> for Life, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to his Son <hi>Matthew</hi> (who for the preſent was made
Baron of <hi>Dunganon</hi>) in Tayl, and two of his Followers
(<hi>Denis</hi> and <hi>Art Mac Genis</hi>) were knighted, and the Biſhop
of <hi>Clogher</hi> was confirmed; and the Earl after his return, was
on the ſeventh Day of <hi>May</hi> ſworn one of the Privy Council
of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In like manner the Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> purſuant to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
repaired into <hi>England,</hi> where he was graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and having made his Submiſſion, he returned, with
Orders likewiſe to be of the Privy Council.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Lord Deputy, on the twenty fourth
Day of <hi>May</hi> made an Order of Agreement between the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genis</hi>'s;
and did the like between the <hi>O Carols,</hi> on the ſecond
of <hi>July:</hi> And on the fourth of <hi>July</hi> the <hi>O Birnes</hi> did ſubmit
by Indenture, and granted the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Wicklow</hi>
to the King; and alſo ſurrendred to his Majeſty the Caſtle of
<hi>Mac Eningham,</hi> and all ſpiritual Livings in their Poſſeſſion:<note place="margin">Lib. D.</note>
They alſo covenanted to find one hundred and twenty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowglaſſes
and their Servants for three Months, when the
Counties of <hi>Carlow</hi> and <hi>Kildare</hi> do ſo, and twelve Horſe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65997:171"/>
and twenty four Foot at every Hoſting, and to raiſe their
whole Force, and keep them three days on any emergency:
And it is allowed by the Deputy, that <hi>O Birn</hi> ſhall have
twenty four <hi>Kerns,</hi> called <hi>Kerne Tee,</hi> for this year, at the
Charge of the Country, as is uſual; wherewith he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to aid the Sheriff; and if <hi>O Birn</hi> misbehave himſelf,
the Lord Deputy may give the <hi>Kerns</hi> next year to whom he
pleaſes: And 'tis agreed, That no body ſhall keep Idlers
but in his own Houſe; and concludes, <hi>Quod ſi poſthac ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
Hibernicorum reſilierit, vel cum Hibernicis &amp; aliis ſuſurra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit,
confederaverit, vel conſentierit impedire vel obſtare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formationi
Hiberniae, quam Dominus Rex intendit,</hi> that then
they will forfeit all. And it ſeems, that at the ſame time
they propoſed to have their Country made a County,<note place="margin">Davis, 104.</note> by the
Name of the County of <hi>Wicklow;</hi> and that in conſideration
thereof, they would divide it into eight Plow-Lands, and
pay ten Groats <hi>per annum,</hi> for ever to the King out of each
Plow-Land.</p>
                        <p>On the 19th of <hi>November, Thomas Butler</hi> was made Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
of <hi>Cahir,</hi> and in the beginning of the next year <hi>Maurice
O Bryan,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1534.</note> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick Burk,</hi> induced by the Example and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> went to wait upon the King in
<hi>England,;</hi> and having made their Submiſſions, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
their Eſtates, <hi>O Brian</hi> obtained a Grant of all his
Lands in <hi>Thomond,</hi> and all the Abbies and Patronage of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
in the King's Gift within his Precincts, to him and
his Heirs Males; and he was made Baron of <hi>Inſiquine,</hi> to
him and his Heirs, and Created Earl of <hi>Thomond</hi> for Life,
with a remainder to <hi>Donough O Bryan</hi> and his Heirs for
ever; who, for the preſent was made Baron of <hi>Ibracane,</hi>
(but whether this <hi>Donough</hi> were Nephew or Natural Son
of the Earl's, is not very plain.) This Lord of <hi>Ibrahcan</hi> had
alſo an Annuity of twenty Pounds <hi>per annum</hi> granted to him
in Tail, and the Abby of <hi>Inſula Canonicorum,</hi> and half the
Abby of <hi>Clare;</hi> and the King bore the Earl of <hi>Thomond</hi>'s
Charges, and gave him an Order to be of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick Burk,</hi> he had likewiſe his Charges born, and
was Created Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and his Eſtate was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granted
to him, and the Abbies and Patronage of all Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
within his Precincts: The Cocquets of <hi>Galway</hi> were
excepted in the Patent, but in lieu of them, the Earl had a
Penſion of thirty Pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and the third part of the
Firſt-Fruits, and the Abby of <hi>Via Nova</hi> or <hi>Confert.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And about the ſame time, the Lord of Upper <hi>Oſſory</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a Grant for Fairs and Markets, and the Houſe of the
Friars at <hi>Haghevo,</hi> and the Monaſtery of <hi>Hackmacart,</hi> and to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65997:171"/>
each of theſe four Noblemen,<note place="margin">Davis, 219.</note> 
                           <hi>viz.</hi> the Earls of <hi>Deſmond, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,
Thomond</hi> and <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> the King gave a Houſe and
a Parcel of Land near <hi>Dublin,</hi> to encourage them to make
their Appearance frequently at Court.</p>
                        <p>And it is to be noted,<note place="margin">Council Book of <hi>Ireland,</hi> fol. 73.</note> That many times the chief Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> inſtead of Riſings out and Carriages to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Hoſting, did coſs the Country, or tax it to find ſo much
Mony as would maintain a certain number of men three
Months, and accordingly, in <hi>July</hi> this Year, the Counties of
<hi>Kilkenny, Waterford, Typerary</hi> and <hi>Wexford</hi> were ordered to
levy Maintenance for two hundred and forty <hi>Kerns</hi> for three
Months; which came to no more than two hundred and
four Pounds, thirteen Shillings and four Pence; whereby
one may perceive that the Tax was eaſie enough, but the
Grievance was in the irregular Aſſeſsments, and the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
manner of levying it.</p>
                        <p>The French King, by his Ambaſſador <hi>Theobald de Boys,</hi>
tempted <hi>O Donel</hi> with Offers of Money and Arms, to make
an Inſurrection, but he could do little of himſelf, and it was
too ſoon to ſeduce others, after ſuch ſolemn and formal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
ſo lately made; and ſo that Negotiation had little or
no effect; but in <hi>February</hi> the Lord Deputy was recalled, to
give the King an Account of his Adminiſtration of Affairs in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> and</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>William Brabazon</hi> was ſworn Lord Juſtice in his ſtead;<note place="margin">Ware, 168.</note>
his Patent bears date the twelfth of <hi>October, 35 Hen.</hi> 8. To
this Lord Juſtice new Seals were ſent, becauſe of the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the King's Stile, from LORD, to KING of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and the old Seals were ſent back to <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Lord Juſtice,<note place="margin">1544.</note> by the King's Orders, ſent him ſeven
hundred Men to <hi>Calice,</hi> under the Command of the Captains
<hi>Poer, Finglaſs</hi> and <hi>Skurlock;</hi> they were very ſerviceable to
the King at <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and did much Miſchief to the French;
for being light of foot,<note place="margin">Holingſhead, 103.</note> they would often range twenty or
thirty Mile into the Country, and as they returned, would
burn and ſpoil where-ever they came: They had a pretty
Trick to get a Prey; which was to tie a Bull to a Stake, and
ſet fire about him, and as the Fire ſcorched him, the Bull
would bellow, and thereupon, all the Cattel within hearing,
of him, would flock that way, and ſo were taken. Theſe Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would never give Quarter, and therefore, whenſoever
the Frenchmen took any of them, they gelded them, and
otherwiſe tormented them exceedingly. After the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> a large Frenchman on the other ſide of the
Haven, braved and defied the Engliſh Army; whereupon,
one <hi>Nicholas Walſh</hi> did ſwim over the River, and cut off the
Frenchmans Head, and brought it back over the River in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65997:172"/>
his Mouth; for which bold Action he was bountifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>Anthony Saintleger,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">June 11. 1544.</note> being for his good Services made
Knight of the Garter, returned Lord Deputy, and found the
Kingdom quiet; and he made it his Buſineſs to keep it ſo:
which he effectually accompliſhed, by impriſoning two or
three turbulent People, and by taking Indentures and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages
from thoſe he ſuſpected.</p>
                        <p>And this Lord Deputy knowing it was the only way to
keep the Kingdom in peace,<note place="margin">Lib. D.</note> made it his Buſineſs to break the
Dependencies of the Iriſh, and to that end, upon all Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
to him, he took care that the weaker Party might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the Government for Protection, and that he ſhould
not rely upon, nor be under the Subjection of any other; and
particularly, on the fourteenth of <hi>July,</hi> he made an Award,
or final Order between the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and <hi>O Donel;</hi>
whereby <hi>O Donel</hi> was freed from depending on <hi>O Neal,</hi> any
farther than that he ſtill continued obliged to pay a yearly
Rent of ſixty Beeves to <hi>O Neal,</hi> for the Iſland of <hi>Iniſowen;</hi>
and it ſo hapned that the very next year <hi>O Neal</hi> invaded <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conel,</hi>
becauſe that Rent was not paid; whereupon, there
was another Reference to the Government, and a new Peace
was made between them, <hi>Aug.</hi> 24, 1546. In the mean time,
the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1545.</note> who fled out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was kindly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by King <hi>Henry,</hi> and married his Neece, was by the King
ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to levy an Army, to recover his Inheritance
in <hi>Scotland;</hi> he came to the Deputy at <hi>Kilmainham,</hi> where
he lived, and being effectually recommended by the King,
he was ſo kindly received, and his Buſineſs ſo heartily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that by the middle of <hi>November,</hi> he had raiſed fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Men, under the Command of Sir <hi>John Travers</hi>
Maſter of the Ordnance; to whom the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as many of his own Followers, and was himſelf General
of the Army: They ſet Sail for <hi>Scotland</hi> in twenty eight
Ships; but the Levity of their Confederates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or
the Power of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> diſappointed this Deſign; for
not being able to gain <hi>Dunbritton</hi>-Caſtle, which was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be delivered up to them, and finding a potent Army
ready to encounter them, inſtead of Friends, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to embrace them, and being ſhattered by a violent
Storm, the Iriſh were neceſſitated to return home <hi>re in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the mean time,<note place="margin">Lib. D.</note> on the Nineteenth of <hi>October,</hi> died <hi>

and <hi>O Neal, O Donel, O Dogharty,</hi> and one <hi>Callock,</hi> had made
ſome Overtures to the French King, about aſſiſtance to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
an Inſurrection; and they propoſed to him, to become

he would procure the Pope's Gift of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſend
two thouſand Harquebuſſes, two hundred Light Horſemen,

the Offer ſo conſiderable, that he ſent over <hi>John de Monluck,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> his Ambaſſador to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to learn the
Truth of their Circumſtances, and to certifie the King what
probability there was of Succeſs, if he ſhould engage in that

was a great dark Tower; there the Biſhop found bad Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
and was forced to be contented with Herrings,
and Bisket, and ſuch like Lenten Fare, which was the beſt
the Houſe afforded.</p>
                        <p>The Biſhop had a Months Mind to O <hi>Dogharty</hi>'s Daughter,
which two Engliſh Fryers obſerving, to prevent any Abuſe of

though ſhe was of meaner Quality, this Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Harlot unfortunately met with a ſmall Bottle of choice
Balm, valued at two thouſand Crowns, which was given
to the Biſhop (by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent) when he was
Ambaſſador in <hi>Turky,</hi> ſhe was invited by its Odour to try
its Reliſh, and it ſeems liked it ſo well, that ſhe licked it
all out; whereat the Biſhop grew ſo outragious and loud,
that he diſcovered his Debauchery, frightned the Woman
away, and made ſport for the Iriſhmen and his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                        <p>After this, the Biſhop met with <hi>O Neal,</hi> and the Titular

                  <p>But the <hi>O Birnes</hi> took advantage of the Change of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and hoping that the Infancy of the King would
occaſion Diſturbances in the State, they began to be very
unruly and troubleſome; inſomuch that the Lord Deputy
was neceſſitated to invade their Country; he purſued them
ſo cloſe, that he ſlew their Captain, and drove themſelves
into the Woods and Faſtneſſes: He alſo took two of the
<hi>Fitz-Giralds,</hi> who had formerly been Proſcribed; and now
joyned with <hi>O Toole,</hi> and he brought them and other Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where they were executed.</p>
                  <p>Nor were <hi>Patrick O More</hi> and <hi>Brian O Connor,</hi> leſs forward
than the reſt, but briskly invaded the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and
loaded themſelves with Prey and Plunder; but the Lord
Deputy came ſeaſonably to intercept them, and having killed
two hundred of the Rebels upon the Place, the reſt of them,
with their light-footed Captains, fairly ran away.</p>
                  <p>But the Government of <hi>England</hi> wiſely conſidering the fickle
Inclinations of the Iriſh, and the danger of a general Defection
of that Nation from a Proteſtant King, ſeaſonably provided for
that Kingdom; ſo that <hi>Edward Bellingham,</hi> with the Title of
Captain General brought over ſix hundred Horſe and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Foot, whoſe Pay came to twelve hundred and twenty
ſix Pound <hi>per</hi> Month, <hi>viz</hi> ſeven hundred and ſeventy Pound
for the Horſe, and four hundred fifty ſix Pound for the Foot:
and about Midſummer they landed at <hi>Waterford,</hi> and being
joyned by the Lord Deputy, they invaded the Countries of
<hi>Leix</hi> and <hi>Offaly,</hi> and proclaimed O <hi>More</hi> and O <hi>Connor</hi> Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and having diſperſed the Forces of the Rebels, the
Lord Deputy repaired the Fort of <hi>Dingen,</hi> and built the Fort
of <hi>Campaum alias Prolector</hi> (now called <hi>Maryburgh);</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>O More</hi> and <hi>O connor</hi> were forced to ſubmit, and <hi>Bellin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham</hi>
was knighted and made Marſhal of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Athloan</hi> was likewiſe repaired and garriſoned,
by Special Orders from <hi>England,</hi> and the Vice-Treaſurer
<hi>Brabazon</hi> had the Care and management thereof, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
it effectually, in ſpight of the great Oppoſition he
met with from <hi>Dominick O Kelly</hi> and other Great Men of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught:</hi>
And this auſpicious Year did alſo produce the mighty

But as the Reformation proceeded in <hi>England,</hi>

Zeal and Superſtition increaſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ware, 180.</note>and the Pale it
ſelf began to be diſturbed with it, for <hi>Richard Fitz-Euſtace</hi>
and <hi>Alexander</hi> his Brother, Sons of the Viſcount <hi>Baltinglaſs,</hi>
were buſie forming a Rebellion in the County of <hi>Kildare;</hi>
but the Preſence of the Lord Deputy (without Blows)
brought them to a Submiſſiom, and ſtifled this Infant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
in the Cradle; and it was well it did; for this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Diſtemper was very infectious, and in a little time
would have ſpread over the whole Kingdom; the Lord of
<hi>Baltinglaſs</hi> himſelf was a little tainted with it, but by the
means of Sir <hi>Edward Bellingham</hi> (when Lord Deputy) the
Viſcount was pardoned.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Lord Deputy (<hi>Saintleger</hi>) was ſent
for to <hi>England;</hi> and carried with him <hi>O More</hi> and <hi>O Connor,</hi>
as Priſoners; but upon their Submiſſion they were received
into Favour, and honoured with a Penſion of one hundred
Pound <hi>per annum</hi> out of the Exchequer, during their Lives,
which <hi>O More</hi> enjoyed not very long, for he died within the
Year, ſuddainly, at <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Bellingham,</hi> who had been ſent into <hi>England,</hi>
with an Account of the Submiſſion of the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi>
was now ſent back Lord Deputy; he landed at <hi>Dalkye</hi> on
<hi>Whitſon</hi>-Eve, and two Days after he received the Sword at
<hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> according to Cuſtom: He was a Zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
and a brave Soldier; and by his means Sir <hi>John Allen</hi>
was again made Lord Chancellor.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he was ſetled,<note place="margin">Davis, 62.</note> he marched into <hi>Leix</hi> and <hi>Offaly</hi>
againſt <hi>Cahir O Connor</hi> and others, that were brewing new
Treaſons there, and forced them to ſubmit; and brought the
Country to that degree of Subjection, that he is ſaid to be the
firſt Man ſince <hi>Edward</hi> the third's time that enlarged the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Borders beyond the Pale; and from <hi>Offaly</hi> the Lord Deputy
marched to <hi>Delvin,</hi> againſt <hi>Mac Coughlan,</hi> whoſe Country
he totally deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Deputy had expreſs Orders to ſet up a Mint at
<hi>Dublin,</hi> which he did, but it continued but a very little time
for want of Bullion. And this Year, on the twenty ſecond Day
of <hi>April</hi> the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> (which at firſt was governed by
a Provoſt, and by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third ſubjected to a Mayor
and Bayliffs, and by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was honoured with a
Sword) obtained their Bayliffs to be changed into <hi>Sheriffs,</hi>
and <hi>John Rians</hi> and <hi>Robert Eyons</hi> were the firſt two Sheriffs
that were choſen or appointed for that City.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Sir <hi>Francis Bryan</hi> who had married the
Counteſs Dowager of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and was made Marſhal of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and Governour of the Counties of <hi>Typerary</hi> and <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:65997:175"/>
could by no means agree with the Lord Deputy; their
Differences grew at length to that height, that Sir <hi>Francis</hi>
impeached the Lord Deputy in <hi>England,</hi> and prevailed to
have him ſent for, to anſwer the Accuſation.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt that affair was tranſacting,<note place="margin">Ware, 182.</note> 
                     <hi>Teige O Carol</hi> plyed
his own Buſineſs diligently, and after a ſtout Defence, he
took and demoliſhed the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Nenagh,</hi> and drove

                  <p>In <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster, Manus O Donel</hi> quarrelled with his Son <hi>Calvagh,</hi>
and at length it came to Blows; ſo that on the ſeventh Day
of <hi>February, Calvagh</hi> was routed, and <hi>Manus, Mac Donough O

                  <p>In the <hi>Lower Delvin, Teige Mac Mlaghlin</hi> and <hi>Edmond Fahy,</hi>
with their united Forces, did all the Miſchief they could,

                  </p>
                  <p>On the eighteenth of <hi>November, Cormock Roe O Connor,</hi>
who was proclaimed Traytor, came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and with
Tears in his Eyes begged Pardon of the Lord Deputy and

                  <p>It is worthy Obſervation,<note place="margin">Holingſh. 109.</note> That though the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi>
for his Quality and vaſt Eſtate was made Lord High Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
yet he was not of the Privy Council, nor indeed qualified
to be ſo, for he was Rude and Savage both in Apparel and
Behaviour; he had neither Learning nor Manners, but lived
after a barbarous faſhion in the Country, among the Wild-Iriſh,
and perhaps had not ſo much as a Glaſs-Window to his
Houſes, and yet he was the beſt landed Subject in the King's
Dominions. About <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> the Deputy ſent for him to <hi>Dublin,</hi>
but he refuſing, the Lord Deputy himſelf, with about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Horſe, made that haſte to <hi>Munſter,</hi> that he took the Earl
ſitting by the Fire in his own Houſe, not at all ſuſpecting
that Expedition: And it was well for him that he was ſo
ſurprized, for he was not only brought to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in his Duty to his Prince, and in good Manners and
Civility towards his Fellow-Subjects, but was alſo (by the
Lord Deputy's means) pardoned and reſtored to the King's
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:65997:176"/>
Favour, ſo that he continued a good Subject ever afterwards
during his Life; and was ſo grateful to his Benefactor the

                  <p>
                     <hi>EDWARD, by the Grace of God,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas our
Gracious Father, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, of happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
taking into conſideration the bondage and heavy yoke that
his true and faithful Subjects ſuſtained under the Juriſdiction of
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo the Ignorance the Commonalty
were in, how ſeveral fabulous Stories and lying Wonders miſled
our Subjects in both our Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby the Means thereof into their hands, alſo diſpenſing
with the Sins of our Nations by their Indulgences and Pardons
for Gain, purpoſely to cheriſh all ill Vices, as Robberies, Rebellions,
Thefts, Whoredoms, Blaſphemy, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He our Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Father King <hi>Henry</hi> of happy Memory, hereupon diſſolved all
Priories, Monaſteries, Abbies, and other pretended Religious
Houſes, as being but Nurſeries for Vice and Luxury, more than
for Sacred Learning; Therefore, that it might more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the World, that thoſe Orders had kept the Light of the
Goſpel from his People, he thought it moſt fit and convenient, for
the preſervation of their Souls and Bodies, that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſhould be Tranſlated, Printed and Placed in all Pariſh-Churches
within his Dominions, for his faithful Subjects, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65997:177"/>
their Knowledge of God and of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.
We therefore, for the general Benefit of our well beloved Subjects
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, whenever aſſembled or met together in the ſaid
ſeveral Pariſh-Churches, either to Pray or hear Prayers read,
that they may the better joyn therein in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Hearts and Voice,
have cauſed the Liturgy and Prayers of the Church to be Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into our Mother-Tongue of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Aſſembly of Divines lately met within the ſame for
that purpoſe. We therefore Will and Command, as alſo Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
you, Sir <hi>Anthony Saint-Leger,</hi> Knight, our Vice-Roy of
that our Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to give ſpecial Notice to all our
Clergy, as well Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Arch-Deacons,
as others our Secular Pariſh-Prieſts within that our ſaid King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to perfect, execute and obey this our Royal Will
and Pleaſure accordingly.</p>
                  <p>But before Proclamations were iſſued out, Sir <hi>Anthony
Saint-Leger,</hi> upon receipt of this Order, call'd an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Archbiſhops and Biſhops, together with the
then Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which Aſſembly he ſignified
to them, as well his Majeſties Order aforeſaid, as alſo the
Opinions of thoſe Biſhops and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> who had
adhered unto the Order, ſaying, That <hi>it was his Majeſties
Will and Pleaſure, conſenting unto their ſerious Conſiderations
and Opinions, then acted and agreed on in</hi> England, <hi>as to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Matters, that the ſame be in</hi> Ireland <hi>ſo likewiſe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
and performed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Anthony Saint-Leger</hi> having ſpoken to this effect, <hi>George
Dowdal,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>George Cromer</hi> in the Primacy of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi>
ſtood up, and (through his Romiſh Zeal to the
Pope) laboured with all his power and force to oppoſe the
Liturgy of the Church, that it might not be read or ſung in
the Church; ſaying, <hi>Then ſhall every illiterate Fellow read
Service</hi> (or <hi>Maſs</hi>) as he in thoſe Days termed the Word
<hi>Service.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To this Saying of the Archbiſhop's, Sir</hi> Anthony <hi>replied,</hi>
No, your Grace is miſtaken; for we have too many illiterate
Prieſts amongſt us already, who neither can pronounce the Latin,
nor know what it means, no more than the Common People that
hear them; but when the People hear the Liturgy in Engliſh,
they and the Prieſt will then underſtand what they pray for.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Reply, <hi>George Dowdal</hi> bid Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> beware
of the Clergy's Curſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Anthony <hi>made Anſwer,</hi> I fear no ſtrange Curſe, ſo long
as I have the Bleſſing of that Church which I believe to be the true
one.</p>

                     <hi>The Archbiſhop again ſaid,</hi> Can there be a truer Church than
the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Mother Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Anthony <hi>return'd this Anſwer,</hi> I thought we had all been
of the Church of Chriſt; for he calls all true Believers in him,
his Church, and himſelf the Head thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Archbiſhop replied,</hi> And is not St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Church the
Church of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Anthony <hi>return'd this Anſwer,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a Memher
of Chriſt's Church; but the Church was not St. <hi>Peter's,</hi> neither
was St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Head thereof.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>George Dowdal</hi> the Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> roſe up, and
ſeveral of the Suffragan Biſhops under his Juriſdiction, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only <hi>Edward Staples,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> who tarried
with the reſt of the Clergy, then aſſembled on the Kalends
of <hi>March,</hi> 1550.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Anthony <hi>then took up the Order, and held it forth to</hi>
George Brown <hi>Archbiſhop of</hi> Dublin; <hi>who (ſtanding up)
received it; ſaying,</hi> This Order, good Brethren, is from our
Gracious King, and from the reſt of our Brethren, the Fathers
and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> who have conſulted herein, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Holy Scriptures with what they have done; unto whom I
ſubmit, as <hi>Jeſus</hi> did to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in all things juſt and lawful,
making no queſtion why or wherefore? as we own him our true and

                  <p>And it ſeems that on <hi>Eaſter-Sunday,</hi> the Liturgy in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh

the Lord Deputy were not zealous in propagating the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,

on the twentieth day of <hi>October,</hi> deprived him of the
Title of <hi>Primate of all</hi> Ireland, and annexed it to the See of

But upon the Lord Deputy's Return to <hi>Dublin, Matthew,</hi>
Baron of <hi>Dungannon,</hi> complained to him againſt his Father,
the Earl of <hi>Tyrone;</hi> whereupon that Earl was impriſoned,
which enraged his other Sons to that degree, that they burnt
and deſtroyed that part of the Country which belonged to
<hi>Matthew:</hi> On the other ſide, the Baron, being aſſiſted by

it came to a Battel, which was doubtful for ſome time, but
ended in the Defeat of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the Slaughter of two
hundred of his Soldiers Engliſh and Iriſh.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> remain'd confin'd to ſtay

Hoſtages in <hi>February,</hi> and returned to <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Year 1552,<note place="margin">1552.</note> was propitious to the Noble Family of
the <hi>Giraldines;</hi> for <hi>Girald,</hi> Son of the laſt Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi>
whoſe miraculous Preſervation hath been already mention'd,
was now received into Favour, and on the twenty fifth of
<hi>April</hi> was reſtored to <hi>Minooth,</hi> and good part of his Eſtate;
and about two years after, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> viz.
on the thirteenth of <hi>May,</hi> 1554. he was Created Earl of
<hi>Kildare,</hi>

                  <p>But <hi>Donough</hi> Earl of <hi>Thomond,</hi> who had that Title con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to him and his Heirs Males, in <hi>January</hi> laſt, had great
Conteſts with his Unkle <hi>Daniel,</hi> who claimed the Eſtate by
Taniſtry; but at length, by the Mediation of the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,
they came to an Agreement; which is mentioned in
an Indenture Tripartite between the Deputy, the Earl, and
<hi>Daniel O Bryan,</hi> Dated <hi>May</hi> 9, 1552.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, Sir <hi>Nicholas Bagnal</hi> was ſent againſt
<hi>Hugh Mac Morough,</hi> and they came to a Battel, which was
ſo well fought on both ſides, that the Loſs as well as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
is uncertain; But the Garriſon of <hi>Athloan</hi> had better
Succeſs at <hi>Cluan macnoiſe,</hi> where they robbed or deſtroyed all
they met with, not ſparing even the Church-Books.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Depury marched to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and repaired and
garriſon'd the Caſtle of <hi>Belfaſt;</hi> but it ſeems he brought but
a ſmall Army, in expectation that the Baron of <hi>Dungannon</hi>
would joyn him with his Forces; and indeed the Baron de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
it, and endeavoured it; but his Brother <hi>Shane O Neal</hi>
ſurprized his Camp by night, and routed his Army with a
great Slaughter: Whereupon, the Lord Deputy returned
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65997:179"/>
to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and intended for <hi>England;</hi> but he was ſtopped
for a while, by Sir <hi>Henry Knolls,</hi> whom the King ſent over
with Intelligence, that the Queen of Scots had ſent <hi>O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>'s

as it was underſtood that his Negotiation was ineffectal,
the Lord Deputy proſecuted his former Reſolution, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
at <hi>Houth</hi> on the fourth of <hi>December,</hi> and purſuant to
the King's Letter of the ſeventh of <hi>November,</hi>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Cuſack,</hi> Lord Chancellor, and Sir <hi>Girald

                     <hi>Hugh Mac Neal Oge</hi> of <hi>Clandeboy,</hi> made his Submiſſion to
the Lords Juſtices (or rather to the King) and ſwore
Allegiance, and Agreed and Covenanted by Indenture,
to forfeit all if he ever relapſed or apoſtatized again:
Whereupon, the King granted to him the Abby of <hi>Carrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus,</hi>
and Liberty to keep three Secular Prieſts, as alſo
the Caſtle of <hi>Belfaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ireland</hi> was unhappy, not only by the Civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions
in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> between the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and his

that a Kilderkin of Wheat was ſold for four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhillings, which in the following year was ſold for five
ſhillings; but alſo by the Death of Sir <hi>William Brabazon,</hi>
who died in <hi>July,</hi> and was one of the moſt faithful men
to the Engliſh Intereſt, that had appeared in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
from the Conqueſt to that day.</p>
                  <p>The King was adviſed to lower the Value of Braſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and to make the Bell-Groat currant at two pence and
no more, and alſo to build a Caſtle at <hi>Baltimore,</hi> to oblige
the Fiſhermen to pay Tribute; the former he performed, but
the later as unpracticable, was neglected or poſtponed.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Thomond,</hi> and his Unkles <hi>Donald</hi> and <hi>Trelagh,</hi>

notwithſtanding King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Will, and
all the Endeavours that were uſed againſt
her, did ſucceed her Brother in the
Throne; and although ſhe was Kept out
of Poſſeſſion by the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> about
twelve Days, ſo that ſhe was not proclaimed at <hi>London</hi> until

                  <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, That the Proteſtants did ſo eaſily
ſubmit to her; or that the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould at all
own her for their Queen: Becauſe,</p>
                  <p>I. She was the Iſſue of an Inceſtuous Marriage, ſo directly
againſt the Law of God, that no Power on Earth could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with it:<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Hiſt. Reform. 131.</note> And that Marriage was judicially nulled and

II. Becauſe the Crown was entailed upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
by Name, by the Iriſh Statute of 28 <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 2. as hath
been already obſerved, and that Statute was not repealed in
<hi>Ireland</hi> to that time.</p>
                  <p>It would be a lame Anſwer to the firſt Objection, to inſiſt
upon the Engliſh Statute of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which gave that King
Power to diſpoſe of the Crown by his Will; for beſides what
ſome will alledg againſt Bills of Excluſion in general, every
Body will oppoſe that wild and unjuſt Method of Excluſion,
that has no regard to the Faults of the Party rejected, nor to
the Merits of the Perſon to be advanced; but Expoſes the
Right of an Innocent to the Figary of an humerſom Man:
Moreover, it is a high Point to delegate the Legiſlative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in an Inſtance of that Importance; and if allowed, would
at once deſtroy all hereditary Right.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary therefore, that we have recourſe to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more ſolid, and which really was the true Reaſon;
and it was this, That <hi>Mary</hi> having gained Poſſeſſion of the
Throne in a Hurry, by the Surprize and Confuſion of the
People in general, the Eaſineſs and Credulity of the Suffolk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in particular, and the Envy ſome bore to the Duke
of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the Malice others entertained againſt the Duke
of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Proteſtants did believe themſelves
obliged by the Laws of God and Man to obey the Queen, <hi>de
facto,</hi> and to acquieſce in the Government that was actually
over them; and therefore the Clergy, and the beſt and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of the Proteſtant Party, choſe rather to be Refugees, and
beg their Bread abroad, than to be mutinous and diſloyal at
Home.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be doubted, but that they did conſult and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examine both the Laws of God and the Laws of the Land
in that Particular, and found by both Sanctions, that it was
not the Duty of the Subject to diſpute the Title of the Prince
in Poſſeſſion; this were to make the Rabble Judges of the
Rights of Princes, and to erect a Judicature above the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Power, and to introduce an Appeal from the Parliament
to the People.</p>
                  <p>As to the Firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Law of God, nothing was more
plain, than that a Chriſtian peaceable Temper was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in General, and a Submiſſion to the King, <hi>de facto,</hi> in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
and the Reaſon is, Becauſe <hi>the Power that is, is of
God,</hi> for <hi>Caeſar</hi> had no Right, eſpecially over the Jewiſh State,
but both <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> were Uſurpers, and yet it
was to them that our Saviour and the Apoſtles preached Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and commanded us, <hi>To render the things that were
Caeſars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:65997:181"/>
And as to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> The Law of the Land, it has
no regard to any other than the King <hi>de facto,</hi> it is he that is
only King within the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
it is he only that by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> can grant
Pardons, Call and Diſſolve Parliaments, and Confirm their
Acts: In a Word, It is he only that can do all Acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and he is the Perſon who can and ought to give
<hi>Protection</hi> to the Subjects, and conſequently is to have Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
from them; the King, <hi>de facto,</hi> can puniſh Treaſons
committed againſt his Predeceſſor and his Rightful Succeſſor
may puniſh Treaſons done againſt him; and the Reaſon is,
Becauſe it is the ſame continuation of the Regal Government,
and the Perſon is not regarded in Law any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> longer than it is
cloathed with the Politick Capacity.</p>
                  <p>For the Relation that is between King and Subject, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Allegiance, is reciprocal, and the Obligation is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
as it is betwixt Husband and Wife; and therefore
whenſoever a King totally ceaſeth the Exerciſe of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Office, he is dead in his Politick Capacity, with which
the Relation is, and the Subject is at Liberty, <hi>ad alia vota
convolanda,</hi> to the Succeſſor; and whether this happens by
Force or Conſent, is no more to the purpoſe, than it is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Man's firſt Wife was murdered or dyed of a Fever.</p>
                  <p>So that it is Plain, That Poſſeſſion of the Throne, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the two Houſes of Parliament, does give a Right, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Subject, and therefore the Words, <hi>King de jure,</hi> are
but terms of Art, as <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> among the Logicians, to
ſignifie an Imaginary Notion they had no other name for;
and if this were not ſo, there could be no Peace upon Earth,
ſince there is not a Crown in <hi>Europe</hi> to which there are not
ſeveral plauſible Pretenders, whoſe Claims have many warm
and furious Abettors; and perhaps it would be very difficult
for any man to define what Preſcription is ſufficient to give
more Title to a Throne than is gained by the quiet Poſſeſſion
thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh hath been already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
wherein the Judges reſolved, That the Poſſeſſion of
the Crown, and of the Regal Government, cleared him of
all Incapacities, Defects and Attainders whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary to add, That the Preſervation of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is the End and Deſign of all Laws; and that the greateſt
Soleciſm that can be in the OEconomy of a Kingdom, is to
ſuſpend the Government, though but for a Moment: And in
Truth, the whole Society would periſh by a very ſhort Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
<hi>wherein every Man might do what ſeems good in his own
Eyes:</hi> It is for this Reaſon there is no <hi>interregnum</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And therefore there always is a King, to whom the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65997:182"/>
Engliſh Subject owes Allegiance excluſively of all others;
and that can be no other than the King <hi>de facto,</hi> who is truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Law with the executive Power thereof, and who
alone doth or can give the People actual Protection.</p>
                  <p>If it were needful this might be farther urged, becauſe
every Man is repreſented in Parliament, and their Act is the
Act of every individual Perſon; and it is beyond controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
That every one is obliged to obey the Authority himſelf
has owned and conſented to.</p>
                  <p>And as to the ſecond Objection, it is eaſily anſwered, That
<hi>Ireland</hi> is a ſubordinate Kingdom to <hi>England</hi> and part of its
Dominions; and therefore whoever is King of <hi>England,</hi> is,
<hi>ipſo facto,</hi> King of <hi>Ireland</hi> as much as of the Iſle of <hi>Sheppy,</hi>
or of the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> and it was ſo at Common Law, and
it is explained to be ſo by the Iriſh Statute of 28 <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 1.
wherein it is enacted, That the King and his Succeſſors <hi>Kings
of England,</hi> ſhall be Kings of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that Kingdom,
is by the ſame Act united and knit to the Imperial Crown of
<hi>England:</hi> And therefore it follows, That <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to ſuch diſpoſal of the Crown as is made in <hi>England,</hi> and
ſo the Engliſh Statute of 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. was in effect a Repeal of
the Iriſh Statute of 28 <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 2. as it was actually a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of the Engliſh Statute of the ſame tenor and effect. But to
proceed.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Cuſak</hi> Lord Chancellor and <hi>Girald Aylmer</hi> Lord
Chief Juſtice, continued Lords Juſtices; and to them the
Council of <hi>England,</hi> on the twentieth Day of <hi>July</hi> ſent an
account of the Succeſſion of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> together with a
Proclamation, wherein ſhe was ſtiled <hi>Supreme Head of the
Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1553.</note> which was read in <hi>Dublin</hi> and other Cities and
Towns of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as is uſual; and Orders were ſoon after
ſent to continue all Officers in their Places; and another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
To give Liberty of the Maſs to all that would,
was likewiſe ſent over; and afterwards the Queen was
crowned by <hi>Gardiner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ware, 204.</note> on the firſt day
of <hi>October;</hi> and ſhe gave a General Pardon to both her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>O Connor</hi> and his Complices were buſie
about the Invaſion of <hi>Offaly,</hi> but by the Prudence of the Lords
Juſtices they were eaſily ſuppreſſed.<note place="margin">September.</note> Nor had <hi>O Neal</hi> better
Succeſs in the County of <hi>Lowth,</hi> for though he did abundance
of Miſchief there, yet the Lords Juſtices (with the Militia of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſuch others as they could on a ſuddain ſcrape to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
gave him a great Defeat near <hi>Dundalk,</hi> where he loſt
many of his Men. And on the eleventh of <hi>November</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Anthony Saintleger,</hi> Lord Deputy arrived at <hi>Dalkye;</hi>

<hi>Staples</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> was for that reaſon deprived,

                  <p>In <hi>November</hi> came over <hi>Girald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> who was

Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat:</hi> This <hi>Fitz-Patrick</hi> is famous for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
loving and being beloved of King <hi>Edward</hi> the

was created Baron of <hi>Balian</hi> for Life, and after his
Death, his Brother <hi>Dermond</hi> had the ſame Title.</p>
                  <p>The Queen ordered that the Army ſhould be reduced to
five hundred; but that was not thought reaſonable in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
However, to comply as far as they could with her
Majeſties Orders, they did reduce the Army to ſix hundred
Foot, and four hundred and ſixty Horſe, and a few Kerns;
but were forced in a ſhort time afterward to raiſe more,
and to ſend for freſh Supplies out of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <hi>Daniel O Bryan</hi> (claiming by Taniſtry)

But the Iriſh Hiſtorian, Mr. <hi>Sullevan,</hi> gives a very different
Account of this Matter, and tells us, That the Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Fitton,</hi> got <hi>Daniel O Bryan</hi> into <hi>Limerick,</hi> upon his
Oath, that he would give him free and ſafe egreſs out of the

the wrong Gate, (ſo that there was the River of <hi>Shenin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and his Army, which was incamped in <hi>Thomond</hi>)
and immediately ſent the young Earl to take poſſeſſion of the
Country, which he did; and <hi>Daniel</hi> (who was ſo brave a
man, that many of the old and new Iriſh courted him to be
King of <hi>Ireland</hi>) was forced to lie that tempeſtuous Night in
a Cabbin; but when (according to the Iriſh faſhion) he
thought to lead his Horſe to ſtable in the ſame Houſe with
himſelf, the proud Beaſt ſcorned to ſtoop, until the Foot-boy
whiſpered the Horſe in the Ear, and told him that his
Maſter <hi>O Bryan</hi> would lodge that Night in that Cabbin,<note place="margin">Sullevan, 80.</note> and
deſired that he would lower his Creſt and his Crupper, and
creep into the Houſe to keep his Maſter company: (<hi>ut tu

whiſpered him once more, that his Maſter <hi>O Bryan,</hi> who fed

                  <p>It is ſaid, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> agreed to pay two thouſand

                  <p>The Year 1555,<note place="margin">1555.</note> began with the Reſtoration of St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>'s

back his Auxiliary Scots. Another Party of the Scots kill'd <hi>Hugh

                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>May</hi> the <hi>Cavenaughs</hi> and their Complices invaded the

there, to puniſh and repreſs all Hereticks and Lollards, and

                  <p>On the firſt Day of <hi>July</hi> the Lord Deputy marched to <hi>

having left Neceſſaries at <hi>Knockfergus,</hi> and <hi>Stanly</hi> the Marſhal
Governour of <hi>

                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Shane O Neal</hi> came to the Lord Deputy to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainham,</hi>
upon a Promiſe of Protection, and made his humble
Submiſſion: But ſince that time frequent Experience has
convinced the Government, That <hi>Protections</hi> have always
proved diſadvantagious to the State, and that lenity to the
Iriſh Rebels has produced no other Effects, than that it has
encouraged them to relapſe, and others to follow their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
And of this <hi>Shane O Neal</hi> affords us one Inſtance, for
notwithſtanding this Submiſſion, it was not long before he
rebelled again; and <hi>Rory O Connor</hi> and <hi>Donough O Connor</hi>
followed the ſame Copy, for though they ſubmitted at <hi>Dingen,</hi>
and put in Hoſtages for their Loyalty, yet they rebelled
once more, and therefore were on the twenty fifth Day of
<hi>February</hi> proclaimed Traytors, and at length were ſlain, and
their Country waſted:<note place="margin">1557.</note> In like manner <hi>William Odare O Carol</hi>
was made Governour of <hi>Ely O Carol</hi> under certain Conditions,
one of which was, To ſend a certain number of Soldiers to

every Hoſting; but this Condeſcention and Kindneſs could
not oblige him, but that the ungrateful Traytor rebelled next
Year and was routed, and <hi>Thady O Carol</hi> was put in his Place.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, we are come to the Parliament, which began the

the Lord Deputy (who by the Death of his Father was Earl

and not returning before the firſt day of <hi>March,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>It ſeems, that beſides the Statutes that are in Print, this

                     <item>6. That the Grants made by Archbiſhop <hi>Brown</hi> be void;

                  <p>But afterwards, by the Act of the ſecond of <hi>Elizabeth, cap.</hi>
1. the Act of Repeal was repealed, and the revived Statutes
againſt Hereſie were ſuppreſſed, the Juriſdiction of the Pope
was aboliſhed; and (<hi>cap.</hi> 3.) the Firſt-Fruits and twentieth

                  <p>There was alſo an Act, to give the Queen a Subſidy of
thirteen Shillings and four Pence out of every Plow-land, for
ten Years: And another to make it Treaſon to introduce or

                  <p>The printed Acts of this Parliament are,

                        <item>I. For the Diſpoſition of <hi>Leix</hi> and <hi>Offaly.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>II. For making the King's County and Queens County

                        <item>IV. To explain <hi>Poynings</hi> Act, that new Bills whilſt the

                  </p>
                  <p>And it is to be noted, That this Act, which was deſigned
to ſpare Corn, and prevent a Dearth, was neceſſary at that
time: Yet now the Kingdom is better improved, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
abounds in Corn, this Act (though not repealed)
is become obſolete, and a quite contrary Act, <hi>viz.</hi> To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Making and Exportation of <hi>Aquavitae</hi> would tend

Summons to the Caſtle of <hi>Melik,</hi> but the valiant Warders not
only boaſted how ſtoutly they would defend it; but alſo
believing, that every Summons was an Affront, and as it
were a Suſpicion of their Courage, they aſſured the Herald,
That it ſhould not be ſafe for him to come with any more
ſuch Meſſages to them: It is hardly credible, That after all
this Oſtentation, theſe Men of War ſhould deſert the Caſtle
the very next Night; however, they certainly did ſo, and
the Lord Deputy placed a Garriſon in it, and returned.</p>
                  <p>On the tenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Lord Deputy advanced into

Numbers, and deſpiſing the Weakneſs of their Adverſaries,
had made no preparation to reſiſt an Aſſault which they did
not ſuſpect, and wanting ſuch Scouts, Out-guards and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels,

                  <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> having dealt ſeverely with the Proteſtants in
<hi>England,</hi> about the latter end of her Reign ſigned a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for to take the ſame Courſe with them in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and
to execute the ſame with greater Force, ſhe nominates Dr. <hi>Cole</hi>
one of the Commiſſioners: Sending the Commiſſion by this
Doctor, who in his Journey coming to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the Mayor
of that City hearing that her Majeſty was ſending a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and he being a Church-Man, waited on the
Doctor, who in diſcourſe with the Mayor taketh out of a
Cloak-Bag a Leather-Box, ſaying unto him, Here is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
that ſhall laſh the Hereticks of <hi>Ireland</hi> (calling the
Proteſtants by that Title): the good Woman of the Houſe
being well affected to the Proteſtant Religion, and alſo hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Brother named <hi>John Edmunds</hi> of the ſame, then a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> was much troubled at the Doctor's Words;
but watching her convenient time, whilſt the Mayor took his
Leave, and the Doctor complementing him down the Stairs,
ſhe opens the Box and takes the Commiſſion out, placing in
lieu thereof a Sheet of Paper with a Pack of Cards, the Knave
of Clubs faced uppermoſt wrap up: The Doctor coming
up to his Chamber, ſuſpecting nothing of what had been
done, put up the Box as formely. The next day going to
the Water-ſide, Wind and Weather ſerving him, he ſails
towards <hi>Ireland,</hi> and landed on the ſeventh of <hi>October,</hi> 1558.
at <hi>Dublin;</hi> then coming to the Caſtle, the Lord <hi>Fitz-Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
being Lord Deputy, ſent for him to come before him
and the Privy Council; who coming in, after he had made
a Speech, relating upon what account he came over, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
the Box unto the Lord Deputy; who cauſing it to be
opened, that the Secretary might read the Commiſſion, there
was nothing ſave a Pack of Cards, with the Knave of Clubs
uppermoſt; which not only ſtartled the Lord Deputy and
Council, but the Doctor, who aſſured them, He had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
but knew not how it was gone: Then the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
made anſwer, Let us have another Commiſſion, and
we will ſhuffle the Cards in the mean while. The Doctor
being troubled in Mind went his way, and returned into
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65997:187"/>
                     <hi>England,</hi> and coming to the Court obtained another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
but ſtaying for a Wind at the Water-ſide, News
came unto him, That the Queen was dead: And thus God
preſerved the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                  <p>This Queen died on the ſeventeenth day of <hi>November,</hi> 1558.
And it is obſervable, That though ſhe was a very zealous
Papiſt, yet the Iriſh were not quieter during her Reign, than
they were under her Brother; but on the contrary, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
againſt Engliſhmen and Government induced them
to be as troubleſome then as at other times, and prevailed
with Mr. <hi>Sullevan</hi> to give this ſevere Character of her Reign,<note place="margin">Sullevan. cath. hist. 81.</note>
That although the Queen was zealous to propagate the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

and abuſe the Iriſh: <hi>Quae tametſi catholicam Religionem tueri

1558. and in the five and twentieth
year of her Age, the Parliament (who were
all Papiſts) then ſitting, ſhe was by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent immediately Proclaimed Queen.</p>
                  <p>And though <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could not be both legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
no more than their Father could have two Wives at
once; for if the firſt Marriage and Diſpenſation were not
good, then was Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſpurious; and if they were
valid, then was <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Iſſue of an adulterous Bed;
yet, by a rare Example of Fortune, they both enjoyed Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively

                  <p>But the true Reaſon was, becauſe they believed <hi>Elizabeth</hi>

                  <p>Nevertheleſs, it muſt be confeſſed, That the Stateſmen of
that time, whoſe Intereſts and Deſigns were Popiſh, were
much overſeen, and did not build their Conjectures upon
Reaſons that were any thing ſolid; for it was <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
greateſt Intereſt to regard her own Legitimacy; and it was
notorious, that by marrying King <hi>Philip,</hi> her Siſter's Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
ſhe muſt juſtifie by her own example, the Marriage of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth with his Brothers Wife; and by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

allow his Diſpenſation for the Marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth

to <hi>Con O Neal,</hi> with Remainder to his Son <hi>Matthew,</hi>
whom, for the preſent he made Baron of <hi>Dungannon,</hi> as hath

the Son of a Smith of Dundalk (as inded he had been repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

murthered his Brother <hi>Matthew,</hi> and impriſoned his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who thereupon died with grief, he ſet up for himſelf,
and broke out into Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Deputy marched to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> to fortifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Engliſh Pale, and ſent for <hi>Shane O Neal</hi> (who lay
at a Houſe of his ſix Mile from <hi>Dundalk</hi>) to come to him
thither; but <hi>Shane</hi> deſired to be excuſed, and prayed that
the Lord Deputy would be pleas'd to be his Goſſip, and that
then he would come and do all that ſhould be requiſite for
her Majeſties Service; and though this ſeem'd diſhonourable,
that the Deputy ſhould be Goſſip to a Rebel before Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet the neceſſity of the Queens Affairs required it, and
therefore he conſented, and on the laſt day of <hi>January</hi> he
and <hi>James Wingfield</hi> Chriſtned the Child.</p>
                  <p>After the Solemnity was over, the Deputy expoſtulated

he had but an Eſtate for Life in his Principality, nor

there was no Inquiſition taken before they were paſs'd,
nor could there be any Inquiſition till <hi>Tyrone</hi> were made
Shire-ground; That he was elected <hi>O Neal</hi> by the Country
according to cuſtom, and that he is the legitimate Son and
Heir of his Father, and that his Title to all he claims, is by

great moment, and that he doubted not but that the Queen
would do what was right and juſt; and therefore adviſed
him to a quiet and loyal Deportment till her Majeſties Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

                  <p>The Parliament being diſſolved the Deputy went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

and finding that the inconſtant <hi>Shane O Neal</hi> had apoſtatized

                  <p>Whereupon, <hi>Macguire</hi> and others complained to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
but <hi>O Neal</hi> diſdaining to have his Princely Claim
tried in a Court, grows enraged at <hi>Macguire,</hi> for putting the

                     <note place="margin">1565.</note> Lord Juſtice, was ſworn the twenty

long, before</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Sydny,</hi> Knight of the Garter, Lord Preſident of
<hi>Wales,</hi> came over Lord Deputy; he Landed on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>January,</hi> and was ſworn the next <hi>Sunday</hi> after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the twentieth; he was received with great joy, being a
Perſon, of whoſe excellent Government that Kingdom had
long Experience; and when he received the Sword, he made
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65997:192"/>
an eloquent and pithy Speech, to this effect; ſetting forth
what a precious thing good Government is, and how all
Realms, Commonwealths, Cities and Countries do flouriſh
and proſper,<note place="margin">Hooker, 111.</note> where the ſame is orderly, in quiet Juſtice and
Wiſdom directed and governed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What a continual Care the Queens Highneſs
hath had and yet hath, not only for the good guiding and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which ſhe
ſo earneſtly deſireth and wiſheth to be preſerved, as well in
Peace as in War: That ſhe hath made great Choice from
time to time, of the moſt Grave, Wiſe and Expert Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
for the one, and the moſt Valiant, Skilful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Men of Arms for the other. That both in Peace and
Wars, the publick State of the Commonwealth, and every
Member therein might be conſerved, defended and kept in
Safety under her Government. And for the performance
thereof, her Majeſty over and beſides the Revenues of the
Crown of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did yearly far above any of her Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
expend of her own Coffers out of <hi>England,</hi> great
Maſſes of Money amounting to many thouſand Pounds:
All which her exceſſive Expences and continual Cares, ſhe
made the leſs Account of, ſo that her Realm and Subjects
of <hi>Ireland</hi> might be preſerved, defended and governed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Notwithſtanding her Majeſty might have made
better Choice of many others, who were better able to hold
her Place in this Realm, both for Honour, Wiſdom and
Experience; yet her Pleaſure was now to caſt this heavy
Charge and Burden upon him: Which he was the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to take upon him, becauſe the greater the Charge
was, the more unable and weak he was to ſuſtain the ſame;
nevertheleſs, being in good hope, and well promiſed of her
Highneſſes Favour and Countenance in his well-doings, and
having his Confidence in them, her Highneſſes Counſellors
aſſciated to him, to join Aid, and aſſiſt him in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was, and is the more ready to take the Sword in
Hand, in hope that this his Government ſhall be to the Glory
of God, the Honour of her Majeſty, the Benefit of the
Commonwealth, and the Preſervation of the whole Realm,
and People of the ſame: And ſo making his earneſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
to the ſaid Lords preſent, for their conjoyning with
him, and the aiding and aſſiſting of him in this her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Service, he made an end of his Speech.</p>
                  <p>This Lord Deputy brought with him Inſtructions, Signed
by the Queen, on the Fifth day of <hi>October</hi> 1565, and were
to this Effect;</p>

and ſworn before the Lord Deputy, as is uſual; and he was
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65997:192"/>
directed to conſult and uſe their Advice, and they were to
reſpect and reverence his Quality, and both to conſpire the
Good of the Realm.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Hooker, 111.</note> That Religion and Knowledge of the Scriptures

                  <p>Thirdly, That the Law be adminiſtred uprightly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
Judges and Officers removed, and a Sheriff placed
in every County.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the Army be kept orderly, not oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Subject; that Muſters be once a Month, and Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
made whether the Soldiers be Engliſhmen or not, and how
paid.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That Care be taken of the Revenues of the
Crown.</p>

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Sullevan</hi> makes a pleaſant Story of this,<note place="margin">Sullevan, 84.</note> and tells

Saint of <hi>Derry,</hi> was impatient at the Prophanation of
his Church and Cell by the Hereticks, the one being made the
Repoſitory of the Ammunition, and the other being uſed for
their Lutheran Worſhip; and therefore to be revenged on
the Engliſh for this Sacrilege, the Saint aſſumed the ſhape
of a Wolf, and came out from an adjacent Wood, and paſſing
by a Smith's Forge, he took his Mouth full of red hot coals,
and ran with it to the Magazine, and fiercely ſpit the Fire
into the Room where the Ammunition lay, and ſo ſet all on
fire, and forced the Hereticks to ſeek for new Quarters.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems that <hi>Shane O Neal</hi> had deſired to have a Conference
with the L. Deputy near <hi>Dundalk;</hi> to which the L. Deputy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,

                     <note place="margin">Iriſh Stat. 234.</note> or what other Impediment he met with,

That the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> was in the Field with two

Citizens from <hi>Limerick,</hi> had him ſafely conveyed to that
City, where he was Indicted of High Treaſon, for Levying
War againſt the Queen, and his Brother <hi>John</hi> was Knighted,
and made Seneſchal of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and for a while behaved
himſelf ſo well, that in three Months time he made repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the People his Brother (the Earl) had injured, to
the value of three thouſand Pounds; nevertheleſs the Earl
of <hi>Ormond</hi> was not pleaſed with this Preferment of Sir <hi>John
Deſmond,</hi> as one who plainly foreſaw, that he would in
time prove as troubleſom as his Brother.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord Deputy being tired with the Complaints of
<hi>Oliver Sutton,</hi> a Gentleman of the Pale, againſt the Earl of
<hi>Kildare,</hi> and others, and the Accuſations preferred by the
Lady of <hi>Dunboyn, Mac Brian Ara, Oliver Fitz Girald,</hi> and
others, againſt Sir <hi>Edmond Butler,</hi> and <hi>Pierce</hi> his Brother,
was an earneſt Suitor, That a Lord Chancellor fitly qualified
might be ſent over to determine ſome of thoſe Differences;
and accordingly Dr. <hi>Weſton,</hi> Dean of the Arches, was made
Lord Chancellor, and arrived at <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>July,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1567.</note> and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that Office, to the great eaſe of the Lord Deputy, and
to the ſatisfaction of the People: He alſo brought Letters,
adviſing the Lord Deputy to take care that <hi>Shane</hi> O <hi>Neal</hi>'s
Son (who was Hoſtage for his Father's Loyalty) ſhould be
ſafely kept in the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which now, upon the
Death of <hi>Shane,</hi> was diligently obſerved.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Deputy ſent a Meſſenger to the Engliſh Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
with the News of <hi>Shane O Neal</hi>'s Death; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
marched to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and incamped in the Heart of the
Country, and there <hi>Turlogh Lynogh,</hi> and the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors
for the Captainry of <hi>Tirone,</hi> came to him, and made
their Submiſſions, and moſt of the Gentry of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> did the
like: And ſo the Deputy having ſetled that Province as well
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65997:196"/>
as was poſſible, after many pithy Exhortations to Peace
and Obedience, and a Promiſe to ſend Commiſſioners
amongſt them to decide all Controverſies, except thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Homicide and Free-hold, he returned to <hi>Dublin</hi> with
the applauſe of the People; and at <hi>Dublin</hi> he received the
Submiſſion of the <hi>O Reylyes,</hi> by Indenture, on the twenty
eighth of <hi>November,</hi> and about the ſame time beautified the
Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> with ſtately additional Buildings, which
yet remain.</p>
                  <p>But howſoever theſe good Services were reliſhed in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where the Fruits of them were felt and perceived, yet
in <hi>England</hi> they were ſo little regarded, that no mention was
made of them in any of the Publick Diſpatches; but on the
contrary, the Publick Letters to the Deputy, were full of
Reprimands and ſharp Reflections, becauſe of the Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Earl of <hi>Deſmond;</hi> and therefore the Lord Deputy
did endeavour his own Revocation; and at length prevailed
to get Licence to go for <hi>England;</hi> he carried with him the
Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Dungannon,</hi> O <hi>Connor Sligo,</hi>
O <hi>Carol,</hi> and others: When he came to <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court,
with two hundred Gentlemen in his Train, it hapned that
the Queen was looking out at the Window,<note place="margin">Hooker, 118.</note> and ſeeing ſuch
a Multitude, ſhe was thereat ſurprized, until ſhe was told,
it was the Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and then ſhe replied, <hi>It
was well enough; for he had two of the beſt Offices in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
And being come in, he was well received for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
by the Queen; but after a while, was told by ſome of the
Courtiers, That <hi>the Scuſſle in</hi> Ulſter <hi>was not worthy to be called
a War, ſince the principal Rebel</hi> (Shane O Neal) <hi>was but a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
and an Outlaw.</hi> However, the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> and O <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
were clapt up in the Tower, and Sir <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Deſmond</hi>
was ſent for, and impriſoned in the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>O Connor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. L.</note> by Indenture made his Submiſſion to the
Queen,<note place="margin">Lib. H.</note> and thereupon was enlarged; and the next Year, <hi>viz.</hi>
the twelfth of <hi>July</hi> 1568, the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> ſubmitted in
moſt humble manner, and laid all his Eſtate at her Majeſties
Feet, and promiſed to convey what part ſhe ſhould be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take of it, and acknowledges to have forfeited a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance
of twenty thouſand Pounds, which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made to the Queen, as hath been already related. But
when <hi>Sydny</hi> went to <hi>England,</hi> he left</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Weſton,</hi> Lord Chancellor, and Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams,</hi>
Treaſurer at Wars, Lords Juſtices by Commiſſion
under the Great Seal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Dated the fourteenth Day
of <hi>October:</hi> In their time, private Quarrels did ſwell almoſt
into publick Wars; for not only Sir <hi>Edmond Butler</hi> and
<hi>Pierce Grace</hi> did invade <hi>Oliver Fitz Girald</hi>'s Territories with
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65997:196"/>
great Fury, but alſo the O <hi>Connors</hi> and O <hi>Mores</hi> (who were
Proclaimed Traytors) did now appear in the Field with a
thouſand <hi>Gallowglaſſes,</hi> and threatned to ſpoil O <hi>Carol</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and to burn <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and the Defendants, being in no good
condition to reſiſt, did in vain importune the Government for
Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Daniel Mac Carty More,</hi> deſpiſing his Title of
Earl of <hi>Glencar,</hi> aſſumed the Title of King of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and
having confederated with <hi>O Sullevan More, Mac Swiny,</hi> and
others; he invaded the Lord <hi>Roche</hi>'s Country with Banners
diſplayed, and deſtroyed all the Corn, together with ſeven
Hundred Sheep, and killed many Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and carried away fifteen Hundred Cows, and an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Garrons.</p>
                  <p>Nor was the Contention leſs between <hi>James Fitz Maurice</hi>
of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Lixnaw;</hi> And there happened
another barbarou accident that was more ſurprizing than any
of the reſt; for one <hi>Maurice Gibbon,</hi> alias <hi>Reagh,</hi> who was
by the Popes Bull appointed to be Archbiſhop of <hi>Caſhell,</hi> had
the Confidence to come to <hi>James Mac Caghwell,</hi> who for ſome
time had been Archbiſhop of that See,<note place="margin">Ware, de preſul. 172.</note> and to demand Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which being refuſed, the barbarous Villain ſtabbed the
Archbiſhop with a Skein, but it ſo happened that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhod
recovered, and <hi>Maurice</hi> made his eſcape into <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Turlogh Lynogh</hi> had aſſumed the Name of <hi>O Neal,</hi>

but it ſeems that quarrel was appeaſed, and one Thouſand
of the <hi>Scots</hi> took Pay under <hi>Turlogh,</hi> and invaded the <hi>Ferny</hi>
contrary to Articles.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Connaught</hi> there was a new Broil between <hi>Mac William

and in <hi>Thomond</hi> there were great Conteſts between the Earl

                     <note place="margin">1568.</note> when in <hi>September</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Sydny</hi> Lord Deputy landed at <hi>Carigfergus,</hi> he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſent for <hi>Turlogh Lynogh,</hi> who came to him, and confeſſed
his Fault, and with the greateſt Humility begged the Lord
Deputies Pardon, which with great difficulty he at length
obtained, but not until the <hi>Scots</hi> Hoſtages were firſt Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
                  <p>On the twentieth of <hi>October</hi> the Lord Deputy was Sworn
at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and immediately he ſent for Sir <hi>Edmond Butler,</hi> who
upon ſeveral frivolous Pretences refuſed to come, but broke
out into Rebellion, as ſhall be related hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Proceedings at Council-board will
deſerve a Paragraph in this Hiſtory, and the rather, becauſe
a great and memorable Caſe was at this time agitated there,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:65997:197"/>
for Sir <hi>Peter Carew,</hi> (whoſe Anceſtor had formerly been Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Cork,</hi> and had great Poſſeſſions in ſeveral parts of
the Kingdom) came over well recommended to <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. F. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> and
reſolved to endeavour the recovery of that great Eſtate, which
was wrongfully withheld from him, and particularly the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony
of <hi>Idrone,</hi> in the County of <hi>Caterlogh,</hi> was detained by
the Heirs of thoſe whom one of the <hi>Carews</hi> had employed
as his Steward, and had entruſted to mannage that Eſtate;
but Sir <hi>Peter</hi> being adviſed not to alarum the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> by begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with them firſt, he did on the twenty ninth day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
prefer his Petition to the Council-board againſt Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher
Chivers,</hi> for the Mannor of <hi>Ballymaclethan</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Meath,</hi> and in the Petition he ſuggeſted that <hi>Chivers</hi> was
ſo popular and powerful a Man in his Country, that there
could be no indifferent Tryal had at Common-Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Hereupon Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> was ſummoned, and when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
he pleaded <hi>ore tenus</hi> to the Juriſdiction of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-board
in this Matter; but Mr. <hi>Perriam</hi> gave three reaſons
why they might proceed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe it was the common Practiſe to determine
Cauſes at the Council-Table in <hi>England,</hi> and inſtanced the
Caſe of one <hi>Colſhul</hi> about an Office in the Exchequer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That in caſes of Extremity, as loſs of Evidence,
want of juſt Tryal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Suit may be commenced before
the Lord Chancellor, or at the Council-board; <hi>propter neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,
ne curia domini Regis deſiceret in Juſtitia exhibenda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That there are innumerable Preſidents of Cauſes
determined at the Council-Table in <hi>Ireland;</hi> upon theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
the Judges, <hi>Dillon</hi> and <hi>Plunket</hi> were of Opinion the
Board might proceed to determine this Cauſe, and afterwards
the two Chief Juſtices concurred in the ſame Opinion, ſo that
<hi>Chivers</hi> was forced to put in his Anſwer in Writing, which
he did, but ſtill it concluded to the Juriſdiction as before, and
in his Plea he inſiſted on the Statutes of <hi>Magna Carta, cap.</hi> 11.
and <hi>cap. 29. 25 Edw. 3. cap. 4. 28 Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 3. and 42 <hi>Edw.
3. cap.</hi> 3. But he likewiſe ſet forth his Title by Deſcent to part
of the Lands in queſtion, and made ſome other Title to the
reſt: The Court was angry with the Defendant for repeating
his Plea to the Juriſdiction, after it had been ſo ſolemnly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled,
however they ordered the Plantiff to reply, which
he did, by abridging his Plaint as to the Lands Deſcended,
and by a ſolid Anſwer to the reſt of the Plea: But at length
the Parties agreed among themſelves, and <hi>Chivers</hi> for a
ſmall Conſideration had a Releaſe from Sir <hi>Peter;</hi> however
Sir <hi>Peter</hi> afterwards on the like Petition recovered the Barony
of <hi>Idrone</hi> from the <hi>Cavenghs,</hi> by the Judgment and Decree
of the Lord Deputy, and Council.</p>

The Lord Deputy ſummoned a Parliament, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
met at <hi>Dublin</hi> on the ſeventeenth day of <hi>January,</hi> 1568.<note place="margin">1568.</note>
The Deputy appeared in Robes of Crimſon Velvet, lined with
Ermin, and after an Eloquent Speech from the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
<hi>Weſton,</hi> in commendation of the Law, and her Majeſties
Government, the Commons departed to their Houſe, and choſe
<hi>Stainhurſt,</hi> Recorder of <hi>Dublin</hi> for their Speaker, who being
approved by the Deputy, on the twentieth of <hi>January</hi> made
his Requeſt as is uſual.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For Priviledge of Parliament, that the Members might
come and go without Moleſtation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for Freedom of Speech.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Puniſhment of any Offender ſhould
be leſt to the Houſe; all which were granted, and the Houſes
adjourned to the next Day.</p>
                  <p>But the Popiſh Party were diſſatisfied that Sir <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Barnwel</hi> was not choſen Speaker, and therefore began to
Mutiny, alledging,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That ſeveral Members were returned from Towns
not Incorporated.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That certain Sheriffs and Mayors had returned
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That ſeveral Members were returned, that were
ſo far from being reſident according to Law, that they did not
know the Corporations that choſe them: And after four days
debate, and many high Words, the matter was referred to
the Judges, and they approved of the two firſt Objections;
but as to the third, they ſaid that the return of Non-reſidents
might be Penal to the Sheriffs, but did not incapacitate the
Member that was returned to ſit in the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>But the Judges Anſwer (being reported to the Houſe by the
Speaker) did not at all pleaſe the Papiſts, and therefore Sir
<hi>Lucas Dillon,</hi> who was Attorney General, was ſent for to the
Houſe, to teſtifie that it was the Judges Opinion, and his alſo,
that the Non-reſident Members might ſit in the Houſe;<note place="margin">Hooker, 120.</note> but
neither did this ſatisfie them: On the contrary when the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ordered a Bill to be read, the Mutineers oppoſed it in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diſſorderly manner, and ſo it reſted till the two Chief-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,
the Queens Serjeant at Law, Attorney-General and
Solicitor, came to the Houſe the next day, and affirmed their
Opinions and Reſolutions, as already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs the Male contents (who were loth to part with
their Iriſh Captainries and exactions) continued their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to obſtruct the Proceedings of this Parliament, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
almoſt every Bill that was read, eſpecially that of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
<hi>Poyning</hi>'s Act, <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> and the Bill for an Impoſt
upon Wines; but this had been tolerable, if their Behaviour
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65997:198"/>
had not been unruly, and unbecoming the dignity of that
great Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon my Author (<hi>John Hooker,</hi> Burgeſs of <hi>Athenry</hi>)
ſtood up,<note place="margin">Hooker, 121.</note> and ſpoke to the Bill for the impoſt on Wine, and took
an occaſion to mention the great Charge the Queen was at for
the Defence of the Kingdom, and the Protection of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and then reflected on the Rebellions and Ingratitudes of
the Iriſh, becauſe the former occaſioned that vaſt Expence,
and the latter hindred that Contribution which ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it; he affirmed, the Queen might by her Prerogative have
impoſed Tonnage on Wine, but it would be more pleaſing to
her to receive it by their Conſents expreſſed in an Act of
Parliament; and concluded with a compariſon of the Mutinies
of the Iriſh againſt the Lord Deputy, to that of the ſeditious
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſcontented Members were hereupon enraged againſt
<hi>Hooker,</hi> and behaved themſelves ſo tumultuouſly, that ſome of
the Proteſtants found it neceſſary to guard him Home to Sir
<hi>Peters Carews</hi> Houſe, to prevent the violence they ſuſpected
or rather perceived to be deſigned againſt him, and the next
day Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Barnwell</hi> ſtood up in the Houſe to ſpeak to
a Bill, but he pretermitted all that was pertinent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of that, ſpent his diſcourſe in Reflections upon <hi>Hooker,</hi>
affirming that if <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Calumnies had been uttered any
where but in that Houſe, they would all have died, rather than
have ſuffered them; but he was at length interrupted by the
Speaker, and told, That if he had any cauſe of Complaint,
he ſhould bring in his Impeachment regularly, and in writing;
but it ſeems he did not think ſit to do ſo, and theſe Heats cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by degrees, the Parliament at length proceeded with good
Succeſs, and made theſe following Acts.</p>

recited in the Statute-Book, from <hi>pag.</hi> 267. to <hi>pag.</hi>
279.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt the Lord Deputy and the Parliament were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
the Proſperity and Peace of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by enacting
good and wholſom Laws, others were as buſie to countermine
them, and to put all into Diſorder and Confuſion; for ſome
of the looſer ſort of the Iriſh Lords were diſtaſted to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
at the loſs of their Captainries and Iriſh Extortions, as
alſo at the Impoſt on Wine, that they reſolved by force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcind
thoſe Laws, or at leaſt prevent the execution of them;
and ſo making <hi>Religion</hi> their Pretence, they confederated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
<hi>James Fitz-Morris</hi> was the Bell-weather of this
Flock, and the Ringleader of all this Miſchief; he added to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65997:199"/>
the general Grievances, the particular Injuries done to his
own Family, by the impriſonment of the Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi>
and his Brother Sir <hi>John;</hi> and he inveigled the Earl of <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi>
by telling him, That the Queen was to be married to
the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> and that thereupon, the Lord Deputy
(who married that Earl's Siſter) was to be King of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and when the Earl of <hi>Glencar</hi> was once engaged, <hi>Mac Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogh,</hi>
and many more of the <hi>Cartyes</hi> came in of courſe; and
<hi>Fitz Girald,</hi> commonly called Seneſchal of <hi>Imokilly,</hi> was as
forward in this Rebellion as any of them; and although Sir
<hi>Edmond Butler,</hi> who was Seneſchal to his brother the Earl of
<hi>Ormond,</hi> and conſequently hated all the Family of <hi>Deſmond,</hi>
and had formerly pretended to ſerve againſt <hi>James Fitz-Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris:</hi>
Yet partly, becauſe he did not dare to appear before
Commiſſioners ſent by the Lord Deputy to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to
examine and redreſs the grievous Complaints made againſt
him; and partly for Zeal to the Catholick Cauſe, and Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Iriſh Uſurpations, he ſacrificed his private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments
to the publick Concern, and joyned with the reſt
of the Rebels.</p>
                  <p>The Confederates being reſolved to make ſomething of
this Rebellion, if it were poſſible, ſent the Titular Biſhops of
<hi>Caſhel</hi> and <hi>Emly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hooker, 130.</note> and the youngeſt Brother of the Earl of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
as their Ambaſſadors to the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
to implore Aid and Aſſiſtance to reſcue their Religion and
Country from the Tyranny and Oppreſſion of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Lord Deputy was not idle; but aſſoon as he had
notice of this Confederacy, he proclaimed them Traytors,
and ordered Sir <hi>Peter Carew,</hi> Governor of <hi>Leighlin,</hi> to begin
the War, which he did; and being accompanied by the
Captains, <hi>Malby, Gilbert, Baſnet,</hi> and others, he took Sir
<hi>Edmund</hi>'s Caſtle of <hi>Cloghgriman,</hi> and gave the Spoil to the
Soldiers; and thence he marched to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
that three thouſand Men were within three Miles
of that City, Sir <hi>Peter Carew</hi> ſent <hi>Henry Davels</hi> to diſcover
them; and being ſatisfied by him, that they were not above
two thouſand, he reſolved to attack them; Captain <hi>Gilbert,</hi>
and <hi>Davels,</hi> and twelve more began the Charge; which
was well ſeconded by <hi>Carew, Malby</hi> and <hi>Baſnet,</hi> and the
Succeſs was accordingly; four hundred <hi>Gallowglaſſes</hi> being
ſlain, without the loſs of any Engliſh Man, Captain <hi>Malby</hi>'s
Servant only excepted.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, <hi>James Fitz-Morris</hi> beſieged <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> but
both Garriſon and Citizens behaved themſelves ſo well, that
<hi>Fitz-Morris</hi> was fain to execute his Malice on the Country-Villages
and ſmaller Towns, and thoſe he did not ſpare; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65997:200"/>
he robbed old <hi>Falco Quiverford</hi> of <hi>Galan</hi> (who had
been Servant to three Earls of <hi>Ormond</hi>) of two thouſand
Pounds in Money, Plate and Houſhold-ſtuff, beſides Corn
and Cattel.</p>
                  <p>Another Party went to the County of <hi>Wexford,</hi> and at
a Fair at <hi>Iniſcorthy,</hi> committed moſt vile Outrages, raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Women, and killing or impriſoning every body they met
with; nor did the Queens County and <hi>Oſſory</hi> fare any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Lord <hi>Power</hi>'s Eſtate, and the whole County of
<hi>Waterford</hi> were in the ſame condition; and even the very
County of <hi>Dublin</hi> had its ſhare of Deſolation.</p>
                  <p>But the Confederates finding no Effects of their former
Ambaſſy, ſent new Meſſengers to the Pope and King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and alſo ſollicited <hi>Turlogh Lynogh</hi> to procure the Aid of the
Scots, and were ſo diligent, that nothing was left undone
that might tend to ſubvert the Government, and clear the
Country of all Engliſh Men and Engliſh Laws.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> then in <hi>England,</hi> troubled at the
Diſloyalty of his Brethren, offered his Service againſt them,
and undertook to reclaim them by Perſwaſion or Force, and
to that end, he arrived at <hi>Wexford</hi> the fourteenth Day of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> being the very Day of the aforeſaid Fair at <hi>Iniſcorthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould have mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Sir <hi>Warham Saint Leger</hi>
was, <hi>anno</hi> 1566, made Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and now, the
Lord Deputy having notice that Sir <hi>Warham</hi>'s Lady was (in
her Husband's abſence) much diſtreſſed at <hi>Cork,</hi> and daily
threatned by the Iriſh, he reſolved to march that way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
her, and with ſix hundred Men only he ſet out from
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and came to <hi>Clonmel,</hi> and thence he ſent to <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford</hi>
for a few Citizens, for three days, to aſſiſt
him in his Paſſage over the Mountains; but that City
obſtinately inſiſted upon its Privileges, and refuſed to
ſend any Men; however, Mr. <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and a few Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
and ſome Sea-men came to the Deputy, and were very
kindly received, and the Diſloyalty of the City was remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
at another time. In <hi>Clonmel</hi> the Lord Deputy was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Treated in the Town-Houſe, which he requited by a
moſt excellent Speech in commendation of Loyalty; and
thence marched to <hi>Caſhil,</hi> and in his March took a Caſtle,
held by Sir <hi>Edmond Butler;</hi> and reſtored it to one <hi>Cantrel,</hi>
who was the right Owner;<note place="margin">1569.</note> and ſo he came to <hi>Cork,</hi> where
he found four hundred Soldiers, newly arrived out of <hi>England,</hi>
under the Command of the Captains <hi>Shute</hi> and <hi>Ward,</hi> as by
his Letters to <hi>England,</hi> he had deſired.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Cork,</hi> the Lord Deputy made a ſtep into <hi>Kirricurry,</hi>
and took the Caſtle of <hi>Carigoline;</hi> and afterwards he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Orrery,</hi> and took <hi>But<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but <hi>James Fitz-Morrice</hi> got there before him, and
took the Town by the help of ſcaling Ladders; and finding
that he could not keep it, he burnt and deſtroyed as much of
it as he could.</p>
                  <p>However, the Lord Deputy marched thither, and having
given all the Encouragement that he could to repair and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifie
<hi>Kilmallock,</hi> he ſetled a Garriſon there, of an hundred
Horſe, four hundred Foot, and ſome Kern, under Colonel
<hi>Gilbert,</hi> who was made Governor or Colonel of <hi>Munſter;</hi>
and ſo having taken the Oaths and Hoſtages of the Lords,
<hi>Roch, Courcy, Decyes, Power,</hi> and of Sir <hi>Cormock Mac Teige,</hi>
and many other Gentlemen and Freeholders of the Counties
of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Limerick,</hi> he marched directly to the City of
<hi>Limerick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> came to the Lord Deputy at or near
<hi>Limerick,</hi> and brought with him his Brother Sir <hi>Edmond But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
who, in the open Camp ſubmitted to Mercy, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
his Follies, and craving Pardon; and thereupon he
was ſet at Liberty, upon the Earl's Recogniſance for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
at <hi>Dublin;</hi> and accordingly he did appear there,
on the ſixteenth day of <hi>October,</hi> together with <hi>Pierce Butler,</hi>
another Brother of the Earl's, and both of them were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
of High Treaſon: However, it ſeems that <hi>Pierce</hi>
was afterwards bailed; but Sir <hi>Edmond,</hi> being a Cholerick
Man, did reflect upon the Lord Deputy, and attributed all to
his Partiality; and alledged that the Lord Deputy did threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
him, and would do him no Juſtice; and vented many
more ſuch paſſionate expreſſions, and therefore had not the
favour of being bailed, but was committed cloſe Priſoner
to the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin;</hi> from whence, in a very ſhort time
after, he made a ſtrange and hazardous eſcape, by the help
of a ſmall Rope, which broke within three yards of the
ground, and ſo bruiſed him, that he could not go far, ſo that
he was forced to ſtay all that cold Winter-Night up to the
Chin in the Water, to prevent his Diſcovery: However, about
three Months after, <hi>viz.</hi> on the laſt of <hi>February,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Ormond</hi> did again bring Sir <hi>Edmond,</hi> and the reſt of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
before the Lord Deputy and Council at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
there, after a ſhort Commitment, and humble Submiſſions,
they were all pardoned for the ſake of the Earl, and perhaps
by ſpecial Orders from the Queen, who by the Mother was

                  <p>In the mean time, Colonel <hi>Gilbert</hi> behaved himſelf ſo well
in <hi>Munſter,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Glencar</hi> and his Follower <hi>Mac

And the Earl of <hi>Glencar</hi> was to command them, and in

with two hundred Horſe and four hundred Foot, and to
maintain them for two years, and afterwards he was to keep
as many Soldiers as the Queen ſhould keep for the Defence
of her Moyety, not exceeding ſix hundred, and no more; and
it was agreed, that for the firſt two years the Queen would
likewiſe keep two hundred Horſe, and four hundred Foot,

four hundred Acres of Land, and a Foot-Soldier two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

twenty years build on her or his reſpective ſhare, as they
pleaſed. And the Earl was to have Timber out of <hi>Killulta</hi>
Woods, and might for ſeven years tranſport the growth of
the Country, without paying Cuſtom; and for twelve years
more ſhould pay no more Cuſtom than is paid in <hi>England;</hi> and
he had liberty to tranſport Arms, Money, and all Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
out of <hi>England</hi> Cuſtom-free, giving notice thereof to
the Officers of the Ports. Each might diſpoſe of five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Acres as they pleaſe; but more than that quantity was
not to be given to Iriſh or Scots. The Earl was to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-General

and the Earl did not ſpeed much better; for after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of much Treaſure, and a years time, he returned to

                  </p>
                  <p>This year the Money ſent by the Queen into <hi>Ireland,</hi>

                  <p>It is reported of <hi>Bryan Mac Fylemy,</hi> that he had thirty

hundred Iriſh, and took <hi>Bryan Mac Fylemy,</hi> and his Wife
and his Brother <hi>Rory Oge</hi> Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time,<note place="margin">1574.</note> the Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> notwithſtanding

his Progreſs in building Fortifications in <hi>Clandeboy;</hi>
however he obeyed, and at length the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> was

                     <note place="margin">1575.</note> Lord Deputy, arrived on the twelfth of

Plague raged in <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is obſervable of this great and good man, that although
he did moſt excellent Service in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet he was but ill
rewarded for it in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore he was with great
difficulty prevailed with to accept the Government this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
and laſt time; for (as he expreſſed himſelf in his
Letter) he curſed, hated and deteſted <hi>Ireland</hi> above all other
Countries; not that he had any diſlike of the Country, but
that it was moſt difficult to do any Service there where a Man
muſt ſtruggle with Famine and Faſtneſſes, inacceſſible Bogs,
and light-footed Tories; and yet, when theſe, and all other
Difficulties were ſurmounted, no Service in the world was
leſs reputed, valued or requited than that: and it is farther
remarkable of him, that though he was four times Lord Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and three times Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet he never
purchaſed a Foot of Land in that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Deputy's Inſtructions were to find means to pay
the Queens Debts, if poſſible, and to grant <hi>Leix</hi> and <hi>Offaly</hi>
to Engliſh Undertakers,<note place="margin">Lib. H.</note> and the Queen promiſed him, that
beſides the Iriſh Revenue, twenty thouſand Pounds <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
ſhould be punctally remitted him out of <hi>England</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly:
And <hi>Sydny</hi> undertook for that Sum to fortifie <hi>Carrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus,</hi>

                  <p>The Lord Deputy was magnificently received and treated

Weeks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during which time the Soldiers for half their Pay,

                  <p>The Earls of <hi>Thomond</hi> and <hi>Glencar,</hi> and the principal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the Province came to wait on the Lord Deputy at <hi>Cork,</hi>
and there they kept their <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> and as ſoon as that was

almoſt every day from the ſeventh day of <hi>January</hi> to the
one and thirtieth, <hi>Condom</hi> and a younger Son of the Lord
<hi>Roch</hi> were Condemned, and though they were Reprieved,
yet there were twenty three other notorious Malefactors Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
and the better to diſcover Vagabonds and Tories,
every Gentlemen was commanded to give in a Liſt of his
Dependants, and to anſwer for them, and Proclamation was
made, That every I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Whilſt the Deputy was at <hi>Cork,</hi> he had information of
the Diſloyalty of the Seneſchal of <hi>Imokilly,</hi> and of the Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations

being attended by two Hundred Citizens of <hi>Cork,</hi> beſides
his own Forces, the Deputy marched to <hi>Ballymarter,</hi> and
took that ſtrong Caſtle, and had taken <hi>Fitz Girald</hi> himſelf,
but that he narrowly eſcaped through a Hole in the dead of
the Night: There was abundance of Victuals found in the
Caſtle, beſides other things of value; but all the Spoil was
given to the Soldiers, and ſo a Garriſon of twenty Men under
<hi>Jaſper Horſy</hi> being left in the Caſtle, the Lord Deputy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Cork.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord Deputy was ſo well pleaſed with Sir <hi>Cormack

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65997:205"/>
diſpoſition he was the rareſt Man that ever was born of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhy;</hi>
and in another Letter to the Lords of the Council he
obſerves that the Lord <hi>Poer</hi> lived more plentifully than thoſe
that had far more Land, and that his barren Land yielded
more Rent than the richer ſoil of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> and <hi>Decyes,</hi> and
the reaſon was, becauſe he kept his Territory in order, and
free from Idlers and Vagabonds, whereas on the contrary,
the Lord of <hi>Decyes</hi> was ſcarce able to ſubſiſt, becauſe his
Country harboured more bad Men than it fed good
Cattle.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Cork,</hi> the Deputy went to <hi>Limerick,</hi> where he was
entertained with more Pomp than any where elſe, there he
kept Seſſions, and obſerved the ſame Methods as he did at
<hi>Cork,</hi> and then he marched into <hi>Thomond,</hi> which formerly
belonged to the Engliſh Lords of <hi>Clare,</hi> and was inhabited by
many Engliſh, but now not a Man of Engliſh Extraction to
be found there, and even the <hi>O Bryans</hi> (tho' very near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
were inveterate Enemies each to the other, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was entirely waſted, and innumerable complaints of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Rape, Burning, Robbery, and Sacriledge were made
to the Deputy.</p>
                  <p>He impriſoned the Earl of <hi>Thomond,</hi> and <hi>Teig Mac Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
till they gave Bonds and Hoſtages of their good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
he kept the Earl's Brother in Irons, and made Sir

<hi>per Annum</hi> for his Country, beſides Contribution of Men,
on <hi>riſings out,</hi> and conſented the <hi>Clandonells</hi> ſhould hold
their Lands of the Queen, whereupon he was Knighted, and

ſubmitted as did all the reſt of the County of <hi>Mayo,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
Juſtice and Engliſh Government, being weary of the

                  <p>The Town of <hi>Galway</hi> was poor and diſorderly, and the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65997:206"/>
Country deſtroyed by the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard's</hi> Sons, againſt
whom infinite Complaints were made: Nevertheleſs, they
had the Confidence to come unexpectedly into the Church of
<hi>Galway</hi> in the time of Divine Service, and upon their Knees
to make their Submiſſion, and at the ſame time they humbly
begged Pardon for their Extravagances, which by Advice
of the Privy-Council was granted unto them, although for
the preſent they were confined, and were afterwards carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſo the Lord Deputy having ſtayed three
Weeks at <hi>Galway,</hi> ſet out towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> and kept Seſſions
in every County he marched into,<note place="margin">1576.</note> and ſetled Garriſons in

                  <p>But the ſtate of Affairs and the miſerable Condition of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> are beſt underſtood from the lively Repreſentation of
them in the Lord Deputies Letters, which import, that the

of the Army through it, but would recover, if it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected

<hi>Meath</hi> has been haraſſed by <hi>O Connor,</hi> and <hi>O Molloy,</hi> even ſince
their Protections, but that <hi>O Reyly</hi> behaved himſelf well: That
the Kings Writ did not run in the new Baronies of <hi>Weſt meath,</hi>
but he hoped it ſhould in a little time; that the County
of <hi>Kildare,</hi> was waſted by the <hi>O Mores,</hi> and the Counties of

and that the Undertakers are ſo poor and few, that two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Soldiers are in Garriſon there to protect them, ſo that
thoſe Counties do not yield the Crown the twentieth part of
the Charge they put it to; that <hi>Kilmallock</hi> was re-edified,
but that <hi>Athenry</hi> was the moſt miſerable Spectacle in the
World; the whole Town was burnt by the <hi>Mac an Earla's,</hi>
and the Church it ſelf was not exempted from the common
Ruin, although the Mother of one of theſe Vipers was buried
therein; but that was ſo far from mitigating their Fury,
that the Son being told his Mother was buried in that Church,
replied; <hi>That if ſhe were alive, he would ſooner burn her
and the Church together, than that any Engliſh Church ſhould
fortifie there;</hi> that theſe <hi>Mac an Earla's</hi> hated each other,
and yet like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> joined together againſt any
third Perſon, whom they thought to be a common Enemy;
That the Deputy had laid a Tax of two Thouſand Pound on
the Country, towards the re-edifying <hi>Athenry,</hi> and took
from the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> the Caſtles of <hi>Ballyclare,</hi> and
<hi>Ballyniſlow;</hi> That <hi>O Connor Dun,</hi> and <hi>O Flyn</hi> ſubmitted to him

of <hi>Connaught</hi> was much annoyed by the Scots, whom
the <hi>Mac an Earla's</hi> had brought to their Aſſiſtance; That

                  <p>But if the Civil State of the Kingdom were in an ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
the Eccleſiaſtical was in a worſe; for there were

on Fire, defaced the Queens Arms, drove away ſome, and
ſlew others of the Maſons that were building.</p>
                  <p>The induſtrious Deputy made ſuch haſte, that in three days

                  <p>The Lord Preſident <hi>Drury,</hi> being valiant in War, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent

                  <p>Nevertheleſs the Earl diſſembled the Matter and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
for a long time; he was building a Caſtle, when the news
firſt came of <hi>James</hi>'s Arrival, and immediately he diſcharged
the Workmen, and pretending to oppoſe the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he
ſent to <hi>Mac Carthy More,</hi> to ſummon him to aſſiſt him, <hi>Mac
Carthy</hi> came accordingly, and ſhewed himſelf forward in
the Matter, but as ſoon as he diſcovered <hi>Deſmond's</hi> Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he took his leave and returned.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> at the perſwaſion of
Captain <hi>Appeſly</hi> was (againſt his Will) obliged to remove to
<hi>Askeaton;</hi> however he ſuffered, and ſecretly encouraged ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Followers to go over to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but that did
not ſatisfie them, for when they found themſelves diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of thoſe great Aids that were promiſed them, their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
began to abate, and they entertained Thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home, and undoubtedly they had done ſo, but that
<hi>James Fitz Maurice</hi> kept up their Spirits by large Promiſes
of ſpeedy Aſſiſtance, and in order to procure it, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
a Journey to <hi>Connaught,</hi> but pretended only to go in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
to pay his Devotions to the Holy Croſs in <hi>Typerary;</hi>
he took with him four Horſe, and twelve Kerns, and being
come into <hi>Burk</hi>'s Country, in the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cambd. Eliz. 237.</note> and
wanting a Horſe, he ordered his Men to take the firſt they met
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65997:211"/>
with, which they did out of a Plow of <hi>Burk</hi>'s; the Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
raiſe the Hue-and-Cry, whereupon Sir <hi>William Burk</hi>'s
Sons purſued them, and at length overtook them, Headed
by <hi>Fitz Morris,</hi> with whom their Father had formerly join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Rebellion; <hi>Fitz Morris</hi> immediately calls out <hi>Coz Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
Two Garons ſhall make no Breach between you and I, I hope
you will do as I do;</hi> Burk replied, <hi>He had too much of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
already, and had ſworn the contrary, and therefore would have
his Horſes. Fitz Morris</hi> thought it diſhonourable to part with
what he had gotten, and ſo to Skirmiſh they go, which was
brisk enough, and ended in the ſlaughter of both of them.
<hi>Fitz Morris</hi> was quartered at <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> and Sir <hi>William
Burk</hi> was afterwards made Baron of <hi>Caſtleconnel,</hi> with Joy
whereof he died.</p>
                  <p>Upon notice that <hi>James Fitz Maurice,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
were arrived, the Lord Deputy with the Army (which was
but four hundred Foot, and two hundred Horſe) marched
to <hi>Munſter,</hi> accompanied by the Marſhal <hi>Bagnal, Malby, Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild,
Waterhouſe, Fitton, Maſterſon,</hi> and others of that ſort,
and by the Lords of <hi>Kildare, Moungarret,</hi> Upper <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and
<hi>Dunboyn,</hi> who brought two hundred Horſe of their own,
beſides Kern; when they came to <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> the Deputy ſent
Meſſengers for the Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and ſome others whom
he ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſmond</hi> after much lingring, and many vain excuſes, came
to the Camp well attended; but ſome of his tricks being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
he was committed to Priſon, and thereupon being fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
leſt all his ſecret Treaſons and Combinations might be unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled,
he ſo paſſionately humbled himſelf to the Deputy, that
upon the renewal of his oath of Allegiance he was ſet at Liberty.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, his Brother Sir <hi>John Deſmond</hi> was at
the head of the Rebels, and encamped near <hi>Sleavelogher;</hi> but
the Deputy quickly feaſed them thence, and having divided
his ſmall Army into three Parts; he purſued the Iriſh ſo cloſe,
that he often lay in the place where they had lain the night
before; nevertheleſs, he could never overtake theſe light foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Enemies, and therefore having deſtroyed the Forage, he
returned to <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> and Encamped at <hi>Gibbings-Town,</hi> and
continued nine Weeks, marching up and down thereabouts,
with very great toil, but to no great purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Only the Captains, <hi>Herbert</hi> and <hi>Price,</hi> being detached with
two hundred Men, did ſome Execution on the Rebels at a place
called the <hi>Blackwood:</hi> But in their return homeward, they were
ſurprized by an Ambuſh of Sir <hi>John Deſmond's,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and moſt of their Company ſlain, without any great
dammage to the Iriſh, ſaving that their Commander, Sir <hi>John
Deſmond</hi> was wounded in the Noſe.</p>

                     <pb n="358" facs="tcp:65997:212"/>
But the Army being recruited by the arrival of the
Captains,<note place="margin">1579.</note> 
                     <hi>Bourchier, Carew</hi> and <hi>Dowdall,</hi> with ſix hundred
Men to <hi>Waterford,</hi> and of Sir <hi>John Perrot</hi> with ſix Ships to
<hi>Cork,</hi> the Deputy made another incurſion into <hi>Connilo,</hi> but
could not meet with the Rebels, and ſo finding himſelf Sick,
he left the Army with Sir <hi>Nicholas Malby,</hi> and retired to <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,</hi>
and having Knighted <hi>Bourchier, Stanly, Carew, More,
Pelham, Gorge Perrot,</hi> and <hi>Walſh,</hi> he died the laſt day of
<hi>September,</hi> 1579.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> continued his Profeſſion of Loyalty,
and pretended to act ſeparately, but would not by any means
venture himſelf in the Camp, or in any walled Town, however
he ſent his only Son to be a hoſtage of his fidelity, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
brought the Child to the Deputy a little before his Death.</p>
                  <p>During the Interval between the Deputies ſickneſs, and the
Election of a new one, the Marſhal <hi>Malby</hi> managed the
Army, which conſiſted of nine hundred Foot, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Horſe, whereof he left fifty Horſe, and three
hundred Foot with Captain <hi>Bourchier</hi> at <hi>Killmallock,</hi> and
marched with the reſt to refreſh them at <hi>Limerick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After they had a little Reſt, the Marſhal made an incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into <hi>Connilo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cambd. Eliz. 338.</note> and at <hi>Monaſter Neva,</hi> about nine Miles from
<hi>Limerick,</hi> he met with Sir <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Rebels, and it came to a Battle, wherein the Iriſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
themſelves valiantly, and with great reſolution recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the firſt and ſecond Charge; however they could not
forget the known Maxim of ſome Men, <hi>That if the Enemy
wont run, they will,</hi> and therefore at the third Charge their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
came down, and their General, Sir <hi>John,</hi> was as nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as any of them to ſhelter himſelf in a Bog; however he
left two hundred and ſixty of his Myrmidons behind him,
who were killed upon the Spot, and amongſt them the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Legat, Doctor <hi>Allen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Kerry,</hi> from a little
Hill, hard by, were the Melancholy Spectators of this Battle;
and although <hi>Deſmond</hi> did the next day ſend a Meſſenger to
<hi>Malby</hi> to congratulate his Victory, and had put in his Son
as a pledge for his Loyalty, and although the Lord of <hi>Kerry's</hi>
Son <hi>Patrick,</hi> was a ſworn Officer to the Queen in <hi>England,</hi>
and was now come over by her Majeſties Leave, only to ſee
his Father, and although all of them are of the noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Fitz Girald,</hi> and conſequently of Engliſh Extraction;
yet they were ſo bigotted with ſenſleſs Superſtition, that the
Iriſh Prieſts (who are the moſt ignorant <hi>Clerks</hi> in the World)
could lead theſe Noblemen by the Noſe into the greateſt Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Ingratitude, and Diſloyalty that ever was known, ſo that
henceforward we muſt expect to find theſe Engliſh Lords in
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:65997:212"/>
open Rebellion with the Iriſh againſt the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The victorious <hi>Malby</hi> encamped that night by the Abby of
<hi>Monaſter Neva,</hi> and after two or three days removed to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kele,</hi>
and encamped there; a Party of the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi>'s
came confidently within a Mile of the Camp, but were well
beaten for their pains, and ſome that were taken Priſoners,
diſcovered many of <hi>Deſmond</hi>'s Deſigns, and that he had been
in the Field ever ſince the Battel of <hi>Monaſter Neva;</hi> but they
needed not to be ſo nice in their Examinations, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Night put the Matter out of doubt, and <hi>Deſmond</hi> and his
Brother did perſonally aſſault the Engliſh Camp, but came
off (as they uſed to do) with Loſs and Diſgrace; however,
the Marſhal thought it neceſſary to remove to <hi>Askeaton,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt ſetled a Garriſon at <hi>Rakeal,</hi> and he performed what
he deſigned, although the Enemy did frequently skirmiſh
with him in his March; and then having notice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty's
Death, he placed Sir <hi>William Stanly</hi> and Captain <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew</hi>
at <hi>Adare,</hi> and ſent the reſt of the Army to other Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, the Rebels inſulted at a great Rate, bragging,
that they would take all the Garriſons; and Sir <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
with four hundred Foot and fifty Horſe, actually beſieg'd
<hi>Adare;</hi> ſo that the Garriſon durſt not peep abroad till their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
failed them; and then Neceſſity whetted their Courage,
and made their Swords as ſharp as their Stomachs; ſo that
Sir <hi>John</hi> was forced to retire. The Engliſh had but one ſmall
Cot, which would hold about eight Men, and by help of it,
an hundred and twenty Men of the Garriſon of <hi>Adare</hi> were
wafted over the River,<note place="margin">Hooker, 162,</note> into the Knight of the <hi>Glinns</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and being unexpected there, they did great Execution;
but they ſtaid ſo long, that the Knight of the <hi>Glin</hi> and Sir

Foot, ſome Iriſh, and ſome <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and overtook
them, and entertain'd a brisk Skirmiſh for about eight hours;
nevertheleſs the Engliſh made good their Retreat, without
any conſiderable Loſs, and killed about fifty of the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William Pelham,</hi> Lord Juſtice, was choſen by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,<note place="margin">1579.</note>

particularly, to <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh O Reily,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh

and having committed the Care of the North-Borders to the

                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Caſhel</hi> the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> came to him with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

to the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> to repair to him, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile

where he was well received, and the Mayor Preſented
him with a thouſand Armed Citizens; here alſo he was met
by <hi>Malby</hi> and the Army; and the next day he went to a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
called <hi>Fannings,</hi> where he gave Orders for a General

<hi>Deſmond,</hi> with Letters from her Husband.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> was ſent to expoſtulate with

Anſwer, on the the thirtieth of <hi>October,</hi> complaining of
old Injuries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore other Letters were ſent from
<hi>Crome,</hi> where the Lord Juſtice then was; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for though <hi>Deſmond</hi> proteſted Loyalty, yet he would
not come to the Camp; nay he was known to act rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
even while he was writing his Proteſtation; for the
Lord Juſtice being removed to <hi>Rakeal,</hi> was allarm'd by ſome
Rebels; whereof four being killed, one was found to be <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s
Butler, and himſelf was not far off; wherefore he
was Proclaimed Traytor in the Camp, the ſecond day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
1579. unleſs he ſhould ſurrender himſelf in twenty
days; and immediately the Army proceeded to deſtroy his
Country with Fire and Sword. And it muſt not be omitted,
that the Lords of <hi>Gormanſtown</hi> and <hi>Delvin</hi> (who were of the
Council, and attended the Lord Juſtice in this Expedition)
were ſo tainted and corrupted with Popery, that they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſign the Proclamation againſt <hi>Deſmond;</hi> for which,
they were afterwards ſeverely reprimanded by a Letter from
the Lords of the Council in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the third of <hi>November,</hi> the Lord Juſtice removed to
<hi>Puble O Bryan,</hi> and Muſtered the Army, and ſo leaving two
hundred and fifty Horſe, and eight Enſigns of Foot with the
Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> he returned to <hi>Limerick.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:65997:213"/>
The Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> thought to divert the Army from
farther proſecution in <hi>Conilogh,</hi> by making an Incurſion into
<hi>Imokilly;</hi> and being there, at the requeſt of the Seneſchal
of <hi>Imokilly,</hi> he attack'd <hi>Youghal,</hi> and finding ſmall reſiſtance,
he eaſily took, and afterwards plundered that Town; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> ſent Captain <hi>White</hi> and a Company

by the numerous Forces of the Seneſchal's, <hi>White</hi> and
moſt of his Men were ſlain, and the reſt with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p>Hereupon, <hi>Deſmond</hi> grew ſo inſolent,<note place="margin">November 20. 1579.</note> that he wrote an
arrogant Letter to the Lord Juſtice, importing, that he and
his Brethren were entred into the Defence of the Catholick
Faith, under the Protection of the Pope and the King of

nine days after, he wrote Circular Letters to ſuch of the Lords

Contradiction, look upon the Engliſh as Uſurpers, whilſt

to which Place <hi>Deſmond</hi> was again returned; but did
not at all expect that Attack, ſo that moſt of the Inhabitants
were ſurprized, and either killed or taken Priſoners, and
the Villages were either plundered or burnt; the Earl
was like to be ſurprized at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and very narrowly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:
And not long after <hi>Ormond</hi> had a Bruſh with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſchal

expected ſtout and obſtinate Reſiſtance; but on the contrary,
they deſerted the Caſtle upon view of the Army, and fled
over the Water, but were ſo hotly purſued, that moſt of them
were ſlain, and a Garriſon was put into the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Head Quarters were at <hi>Adare,</hi> and it being uſual
for the Soldiers to range abroad for Forage or Plunder, <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
placed an Ambuſh ſo luckily, that it once intercepted
them; but being ſtout, and well diſciplin'd Men, they made
good their Retreat without any Diſadvantage.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Lord Juſtice (whom we left at
<hi>Limerick</hi>) marched into <hi>Thomond,</hi> where the Earl, and his
Son, and two Servants, very ill mounted, met his Lordſhip,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65997:214"/>
and waited on him to <hi>Galway;</hi> and there the Lord Juſtice
confirm'd the Priviledges of that Town,<note place="margin">1579.</note> and thence march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through <hi>Athenry, Balliniſlow</hi> and <hi>Athlone,</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
there he found <hi>William Norris,</hi> and an hundred and fifty
brave Horſe (all in a Livery of Red Coats and Yellow
Lace) newly arrived from <hi>England,</hi> which were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſent to Quarter at the <hi>Newry,</hi> where <hi>Norris</hi> died on
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Day.</p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Caſy</hi>'s Company, that was left in <hi>Galway,</hi> was
forced to hire a Houſe for the Soldiers, and the Queen paid
the Rent of it; and on the twenty eighth of <hi>November</hi> a
<hi>Cuſtodiam</hi> of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Roſs</hi> was granted to <hi>Robert
Drury,</hi> for three Years; and on the 3d. of <hi>Dec.</hi> the L. Juſtice
kept Seſſions at <hi>Trim,</hi> and cauſed 16 Malefactors to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and on the 10th of <hi>Dec.</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> O <hi>Reily</hi> made his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and the ſame day 5000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  </p>
                  <p>On the eighteenth of <hi>January</hi> the Lord Juſtice left <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
and came by the Sea-coaſt to <hi>Wexford,</hi> where he kept
Seſſions, and ſate perſonally in the Court; thence by <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi>
he came to <hi>Waterford,</hi> where he was nobly received,
and the Mayor carried the Sword before him: The Earl of
<hi>Ormond</hi> met him at <hi>Waterford;</hi> and upon Advertiſement that
the Rebels drew near <hi>Dungarvan</hi> and <hi>Youghal,</hi> Captain <hi>Zouch</hi>
was ſent with four hundred Foot, and an hundred Horſe to
oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p>On the Eleventh of <hi>February</hi> a Commiſſion of Martial
Law was ſent to Sir <hi>Warham Saint-Leger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hooker, 166.</note> and then the Lord
Juſtice, having ſtayed three Weeks at <hi>Waterford,</hi> removed to
<hi>Clonmel,</hi> where <hi>Ormond</hi> met him again, and thence he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Limerick,</hi> and had his Baggage carried a great part of
the way on Mens Shoulders, for want of Carriage-Horſes,
or becauſe of the badneſs of the Way, or both; at <hi>Limerick</hi>
the Chancellor of that Dioceſs, was found guilty of Treaſon,
for correſponding with <hi>Deſmond,</hi> but he made Shift to get
a Pardon, whilſt the Biſhop of <hi>Limerick</hi> (who was ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuſpected) was confined to his Houſe.</p>
                  <p>On the Tenth of <hi>March,</hi> the Lord Juſtice and <hi>Ormond</hi> met
at <hi>Rakele,</hi> and the next day they paſſed over the Bridge of
<hi>Adare,</hi> and returned at Night; and then they divided their
Forces, and invaded <hi>Conniloe,</hi> burning and ſpoiling the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and incamped within one Mile of <hi>Kilcolman,</hi> where
they had News that Lieutenant <hi>Parker,</hi> five Horſe, and three
Foot, coming from <hi>Limerick,</hi> were ſet upon by an hundred
Rebels, near <hi>Rakele;</hi> but they ſo behaved themſelves, that
they ſlew the Commander, and five or ſix more of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and came off with ſmall Loſs; the ſame day a Soldier
of the Marſhal's encountred two luſty Kerns, and having ſlain
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65997:215"/>
one, he compell'd the other to carry his Fellow's Head to the
Camp, where he was likewiſe ſlain.</p>
                  <p>On the twelfth of <hi>March,</hi> the Army being divided, Prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and burnt the Country to <hi>Slevelogher,</hi> as they did likewiſe
the next day, and ſlew above four hundred Men, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord <hi>Lixnaw</hi> was humbled, and made his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Juſtice having marched as far as <hi>Slewemiſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>Traley,</hi> and not being able to paſs farther, reſolved to
beſiege <hi>Carrigifoyl,</hi> which was <hi>Deſmond</hi>'s chief ſtrength, and
it was Garriſoned with nineteen <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and fifty Iriſh,
under one <hi>Julio,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Engineer: The Lord Juſtice co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to view it, had like to have been killed with a Muſquet
Shot; nevertheleſs, he perſevered in his Reſolution, and
cauſed the Caſtle to be battered with three Cannon, a Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verin,
and a demy-Culverin, till a Breach was made, at
which Captain <hi>Macworth</hi> entred and took the Caſtle, putting
fifty to the Sword, and ſix he took, and executed them in the
Camp; the Captain, <hi>Julio</hi> was preſerved two or three days
for certain Conſiderations, and then not complying with the
Lord Juſtices Expectations, he was Hanged.</p>
                  <p>On the third of <hi>April,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1580.</note> the Army ſat down before <hi>Askeaton,</hi>
which is a very ſtrong Caſtle built upon Rocks, and of

baſely deſerted the Caſtle the firſt night of the Siege, having

the Caſtle, but did not prejudice the principal Towers: The

<hi>Ballyloghane</hi> another Caſtle of <hi>Deſmond</hi>'s, which the
Garriſon upon ſight of them likewiſe deſerted, but not ſo
timely but that (being cloſely purſued) many of them were
ſlain.</p>
                  <p>Now was <hi>Deſmond</hi> diſpoſſeſſed of all his Caſtles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>However, the Army (tho in Garriſon) was not ildle, but

ſubmitted and promiſed future Loyalty, and were ordered

Pledges of Performance; but the next day they thought the
Charge too heavy, and therefore were confined to their
Chambers, till they ſent their Pledges; ſoon after Sir <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock
Mac Teig</hi> was diſmiſſed with Favour, and an Order to

being an Hundred and Fifty, were beaten, and moſt of them

Sir <hi>Warham</hi> Saint <hi>Leger,</hi> and Captain <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> who cauſed
him to be Hanged, Drawn, and Quartered at <hi>Cork.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Auguſt, Ormond</hi> diſlodged from <hi>Adare,</hi> and marched to

Army; it took them in the Head, and for two or three Days
they lay Senſeleſs, and then recovered, few or none died of it,
though by the Violence of the Diſeaſe, it was not expected
that many could recover.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ormond</hi> divided his ſmall Army into two Parts, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

eight thouſand Cows, beſides Garrons, Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſlew
a great many People, and had ſlain more, but that Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Winter</hi> (who was then in the Harbour of <hi>Ventry,</hi> with

                  <p>This <hi>Winter</hi> was Vice-Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> and came to

elſe believed they would not come in the Winter, ſo he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
home before they came.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> was reduced to great
Extremity, more of his Followers having periſhed by the

                  <p>In the mean time the new Lord Deputy landed at <hi>Dublin</hi>

<hi>Coſby,</hi> an experienced Soldier, diſſwaded the Attempt, but
having poſitive Orders, the Foot entred the <hi>Glins,</hi> whilſt the
Lord <hi>Grey</hi> with the Horſe ſcowred the Plains; but the Rebels
being well acquainted with theſe Woods,<note place="margin">Camb. Eliz. 241.</note> laid their Ambuſhes
ſo cunningly, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could neither fight in that dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
place, nor retire out of it: Courage could but little avail
them, whilſt being mired in the Bogs, they were forced to ſtand
ſtill like Butts, to be ſhot at: Diſcipline or Conduct were of

the Engliſh were defeated, and the whole Company ſlain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

                  <p>About the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> ſeven hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi>
and <hi>Italians</hi> under the Command of <hi>San Joſeph</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi>
landed at <hi>Smerwick</hi> in <hi>Kerry,</hi> being ſent by the Pope, and King
of <hi>Spain</hi> to propagate Catholick Religion in <hi>Ireland;</hi> they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
built a Fort, and called it <hi>Fort del ore,</hi> and they
fortified and furniſhed it the beſt they could, having brought
with them Money and Ammunition, and Arms enough for five
thouſand Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ormond</hi> encamped at <hi>Traley,</hi> and the next day marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Fort, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſerted, and retired to the
faſtneſs of <hi>Glanigall;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cambd. Eliz. 242.</note> but finding the Engliſh Army was ſmall,
three hundred of them went to their Fort again, and the next
day ſallied on the Engliſh, who came to view the Fort, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Ormond</hi> finding he was not ſufficiently provided with
Artillery and other Neceſſaries, retired to <hi>Rakele,</hi> where he
met the Lord Deputy.</p>
                  <p>The Deputy accompanied with the Captains, <hi>Zouch, Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,
Denny, Macworth, &amp;c.</hi> and about eight hundred Men, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
from <hi>Rakele,</hi> and marched towards the Enemy, but
Captain <hi>Rawleigh</hi> well knowing the Cuſtoms of the Iriſh,
ſtayed ſome hours behind in Ambuſh, till ſeveral Kearns came
into the forſaken Camp as they were accuſtomed, to ſcrape
<pb facs="tcp:65997:217"/>
up what was left-behind, but he ſurprized them all, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
them according to their Deſerts.</p>
                  <p>Now was Sir <hi>William Winter</hi> return'd with his Fleet out
of <hi>England,</hi> ſo that he, by Sea, and the Lord Deputy, by
Land, laid cloſe Siege to the Fort, having firſt ſummoned it,
and received for Anſwer, That <hi>they held it for the Pope and
the King of</hi> Spain (to whom the Pope had given the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland;</hi>) and not long after, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made a
Sally, which was well received by Captain <hi>Denny,</hi> and the
Aſſailants were forced to retire.</p>
                  <p>That Night the Engliſh raiſed a Battery with great dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<note place="margin">Cambd. Eliz. 242.</note>
which was ready by Break of Day; nevertheleſs, the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> made a Sally, but very faintly, and without effect;
nor did they do any thing the third Day worthy their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and on the fourth Day, being cloſe preſſed from Land
and Sea, and all Conditions refuſed, they yielded at Mercy;
which was too ſparingly extended to them, every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put to death except the Commanders; which very much
diſpleaſed the Queen, although there was a neceſſity for it,
by reaſon of the paucity of the Engliſh Army, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Rebels approaching.</p>
                  <p>Sir John <hi>Fitz-Girald,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Decies,</hi> being a Priſoner
to the Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> was here found and ſet at Liberty;
the Fort was razed, and the Army diſperſed into Garriſons;
the Lord Deputy returned to <hi>Dingle,</hi> where <hi>Ormond</hi> met him
with Supplies, and there Captain <hi>Zouch,</hi> with four hundred
and fifty Men was left Governor of <hi>Kerry</hi> and <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and
had all the Victuals given him that were found in the Fort,
and then the Deputy returned to <hi>Limerick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now came out of <hi>England</hi> ſix new Companies, under

                  <p>The Deputy having left <hi>Ormond</hi> Governor of <hi>Munſter,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

Power upon Earth Commands us to take the Sword, and to

                  <p>Queſtionleſs it is a great want of Knowledge, and more of
Grace to believe that a Woman Incapax of Holy Orders,

<hi>Butler alias Becket</hi> had never been Earl of <hi>Ormond, &amp;c.</hi> and

The Lord Deputy having thus ſecured the Country, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
ſome Ships to <hi>Loghfoyle</hi> to attack the <hi>Scots</hi> that way,
which they got notice of, and immediately retired and went

                  <p>
                     <hi>Norris</hi> took a prey of 200 Cows from <hi>Ochane,</hi> which gave
great relief to the Army, but 100 of his ſtragling Boys and
Servants were cut off by <hi>Brian Carrows</hi> men, and ſome that
came to their Reſcue were wounded; and ſoon after Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

preyed <hi>Brian Carrows</hi> Country, and ſlew them that were

                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Ochane</hi> ſubmitted and put in Hoſtages, and was
the firſt Rebel in Arms that was pardoned ſince the Deputy
came over; then went the Deputy to beſiege <hi>Dunluce,</hi> and
ſent Artillery by Sea to <hi>Skerries portruſh,</hi> and thence by men
it was drawn two miles; it ſoon brought the Ward to parley,
and to ſurrender this impregnable place; and the fame of this
Exploit made the Warders deſert <hi>Donfert,</hi> and theſe loſſes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

he caus'd them to implead one another by Bill and
Anſwer, that ſo thoſe Conteſts might be regularly decided;
he alſo gave them an Oath of Allegiance, and drew the
Grandees of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> to a Compoſition for the maintenance of

the Lady <hi>Camphell,</hi> and <hi>Donell Gorme,</hi> made their Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
at the Camp near <hi>Dunluce</hi> on the 18th of <hi>September,</hi>
and obtain'd a Grant of that part of the <hi>Glinns</hi> formerly <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi>
paying 50 Bieves yearly, and ſupplying 80 Soldiers to
ſerve the Crown when required: And ſo the Deputy left 200
Foot and 50 Horſe at <hi>Colrain,</hi> and came to <hi>Newry</hi> on the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:65997:224"/>
28th of <hi>September,</hi> to which place <hi>Turlogh Lynogh</hi> brought
<hi>Henry,</hi> Son of <hi>Shan O Neal,</hi> and delivered him priſoner to his
Lordſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Con mac Neal Oge</hi> was forc'd to content himſelf with the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

was divided between <hi>Turlogh Lynogh,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Dungannon,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Henry Bagnall;</hi> and this great Service being thus
effected, the Deputy return'd to <hi>Dublin</hi> the 11 of <hi>October.</hi>
Hence the Deputy gave an account to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
in <hi>England</hi> of his great Succeſs, and propoſed that for
50000 <hi>per annum</hi> added to the Revenue for three years, he
would wall ſeaven Towns, <hi>Athloan, Dingle, Colrain, Liffer, Sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
Newry,</hi> and <hi>Mayo,</hi> and build ſeaven Caſtles at <hi>Black-water,</hi>

in the <hi>Routs, Galin</hi> in the Queens County, and <hi>Kilcomane,</hi>
and erect ſeaven Bridges at <hi>Colrain, Liffer, Balliſhannon,
Dundalk, Fermoy, Veale</hi> near <hi>Slevelogher,</hi> and <hi>Kells</hi> in <hi>Clande-boy;</hi>
and with the help of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Compoſition he would
likewiſe maintain 2000 Foot, and 400 Horſe, during that
time; he deſired 600 Soldiers and a Chief Juſtice might
be ſent over, that <hi>Tamiſtry</hi> might be aboliſhed, and the Iriſh
Lands paſs'd in Patent to the Proprietors on Engliſh Tenures;
to all which he received a ſmooth but dilatory Anſwer, and
therefore wrote again to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> the 17 of
<hi>January</hi> 1584. to the ſame effect, and with like ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs this active Governour proceeded to doe what
he could to repair the broken and miſerable Eſtate of <hi>Ireland;</hi>
he encouraged the Biſhops to the Repair of Churches, and
wrote to <hi>England</hi> that no more Biſhopricks might be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>in Comendam;</hi> and he alſo divided <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> into Counties,
and placed Sheriffs, Juſtices of Peace, Conſtables, and other
Officers in them.</p>
                  <p>And then he ſummoned a Parliament to meet the 26th of
<hi>April,</hi> 1585. at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and cauſed the Iriſh to conform to the
Engliſh Habit to which they have a great averſion, becauſe
they eſteem it a mark of Subjection. The Iriſh Lords were
obliged to wear Robes, and the better to induce them to it,
the Deputie beſtowed Robes on <hi>Turlogh Lynogh,</hi> and other
principal men of the Iriſh, which they embraced like fetters;
ſo that one of them deſired the Deputy that his Chaplain
might walk the ſtreets with him in Trouſes, <hi>For then,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>the Boys will laugh at him as well as at me;</hi> whereto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
gravely replyed, That the want of Order and Decency
would be their Ruine, and demonſtrated to them the Benefits
of this Conformity.</p>
                  <p>But before we come to the Parliament I muſt take notice
of an Inquiſition taken at <hi>Cork</hi> on the 4th of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1584.

It was endeavoured to paſs a Law to try Acceſſaries

The Lord Deputy did intend to ſuſpend <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Act, that
he might the more ſpeedily paſs ſuch Laws as he thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
but ſome Gentlemen of the Pale grew jealous of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and overthrew the Bill at the third reading; and although
upon a conference they were perſuaded to paſs the Bill, yet
their jealouſies returning, they overthrew it a ſecond time.</p>
                  <p>There were alſo other Bills propoſed; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lands
of perſons attainted of Treaſon ſhould be veſted in the Queen
without Office, and every Plowland ſhould pay 13 <hi>s. 4 d.</hi>
ſubſidy; and that all thoſe who ſhould rebelliouſly take or
detain any of the Queen's Caſtles, ſhould be guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but theſe Bills were all damned in the Lower-houſe,
and the Acts againſt fraudulent Conveyances, and an Act
to help miſpleading and Jeoffails were ſtopt in the Upper-houſe;
and an Act to enable Tenant in Tail to make Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
for 21 years could not obtain the Royal Aſſent.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Seſſion of this Parliament was on the 28th of
<hi>April</hi> 1586. and then the following Laws being enacted, it

                  <p>3. An Act againſt forging of Evidences.</p>
                  <p>4. An Act of Impoſt and Cuſtome of Wines.</p>
                  <p>5. That all Conveyances made, or pretended to be made,
by any perſon attainted within thirteen years before the Act,
ſhall be entered on Record in the Exchequer within a year,
or be void.</p>
                  <p>This Act did not paſs the Houſes without great difficulty,

                  <p>But the Lord Deputy was again allarm'd with a new Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the Deputy thought it neceſſary to march into the North

Progreſs was, yet the Deputy's Enemies complain'd againſt

                  <p>The chief Articles againſt the Deputy were, That he was
ſevere, and forc'd the People to the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and pryed
into men's Patents, and endeavour'd to promote Laws againſt
Recuſants, and to repeal <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Act, and this Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was abetted by the Chancellour, whom (being alſo Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Dublin</hi>) the Deputy had diſoblig'd, by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to appropriate the Revenues of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church to
the new deſign'd Univerſity, and by carrying himſelf too
Magiſterially in the Government; with the Chancellour Sir
<hi>Henry Bagnal,</hi> Secretary <hi>Fenton,</hi> and others of the Council,
ſided, ſo that it grew into a powerfull Faction, by which the
Deputy was often thwarted at Council Board, and elſe where.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England</hi> was a faſt Friend to the
Arch-biſhop, ſo that by his means the appropriating
of the Livings of <hi>St. Patrick</hi>'s Church was ſtopt,
and other Affronts were put upon the Deputy, which ſo
enraged him, that he ſpoke ſome paſſionate words of the
Queen, which were the cauſe of his Ruine afterwards; and
particularly having received ſome kind Letters from the
Queen after ſome ill uſage that he reſented: <hi>Look ye,</hi> ſays he
to the ſtanders by, <hi>now the Queen is ready to bepiſs her ſelf for
fear of the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>I am become her white Boy again:</hi> This
Deputy was ſuppoſed to be the Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and
had much of his towring Spirit in him: When he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
he ask'd the Lieutenant of the Tower <hi>whether the
Queen would ſacrifice her Brother, to his frisking Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
meaning the Lord Chancellour <hi>Hatton,</hi> who he ſaid
came into Court by the <hi>Galliard:</hi> He was condemn'd on
the Preiſts forged Letter, and dyed ſuddenly in the Tower;
and his Son Sir <hi>Thomas Perot</hi> was reſtor'd to his Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Nor did theſe his open Enemies only impeach him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but they alſo inſtigated the Lords and Gentlemen of
the Pale, (as was believed) to complain (by their Letter of the
15th of <hi>July,</hi> 1585.) that beſides the 2100 <hi>l.</hi> which they had
conſented ſhould be levyed in lieu of the Ceſs; the Lord
Deputy deſign'd to impoſe a ſecond Charge of 1500 <hi>l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>

intolerable to them; but ſome of theſe Lords and Gentlemen

                  <p>One <hi>Dennis O Raughan</hi> a Prieſt, and <hi>Henry Bird</hi> Regiſter

                     <hi>John Williams</hi> betrayed him and diſcovered his Secrets, but

Iſlanders, who to the number of 2000 came to aſſiſt them,
and contracted to expell the Engliſh out of <hi>Connaugh,</hi> and
were to have a Proportion of Land for their pains: The

Cows, whereof 3000 were divided amongſt the Army, and

a Troup of Horſe: The Lord Preſident himſelf with the
reſt of the Forces was not ſo far behind, but he could come
to their relief, if they ſhould happen to be diſtreſſed. The
Engliſh Army ſtaid fourteen days at <hi>Sligo,</hi> and the Rebels
marched through <hi>Leitrim,</hi> over the Curlew Mountains into

                  </p>
                  <p>Upon rumour of the Deputy's remove, the Lords and

to keep correſpondence with the Engliſh of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and to inform him of the State, Condition, Inclination, and

                  <p>But the Deputy's Enemies were reſtleſs, and had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to write a very querimonious Letter to the Queen, in
the Name of <hi>Turlogh Lynogh;</hi> but <hi>Turlogh</hi> (as ſoon as he
had notice of it,) ſent his Secretary <hi>Solomon</hi> to <hi>England</hi> to
diſown it, and to applaud the Deputy's Government: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Deputy being tired with theſe Contrivances, reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratred
his Requeſts to the Queen, to be diſcharged of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
which at length was granted; and ſo having firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
pledges of all the conſiderable Iriſh, he reſigned to,</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William Fitz Williams,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1588.</note> Lord Deputy, who was ſworn
on the 30th of <hi>June</hi> 1588. He had formerly been a very
good Governour in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but being anſwered at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
(when he ſought ſome reward for his Services,) that
the Goverment of <hi>Ireland</hi> was a Preferment, and not a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he ever after endeavoured to make his Profit of that
Office.</p>
                  <p>It was not long after his coming before the Invincible
Armado was forced to coaſt about <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo that many
of them became ſhipwreck'd on the Northern Shoars of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to the number of 17 Ships and 5394 Men. By this
Shipwreck much Treaſure (which belonged to the Queen
by her Prerogative) fell into the hands of the Natives: The
Deputy iſſued out a Commiſſion to make enquiry after it;
but that proving ineffectual, and he being deſirous to have
a Finger in the Pie, went perſonally into <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> in <hi>November,</hi>
to the great Charge of the Queen and Countrey, but to
very little purpoſe; whereupon he grew ſo enraged, that
he impriſoned Sir <hi>Owen O Toole,</hi> and <hi>O Dogherty,</hi> who were
the beſt affected to the State of all the Iriſh; and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
he kept in Priſon during his time, and the other he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
two years, untill he was forced to purchaſe his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
                  <p>One of the <hi>O Neals,</hi> by Name <hi>Hugh ne Gavelock,</hi> Baſtard
Son of <hi>Shane O Neal,</hi> (or rather <hi>Connor Mac Shane,</hi>) diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the Deputy, that <hi>Tyrone</hi> had cheriſhed and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65997:232"/>
ſeveral of the ſhipwrecked Spaniards, and had entered
into Combinations with them, prejudicial to the State; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Tyrone</hi> having notice, he uſed effectual means to get the
Informer into his power, and cauſed him to be hang'd,
though for the reſpect they bore to the Name of <hi>O Neal,</hi> it
was exceeding difficult to find an Iriſhman that would be the
Executioner.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems the Deputy made another journey to <hi>Connaugh,</hi>
for on the 20th of <hi>June</hi> 1589. at <hi>Gallwey</hi> Sir <hi>Morrogh O Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>

                     <hi>William Burk</hi> the blind Abbot, and ſeveral Rebels of
<hi>Mayo</hi> and <hi>Ter Conagh</hi> ſubmitted to the Deputy on theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
1. To put in ſuch Pledges as the Deputy ſhould
name. 2. To diſperſe their Forces and live quietly. 3. To
deliver up the Sparniards and Portugueiſes they had. 4. To
make amends for all ſpoils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince the 30th of <hi>May</hi> laſt.
5. To make ſuch amends for former ſpoils as Commiſſioners
to be appointed by the Deputy ſhall adjudge. 6. To pay
ſuch Fine as the Lord Deputy thinks fit. 7. This being
perform'd they ſhall have pardons. Mr. <hi>Sullivane</hi> aſſures us,
that there were 1000 Spaniards under <hi>Antomo de Leva,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sullevan 121.</note> relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>O Rourk,</hi> and <hi>Mac Swyny na Doo;</hi> and that the Iriſh
urged the Spaniards to aſſiſt them, and they would eaſily
firſt relieve <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then conquer <hi>England;</hi> but that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> refuſed for want of Commiſſion, but promiſed to
return with competent Force to effect thoſe Deſigns; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were miſtaken, for the Ship foundered, and they
were all drown'd in fight of the Harbour; while they were
on Land, the Queen's Officers deſir'd leave to aſſail the
Spaniards, but theſe noble Catholicks deny'd that, alleadging
it was unlawfull to ſuffer any prejudice to thoſe good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
whom they had taken into Protection.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>O Rourk,</hi> and <hi>Mac Swiny,</hi> well knowing that Sir <hi>R. Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Connaugh,</hi> would not take this at their
hands, entertained <hi>Morough ne Mart</hi> and 200 <hi>Munſter</hi>-men
in their pay,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and with this ſmall Force, and ſome few of
their own followers, they took the Field. <hi>Bingham,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> did the like, and ſurpriſed
the Iriſh at <hi>Droumathier,</hi> where <hi>Morough ne Mart</hi> loſt his
Eye by a ſhot; but by the valour of <hi>Roger mac Donall Swiny</hi>
(my Autour's Unkle,) the Iriſh made a gallant Retreat.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Morough ne Mart</hi> having cured his Eye,<note place="margin">Sullevan 122.</note> was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Heart by <hi>O Rourk</hi>'s Daughter, whom he firſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed,
and then ſent her home to her Father. Hereat <hi>O
Rourk</hi> grew ſo angry, that <hi>Morough</hi> and his Soldiers would
ſtay with him no longer; ſo that <hi>O Rourk</hi> was forced to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
himſelf to <hi>Mac Swiny na Doo,</hi> who very generouſly
made him <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of his Forces; but I ſuppoſe he found
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65997:232"/>
but ill quarters there, for it was not long before he went to
the King of <hi>Scots;</hi> but he being no Friend to Rebels, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Camd. Eliz. 447.</note> who had him tryed,
condemned, and hanged.</p>
                  <p>Of this <hi>O Rourk</hi> there go two pleaſant Stories; one, that
being asked why he did not bow his Knee to the Queen, he
anſwered that he was not uſed to bow:<note place="margin">Sullevan 122.</note> 
                     <hi>How! not to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?</hi>
ſays an Engliſh Lord: <hi>Ay,</hi> ſays <hi>O Rourk, but there is a
great deal of difference between your Queen and the Images
of the Saints:</hi> The other, that he gravely petitioned the
Queen,<note place="margin">Bacon's Eſſays.</note> not for Life, or Pardon, but that he might be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

which doubtleſs was readily granted him!</p>
                  <p>Upon the death of <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> who had taken a Patent
for the County of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> his Brother and Heir, <hi>Hugh
Roe,</hi> petitioned the Deputy to be ſettled in his Inheritance;
and the Iriſh ſay it coſt him ſix hundred Cows to get a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of it: At length the Deputy would go in perſon to
doe it, but inſtead of that, as ſoon as he came to <hi>Monaghan,</hi>
he impriſoned, tried, and condemned <hi>Mac Mahon,</hi> for levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Forces two year before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to diſtrain for Rent he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
due to him in the <hi>Ferny.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Camd. Eliz. 447.</note> The Iriſh ſay he had hard
meaſure, and inſtance much foul practice in the Proſecution
and Tryall; but however that be, the poor Gentleman was
hang'd, and his Countrey divided between Sir <hi>Henry Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>
Cap. <hi>Henſlow,</hi> and four of the <hi>Mac Mahouns,</hi> under a
yearly Rent, each of them giving conſiderable Bribes to the
Deputy, as they ſaid in their Complaint to the Council of
<hi>England;</hi> but the Lord Deputy in his Anſwer did vindicate
himſelf from theſe unjuſt Aſperſitions, or at leaſt endeavour
to doe ſo; however it muſt be obſerved, that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
the Iriſh loathed Sheriffs, and the Engliſh Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
as fearing in time they might all follow the Fate
of <hi>Mac Mahoun;</hi> and therefore in the great Treaty near <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk</hi>
in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1595. they all deſired to be exempted from
Gariſons, Sheriffs, and other Officers.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>May</hi> 1590. the Earl of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>trained of his Liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he came over without the Deputy's Licence; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ſubmiſſion he was diſcharged of his Confinement, and
came to a new Agreement with the Queen, (which is to be
found at large, <hi>Moriſon</hi> 9.) and offered Hoſtages thereof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they might be kept in ſome Merchant's Houſe in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
or ſome Gentleman's Houſe in the Pale, and be exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
every three Months. The reaſon why he was ſo much
favour'd and truſted was, becauſe he adviſed the ſuppreſſion
of the Name of <hi>O Neal,</hi> which was really of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65997:233"/>
and he was believ'd to be ſincere, becauſe, being the
Son of a Baſtard, he could have no pretence to it, and it
ſtood not with his intereſt that any body elſe ſhould have it;
and ſo his Power and Authority was in <hi>England</hi> thought to
to be a Bridle upon <hi>Turlogh Lynogh,</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Shane O
Neal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 28th of <hi>May</hi> 1590. ſeaventy one Soldiers of Sir
<hi>Thomas Norris</hi>'s Company mutinied for want of Pay; they
came arm'd to the Caſtle Gate: The Deputy offered them
two month's Pay, but they inſiſted upon all; whereupon he
courageouſly cauſed the Gate to be opened, and ſent them a
Meſſage, that whoever entered the Caſtle ſhould be hanged
as a Traitour; they anſwered, that they did not intend to
enter; upon that the Deputy rode out to Church, Sir <hi>Geo-Carew,</hi>
Maſter of the Ordnance, bearing the Sword before
him: the Mutiniers made a Guard for him, and begg'd his
Lordſhip would conſider them; but he briskly rode up to
one of them, and finding many Gentlemen behind him, he
ordered them to diſarm the Mutiniers; but they prevented
it by laying down their Arms, and placing themſelves on
their Knees, ſupplicated his Lordſhip's favour: and though
they were tied two and two together, and ſent to <hi>Newgate,</hi>
to vindicate the Authority which they had affronted, yet,
becauſe their Indigencies were great, I ſuppoſe they came off
without much ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>About <hi>December</hi> four conſiderable Priſoners eſcaped out of
the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">December, 1590.</note> not without the privity of a great
Man, well bribed, as was ſuppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the two Sons of
<hi>Shane O Neal, O Donell</hi>'s Son, and <hi>Philip O Reily;</hi> but the
Weather being very bad, and the Journey tedious, <hi>Art O

eſcaped to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> where the two other Sons of <hi>Shane O

anno</hi> 1594. who kept them Priſoners, and would by
no means enlarge them, or deliver them to the Deputy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tyrone</hi> on the 9th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> appeared at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the Agreement he had made in <hi>England;</hi> but when
he was urged to the performance of it, the uſed many ſhifts,
and delays, and deſired the like ſecurity might be requir'd of
his Nighbours.</p>
                  <p>This Winter <hi>Turlogh Lynogh</hi>'s Men were wounded by <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>'s,
and the next Summer the Marſhal <hi>Bagnall</hi>'s Siſter
was taken away, and married to the Earl of <hi>Tyrone;</hi> ſo that
he became again obnoxious to the State, and odious to the
Marſhal, becauſe he had another Wife then living.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore on the 16th of <hi>July</hi> he wrote to the Lords of
the Council in <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Turlogh</hi>'s Men were preying
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65997:233"/>
his Country, and were killed by their own fault; and in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
following he wrote to the Deputy, that the Marſhal's
Siſter married him voluntarily, and that he was lawfully
divorced from his former Wife.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time (<hi>viz. July 1591.) Tyrone</hi> was made a
County, and divided into eight Baronies, <hi>Dungannon</hi> being
appointed for the Shire-town; which, amongſt other things,
and particularly the Authority of Marſhal <hi>Bagnall,</hi> ſo fretted
<hi>Tyrone,</hi> that 'tis believed it was this Summer confederated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the reſt of the Iriſh, to defend their pretended
Rights and Religion againſt all Heretical Oppoſers, and not
to admit Sheriffs into their Countries.</p>
                  <p>This Winter Commiſſioners ſate at <hi>Monaghan,</hi> in order to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the Country on the Queen's Patentees, and had 100 Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
for their Guard; they were allarmed and diſturbed at
the rumour, that <hi>Con Tyrone</hi>'s Son was appoaching, for which
<hi>Tyrone</hi> was blam'd; but he anſwered, <hi>That they were frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the ſight of two Horſemen, there being no more near them

a Traitor: 2. That he correſponded with <hi>O Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi>

commended him for his Service againſt <hi>Macguire,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
him innocent of the Crimes laid to his charge, and
chid the Marſhal for his partiality: Nevertheleſs it is plain,
that this cunning Earl at this very time plotted that formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Rebellion which afterward broke out; and in order to
it he uſed two Strategems: 1. Having ſix Companies under
his Command at the Queen's pay, he altered and changed
the men ſo often, that thereby his whole Country became
diſciplin'd Soldiers. 2. He got a great quantity of Lead into
his poſſeſſion, under pretence of building a ſtately Houſe at

                  <p>But as ſoon as the Queen was informed thereof, ſhe

<hi>Iniskelling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Deputy marched from <hi>Dublin</hi> the 19th.<note place="margin">Auguſt. 1594.</note> and came to

<hi>Drumdone,</hi> and the next day paſſed the Bogs, and marched
eleven Miles to the Hill of <hi>Killargan;</hi> on the 28th he went
over other Bogs with great danger, and came to <hi>Ballaghnimer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
and on the 29th to <hi>Glacknemanſha;</hi> on the 30th his
Lordſhip with great difficulty, and ſome loſs, paſſed the River
with 500 Men, and entered the Caſtle of <hi>Iniskelling</hi> without

<hi>Iniskelling</hi> being thus relieved, the Deputy retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

On the 16th of <hi>January</hi> the Deputy took a Hunting Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to <hi>Ballynecor,</hi> and drove <hi>Pheah Mac Hugh</hi> into the <hi>Glinnes,</hi>
and gariſon'd Captain <hi>Street</hi>'s Company in his Houſe, and the

brought in daily; but on the 30th of <hi>January, Girald,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Walter Riagh,</hi> with fourſcore Men, came and burnt
<hi>Crumlin,</hi> within two Miles of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This bold Attempt obliged the Deputy to another Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Ballynecor;</hi> he ſet out the firſt of <hi>February,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
fortifying at <hi>Ballynecor</hi> till the 20th; at which time
he return'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> having deſtroy'd <hi>Girald,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi>
the two Brothers of <hi>Walter Riagh,</hi> and ſome few more of the
Rebels; and about the beginning of <hi>April Walter Riagh</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was taken in a Cave by Sir <hi>Henry Harrington,</hi> and ſent
to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where he was hanged in Chains.</p>
                  <p>On the 11th of <hi>April</hi> the Deputy began another Journey
into the Country of <hi>Wexford,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1595.</note> and for ſome time encamped
at a place called <hi>Money:</hi> and it ſeems the manner of encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
then was in ſmall Cabbins, built on purpoſe, and not
in Tents, as it is in foreign Countries. He returned to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
the 15th of <hi>May,</hi> having taken the Wife and Siſter of
<hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh,</hi> and ſlain or executed ſeveral of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the North was unquiet, and <hi>Monaghan</hi>
was in diſtreſs; for <hi>Tyrone,</hi> notwithſtanding all his Oaths
and Aſſeverations,<note place="margin">Camd. Eliz. 494.</note> did now again appear publickly in Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
wherefore on the 24th of <hi>May</hi> Marſhal <hi>Bagnall</hi> (who
was Lieutenant General in this Expedition) marched with
1500 Foot and 250 Horſe from the <hi>Newry,</hi> and encamped
that night at <hi>Eight-Mile-Church: Tyrone</hi> with 1500 Horſe
appeared within half a Mile of the Camp, but without skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
retired; on the 25th the Army marched eight Miles
farther, and at a Paſs were oppoſed by <hi>Tyrone,</hi> but after a
Skirmiſh of three hours, the Engliſh forc'd the Paſs, and
marched that night to <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and obliged <hi>Macguire</hi> and
<hi>Mac Mahon</hi> to raiſe their Siege.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> encamped that Night on a Hill by the Abby
of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being united made up 8000 Foot
and 1000 Horſe, and drew up within a Mile of them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they did nothing more than allarm the Engliſh once
or twice that night; but the next day they guarded all the
Straits and Paces, reſolving to hinder the return of the
Army; but the Marſhal having recruited the Fort of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naghan</hi>
with Men and Victuals, marched homeward another
way, which the Rebels perceiving, they haſtened to poſſeſs
a Strait which the Engliſh muſt of neceſſity paſs through,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65997:236"/>
and there they entertained a ſmart Fight, to the ſlaughter of
twenty Engliſhmen, and the wounding of ninety; their
own loſs amounted to three or four hundred; but if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel's
Powder had not been all ſpent, this Encounter had been
more unfortunate to the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>That night the Royaliſts were forced to lodge in the
midſt of the Enemy, which might have been fatal to them,
if the Rebels had had any Amunition left; they ſent to
<hi>Dungannon</hi> for ſupply, but none came; ſo that the Queen's
Army got back ſafe to <hi>Newry,</hi> the Iriſh not thinking they
would take that way, being in the mean time buſie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
their March towards <hi>Dundalk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>General <hi>Norris,</hi> and other Captains, brought over 2000
old and 1000 new Soldiers, which the Deputy had ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſent for, and they were refreſhing themſelves in their

                  <p>In the mean time Captain <hi>George Bingham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">June.</note> and the Ward

                  <p>Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> had the Title of Lord General,<note place="margin">Camd. Eliz. 509.</note> and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

the abſence of the Deputy: The claſhings and janglings that
were between theſe two high ſpirited Men did very much

at <hi>Melli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

O Donell, O Rourk, Macguire,</hi> and <hi>Mac Mahon,</hi> were proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Traitours, both in Engliſh and Iriſh.</p>
                  <p>This perjured Rebel <hi>Tyrone,</hi> after ſo many reiterated Oaths
and Proteſtations, had beſieg'd and taken the Fort of <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi>
and invaded the <hi>Brenny,</hi> and laid Siege to <hi>Monaghan</hi>
in <hi>April</hi> laſt, and publickly appear'd in Rebellion, and yet
at the ſame time he wrote Letters to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Henry Wallop,</hi> to intercede for his Pardon, promiſing
future Allegiance; he alſo wrote Letters to General <hi>Norris</hi>
to the ſame purpoſe, which indeed were intercepted and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
by Marſhal <hi>Bagnall,</hi> till after the Proclamation; but
what ſeems moſt ſtrange,<note place="margin">Camd. Eliz. 508.</note> is, that whilſt this was doing, like
a ſhameleſs <hi>Ambo-dexter,</hi> he offered his ſervice to the Earl
of <hi>Kildare,</hi> to revenge the Injuries that Earl had ſuffered from
the State; and in <hi>September</hi> following <hi>Tyrone</hi> and <hi>O Donell</hi>
wrote Letters to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> offering, or rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to that Majeſty, if he would
ſupply them with 3000 Men, and a little Treaſure. Theſe
and many other of his Tricks being diſcovered, the Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
never to pardon <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and of that opinion ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65997:236"/>
to her dying day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though at laſt ſhe was prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by her Council to act contrary to her own ſentiments
in that particular; but ſhe was willing to pardon <hi>O Donell,</hi>
or any, or all of the Confederates that would ſeparate from
<hi>O Neal,</hi> and ſhe gave Orders accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The Rebels were 1000 Horſe and 6280 Foot in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and
2300 in <hi>Connaugh,</hi> many of them well diſciplined; for Sir
<hi>John Perot,</hi> to ſave Charges, arm'd the Iriſh in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> againſt
the Iſlander Scots, and to taught them the uſe of Arms, to
the ruine of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and Sir <hi>William Eitz Williams</hi> took ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Iriſh into the Army, and improvidently ſent others of
them into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> where they became excellent
Soldiers, and returned to be ſtout Rebels.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis time to return to the Deputy, who left <hi>Dundalk</hi> the
24th. <hi>O Mc lloy</hi> carrying the Standard that day, as <hi>O Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
did the next; the 28th they came near <hi>Armagh,</hi> and ſaw
a Troup of the Enemy's Horſe at a diſtance; the 29th
they marched a mile beyond <hi>Armagh,</hi> and took a reſolution
to fortifie it: On the 30th the Rebels gave two Volleys of
Shot into the Camp, and yet did no harm; on the 3d of
<hi>July,</hi> the Deputy (leaving a Gariſon in <hi>Armagh</hi>) marched
nine Miles towards the <hi>Newry;</hi> but being ſupply'd with
Victuals, he return'd to <hi>Armagh</hi> on the 5th, and marched
to <hi>Monaghan</hi> on the 7th, and afterwards to the Pace of the
<hi>Moyry,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Dundalk</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
arrived the 18th; and in all theſe Marches, though
the Enemy appear'd in view, yet being light of Heel, and
cowardly of Heart, there happened not any Encounter or
Skirmiſh worth mentioning.</p>
                  <p>On the 11th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> General <hi>Norris</hi> (who was alſo
Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter</hi>) marched the Army northward,
but it ſeems he could not hinder but that all the Cows of the
<hi>Newry</hi> were taken by the Rebels; he had a skirmiſh
with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> wherein both the <hi>Norriſes</hi> were wounded; and
though <hi>Tyrone</hi> was forced to retreat, yet the ſucceſs of this
encounter is not much to be boaſted of; for if the Rebels
loſt moſt Men, the Engliſh loſt moſt Horſes.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Connaught</hi> being alſo enflamed, ſome Forces were ſent
thither to the valiant Governour Sir <hi>Richard Bingham,</hi> and
that the Deputy might be nearer to aſſiſt, either in <hi>Connaught</hi>
or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> as the Exigency of their reſpective Affairs ſhould
require, he removed to <hi>Kelles,</hi> where he ſtaid ſome time;
but <hi>Norris</hi> having reliev'd and recruited <hi>Monaghan,</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was diſperſed into Winter Quarters, and both the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
and the General returned to <hi>Dublin</hi> the 11th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                  </p>

How averſe ſoever the Queen was in her own mind from
pardoning <hi>Tyrone,</hi> becauſe ſhe was taught by long experience
of him, that he was not to be retain'd in obedience any
longer than the neceſſity of his Affairs oblig'd him to it;
yet upon the importunity and advice of <hi>Ormond, Norris,</hi>
and others, ſhe did give a Commiſſion to treat with him,
and ſeveral ineffectual Parleys were had thereupon; but at
length,<note place="margin">Camb. Eliz. 510.</note> on the 27th of <hi>October,</hi> they made a Truce to the
firſt of <hi>January</hi> in expectation of his Pardon, and he made
a conditional Submiſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh</hi> came in, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Deputy upon his Knees, and was pardon'd, and
the next day Captain <hi>Richard Wingfield</hi> was Knighted in
<hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">9. November, 1595.</note> and was the worthy Anceſtour of the Viſcounts
of <hi>Powerſcourt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 10th of <hi>November</hi> the Deputy ſet out toward <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
to receive the Submiſſion of the <hi>Burks,</hi> and hear the
Complaints againſt Sir <hi>Richard Bingham;</hi> but <hi>O Donell,</hi> full
of expectations of aid from <hi>Spain,</hi> diſſuaded the <hi>Burks</hi> from
coming; but they ſent their Complaints in writing, as did
many others; and the Deputy returned to <hi>Dublin</hi> the 15th
of <hi>December.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us return to the moſt hypocritical Traitour that
ever was in the World, the famous <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who in his laſt
ſubmiſſion had offered to renounce the name of <hi>O Neale,</hi> and
to be a good Subject for the future, if he might have a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for what was paſt; but being now puft up with hopes of
Spaniſh aſſiſtance, he did not only neglect ſueing out his
Pardon, but alſo ſuffered his Son <hi>Con,</hi> and <hi>O Donell,</hi> and <hi>Mac
Mahon</hi> to break the Truce he and they had ſo lately made, by
ſurprizing the Caſtle of <hi>Monaghan;</hi> however on the eighth of
<hi>January,</hi> a new Commiſſion iſſued to Sir <hi>Robert Gardiner,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Henry Wallop</hi> to conclude a peace with them.</p>
                  <p>This Treaty was very ſolemn, and all the Iriſh Potentates
made their Complaints and Petitions,<note place="margin">Camb. Eliz. 511.</note> which are recited at
large by <hi>Fienes Moriſon, pag.</hi> 113. The Commiſſioners were
very deſirous to eſtabliſh a Peace if poſſible, and therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to relieve them in their real Grievances, and to redreſs
their juſt Complaints; but the Iriſh interpreting this condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention
to be the effect of Weakneſs, and the ill condition of
the Engliſh Affairs, inſiſted upon very unreaſonable Terms:
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. A general Liberty of Conſcience; (although none
of them had ever been proſecuted or diſturbed about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
before that time.) 2. A general Pardon for all. 3. That
no Gariſon,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>M.</hi> Lam.</note> Sheriff, or Officer, ſhould remain in any of their
Countries, <hi>Newry</hi> and <hi>Carigfergus</hi> excepted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:65997:237"/>
Nay they were ſo ſtiff, that they refuſed to come to <hi>Dundalk</hi>
on the Oaths and Protection of the Commiſſioners, ſo that
five of a ſide were neceſſitated to meet in the open Field, their
reſpective Troups being half a mile diſtant, and two of the
adverſe Party between the Commiſſioners and the ſeveral
Troups to prevent Treachery; ſo that all this trouble and
charge produced nothing but a Truce to the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> 1596.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Tyrone</hi> would not drop his deſign ſo; his aim was to
ſpin out the time in fruitleſs Treaties, whereby the Queen's
Army and Treaſure would be waſted in Gariſon to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and his own Forces be better diſciplin'd, and encourag'd,
and (as he hoped) ſupplied, and increaſed by the Acceſſion of the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> he therefore wheedled the General to that degree,
that <hi>Norris</hi> procured a new Commiſſion to himſelf, and <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
Secretary of State, to make a final end with all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
which bears date the Ninth day of <hi>March,</hi> 1595.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Moor,</hi> who carried <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Pardon, could not
find that Earl, who purpoſely went out of the way
to avoid it; for three Pinaces, with about 200 men, and
ſome Powder arrived from <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> conſigned to <hi>O Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi>
with promiſe of farther ſupply, as is moſt probable; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Lords were ſo far from obſerving the late Peace,
that <hi>Tyrone</hi> took upon him to make an <hi>O Reily,</hi> and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a correſpondence with <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh,</hi> and other of
the Rebels of <hi>Leinſter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. M. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> and on the 6th of <hi>July Tyrone, O Rourk,
Mac William,</hi> &amp;c. ſent the <hi>Clan-ſhyhyes</hi> to ſtir up Rebellion in
<hi>Munſter,</hi> and ſign'd a general Letter, or Credential, to that
effect; he delay'd taking his Pardon till the 22th of <hi>July,</hi>
and even then refuſed to renounce foreign Aid upon
Oath; however he put in his Pledges, and proteſted
Loyalty and Obedience, only to delay the War a little
longer, for which he was not yet ſo fully prepared as he
deſir'd, for he had not an anſwer from <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh,</hi>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:65997:238"/>
till the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and then he received one to his
content.</p>
                  <p>For in the beginning of <hi>Auguſt Pheagh Mac Hugh</hi> (although
he was under protection) enter'd into open Rebellion,<note place="margin">Lib. B. 2. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> and by
ſurpriſe took and raz'd the Fort of <hi>Ballyne Cor;</hi> and great ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
was had of the <hi>O Moors,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Butlers;</hi> there
was noiſe alſo of ſome <hi>Spaniards</hi> at Sea, ſo that the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
complaining that he was not countenanced, nor credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>England,</hi> as he ought to be, petitioned to the Lords of
the Council there, to be a means to remove him from the
Government.</p>
                  <p>However theſe Misfortunes were ſomewhat alleviated by
the quiet and peaceable condition of <hi>Connaugh,</hi> which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Norris</hi> and Sir <hi>Geoffry Fenton</hi> had reduced to terms of
Submiſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Deputy marched out of <hi>Dublin</hi> the 18th of <hi>September,</hi>
to proſecute <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh,</hi> and for ſome time encamped
at <hi>Rathdrome;</hi> he took many Preys, and ſlew ſome Rebels,
and on the 16th of <hi>November</hi> cauſed two of the Pledges
which <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh</hi> had put in for his good behaviour to
be executed in the Camp: In like manner the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>
effectually proſecuted the <hi>Butlers,</hi> as Sir <hi>Anthony Samtbeger</hi>
did the <hi>O Moors,</hi> and <hi>O Connors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Tyrone</hi> is not idle; but notwithſtanding
his Submiſſion and his Pledges,<note place="margin">Camd. Eliz. 515.</note> he attempted to ſurpriſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi>
and killed 35 men of that Gariſon; he oppos'd the
Convoy that carried the Victuals thither, and murthered
eight of the Gariſon that went out for Wood; his Son in
Law, <hi>Henry Oge,</hi> made Incurſions into the Pale, as far as the
River <hi>Boyne;</hi> he alſo endeavour'd to ſurpriſe <hi>Carlingford</hi> Caſtle,
and contrary to his Covenant, refuſed to ſuffer any relief to
be brought to the Fort of <hi>Blackwater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Lord Deputy and Council wrote him a
ſmart Letter on the 30th of <hi>November,</hi> which he anſwered
the 4th of <hi>December,</hi> and alleadg'd that he had juſt provocation
to doe what he did, becauſe his Allie and Confederate <hi>Pheagh
Mac Hugh</hi> was proſecuted by the State.</p>
                  <p>This was but a lame excuſe, for that Rebel was not at all
comprehended in <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Articles; however General <hi>Norris</hi>
ſo far eſpouſed <hi>O Neal</hi>'s Quarrel, that he wrote to the Council
Board, that one good Letter would have prevented the danger
<hi>Armagh</hi> is in, whereby he covertly reprehended the Deputy's
ſeverity: But the Board ſent him a ſmart anſwer, and ſince
he underſtood <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Humor beſt, they left it to him to
relieve <hi>Armagh,</hi> by Force or Treaty, as he thought fit.</p>
                  <p>On the 30th of <hi>December,</hi> Captain <hi>Lea</hi> had a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh,</hi> and had the good fortune to
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:65997:239"/>
kill thirty of the Rebels, and ſent moſt of their heads to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the ſecond of <hi>January,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Bingham,</hi> being a
ſevere Governour, and perhaps therefore obnoxious to the
Iriſh, who were frequent Tranſgreſſours, was upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
complaints removed from the Government of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naugh,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Conyers Clifford</hi> ſubſtituted in his room.</p>
                  <p>On the 15th of <hi>January</hi> General <hi>Norris,</hi> accompanied by
<hi>Bourchier</hi> and <hi>Fenton,</hi> marched from <hi>Dublin</hi> to re-victual <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi>
and on the 22d met with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the General at a great rate, applauded his Moderation,
and thank'd him for his Friendſhip, offered to ſuffer <hi>Armagh</hi>
to be re-victualled (as it was) without oppoſition, and made
all the Proteſtations of Loyalty, and offers of Submiſſion that
could be devis'd, and deſired that the General would procure
a new Commiſſion to conclude an everlaſting Peace with
him, which accordingly was granted to <hi>Norris, Bourchier,</hi> and
Secretary <hi>Fenton,</hi> whereof they gave notice to <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and
appointed him to meet on the ſecond of <hi>April;</hi> but he by his
Letter of the 15th of <hi>March</hi> alleadged many frivolous Excuſes;
and though they by their diſpatch of the 22d aſſured him of
all reaſonable ſatisfaction,<note place="margin">1579.</note> yet he ſtill perſiſted in his Excuſes;
wherefore they wrote to him again the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> and
he by his anſwer of the 15th made many triviall Complaints,
and particularly he queſtioned the General's Power to make
good what he ſhould promiſe, for that poſſibly the new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
ſhould not approve of what they ſhould agree to, and
therefore he deſired a farther day; whereupon the General
finding (too late) that he was baffled and abus'd by that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Traitor, he exclaimed againſt his Perfidiouſneſs, and
broke off the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>O Donell</hi> had invaded <hi>Connaugh</hi> in <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
and drew moſt of the late pardoned Rebels into a new
Revolt, ſo that <hi>Clifford</hi> was oblig'd to haſten to that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Some of the Rebels of the <hi>Brenny</hi> attempted the Town
of <hi>Kells,</hi> but by the Valour and Vigilance of Captain <hi>Street,</hi>
they were diſappointed, and loſt 35 of their Company.</p>
                  <p>The Deputy made a Journey to <hi>Caterlogh,</hi> and thence to
<hi>Kilcor,</hi> and ſtaid thereabouts purſuing <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh,</hi>
and his Abetters, from the 18th of <hi>February,</hi> to the 15th of
<hi>March,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. B. 2. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> on the 12th of which month 140 Barrels of Powder
took fire at the Crane in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and did much harm.</p>
                  <p>On the ſeventh of <hi>May</hi> the Deputy made another journey
into <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh</hi>'s Country,<note place="margin">1597<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and on the eighth had
the good fortune to kill that Arch Rebel,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and to take a Prey
of 200 Cows, which were divided amongſt the Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:65997:239"/>
But the Queen believing that her Affairs were prejudiced
by the diſagreement between the Deputy and the General,
did, at his own Requeſt, revoke the Lord Deputy, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his Place ſent over</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Burrough,</hi> Lord Deputy, who landed on the
15th of <hi>May,</hi> and received the Sword in St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church,
on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 22d.<note place="margin">Camb. Eliz. 543.</note> he had ſupreme Authority in Martial as
well as Civil Cauſes, and immediately ordered General <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
to his Preſidency of <hi>Munſter;</hi> which Affront, (together
with the Diſappointment of the chief Government, which
he knew he merited, and earneſtly expected,) and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
baffles <hi>Tyrone</hi> had put upon him, broke his Heart.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Deputy (amongſt other Inſtructions) had charge
to enquire what Engliſh Undertakers had,<note place="margin">☜</note> contrary to their
Covenants, ſuffered <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> to inhabit their Lands, and to
enquire into the Earl of <hi>Glancar</hi>'s Eſtate, which for want of
Heirs Males was devolved to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>After a Month's Truce with <hi>Tyrone</hi> the Deputy marched
to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> where the Crown retained only <hi>Newry Knockfergus,
Greencaſtle, Armagh, Dundrum,</hi> and <hi>Olderfleet; Connaugh</hi> was
likewiſe in Rebellion, and ſo were ſome of the <hi>Butlers</hi> in
<hi>Munſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Deputy met ſome oppoſition at a Paſs near <hi>Armagh,</hi>
but he gallantly forced his way, and thereby was convinced
<hi>that the Iriſh would run, if reſolutely aſſaulted:</hi> he ſoon took
the Fort of <hi>Blackwater,</hi> and gariſon'd it with Engliſh; but
whilſt they were giving thanks to God for this Victory,
they were called from Prayers to Arms, upon the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Iriſh Forces, with whom they skirmiſhed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully;
yet ſo as that the Deputy's Brother-in-Law, (<hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghan</hi>)
and ſeveral others, were ſlain, and particularly two
Foſter-brothers of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> for grief whereof
the Earl ſoon after dyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clifford,</hi> Governour of <hi>Connaugh</hi> was ordered to advance
with the Forces of his Province to the borders of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi>
wherefore with 700 old Soldiers he attempted it bravely,
but being oppoſed by a numerous Enemy, he nevertheleſs
made a gallant retreat above 30 Miles, and in the face of
2000 Rebels, without any conſiderable loſs.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Lord Deputy's return towards the Pale, the
Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> immediately beſieged the Fort of <hi>Blackwater,</hi>
and the Deputy as nimbly marched to its relief; and having
raiſed the Siege, he deſigned to march to <hi>Dungannon,</hi> and ſo to
clear the way thither, that on any occaſion the Army might
march that way; but he fell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and was forced to return,
and dyed in the way to <hi>Dublin;</hi> and,</p>

Sir <hi>Thomas Norris</hi> Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> was proviſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made Lord Juſtice on the 30th of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> but he being
melancholy at the death of his Brother, ſoon grew weary of
the Office, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at his Requeſt, the Government was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> Lord Chancellour, and Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Robert Gardiner,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice, Lords Juſtices,
who were ſworn on the 15th of <hi>November,</hi> and the ſame day
the Council gave in writing an account of the State of the
Kingdom, and concluded, that it was <hi>an univerſal Iriſh Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
intended, to ſhake off all Engliſh Government:</hi> The Earl of
<hi>Ormond</hi> was made Lieutenant General of the Army, and he
was to have 100 Marks <hi>per menſem,</hi> and 30 Horſe and 30 Foot,
and the Lords Juſtices were to have 33 <hi>l. 6 s. 8 d. per menſem,</hi>
and 20 Horſe and 20 Foot equally divided between them.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> (upon application made to him by
<hi>Tyrone</hi>) procured a Commiſſion to himſelf, the Biſhop of
<hi>Meath,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Fenton,</hi> to treat with that Rebel; and
on the 22d day of <hi>December</hi> they met at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to a Ceſſation for eight weeks, on <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to furniſh the Fort of <hi>Blackwater</hi> with 50 Bieves, and
to give the Gariſon liberty of Forage, and other Articles,
recited at large, <hi>Moriſon</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>On the 18th of <hi>February O Rourk</hi> ſubmitted to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General, and ſubſcribed the Agreement likewiſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
at large, <hi>Moriſon</hi> 22. and on the 15th of <hi>March, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
propoſed to <hi>Tyrone</hi> 13 Conditions of Pardon, (menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>Moriſon</hi> 23.) to moſt of which he agreed; but becauſe
<hi>O Donell,</hi> and ſome others, did not appear, that matter was
adjourned to the 10th of <hi>April;</hi> in the mean time the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
was drawn, and bears date the 11th of <hi>April,</hi> but I do
not believe that <hi>Tyrone</hi> ever came for it, both becauſe he
was <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. outlawed on the former Indictment, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he immediately relapſed into his former Diſloyalties,
and not only ſent aid to <hi>Phelim mac Feagh,</hi> but alſo laid
cloſe Siege to the Fort of <hi>Blackwater,</hi> but the defence made
by Captain <hi>Thomas Williams</hi> was ſo conſiderable, that <hi>Tyrone</hi>
deſpair'd of effecting his deſign by Force, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſtarve them; and indeed they were reduced to
great neceſſity, when in <hi>Auguſt</hi> Marſhal <hi>Bagnall,</hi> with 14 En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of Foot, and a choice Party of Horſe was ſent to relieve
them.</p>
                  <p>The Rebels,<note place="margin">Camd. Eliz. 565.</note> being a vaſt number, fell upon the Engliſh in a
Wood, half a Mile beyond <hi>Armagh,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi>
having a particular ſpight againſt the Marſhal <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gnall,</hi> he
bent all his Force that way, and had the good fortune to
kill the Marſhal, and to rout the Engliſh Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:65997:240"/>
ſlaughter of 13 Captains and 1500 Soldiers; whereupon
the ſhattered remnant of the Engliſh retired to <hi>Armagh;</hi> and
ſent to Captain <hi>Williams</hi> to ſurrender the Fort of <hi>Blackwater,</hi>
that he might reinforce and preſerve the reſt of the Army.</p>
                  <p>By this Victory the Iriſh got Arms, Ammunition, and
Victuals, and which was more, ſo much <hi>Reputation,</hi> that
the Engliſh could act only on the defenſive part, and not
that it ſelf without continual fear and danger.</p>
                  <p>But the Queen was nettled at this Defeat, and by the 12th
of <hi>September</hi> 1598. blam'd <hi>Ormond</hi> that he was not there,
and ordered him to reduce the old Liſt to 8000, and to clear
the Army from Iriſh; and ſhe alſo ſent over Sir <hi>Richard Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

to return to <hi>Cork;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Munſterians</hi> generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
in <hi>October,</hi> and kill, murther, raviſh, and ſpoil without

on condition to be tributary to him: He was the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt
Man of his time, and is commonly called the <hi>Sugan</hi>
Earl. And the Queen thought this Rebellion ſo formidable,
that on the third of <hi>December</hi> 1598. ſhe ſent Letters to the
Lord Preſident, if poſſible, to retain <hi>Mac Donough,</hi> the <hi>white
Knight,</hi> and <hi>Condon,</hi> in their Duty, by all reaſonable favour
and perſuaſion, which undoubtedly he endeavoured to doe,
but all in vain.</p>
                  <p>But that all the World may know what Truſt is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the wheedlings and Submiſſions of <hi>Iriſh Rebels,</hi> it
muſt be remembred that amidſt all theſe Treaſons, and whilſt
<hi>Tyrone</hi> magnified his Victories to the Spaniard, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

the ſame time he wrote ſubmiſſive Letters to the Earl of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
praying that he might be pardoned, and offering to
come in (but indeed upon unreaſonable conditions,) nor is

On the 15th of <hi>June Eſſex</hi> wrote a moſt Excellent Letter to
the Queen, which contains many good Inſtructions, how
to manage an Iriſh War; and though ſome of his Notions
are obſolete now, yet becauſe others are very uſefull I will
recite the Letter at large.</q>
                  <p>WHEN this ſhall come to your Majeſty's Hands, I
know not, but whenſoever it hath that Honour, give
it leave (I humbly beſeech your Majeſty) to tell you, that now
having paſſed through the Provinces of <hi>Leinſter</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi>
and been upon the Frontier of <hi>Connaught,</hi> (where the Governour,
and the chief of the Province were with me,) I dare begin to
give your Majeſty ſome Advertiſement of the State of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
not as before by hear-ſay, but as I beheld it with mine own
Eyes. The People in general have able Bodies by Nature, and
have gotten by Cuſtome ready uſe of Arms, and by their late
Succeſſes boldneſs to ſight your Majeſties Troups: In their Pride
they value no man but themſelves; in their Affection they love
nothing but idleneſs, and licentiouſneſs; in their Rebellion they
have no other end but to ſhake off the Yoak of Obedience to your
Majeſty, and to rout out all remembrance of the Engliſh Nation
in this Kingdom. I ſay this of the People in general; for I find
not only a great part thus affected, but that it is a general
quarrel of the Iriſh, and they who do not profeſs it, are either ſo
few, or ſo falſe, that there is no account to be made of them: The
Iriſh Nobility, and Lords of Countries, do not only in their hearts
affect this plauſible Quarrel, and are divided from us in Religion,
but have an eſpecial Quarrel againſt the Engliſh Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it limiteth, and tieth them who have ever been, and ever
would be as abſolute Tyrants as any are under the Sun; the Towns
(being inhabited by men of the ſame Religion and Birth as the reſt)
are ſo carryed away with the Love of gain, that for it they will
furniſh the Rebels with all things that may arm them, or inable
them againſt the State, or againſt themſelves. The Wealth of
the Kingdom (which conſiſteth in Cattel, Oat-meal, and other
victuals) is allmoſt all in the Rebels hands, who in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
till my coming, have been maſters of the Field: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of theſe Rebels is very preſent, and very confident;
that <hi>Spain</hi> will either ſo invade your Majeſty, that you ſhall have
no leiſure to proſecute them here, or ſo ſuccour them, that they
will get moſt of the Towns into their hands, e'er your Majeſty
ſhall relieve and reinforce your Army; ſo that now if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
reſolve to ſubdue theſe Rebels by force, they are ſo many,
and ſo fram'd to be Soldiers, that the War will certainly be
great, coſtly, and long. If your Majeſty will ſeek to break them
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:65997:242"/>
by factions amongſt themſelves, they are covetous and mercenary,
and muſt be purchaſed, and their Jeſuits and practiſing Prieſts
muſt be hunted out, and taken from them, which now do ſodder
ſo faſt and ſo cloſe together: If your Majeſty will have a ſtrong
party in the Iriſh Nobility, and make uſe of them, you muſt
hide from them all purpoſe of Eſtabliſhing Engliſh Government,
till the ſtrength of the Iriſh be ſo broken, that they ſhall ſee no
ſafety but in your Majeſties Protection: If your Majeſty will be
aſſured of the Poſſeſſion of your Towns, and keep them from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the wants of the Rebels you muſt have Gariſons brought into
them able to command, and make it a capital Offence for any Merchant
in <hi>Ireland</hi> to trade with the Rebels, or buy or ſell any Arms, or
Munition whatſoever; for your good Subjects may have for their
money out of your Majeſties Store that which ſhall be appointed by
order, and may ſerve for their neceſſary defence; whereas if once
they be tradable, the Rebels will give ſuch extreme and exceſſive
Prices, that they will never be kept from them: If your Majeſty
will ſecure this your Realm from the danger of Invaſion, as ſoon
as thoſe which direct and manage your Majeſty's Intelligences
give notice of the preparations, and readineſs of the Enemy,
you muſt be as well armed, and provided for your Defence:
Which Proviſion conſiſts in having Forces upon the Coaſt,
enroll'd and train'd, in having Megazines of Victuals in your
Majeſties Weſt and North-weſt Parts, ready to be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and in having Ships both of War and Tranſportation,
which may carry and waft them both upon the firſt Allarm
of a Deſcent; the enrolling and training of your Subjects is no
charge to your Majeſties own Coffers: The providing of Megazines
will never be any loſs, for in uſing them you may ſave
a Kingdom; and if you uſe them not, you may have your
old Store ſold, and (if it be well handled) to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Profit. The arming your Majeſties Ships, when you
hear your Enemy arms to Sea, is agreeable to your own
Provident and Princely Courſes, and to the Policies of all
Princes and States of the World. But to return to <hi>Ireland</hi>
again: As I have ſhewed your Majeſty the danger and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which your Servants and Miniſters here ſhall and do
meet withall in this great Work of reducing this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſo I will now (as well as I can) repreſent to
your Majeſty your Strengths and Advantages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe Rebels are neither able to force any wall'd
Town, Caſtle, or Houſe of ſtrength, nor to keep any that they get,
ſo that while your Majeſty keeps your Army and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igour, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
Meſtriſs if all Towns and Holds whatſoever; by
which means (if your Majeſty have good Miniſters) all the
Wealth of the Land ſhall be drawn into the hands of your
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65997:243"/>
Subjects; your Soldiers in the Winter ſhall be with eaſe lodg'd,
and readily ſupplyed of any wants; and We that command
your Majeſties Forces, may make the War offenſive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive;
may fight and be in ſafety, as occaſion is offered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> your Majeſty's Horſemen are ſo incomparably
better than the Rebels, and their Foot are ſo unwilling to
fight in Battel, or groſs, (howſoever they be deſirous to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
and looſe fight,) that your Majeſty may be allways Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of the Champion Countries, which are the beſt parts of
this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Your Majeſty victualling your Army out of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and with your Gariſons burning and ſpoiling the
Country in all places, ſhall ſtarve the Rebels in one Year,
becauſe no place elſe can ſupply them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Since no War can be made without Munition,
and Munition this Rebel cannot have but from <hi>Spain, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or your Towns here, if your Majeſty will ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
your Ships and Pinaces upon the Coaſt, and be pleas'd to
ſend a printed Proclamation, That upon pain of Death, no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
Townſman, or other Subject, do traffick with the Rebel,
or buy or ſell, in any ſort, any kind of Munition or Arms, I
doubt not but in ſhort time I ſhall make them bankrupt of their
own Store, and I hope our Seamen will keep them from any new.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Your Majeſty hath a rich ſtore of gallant Collonels,
Captains, and Gentlemen of Quality, whoſe Example and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
is of more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe than all the reſt of your Troups; whereas
the beſt Men of Quality among the Rebels, who are their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and their Horſe-men, dare never put themſelves to any
hazard, but ſend their Kerne, and their Hirelings to fight with
your Majeſty's Troups; ſo that although their common Soldiers
are too hard for our new Men, yet are they not able to ſtand
before ſuch gallant Men as will charge them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Your Majeſty's Commanders being adviſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed,
know all Advantages, and by the Strength of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will, in great Fights, beat the Rebels; for they neither
march, nor lodge, nor fight in order; but only by the benefit
of Footmanſhip, can come on, and go off at their pleaſure, which
makes them attend a whole Day, ſtill skermiſhing, and never
engaging themſelves; ſo that it hath been ever the Fault and
Weakneſs of your Majeſty's Leaders, whenſoever you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any Blow; for the Rebels do but watch and attend upon
all groſs Overſights.</p>
                  <p>Now if it pleaſe your Majeſty to compare your Advantages and
Diſadvantages together, you ſhall find, that though theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
are more in number than your Majeſty's Army, and have
(though I do unwillingly confeſs it) better Bodies, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65997:243"/>
uſe of their Arms than thoſe Men which your Majeſty
ſends over; yet your Majeſty commanding the walled Towns,
Holds, and Champion Countries, and having a brave Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Gentry, a better Diſcipline, and ſtronger Order than
they, and ſuch means to keep from them the maintenance of
their Life, and to waſte the Countrey which ſhould nouriſh them,
your Majeſty may promiſe your ſelf, that this Action will in
the end be ſucceſsfull, though coſtly, and that your Victory
will be certain, though many of us your honeſt Servants muſt
ſacrifice our ſelves in the Quarrel, and that this Kingdom will
be reduced, though it will ask (beſides Coſt) a great deal of
Care, Induſtry, and Time.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>June</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Harrington</hi> and ſome of his young
Captains, with 600 Men left in the <hi>Glinnes,</hi> received a Baffle

impair'd, that he and the Council joyn'd in a Letter for

Governour of <hi>Connaugh,</hi> to march to <hi>Belick,</hi> to diſtreſs <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>
on that ſide; accordingly he march'd with 100 Horſe
and 1400 Foot; but being encountered by <hi>O Rourk,</hi> and 200
Rebels at a Paſs, our Men being tired, and wanting Powder,
were routed, 140 ſlain, together with <hi>Clifford,</hi> and Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
Ratcliff,</hi> and as many wounded; nay, they had all
been loſt, were it not for the valour of the Horſe, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
their Retreat; and ſo the next day they marched back
to <hi>Athloan.</hi>

                     <hi>Eſſex</hi> received the ſupply of 1000 Foot he had ſent for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England,</hi> and yet made no other attempts againſt <hi>Tyrone,</hi>
than that with 250 Foot, and 300 Horſe; he came to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> about the lattter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and on the 8th

and concluded on a Truce for ſix weeks; and ſo from
ſix weeks to ſix weeks, till <hi>May,</hi> provided either Party might
break it on fourteen days notice before hand; and on the

that he immediately went for <hi>England,</hi> where he unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly

That no harm had followed his raſh Deſerting <hi>Ireland,</hi> that
he left things in the beſt order, and in the hands of the beſt
Men he could, and left ſo good Inſtructions, that they have
not been much altered ſince, and that he came over in a time
of Truce.</p>

profeſs'd, that he would recover the Liberty of Religion and
his Countrey: To him came Fryar <hi>Matthew de Oviedo,</hi> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular
Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Don Martin de la Cerda;</hi>
they brought Papal Indulgencies for all that would take
Arms againſt the Engliſh, and a <hi>Phoenix</hi> Plume to <hi>O Neal,</hi>
and 22000 pieces of Gold from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

                  <p>Hereupon <hi>O Neal,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>December</hi> gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that after fourteen days he would break the Truce;
and ſoon after, <hi>viz.</hi> the 20th of <hi>January,</hi> under pretence of a

into <hi>Munſter,</hi> to confer with the <hi>Sugan</hi> Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi>
and to debauch thoſe people from their Duty; he had with
him 2500 Foot, and 200 Horſe; de depoſed <hi>Daniel Mac Carty
Moor,</hi> and placed <hi>Florence Mac Carty</hi> in his ſtead; he burnt
and ſpoiled all that would not joyn with him, eſpecially the

number of the Rebels; ſo that there were very few Iriſh that
had not intelligence with him, or ſhewed manifeſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

death of Sir <hi>Thomas Norris,</hi> Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who

ſhewed abundance of judgment in her choice of both. Sir

ſtayed at <hi>Dublin</hi> ſome time, to get his Commiſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and to learn the State of the Kingdom; and on
the ſeaventh of <hi>April</hi> 1600. with 700 Foot, and 100 Horſe,
(being accompanied with his Excellency to <hi>Chappel Izzod,</hi>)
he went to his Province,<note place="margin">Lib. C.</note> and on the ſeventh of <hi>March</hi> 1599.
the Lord Deputy and Council iſſued a Proclamation to give

deſired by the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> to go with him eight Miles to

taken Priſoner, and the Preſident and the Earl of <hi>Twomond</hi>
hardly eſcaped by the ſwiftneſs of their Horſes; whereupon
<hi>Pierce Lacy</hi> (who was lately come into Protection) relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                  <p>On the the 16th of <hi>April</hi> the Lord Preſident came to <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,</hi>
where ſome <hi>Fitz-giralds</hi> of the <hi>Decyes,</hi> and ſome of

                  <p>The Lord Lieutenant on the 10th of <hi>March</hi> went to <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingar</hi>
to intercept <hi>Tyrone</hi> in his return from <hi>Munſter;</hi> but
he having notice of that deſign, left 1000 Men with <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
and 800 with the <hi>Butlers,</hi> and with a ſmall Company,
and by exceeding long Marches, eſcap'd into <hi>

                  <p>But the Strength of the Rebels lying in their Faſtneſſes,
the Lord Lieutenant reſolved to make War upon them with

<hi>April,</hi> though he met with brisk Attacks from <hi>Owen mac Rory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Rebels being diſheartened with this
manner of proceeding, and <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s flight from <hi>Munſter,</hi>
grew every day in worſe condition, and ſuffered many Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the Gariſon of the <hi>Naas</hi> took a Prey, and kill'd many
Rebels, and Sir <hi>Francis Shane</hi> defeated 140 of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
45 were ſlain on the place, of which number fourteen
were kill'd by himſelf; ſo that many of the Rebels offered
to ſubmit, which was the leſs regarded, becauſe it was
known that even thoſe that had not yet entered into Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
were hindered more by a ſenſe of their Danger, than
their Duty; and that they waited only for a ſafe opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to declare themſelves; inſomuch that <hi>O Sullevan</hi> aſſures
us,<note place="margin">Sullevan 177.</note> that before the Battel of <hi>Kingſale,</hi> the Papiſts in the
Queen's Army had promiſed to revolt, and that many did ſo,
by two, or three, or ten at a time, and that if they had all
done ſo, then there had been an end of the Engliſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Lieutenant march'd toward <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> the fifth of
<hi>May,</hi> he paſſed the <hi>Moyry</hi> on <hi>Whitſunday</hi> Morning, and came
to <hi>Newry,</hi> where he was inform'd that <hi>O Neal</hi> had raz'd
<hi>Blackwater</hi> Fort, burnt <hi>Armagh,</hi> and was retired into the
Faſtneſs of <hi>Logh lurken;</hi> whereupon <hi>Montjoy</hi> on the 15th of
<hi>May</hi> drew out towards <hi>Armagh</hi> with 1500 Foot and 200
Horſe; but hearing that the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Oliver Lambert,</hi> were coming to him with recruits, on the
17th of <hi>May,</hi> he ſent Captain <hi>Blany</hi> with 500 Foot and 50
Horſe to conduct them, who accordingly came to <hi>Faghard,</hi>
near <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and thence all together marched toward the
<hi>Newry,</hi> but were attacked briskly at the Paſs of the <hi>Moyry</hi>
by <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and 1200 Foot and 220 Horſe; but <hi>Montjoy,</hi> who
foreſaw this deſign, came ſeaſonably to their Relief, ſo that
they paſſed the <hi>Moyry</hi> in ſpight of the Rebels, with a ſmall
Loſs to themſelves, and very conſiderable Loſs to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
in a brisk Fight they had there.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time a Gariſon was planted at <hi>Loghfoile,</hi> by
Sir <hi>Henry Dokwra,</hi> and they took <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and ſpoil'd all
<hi>O Dogharty</hi>'s Countrey, took a good Prey of Cows, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
many Rebels; they alſo fortified at <hi>Derry,</hi> which frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
many of the Iriſh into the Iſlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſome of them to Submiſſion.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of <hi>June Montjoy</hi> return'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> by
the way of <hi>Carlingford, O Neal</hi> being retired into his Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
At <hi>Dublin</hi> the Lord Lieutenant met many and great
Clamours; that in his abſence the Rebels had invaded, prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and burnt the Pale; but the Loſs was not half ſo great as
the Noiſe.</p>

As to <hi>Munſter,</hi> The Preſident with 900 Foot, and 100
Horſe, came to <hi>Youghall</hi> the 21ſt of <hi>April,</hi> where he receiv'd
an account that <hi>Florence Mac Carty,</hi> and others of <hi>Carbry,</hi> on
<hi>Tyrone</hi>'s encouragements, were in actual Rebellion; wherefore
Captain <hi>Flower</hi> was ſent into <hi>Carbry</hi> with 1200 Foot, and
100 Horſe,<note place="margin">Pacata Hib. 30.</note> and burnt and preyed as far as <hi>Roſs;</hi> but in their
return at <hi>Awnebuy,</hi> they fell into an Ambuſh of 2000 men
which <hi>Florence Mac Carty,</hi> and <hi>Dermond O Connor</hi> had laid
there for them: however the Engliſh behaved themſelves ſo
well, that they ſlew <hi>Carbry O Connor,</hi> and 100 Rebels, and
wounded as many more without the loſs of any Perſon of
note on their ſide; and about the ſame time the Gariſon of
<hi>Killmallock,</hi> took a good Prey from the <hi>Brough.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On <hi>April</hi> the 24th the Preſident came to <hi>Cork,</hi> where he
had an account of the miſerable condition of the Province,
which was all in Rebellion, except ſome few Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
whoſe followers and near relations were likewiſe in
Action; ſo that there could be no great confidence placed
in themſelves; the very Cities and Towns were ſtaggering,
and ſo frighted by the Threats and Excommunications of the
Clergy, that there could be no Truſt repoſed in them: But
all this did not diſcourage the Preſident.</p>
                  <p>On the 25th of <hi>April John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mac Thomas</hi> took a Prey of
300 Cows, and 10 Horſes from <hi>Castlelions,</hi> and the next day
<hi>Redmond Burk</hi> invaded <hi>O Dwyres</hi>'s Countrey to his loſs of 120
Men; to revenge which, <hi>Redmond</hi> ſoon after return'd thither,
and on the Sixth of <hi>May</hi> ſlew all the Men, Women, and
Children, and took all their Cattel, and burnt all that Country.</p>
                  <p>On the 29th of <hi>April,</hi> the Gariſon of <hi>Killmallock,</hi> took the
Prey of <hi>Loghgwir,</hi> and ſoon after <hi>Banet Condon,</hi> and the
<hi>White Knight</hi> ſubmitted to the Preſident.</p>
                  <p>On the Third of <hi>May Florence Mac Carty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> on promiſe of
ſafe return, came to <hi>Cork,</hi> and ſubmitted to the Preſident, and
promiſed Neutrality; and <hi>Dermond O Connor</hi> was dealt with
for a conſiderable reward to ſieze upon the <hi>Sugan</hi> Earl of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
and one <hi>Nugent,</hi> a relapſed Rebel, for Pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
promiſed to find means to ruine <hi>John Fitz Thomas,
(Deſmond</hi>'s brother,) which he attempted to doe by piſtolling
him, but was prevented in the very nick, and the next day
was hanged.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, <hi>Redmond Burk,</hi> who commanded 500 <hi>Banaughs,</hi>
was wheedled by the Preſident, in hopes of the Barony of

                  <p>The Preſident had given out that he deſign'd to march to
<hi>Lymerick</hi> the Sixth of <hi>May,</hi> whereupon the Rebels met in
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:65997:246"/>
great numbers at <hi>Ballyhawra,</hi> and continued together ten
days, and then, partly for want of Victuals, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they believed the Preſident would not, or durſt not

                  <p>The ſame day Sir <hi>Richard Piercy,</hi> Governour of <hi>Kingſale,</hi>

                  <p>On the 21ſt of <hi>May</hi> the Preſident marcht from <hi>Cork</hi> to near
<hi>Mallow,</hi> and the next night near <hi>Killmallock,</hi> the 24th to <hi>Brough</hi>
where he left a Gariſon, and the 25th he came to <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 23d <hi>James Galdy,</hi> (Brother to the Lord <hi>Cahir</hi> and

the Caſtle of <hi>Cahir,</hi> but in lieu of that, the Governour
of <hi>Loghguir</hi>-Caſtle (<hi>Owen Grone</hi>) delivered it up to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for a Summe of money not exceeding 60 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 28th of <hi>May</hi> the Preſident entred <hi>Clan William,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1600.</note>
and <hi>John Burk</hi> refuſing to ſubmit perſonally, pretending that
his Prieſts taught him that it was a mortal ſin ſo to doe. The
Preſident diſdaining that frivolous Anſwer, the next day burnt
and deſtroyed his Houſes, Corn, and Country; and then on
the 30th of <hi>May Burk</hi> came and ſubmitted, and was with his
brother <hi>Theobald,</hi> with difficulty, received upon their putting
in Pledges for their future Loyalty.</p>
                  <p>The laſt of <hi>May</hi> the Preſident took <hi>Ballytraſny</hi> Caſtle, which
the Ward had deſerted, and therein a great quantity of Corn,
and then part of the Army deſtroyed the <hi>Owny,</hi> being <hi>O Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>'s
Country; and then the whole Army returned to <hi>Lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
and Gariſons were placed in <hi>Asketon,</hi> and <hi>Likadowne, Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallock,</hi>
and <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Florence Mac Carty</hi> had by Letter to the <hi>Sugan</hi> Earl of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
a Truce, or Ceſſation with the Preſident, and about
this time had a meeting with the Confederates in <hi>Connilo,</hi> where
he ſlily betrayed his Brother-in-Law, <hi>O Sullevan Moor,</hi> and
others, and left them in pawn to <hi>Dermond O Connor,</hi> for what
<hi>Bonaught</hi> himſelf ſhould have paid.</p>
                  <p>The Preſident's Army being refreſh'd by the Arrival of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Harvy</hi>'s Ship at <hi>Lymerick,</hi> he put his Soldiers into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
Gariſons, to give the better opportunity to <hi>Dermond O

                  <p>This plot was craftily managed, and <hi>Deſmond</hi> was taken, and
afterwards reſcued by the Iriſh out of <hi>Caſtleiſhin</hi> the 26th of

                  </p>
                  <p>In the meantime <hi>O Donell</hi> invaded <hi>Twomond</hi> with a great Force,

                  <p>On the 19th of <hi>June</hi> the Lord Lieutenant wrote to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>

                  <p>In the mean time <hi>O Neal</hi> had poſſeſſed himſelf of the Paſs
of the <hi>Moyry,</hi> but on the 2d and 5th of <hi>October</hi> the Engliſh
skermiſhed ſo ſucceſsfully with them, that on the 9th they
quitted the Faſtneſs; whereupon <hi>Montjoy</hi> cut down the Woods
on both ſides, and having refreſhed his Army at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> on
the 21ſt of <hi>October</hi> he march'd to the <hi>Newry,</hi> where for want
of Victuals he ſtayed till the ſecond of <hi>November,</hi> and then
encamped near the place where he then built the Fort of
<hi>Mountnorris,</hi> and left in it 400 Men under Capt. <hi>Blany;</hi> whilſt
they were building the Fort they had many Skermiſhes with
the Rebels, with good ſucceſs; in one of which they took
Priſoner <hi>Neal O Quin, Tyrone</hi>'s chief Favourite, who was a
butcherly ſort of a Sot.</p>

On the 10th of <hi>November,</hi> Proclamation was made in face
of <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Army, That whoever brought <hi>O Neal</hi> alive, ſhould
have 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and who brought his Head, ſhould have 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
and then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army marcht to the <hi>Newry,</hi> and thence
to <hi>Carling-ford;</hi> but in their way, on the 13th of <hi>November,</hi>
they were attack'd briskly by the Rebels at the Pace of <hi>Carling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 82.</note>
but the iſſue of the Battle was, that the Enemy was
routed with the loſs of 200 men, and in this whole Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne
<hi>Tyrone</hi> loſt 800 men, and which was more, his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there were in this Journey about
200 ſlain,<note place="margin">Cambd. Eliz. 583.</note> and 400 wounded. <hi>Montjoy</hi> marcht from <hi>Carling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Dublin,</hi> having diſtributed his Army
into Winter-quarters, where we will leave them, and return
to <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On <hi>June</hi> 29. the Preſident marcht from <hi>Limerick</hi> into <hi>Conilo</hi>
to relieve <hi>Dermond O Conner,</hi> who was beſieg'd at <hi>Ballyalinan,</hi>
whereof the Rebels having notice, they made an Agreement
with <hi>Dermond,</hi> and all joyn'd together to oppoſe the Preſident.
However, he ſeiz'd on the Caſtle of <hi>Crome,</hi> which the Ward
deſerted, and therein he found good ſtore of Corn and other
Proviſion; and then for four or five days the Army hovered
about <hi>Asketon,</hi> in expectation of ſupplies of Victuals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
were to come from <hi>Limerick</hi> by water, and the Rebels, to the
number of 3000, kept very near them, and ſometimes within
view; but the Rebels had ſuch jealouſie of one another, that
they durſt not attempt any thing: and indeed <hi>William Burk</hi>
and <hi>Morongh in Moe O Flaherty,</hi> did <hi>July</hi> 3. by their Letters
to the Preſident, offer to depart the Province for a Paſs and a
piece of Money,<note place="margin">Pac. hib. 62.</note> and to carry their Bonaughs with them, being
2500 men. But the Knight of the <hi>Glin</hi> (although his Son was
by himſelf put into the Preſidents hands as a Pledge of his
Loyalty) was out in Rebellion: and therefore on <hi>July</hi> 5. the
Preſident ſat down before the Caſtle of <hi>Glin</hi> in the County of
<hi>Limerick;</hi> and although the Rebels Army (being 3000
ſtrong) were within two miles of him, yet he valiantly took
the Caſtle by Aſſault, with the ſlaughter of 80 Rebels.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that during the Siege, and before the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
was mounted, the Knight of the <hi>Glin</hi> had two Parleys
with the Earl of <hi>Twomond,</hi> and might have had good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but he relied upon the Promiſes of his Confederates to
raiſe the Siege, and refuſed to ſubmit. The Preſident having
put 21 men under Captain <hi>Mordant</hi> in the Caſtle of the <hi>Glin,</hi>
deſign'd to attempt <hi>Carrigofoyle,</hi> but <hi>O Connor Kerry</hi> prevented
that by his ſubmiſſion and ſurrender; and yet he alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
relaps'd when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came. In the mean time
the Preſident ſent <hi>Maurice Stack</hi> with 50 men to <hi>Kerry,</hi> where
he ſurpriz'd <hi>Liſcaghan</hi>-Caſtle, burnt <hi>Adare,</hi> and prey'd the

Country, and preſerv'd himſelf ſafe, till Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot</hi>
came to his relief.</p>
                  <p>At length <hi>Dermond O Connor</hi> and the Bownaghs obtain'd

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Florence Mac Carry</hi> began now to appear more openly,
ſo that he would by no means come to the Preſident, tho'

                  <p>To prevent this, the Preſident leaves <hi>Wilmot</hi> in <hi>Kerry,</hi> and

                  <p>Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot</hi> manag'd his buſineſs ſo well in <hi>Kerry,</hi> that

his Caſtle of <hi>Dingle</hi> in <hi>October</hi> following. And it being certain
that <hi>Florence mac Cartie</hi> had confederated with the Sugan Earl,
<hi>Daniel mac Cartie more,</hi> was taken into protection; and the

It is obſervable that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſo blindly devoted to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,<note place="margin">Cambd. Eliz. 584.</note>
that many of thoſe that had been Loyal, ſent to <hi>Rome</hi>

His Patent was ſent to the Preſident, to keep, or give it, as
he ſhould ſee cauſe, and a Company of Foot was caſhier'd for
his maintenance, which was to be in the Preſident's Houſe, for
fear of the worſt; when he came to <hi>Cork,</hi> the Inhabitants
finding he was a Proteſtant, refus'd to entertain him; ſo that
he was fain to obtrude himſelf upon the Mayor, where he
ſupp'd, and after Supper he wrote a Letter of this uſage to the
Lords of the Council; but the Mayor told him, <hi>No Letters

                  <p>Upon this Earls firſt coming to <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> multitudes
flocked thither to ſee him, and pay their Duty to him; but
as ſoon as they ſaw him go to Church, they all forſook him,

                  <p>About the 18th of <hi>December,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Barkly</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

and got a Prey of 1000 Cows, 200 Garrons, many
Sheep, and other Booty, and had the killing of many Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
And the Preſident having notice of a Marriage deſign'd
between <hi>O Donell</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi>'s Siſter <hi>Joan,</hi> very

                  <p>
                     <hi>Geofry Galway,</hi> Mayor of <hi>Limerick,</hi> had formerly impriſon'd
a Souldier for Petty Larceny, and notwithſtanding repeated
Orders from the Preſident, who was then ready to march

turn'd him out of his Office, and made him pay a Fine of
400 <hi>l.</hi> which was expended in the repair of the Caſtle of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of the Garriſon of <hi>Kerry</hi> made a Sally into <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>

<hi>Cork</hi> did the like to purſue ſome Rebels that were fled thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but <hi>Florence mac Carthy</hi> would have his Territories a
Sanctuary inviolable, and therefore his Followers routed both
theſe Parties, and kill'd ſeveral of the Sheriff's men, and two
of the Souldiers. However, on parol he came to the Preſident,
and was by him advis'd to go to <hi>England;</hi> whereto he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to conſent, and obtain'd the Preſident's Letter to the
People of <hi>Carbry,</hi> to encourage them to contribute to the
charge of the Journey; but when he had collected their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,
he took farther time to conſider of the Voyage.</p>
                  <p>But let us return to the Lord Lieutenant, who was reſolv'd
to be reveng'd on the <hi>Birnes</hi> and <hi>Tools,</hi> who daily diſquieted
<hi>Dublin,</hi> eſpecially in his abſence, and he manag'd his deſign ſo

ſurpriz'd <hi>Phelim Mac Pheagh,</hi> in his own Houſe, from whence he
narrowly eſcaped at a back window, but his Wife and eldeſt
Son were taken; and there the Lord Lieutenant ſtaid till the
20th of <hi>January,</hi> and ſpoil'd and ranſack'd the Country, burnt
the Corn and Houſes, and planted Gariſons at <hi>Tullogh</hi> and
<hi>Wicklow,</hi> and then went to <hi>Monſterevan,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Trim;</hi> from
whence, on the 11th of <hi>February,</hi> he went towards <hi>Molingar,</hi>
and ſo to <hi>Athlone;</hi> and in his return homeward, on the 20th
of <hi>February,</hi> he attack'd a ſmall Iſland in <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> where
Captain <hi>Tyrrel</hi> lay, but for want of conveniences to get into
the Iſland, the firſt and ſecond attempts were fruitleſs, but
whil'ſt he prepared better for a third eſſay, and proclaim'd <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi>'s
Head at 1000 Crowns, on the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
in the night ſtole away; thence he march'd into <hi>Ophaly,

1601.</p>
                  <p>In this Journey <hi>Montjoy</hi> received Orders to proclaim the

                  <p>The Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter</hi> propoſed, that a general
pardon to all of his Province might be granted with ſome few
exceptions, but this would be diſadvantagious to the Officers
of the Court and their Clarks, and therefore the Queen or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that every body that the Preſident ſhould recommend,
ſhould be pardon'd; whereupon (before the end of <hi>February,</hi>
1600) more than 4000 Pardons were taken out by the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials
of <hi>Munſter, (viz.</hi>) to <hi>Mac Carty Reagh</hi> and 210 followers;

                  <p>On the 6th of <hi>April,</hi> the Captains <hi>Bodly</hi> and <hi>Blany</hi> did good
ſervice on the Iſland <hi>Loghrurcane,</hi> which the Rebels had made
their Magazine, and tho' they could not get into the Iſland,
yet by ſhooting Arrows with Wild-fire into it, they burnt the
Cabbins and what was in them, and return'd with the loſs of

                  <p>About the ſame time Sir <hi>Henry Dockwra,</hi> Governor of <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foyle,</hi>

                  <p>The Queens <hi>Macguire</hi> being ſetled in <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> and a

ſpoilt <hi>Hugh Mac Hughduff</hi>'s Country, but that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd

O Boyle,</hi> and <hi>Shane Mac Manus oge O Donel,</hi> made their
ſubmiſſions, and were received into protection.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that <hi>Neal Garuff,</hi> who was the Queens
<hi>O Donel,</hi> was inſtrumental to theſe good Succeſſes, whereon he
grew ſo inſolent as to tell the Governor <hi>Dockwra</hi> to his face,
that the People of <hi>Tyrconel</hi> were his Subjects, and that he
would puniſh, exact, cut and hang them as he pleas'd; but
the Governor charg'd him the contrary, on his Allegiance,
and at his peril. This Man might well be called <hi>Garuff,
i. e.</hi> rough, or rude; for he was (as Sir <hi>Henry Dockwra</hi> writes

                  <p>On the 15th, the Deputy rode towards the Woods and

Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Saint Laurence</hi>'s Regiment to <hi>Benburb</hi> (the old
Houſe of <hi>Shane O Neal,</hi> environ'd with Woods) to which the
Rebels flock'd, ſo that there was a pretty Skirmiſh between
them for three hours, in view of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Camp, and new
Detachmenrs were ſent from the Camp as often as requir'd;
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:65997:252"/>
but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were too hard for the Rebels in the Plain, and
therefore the <hi>Iriſh</hi> made their beſt advantage of the Wood,

Deputy loſt only two <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> and twenty-ſix <hi>Kerne,</hi> and

Nor is it to be admired that there was commonly ſuch

Marks-men, and being better furniſh'd with Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
made many more ſhot then the Rebels could ſpare.
The 17th and 18th were ſpent in building and fortifying, or
rather beginning a New Fort at <hi>Blackwater,</hi> not far diſtant from
the old one, which was demoliſh'd.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Sir <hi>H. Dockwra</hi> took <hi>Newtowne,</hi> and
got a prey of a 1000 Cows near <hi>Logeherne,</hi> and did other
good Services in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter.</hi> And Sir <hi>John Barkly</hi> at <hi>Annaly</hi> had
ſtopped <hi>Tyrrel</hi> from paſſing into <hi>Ophaly,</hi> and kill'd many of
his Men, and took 300 Cows.</p>
                  <p>On the 23d of <hi>July,</hi> Captain <hi>Williams</hi> and his Company,
being left to guard the new Fort, and Proclamation firſt
made, <hi>That the Queen would not receive</hi> Tyrone <hi>to Mercy;
and therefore offered</hi> 2000 l. <hi>for him alive, and</hi> 1000 l. <hi>for
him dead:</hi> the Army diſlodg'd, and employ'd themſelves
in deſtroying the Corn. On the 27th the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhew'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but ſoon retir'd; and <hi>Shane mac Daniel Grome, Tyrone</hi>'s
Marſhal, made his ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Sir <hi>Henry Power</hi> behaved himſelf well in
<hi>Leix,</hi> having deſtroy'd and diſpers'd 300 Rebels there, and
kill'd 40 of the Sept of <hi>O more;</hi> and on the 30th of <hi>July</hi> the
Deputy march'd to the new Fort at <hi>Blackwater</hi> and beyond
it, and ſpent two days in cutting the Woods and clearing the
Paces; and whilſt they were doing ſo, on the firſt of <hi>August</hi>
the Rebels made an Alarum, whereat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſes were
frightned, broke their Headſtals, and ran away, ſome to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi>
and ſome to <hi>Newry,</hi> but the Troopers recovered them all
again, by the cowardize and negligence of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe-men
who might eaſily have purſued and taken them all.</p>
                  <p>On the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Deputy return'd to <hi>Armagh,</hi>
and march three miles farther to <hi>Ralawtany,</hi> and ſent out Sir
<hi>Henry Danvers</hi> with 300 Foot to burn about 20 Houſes,
which he effected; but in his return was aſſaulted by <hi>Tyrene</hi>'s
Army. However, being ſuccour'd from the Camp, he made
a ſafe Retreat, though the Rebels purſued him even ſo far as
to pour a Volly of Shot into the Camp, and by reaſon of the
adjacent Wood, they alſo got away ſafe.</p>
                  <p>The next day the Deputy marched North of <hi>Armagh,</hi> for
convenience of Forage, and to ſecure the Convoys, and the
Rebels being numerous, drew down thorough the Woods
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:65997:253"/>
near the Army, which by Poll was but 1728 foot, and above
half of them <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth of <hi>August</hi> the Deputy drew out ſome Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to cut down the Woods, and they were not interrupted
all day; but after they were return'd to the Camp, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
the Rebels appear'd in a Meadow below the Camp
with Drums and Bagpipes, and pretended to aſſault the Camp;
but the Lord Deputy plac'd 400 men in Ambuſh, and order'd
them not to fire till the Enemy was very near. The Rebels
were encourag'd by their not firing, ſo that they poured 2 or
3000 Shot into the Camp; but the Ambuſh finding their
opportunity, gave them ſuch a Volley in their teeth, that
turn'd their Muſick to <hi>Allogone,</hi> and ſlew many of their beſt
men, and particularly <hi>Peirce Lacy</hi> of the <hi>Brough,</hi> one of the
greateſt Rebels in <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who had 3640 Foot, and 400 Horſe,
was ſtrengthned by the acceſs of <hi>Maguire, mac Mahon</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
mac Baron,</hi> and their Followers, and was alſo elevated
with the expectation of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Succours, the Deputy ſent for
Sir <hi>John Barkly</hi>'s Regiment from <hi>Annaly,</hi> and ſpent two days
in cutting the Paces; and on the 7th march'd to <hi>Mount
Norris,</hi> where he ſtaid the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, and
on the 13th came within three mile of <hi>Armagh;</hi> and on the
14th victualled the Abby of <hi>Armagh</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi>
and return'd to his Camp; and on the 15th he march'd
to <hi>Mount Norris,</hi> and on the 16th to <hi>Carrickbane</hi> near the
<hi>Newry,</hi> and on the 24th his Lordſhip left the Field and came to
the <hi>Newry,</hi> having plac'd his Forces in Garriſon,</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>John Barkly</hi> (Governour of <hi>Conaugh</hi> in abſence of Sir

Flower,</hi> aſſiſted by the Lord <hi>Twomond</hi>'s Foot-Company, on the
29th of <hi>March</hi> came to <hi>Quin</hi> in <hi>Thomond,</hi> and hearing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels

ſlain, and their Forces totally routed.</p>
                  <p>The remainder of the Rebels finding that the Preſident had

Sugan Earl, and <hi>Florence Mac Carty,</hi> which not long after he
luckily effected; for on the 29th of <hi>May</hi> the White Knight,

                  <p>On the 28th of <hi>July</hi> the Preſident held Seſſions of Goal-delivery

                  <p>About this time the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> did good ſervice in

                  <p>But let us return to the Lord Deputy,<note place="margin">1601.</note> whom we left at the

ran away to the Fort; in this ſmall Skirmiſh about 50 of each

                  <p>But much better did Sir <hi>Henry Dockwra</hi> behave himſelf in
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> for he not only regain'd the Caſtle of <hi>Derry,</hi> which
ſome of his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soldiers had betray'd to the Rebels, but he
alſo ſurpriz'd <hi>Donegal,</hi> and tho' <hi>O Donel</hi> beſieg'd it full thirty
days, uſing many horrible Howlings and Outcries, to terrifie
the Gariſon, and altho' the Abby by accident was burnt, yet
did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers manfully defend it, until <hi>O Donel</hi> drew
off to the Relief of <hi>Kingſale,</hi> and then Sir <hi>Henry</hi> marched to
<hi>Donegal</hi> by land, and <hi>Edward Diggs,</hi> with two Companies
quartered at a place called <hi>Aſherow,</hi> had the good fortune to
ſurprize and take <hi>Ballyſhannon,</hi> a place very much coveted by
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the advantage of its ſituation.</p>
                  <p>On the 29th of <hi>August,</hi> the Deputy came to <hi>Trim,</hi> where

                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>September</hi> the Lord Preſident receiv'd 2000 freſh Men,

gave account to the Deputy: whereupon <hi>Mountjoy</hi> went to
<hi>Kilkenny</hi> with one Troop only on the 13th of <hi>September,</hi> in

but the Preſident was then hindred by the noiſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Invaſion, but that being cooled again, the Preſident (leaving

on the 19th of <hi>September.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were Poſts newly erected for the more ſpeedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying

at Council in <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> they received News by the Poſt, that
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were diſcover'd near the <hi>Old-head</hi> of <hi>Kingsale;</hi>
and on the 23d another Letter from Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot</hi> was
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:65997:254"/>
brought them, ſignifying, <hi>That they were landed at</hi> Kingſale;
but they were not landed when the Poſt came away, but
landed that very day, being the 23th of <hi>September</hi> 1601.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Marſhal <hi>Wingfield</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Pale</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble

It will be enough to ſay, that it ended in a glorious Victory,
the Rebels being totally routed, and 1200 of them ſlain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place, and above 800 wounded, without any loſs at all
on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide, except one Cornet, and five or ſix Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;

loſt many of his Men and Carriages, in his haſty paſſage

ſuffered as much by the River <hi>Mage,</hi> and met with a ſevere

                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſtrange that this Battle being fought within a mile of

it; and yet it is certain they made no Sally till the Battle
was over, and even then they ſallied twice to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> ſent him an abſolute Submiſſion very
handſomly worded, and yet at the ſame time he wrote to <hi>O

ſtand or fall together.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Sir <hi>Oliver Lambert</hi> had driven the <hi>Burks</hi>
and their <hi>Mac William</hi> out of the County of <hi>Mayo,</hi> and on the
18th of <hi>November</hi> the Deputy began his Journey to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naugh,</hi>
and on the ſecond of <hi>December</hi> he came to <hi>Athloan,</hi> and
on the 14th of <hi>December, O Connor Sligo</hi> and <hi>Rory O Donell</hi> came
thither and made their Submiſſion to him; and although <hi>O
Connor</hi> did act his part well, and alleadg'd many plauſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
yet <hi>O Donell</hi> not only out-did him, but alſo exceeded
all others that had ſubmitted to that day; for he was very
frank and generous in his Deportment, and ſubmitted without
Capitulation or Condition; which was the more regarded,
becauſe he was a man of Parts and Courage, but the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was how to compromiſe the matter between him and Sir
<hi>Neal Garve,</hi> who was no better than an inſatiable unruly
Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Deputy kept <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> at <hi>Galway,</hi> and there received
into favour the <hi>Flahertyes, Mac Dermonds, O Connor roe,</hi> and

                  </p>
                  <p>The Deputy ordered that the Fort of <hi>Gallaway</hi> ſhould be

<hi>O Rourk;</hi> but becauſe it may ſeem that theſe people could
never relapſe and apoſtatize (as many of them did) if there
had been any obligation laid upon them to be loyal, I thought
it not unneceſſary to inform the Reader, that every man that
ſubmitted, took the following Oath.</p>

not one of the Garriſon (being 143 ſelect men) eſcaped, but

to thoſe that fight againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> and his Holineſ's Letter
of the 20th of <hi>January,</hi> 1601. directed to <hi>Tyrone,</hi> to animate
him and his followers to perſevere in their Rebellion, but alſo
procured the Cenſures of the Univerſities of <hi>Salamanca</hi> and
<hi>Valladolid,</hi> that it was mortal ſin for a Papiſt to fight againſt
Prince <hi>O Neal,</hi> the Champion of the Church, who militates
for the Catholick Faith, and that they cannot be forgiven, till
they deſert the Hereticks Service, and Mr. <hi>Sullevan</hi> thinks he
has nickt it, when he calls the contrary Opinion <hi>Inſanam &amp;
vene noſam doctrinam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems that the Earl of <hi>Twomond</hi> (remembring the ſevere
Government of <hi>Fitton,</hi> Preſident of <hi>Connaugh</hi>) whil'ſt he
was in <hi>England,</hi> made his humble Suit to the Queen, that the
County of <hi>Clare</hi> might be re-annexed to <hi>Munſter,</hi> whereof it
was formerly a part, whereupon the Queen the 29th of <hi>July,</hi>
1602. wrote to the Lord Deputy and Council on that Subject,
and on the 4th of <hi>October,</hi> ſhe wrote poſitively to renew the
Earl's Commiſſion to uſe Martial Law in that County, and
to put him into all Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer and Terminor, Goal-delivery,</hi>
&amp;c. next to the Preſident and Chief Juſtice, and to
continue his Band of 200 Men, and his Entertainment of 10 <hi>s.</hi>
a Day, and to reunite <hi>Twomond</hi> to <hi>Munſter,</hi> unleſs they found
great reaſon to the contrary; they debated the matter, and
'twas alledg'd for the reunion. 1. The Name <hi>Thomond,</hi> i. e.
<hi>North Munſter,</hi> which proves it was originally part of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and ſo has continued 1300 Years. 2. It was inhabited
by <hi>Munſter</hi>-men, the <hi>O Bryans</hi> being ſetled on both ſides the
River <hi>Shenin;</hi> their Language and Pronunciation is the ſame,
and ſince there is an Alliance between them, they ought not
to be ſeperated. 3. <hi>Twomond</hi> was formerly part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and the Inhabitants have been often tryed for
Life and Eſtate by Judges and Commiſſioners at <hi>Lymerick,</hi> but
of late, the County being too large, part of it was made a
ſeparate County, by name of the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:65997:260"/>
was ſubject to the Governours of <hi>Munſter.</hi> 4. It
was firſt united to <hi>Connaugh,</hi> at the importunity of <hi>Fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Roſcomon, Sligo,</hi> and <hi>Mayo,</hi> were not ameſnable to Law,
this brought great inconveniency to <hi>Thomond,</hi> till it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Sir <hi>Nicholas Malby</hi> procured it again to be ſeperated,
and ſo it continued till the Earl got the Martial Government of
it, and his Company is of the Liſt of <hi>Munſter.</hi> 6. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
the Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who governs <hi>Lymerick,</hi> ſhould
have command on both ſides the River <hi>Shenin,</hi> to prevent the
deſign of foreign Enemies. 7. Part of <hi>Twomond</hi> is within the
Liberties of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and muſt not de diſpuniſhable till reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
can be had from <hi>Conaugh 8. Lymerick</hi> is the Sanctuary
and Bulwark of <hi>Twomond,</hi> and the fitteſt place to keep it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and therefore the Citizens have purchaſed good Eſtates
in <hi>Twomond,</hi> and it would be very inconvenient to have them
and their Eſtates under ſeveral Governments. 9. <hi>Twomond</hi>
is in the Province of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Munſter;</hi>
and theſe Reaſons prevailing, the County of <hi>Clare</hi> was again
made part of <hi>Munſter.</hi>

I ſhould omit the Indulgence granted by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the

                  <opener>
                     <salute>GREAT SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT is noted by the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in the
Life of the Wiſe and Victorious
Prince, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, That
it was his Cuſtom to be Firſt or Second in
all his Warlike Exploits; and that it was
his Saying, when he heard of Rebels, <hi>That
he deſir'd but to ſee them.</hi> What Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
has lately publiſhed to the Two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Parliament, is of the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> and
<hi>Policy.</hi> But This is not the only Parallel
between Your Majeſty and that Great
King; for He alſo came from Abroad, yet
<pb facs="tcp:65997:266"/>
with this Diſtinction, that His Coming was
only to aſſert his <hi>Particular</hi> Claim; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Coming of Your Majeſty was of
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Concern, it being to free us all,
who were at the Brink of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and
<hi>Bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To whom then (GREAT SIR) ſhould
I Dedicate this <hi>Second Part of the Hiſtory
of Ireland,</hi> but to Your Majeſty, who now
Dedicates Your Self to the Redemption of
<hi>Ireland;</hi> and being thus far in Poſſeſſion of
the Subject, I am already preparing to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
all Your Majeſty's Glorious Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and am in certain expectation of a
greater Theme, than ever that Kingdom
could hitherto boaſt.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, Your Majeſty hath herein the
Power of Two Kings to Oppoſe; but 'tis
no ill Symptom, that by what you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done, the One of them has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to ſend his <hi>Plate,</hi> and the Other his
<hi>Cannon</hi> to the <hi>Mint.</hi> Nor ought we to think
better of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Armies or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Courage, than
is thought by thoſe who judge Both well
paid for, when but rewarded with <hi>Copper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, The Bulk of that Nation
are already ſurfeited with the Stratagem of
<pb facs="tcp:65997:266"/>
that Imaginary Coin; they feel the Fruits
of contending for a <hi>French Intereſt,</hi> by the
Slaughter, Sickneſs, and Defolation of the
Year paſt; ſo that 'tis poſſible <hi>Humane
Nature</hi> may at length be too hard for the
<hi>Prieſt</hi> and the <hi>Politician</hi> too, and that when
by Your Majeſty's Preſence they behold
their Ruin at hand, they may give more
Exerciſe to Your <hi>Mercy</hi> than to Your
<hi>Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was truly obſerved by Your Majeſty,
in Your late Gracious Speech, <hi>That in the
ſpeedy Recovery of</hi> Ireland <hi>the Place and Honor
of</hi> England <hi>did conſiſt, and that hereby alone
Taxes could ceaſe;</hi> So that as Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is now willing to expoſe Your Perſon
for thoſe Great Ends, 'tis not to be feared,
but the <hi>Nation</hi> will ſecond Your Majeſty
with ſuch Royal Supplies, as may make it
a <hi>ſhort</hi> and not a <hi>lingring Work;</hi> for not
only in This, but in many other high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
'tis <hi>Expedition</hi> alone that can anſwer
the Anxieties which <hi>England</hi> muſt be in
for Your Majeſty's Abſence: And ſeeing
Your Majeſty will leave behind that Great
Pledge, Your Royal Conſort and our moſt
Gracious Queen, Your Majeſty will not
want Your own Anxieties alſo for a ſpeedy
Return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:267"/>
But that it may be with ſuch Laurels, as
may bring Terror to <hi>France,</hi> with Triumph
to Your own Kingdoms, and a happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Your poor Proteſtant Subjects
of <hi>Ireland</hi> to their Native Homes, is the
moſt fervent Prayer of,</p>

                  <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>YOU have here a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>great Variety</hi>
and <hi>much Intrigue:</hi> It takes in a large
Space of <hi>Time,</hi> of above <hi>Fifty Years,</hi> and
begins at the End of <hi>one War,</hi> and ends
with the Cloſe of <hi>another.</hi> The <hi>long Interval</hi> between
theſe <hi>Two Periods,</hi> being almoſt <hi>Forty years,</hi> was ſpent
in a <hi>profound Peace,</hi> (the ſhort <hi>Commotion</hi> of <hi>O
Dogharty</hi> only excepted) and in promoting all thoſe
<hi>Bleſſings</hi> of <hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Good Laws</hi> which the <hi>Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi>
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could accompliſh. But the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Part of the <hi>Time</hi> was, according to Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s
<hi>Prophetical Sermon,</hi> Preach'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1601. turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Scene of <hi>Blood, Treachery,</hi> and <hi>Deſolation,</hi> which
overturned all. The <hi>Roots</hi> of that <hi>ſo great Cruelty</hi>
and <hi>Univerſal Defection</hi> are already hinted at in the
<hi>Preface</hi> of my <hi>Former Part,</hi> by thoſe <hi>Differences</hi> there
ſet forth of <hi>Nation, Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon King <hi>James</hi> his Acceſſion to the <hi>Crown,</hi> the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſurfeited with <hi>War,</hi> ſo that all things in
that <hi>Kingdom</hi> had a tendency to <hi>Peace.</hi> And tho' a
Rumor ſpread abroad, and believ'd by the <hi>Iriſh, That
the King was of their Religion,</hi> put ſome of the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Towns</hi> into a <hi>Commotion,</hi> yet the <hi>Diligence</hi>
and <hi>Expedition</hi> of the <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> did ſoon appeaſe
that <hi>Storm,</hi> and reduce the <hi>Diſobedient</hi> to their Duty.</p>
                  <p>And tho' the <hi>natural Inclination</hi> of that <hi>King</hi> to
<hi>Peace,</hi> was a great Temptation to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to try their
Fortune with him in a <hi>War,</hi> and accordingly the Lords
<hi>Tyrone</hi> and <hi>Tyrconell,</hi> and Sir <hi>Cahir O Dogharty</hi>
attempted it, yet the Rebels were always baffled in their
<pb facs="tcp:65997:268"/>
Undertakings, by the <hi>Diligence, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi>
of thoſe to whom the <hi>King</hi> entruſted his <hi>Iriſh Affairs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed both King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, and King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, did take a <hi>particular Care</hi> to put the
<hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> into ſuch Hands as were <hi>worthy
of it,</hi> and underwent the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> thereof with
<hi>Advantage</hi> to that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>Honor</hi> to <hi>themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Firſt was the Lord <hi>Montjoy,</hi> whom King <hi>James</hi>
found <hi>Deputy,</hi> and ſoon after made <hi>Lord Lieutenant.</hi>
This <hi>Lord</hi> was thought in <hi>England</hi> to be a better <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi>
than a <hi>Soldier;</hi> but when he came to <hi>Ireland,</hi> he
proved the <hi>beſt Soldier</hi> that <hi>Kingdom</hi> had ſeen in many
Years: It was he that found out the <hi>true Way</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>War</hi> with the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> For being well ſupplied with
<hi>Neceſſaries</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> he plainly ſaw, that if he
could attack them at a time when they wanted all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences</hi>
to keep the <hi>Field,</hi> he could meet with very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no <hi>Reſiſtance;</hi> and therefore he ſupplied his <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
Gariſons</hi> with <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Proviſions;</hi> and they by
their <hi>frequent Excurſions</hi> did ſuch Execution on the
<hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that by One <hi>Winters
War</hi> he reduc'd them to the <hi>Neceſſity of eating one
another,</hi> and forced their <hi>Ringleader,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi>
to ſubmit to his Mercy, and ſo made an end of that
<hi>Rebellion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> or rather <hi>Deputy,</hi> Sir <hi>George Cary,</hi>
was <hi>Treaſurer at Wars,</hi> and a <hi>worthy Gentleman;</hi>
but nothing of <hi>extraordinary moment</hi> hapned during
his <hi>Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next was Sir <hi>Arthur Chicheſter,</hi> afterwards
Lord of <hi>Belfaſt;</hi> one well experienc'd in the <hi>Affairs</hi> of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> whereof he held the <hi>Chief Government</hi> for
<hi>Eleven Years.</hi> He was a <hi>good Soldier,</hi> and a true <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman,</hi>
and did <hi>Three great Things</hi> towards a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:</hi>
The <hi>Firſt</hi> was, his <hi>Management</hi> of the
moſt <hi>ſtubborn Parliament</hi> that ever was in that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
which nevertheleſs he prevail'd with to Attaint
the Earls of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and <hi>Tyrconell,</hi> Sir <hi>Cahir O
<pb facs="tcp:65997:268"/>
Dogharty,</hi> and others, and to make an <hi>Act of Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi>
and to give the <hi>King</hi> a <hi>Subſidy:</hi> And the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
was, the <hi>Plantation</hi> of the <hi>Forfeit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d Eſtates</hi> in
<hi>Ulſter,</hi> which he very much influenc'd and promoted:
And the <hi>Third</hi> was, the <hi>Reviving</hi> and <hi>Reſtoring</hi> the
<hi>Circuits</hi> for <hi>Judges of Aſſize</hi> in both the <hi>Provinces</hi> of
<hi>Conaught</hi> and <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lords Juſtices,</hi> Doctor <hi>Jones</hi> Archbiſhop of
<hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
were Men Famous in their reſpective <hi>Faculties,</hi>
and are <hi>Founders</hi> of the <hi>Noble Families</hi> of the Earl of
<hi>Ranelagh</hi> and Viſcount <hi>Powerſcourt:</hi> And Sir <hi>John
Denham</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice, was not leſs Renowned
than either of <hi>Them,</hi> by reaſon of his <hi>great Learning</hi>
in his <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> to which the <hi>Crown</hi> owes the <hi>firſt
Advancement</hi> of that Conſiderable Branch of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue</hi>
ariſing by the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> was Sir <hi>Oliver Saint John,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Viſcount <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> a Perſon <hi>Nobly deſcended,</hi>
and of a <hi>generous Temper.</hi> He had given great Proof
of his <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Kinſale,</hi>
and was not <hi>inferior</hi> to any of his <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> in a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Concern</hi> for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi>
of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> but he hapned in an <hi>ill time,</hi> as did
alſo his <hi>Succeſſor</hi> the Worthy Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> whilſt the
<hi>Spaniſh Match</hi> was in agitation: So that both theſe
<hi>brave Men,</hi> by the Clamour of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power of their <hi>Popiſh Enemies,</hi> came away in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace:
But their <hi>Innocence</hi> being afterwards vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as it was, this <hi>Affront</hi> was in ſome meaſure atton'd
for, by the ſubſequent <hi>Favour</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lords Juſtices</hi> that received the <hi>Sword</hi> from the
Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> were the Viſcount <hi>Loftus</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi> Lord
Chancellor, one of <hi>great Parts</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer, who was one of
the moſt <hi>extraordinary Perſons</hi> either <hi>That</hi> or <hi>any other
Age</hi> hath produced, with reſpect to the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>juſt
Acquiſitions</hi> of <hi>Eſtate</hi> that he made, and the <hi>Publick
<pb facs="tcp:65997:269"/>
Works</hi> that he began and finiſhed, for the advancement

and happy had it been for that <hi>Kingdom</hi> if he
had gone over in time: For altho' the Lords Juſtices
<hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Burlace</hi> were very <hi>worthy Men,</hi> and did
not deſerve ſuch <hi>Reproaches</hi> as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> aſperſed them

the <hi>Original,</hi> ſince it deſerves ſome <hi>particular Remark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>France</hi> was hardly Match enough for <hi>Spain,</hi> when
King <hi>James</hi> meditated a <hi>Spaniſh Wife</hi> for His <hi>moſt
excellent Son.</hi> And the more <hi>formidable</hi> this <hi>Power</hi>
then appeared unto Him, the more <hi>intent</hi> He was on it,
being governed by <hi>Fear,</hi> and too obſequiouſly humour'd
therein by His <hi>next Governor,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
His Favourite.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Inſtance of <hi>Spaniſh Authority</hi> in <hi>our
Court,</hi> may be that of <hi>Gondamour</hi> their <hi>Embaſſador,</hi>
who was able to bring Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> to the Block.
Surely it was a <hi>Caſe</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Impreſſion,</hi> that a
Man ſhould ſuffer for acting by the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of his
own <hi>Prince.</hi> But becauſe this was ſo <hi>incongruous</hi> and
<hi>harſh,</hi> they rake into an <hi>old Fault,</hi> which in the Opinion
of all Men was extinguiſh'd by his <hi>new Commiſſion:</hi>
For who was ever made a <hi>General,</hi> and intruſted with
<pb facs="tcp:65997:270"/>
the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>other Men,</hi> who was not underſtood at the
ſame time to be <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>his own?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Second,</hi> and more <hi>unfortunate Step,</hi> was what
we noted in His <hi>Treaty</hi> and <hi>Deſignation</hi> of a Lady of
a <hi>different Religion</hi> for the <hi>Prince.</hi> He had not done
this in His <hi>own Caſe;</hi> and there wanted in all <hi>Europe</hi>
an <hi>Inſtance</hi> where any <hi>Roman Catholick Sovereign</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> for His <hi>Conſort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this I reckon the <hi>Partition-wall</hi> was undermined,
and it was a Day of <hi>unhappy Counſel</hi> to the <hi>Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of <hi>England.</hi> But the Caſe having been decided by
<hi>the Father,</hi> and the <hi>ſame Favourite</hi> ſucceeding to <hi>the
Son,</hi> 'tis probable the <hi>main Queſtion</hi> never came ſo
much as in Debate. For King <hi>Charles</hi> coming then to
the <hi>Crown,</hi> and having reſented the <hi>ill Treatment</hi> he
found in <hi>Spain,</hi> he preſently took in with the <hi>alternate
Power,</hi> and Married a Daughter of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was a Lady who had <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Beauty;</hi> and
the <hi>King</hi> being a Man of <hi>ſtrict Vertue,</hi> proved an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
Husband:</hi> But He was often troubled with Her
<hi>buſie</hi> and <hi>intriguing Temper,</hi> and the <hi>ill Company</hi>
She brought with Her from <hi>France;</hi> ſo that being at
length ſcandalized at their <hi>Inſolence,</hi> and their <hi>tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering</hi>
in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> he diſmiſt them into their
<hi>own Country,</hi> and <hi>War</hi> thereupon immediately enſued
with the <hi>French King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, thus it came to paſs that <hi>Popery</hi> got Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>our Court;</hi> and tho' it were bounded and chained
down by <hi>Articles,</hi> yet when thoſe who were to <hi>obey,</hi>
thought it <hi>Merit</hi> to <hi>tranſgreſs,</hi> 'tis poſſible this <hi>Serpent</hi>
might creep ſometimes out of its <hi>Circle,</hi> and give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to <hi>Cenſures</hi> that were <hi>juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet was it a Work of <hi>Time,</hi> and there needed many
other <hi>angry Conjunctures</hi> in <hi>Government,</hi> before the
<hi>Diſcontented</hi> could venture (as afterwards) to aſperſe
and involve the <hi>whole Court</hi> in the <hi>Calumnies</hi> of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
And as the World hath ſince had leiſure to ſee
why theſe <hi>Outcries</hi> were extended, and what <hi>Ruins</hi> were
<pb facs="tcp:65997:270"/>
thereby brought about; ſo have they been convinc'd, that
moſt of thoſe who were <hi>blaſted</hi> in <hi>that Contagion,</hi>
have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stood <hi>firm Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and, above all,
the <hi>King Himſelf,</hi> who died an <hi>inſuperable Martyr</hi>
for it.</p>
                  <p>However, as to the <hi>Queen,</hi> whether it were by <hi>Fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
or a <hi>miſtaken Zeal,</hi> ſurely the <hi>Event</hi> hath ſhewn,
that all Her <hi>intermedling</hi> in <hi>Affairs</hi> did but afflict the
<hi>Cauſe</hi> of that <hi>Pious King.</hi> Her <hi>reſtleſs Mind</hi> was like
the <hi>Worm</hi> in the <hi>Gourd,</hi> which tho' much reſtrain'd
while He was <hi>alive,</hi> yet ſince hath it eaten to the <hi>Root,</hi>
in a fatal perverting of His <hi>Offspring,</hi> and laying the
<hi>Foundations</hi> of their <hi>preſent Calamity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But my <hi>Province</hi> being limited to Things of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I
ſhall only from the <hi>Topick</hi> which is touch'd, obſerve, <hi>That
the greateſt Obſtacle and Contradictions that aroſe in
Reclaiming the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>and bringing them (or the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that fought againſt them) to His Majeſty's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
was by thoſe Two Emiſſaries that Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
employed, Sir</hi> Kenelm Digby <hi>in 1644. to</hi> Rome,
<hi>and the Earl of</hi> Glamorgan <hi>in 1645. into</hi> Ireland. For
both of theſe moving in <hi>different Meaſures</hi> from the
Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who was <hi>Lord Lieuteuant,</hi> he was
infinitely perplex'd thereby in his <hi>Treaty</hi> with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
they ſtill preſſing for <hi>more</hi> than he had either <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
or <hi>Inclinations</hi> to allow them: And when at laſt
he compaſs'd a <hi>Treaty</hi> with them in 1646. it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<hi>broken,</hi> and ſhamefully <hi>overthrown,</hi> as in the
<hi>following Story</hi> will be manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Truth is, they needed but</hi> little Countenance <hi>of</hi>
pretended Authority, <hi>when the</hi> Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<hi>of</hi> their Church, <hi>or at leaſt the</hi> Documents <hi>of</hi>
their Clergy, <hi>led them from the</hi> Beginning <hi>unto all the</hi>

That the Pope was by Divine Right Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch

That he might Deprive and Dethrone Kings, and had
Power of both Swords, to which every Soul upon

That he had power to abſolve from all Oaths,
and that thoſe who are ſlain in the Quarrel of the
Church againſt an Excommunicated Prince, die true
Martyrs of Chriſt, and their Souls fly to Heaven im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
                  <p>So that it is no wonder, that a People for the moſt
part abounding in <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Bigotry,</hi> tempted by
the Hopes of <hi>Profit</hi> in the <hi>Plunders</hi> and <hi>Succeſs</hi> of the

not appear in all the <hi>Records,</hi> that any <hi>Staln</hi> of <hi>Diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
was ever imputed to any that were the <hi>Chief

                  </p>
                  <p>5. That his <hi>Grace</hi> (not to count what <hi>Titles</hi> they
had before) was the <hi>Twelfth</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the
<hi>Seventh</hi> of that Name of <hi>James.</hi> He who was the
<pb facs="tcp:65997:272"/>
                     <hi>Second James,</hi> and ſtyl'd <hi>The Noble Earl,</hi> as being
by his Mother <hi>de Bohun</hi> Great Grandſon to King <hi>Edw. I.</hi>
was <hi>thrice Lord Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And the <hi>Fifth
James</hi> being by <hi>Hen. VI.</hi> made alſo Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire,
Knight of the Garter,</hi> and <hi>Lord Treaſurer</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
was <hi>Five</hi> times made <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> and <hi>Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had a <hi>Patent</hi> of it for <hi>Twelve
Years.</hi> His late <hi>Grace,</hi> the <hi>Seventh James,</hi> was <hi>Lord
Lieutenant Four</hi> times, which in all took in about
<hi>Twenty four Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And if we ſhall reckon how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>this Family,</hi> and how often they have been concern'd
in <hi>that Government,</hi> it thus appears, That from the
31 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. 1247. when <hi>Theobald Butler</hi> Lord of
<hi>Carrick</hi> was made one of the <hi>Lords Juſtices,</hi> to 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 2.
1684. that his <hi>Grace</hi> was diſmiſt from being <hi>Lord
Lieutenant,</hi> there have in the ſpace of <hi>Four hundred
thirty ſeven Years</hi> been <hi>Ten</hi> of <hi>this Family</hi> who have
<hi>Seven and twenty times</hi> been either <hi>Lords Juſtices, Lords
Deputies,</hi> or <hi>Lords Lieutenants</hi> of <hi>that Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Inſtances</hi> are perhaps ſufficient to give the
<hi>Reader</hi> ſome farther <hi>Curioſity</hi> to know by what <hi>Steps</hi>
this <hi>Great Man</hi> grew up into the <hi>World,</hi> who had a
<hi>various</hi> and <hi>difficult Part</hi> in thoſe <hi>Revolutions</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
<hi>Three Kingdome</hi> and the <hi>Monarchs</hi> thereof. And
inaſmuch as they ſeem to reflect ſome <hi>Light</hi> on part of
the <hi>following Story,</hi> I will venture to add what I alſo
found in the <hi>ſame Manuſcript,</hi> as followeth.</p>
                  <p>That the ſaid <hi>Thomas Duff,</hi> having no other <hi>Iſſue</hi>
than his <hi>Daughter</hi> the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he firſt married
her to his Nephew <hi>Theobald</hi> Viſcount <hi>Tullough,</hi> who
was a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> as well as <hi>himſelf.</hi> But he ſoon dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Childleſs,</hi> and the <hi>young Widow</hi> being made <hi>very
conſiderable</hi> in her <hi>Fortune</hi> by the <hi>Father's Indulgence,</hi>
there came Sir <hi>Richard Preſton</hi> a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> who being
much favoured by King <hi>James,</hi> and fortified by His
<hi>Credentials,</hi> he obtain'd the <hi>Lady,</hi> and was made
thereupon Lord <hi>Dingwell</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
in <hi>Ireland.</hi> This Earl ſoon began to ſtretch and
<pb facs="tcp:65997:272"/>
enlarge his <hi>Pretenſions</hi> to the <hi>Eſtate:</hi> But Earl <hi>Walter</hi>
the <hi>Heir at Law</hi> oppoſed him. King <hi>James</hi> was pleaſed
to take upon Him the <hi>Arbitration</hi> between them, but did
it with ſuch <hi>partiality,</hi> as Earl <hi>Walter</hi> thought, that he
choſe rather to be thrown into the <hi>Fleet</hi> as for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi>
than to <hi>ſubmit.</hi> There he lay a <hi>Priſoner</hi> for
<hi>Eight years</hi> together, his <hi>whole Eſtate</hi> Sequeſtred and
Extended, his <hi>County Palatine</hi> of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> which had
been <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four hundred years</hi> in the <hi>Family,</hi> ſeiſed
by <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> into the <hi>King</hi>'s Hands, and he reduced
to a <hi>ſhameful Want.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was
active in this <hi>Oppreſſion;</hi> but the <hi>Cry</hi> of it grew <hi>ſo
lowd</hi> at laſt, that the <hi>King</hi> relented for what he had
done.</p>
                  <p>In theſe <hi>Troubles</hi> it was that his <hi>Grace's Father, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
Viſcount <hi>Thurles,</hi> coming over to proſecute in this
<hi>Contention,</hi> was drown'd in 1618. upon which his <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
brought her <hi>young Son</hi> over from <hi>Ireland,</hi> whither
he had been carried at the Age of <hi>Three years,</hi> and now
he was about <hi>Nine.</hi> She put him to a <hi>Private School,</hi>
under a <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> but by Order of King
<hi>James</hi> he was removed to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi>
(Doctor <hi>Abbot</hi>) and by <hi>him</hi> he was <hi>wholly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd</hi>
for <hi>Five</hi> or <hi>Six years,</hi> without any <hi>Penſion</hi> from
<hi>Court,</hi> or <hi>poſſibility</hi> of <hi>Help</hi> from <hi>home,</hi> where all was
ſequeſtred and depreſt. By <hi>him</hi> alſo was he firſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> unto which he ſtuck faſt to his
Death.</p>
                  <p>In 1628. his <hi>Grace</hi> was at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> to take Share
in the <hi>Expedition</hi> then preparing for the <hi>Relief</hi> of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel;</hi>
but the <hi>ſudden Death</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
put him upon <hi>other Meaſures;</hi> for in a while after
he married the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Preſton,</hi> which ended
and reconciled the <hi>long Contentions</hi> of the <hi>Family.</hi>
This <hi>Lady</hi> was by the <hi>Marriage</hi> aforementioned the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Child</hi> of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> who being alſo
lately drown'd, ſhe fell in <hi>Wardſhip</hi> to King <hi>Charles</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:273"/>
the Firſt, and His Majeſty beſtowed the <hi>Wardſhip</hi> upon
the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> then <hi>Lord Chamberlain.</hi> She was
intended for a <hi>Nephew</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s,
which drew him into that <hi>Partiality;</hi> and his <hi>Grace</hi>
was in <hi>particular</hi> forbid by <hi>His Majeſty</hi> to pretend unto
His <hi>Ward.</hi> However, the <hi>young Lady</hi> ſaw none in
the <hi>whole Court,</hi> who either for <hi>Beauty</hi> or for <hi>Parts</hi>
could outſhine her <hi>Kinſman;</hi> And <hi>Both</hi> being agreed, he
was forced to pay down <hi>Fifteen thouſand Pounds</hi> to
the ſaid Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> for her <hi>Wardſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were <hi>all the Favours</hi> that either <hi>he</hi> or <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi>
could <hi>then</hi> meet with in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
So haſtning with his <hi>Lady</hi> to <hi>Acton</hi> near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and
there ſtaying about <hi>a Year</hi> with his <hi>Uncle</hi> Sir <hi>Robert
Poyntz,</hi> he went for <hi>Ireland</hi> at the end of 1630. ſoon
after which (as the Manner there was) he purchas'd a
<hi>Troop of Horſe</hi> in the <hi>Standing Army.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
went over <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> in 1633. In a while after he
call'd a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which being appointed to meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> a <hi>Proclamation</hi> iſſued, <hi>That
none of the Members, either Peers or Commons,
ſhould enter with their Swords.</hi> All obey'd the <hi>Order</hi>
ſave <hi>this young Lord,</hi> who told the <hi>Black Rod</hi> at the
Door, <hi>He ſhould have no Sword of his, except in his
Guts.</hi> So being the <hi>only Peer</hi> who ſat that day in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance</hi>
of the <hi>Proclamation,</hi> it fired the <hi>Lord Deputy,</hi>
as not w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt to be <hi>diſobey</hi>'d. His <hi>Grace</hi> was call'd upon
in the <hi>Evening</hi> to anſwer for it, who thereupon ſhew'd
<hi>His Majeſty's Writ</hi> calling him to <hi>Parliament Cinctus
cum gladio;</hi> which ſort of <hi>Anſwer</hi> being not expected,
and finding him like to prove an <hi>untractable Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
it was in deliberation <hi>that Night,</hi> between the <hi>Lord
Deputy</hi> and his <hi>Two-Friends,</hi> Sir <hi>George Ratcliff</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Wandesford, Whether to trample him quite
under foot, or to oblige ſo daring a young Man, who
was now alſo grown very Popular?</hi> But Sir <hi>George</hi>
being for the <hi>more benign Extreme,</hi> he was taken into
<pb facs="tcp:65997:273"/>
                     <hi>Favour, careſs'd;</hi> and made one of the <hi>Privy Council.</hi>
No <hi>Opportunities</hi> were from that time forward omitted
to <hi>oblige</hi> him, or ſet him forth in a <hi>high Character</hi> to
<hi>His Majeſty:</hi> So that in the Year 1639 the <hi>Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi>
made him <hi>Lieutenant General</hi> of the <hi>Horſe</hi> in
the <hi>Army</hi> which was then <hi>newly rais'd,</hi> but as ſoon <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded.</hi>
Upon the neck of this, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>
fell into <hi>thoſe Troubles,</hi> which in <hi>May,</hi> 1640. hurried
him to the <hi>Scaffold.</hi> But the <hi>Earl</hi> having heard with
what <hi>vigour</hi> his <hi>Grace</hi> contended to <hi>oppoſe</hi> and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw</hi>
theſe <hi>Accuſations</hi> which came againſt him from
the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as it was the <hi>laſt Requeſt</hi>
this <hi>Earl</hi> made to <hi>His Majeſty, That he would be
pleas'd to beſtow his Blue Garter upon his Grace,</hi> ſo
in <hi>June</hi> following his <hi>Grace</hi> had notice of <hi>His Majeſty's
Gracious Intentions</hi> to confer it accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was at this time appointed to
be <hi>Lord Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> tho' by <hi>ſome Accidents</hi>
he never went over. It was on the 23d of <hi>October,</hi>
1641. that the <hi>Rebellion</hi> broke out, the <hi>News</hi> whereof
being brought to <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> then in <hi>Scotland, His
Majeſty</hi> does by <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>his Grace</hi> from <hi>Edinborough,</hi>
of the 31th of the <hi>ſame Month</hi> lament that <hi>Calamity,</hi>
and deſires and preſſes his <hi>Grace</hi> to take on him to be
<hi>Lieutenant General</hi> of the <hi>Army.</hi> This was in effect
by <hi>Neceſſity</hi> thrown on him, even before that <hi>Command</hi>
came<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; but in <hi>May,</hi> 1642. it came to him in <hi>Form</hi> by
<hi>Commiſſion</hi> from the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> as <hi>General.</hi>
In <hi>Auguſt</hi> after, His <hi>Majeſty</hi> being at <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
where He ſet up His <hi>Standard,</hi> ſent his <hi>Grace</hi> a <hi>Patent</hi>

His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> by the <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> of the <hi>Lords

                  </p>
                  <p>It was by <hi>theſe Steps</hi> that his <hi>Grace</hi> came ſuddenly
to be embark'd in a <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to which he was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
a <hi>Stranger.</hi> He had not had the <hi>Means</hi> for <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi>

or ever ſeen <hi>War</hi> either <hi>abroad</hi> or at <hi>home.</hi> He
was made a <hi>General</hi> before he was a <hi>Soldier.</hi> His ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>firſt Eſſay</hi> was to oppoſe a <hi>bloody Rebellion,</hi> then
newly broke out: And how far he was able by a <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Body,</hi> and the <hi>vivacity</hi> of his <hi>Parts,</hi> and a <hi>bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Crown,</hi> to diſcharge and ſuſtain that
<hi>Truſt;</hi> or how he bore up in all thoſe <hi>Viciſſitudes</hi> of
<hi>Exaltation</hi> and <hi>Baniſhment,</hi> of <hi>Plenty</hi> and of <hi>Want,</hi> of
<hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Depreſſion,</hi> which did in the Courſe of
about <hi>Fifty Years</hi> after ſo often befal him, may prove
<hi>Matter</hi> for a <hi>larger Place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt who manag'd the <hi>Sword of State</hi> was the
Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> who was alſo an <hi>Engliſh Peer,</hi>
and Earl of <hi>St. Albans:</hi> He was the <hi>Firſt Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
that had been entruſted with the <hi>Chief Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
ſince the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were come
to that paſs, as not to endure a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> to be over
them; and ſo this <hi>brave Gentleman</hi> was deputed by
the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> to take <hi>his Place.</hi> And tho' his
<hi>Religion</hi> was pleaſing to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> yet the <hi>King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
wherewith he was clothed, was by no means accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to them, that deſign'd to ſhake off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of
<hi>England;</hi> and therefore they proved as <hi>troubleſom</hi> and
<hi>refractary</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> as they had been before to the <hi>Lord
Lieutenant:</hi> So that after <hi>Two Years vexatious Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
amongſt them, and after he had <hi>in vain</hi> tried <hi>all
ways</hi> to ſupport the <hi>ſinking State,</hi> he laid down <hi>Arms,</hi>
and had Liberty to retire into <hi>England,</hi> where he died.</p>
                  <p>He was a <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>ſound Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſh'd
Loyalty,</hi> and did from the <hi>beginning</hi> abhor
their <hi>Courſes</hi> towards the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> And altho' the
<hi>Nuncio</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> made <hi>frequent Trials</hi> to ſeduce
him from his <hi>Integrity,</hi> yet being evermore <hi>fixt</hi> in his
<hi>Principles,</hi> he reſiſted all their <hi>Solicitations</hi> and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts</hi>
with an <hi>unſhaken Steadineſs.</hi> It was pity ſo
<hi>true</hi> a <hi>Nobleman</hi> ſhould not fall into <hi>better Times,</hi>
and among a <hi>better People;</hi> he might then have been as
<hi>Eminent</hi> for <hi>doing of Good,</hi> as now he appears <hi>Valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
in the <hi>reſiſting of Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:274"/>
And thus we are come to the End of a <hi>War,</hi> which
as it was <hi>raſhly</hi> and <hi>cruelly begun,</hi> ſo was it by <hi>the
Confederates</hi> with ſuch <hi>Cowardiſe</hi> and <hi>Folly carried

they never had <hi>Advantage</hi> in <hi>any One Pitch'd Battel</hi>

<hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Links</hi> of this <hi>Myſterious Chain</hi> are ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that I can hardly forbear a <hi>ſhort Proſpect</hi> of them
in the <hi>Particulars</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, to obſerve, How the <hi>Monarch</hi> of <hi>Three
Kingdoms,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, ſat peaceably here at
Home, when <hi>Scotland</hi> began to Invade him. How a
<hi>great Number</hi> in <hi>England</hi> ſiding with the <hi>Scots,</hi> put
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> into ſome <hi>Straits.</hi> How the <hi>Iriſh</hi> taking
advantage hereof, fell to the <hi>murthering</hi> of His <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Subjects</hi> in that <hi>Kingdom.</hi> How his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
ſent preſently His <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Commiſſions</hi> to
<hi>ſuppreſs</hi> thoſe <hi>Rebels,</hi> while He at home was by others
<hi>oppreſt,</hi> and at laſt <hi>overthrown,</hi> and His <hi>Children</hi>
driven into <hi>Baniſhment.</hi> How in conſequence hereof,
the <hi>ſame Uſurpers</hi> paſs into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
what His <hi>ſaid Majeſty's Commiſſion</hi> could
not, they there ſubdue and drive the <hi>Iriſh</hi> into the like
<hi>Baniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:275"/>
Here then the <hi>Cryſis</hi> began; That both <hi>Prince</hi> and
<hi>Rebel-Subjects</hi> being forced to depend on <hi>Strangers,</hi>
and <hi>both</hi> driven by the <hi>ſame Hand</hi> into a State of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Miſery,</hi> it was natural enough to <hi>forget</hi> how
Things before had ſtood between them, and only to look
<hi>forward,</hi> either how to be <hi>reveng'd,</hi> or how to <hi>ſubſiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second being (at the <hi>Uſurper's
Inſtance</hi>) expelled alſo from <hi>France,</hi> he makes <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
with <hi>Spain,</hi> and calls to Him from <hi>other Services</hi>
all His <hi>ſcattered Subjects;</hi> and in <hi>this,</hi> it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> made a <hi>Conſiderable Part.</hi> But if it
be true, that with <hi>theſe New Friends,</hi> He then <hi>ſecretly</hi>
grew <hi>reconciled</hi> unto <hi>their Religion alſo,</hi> 'tis no wonder
if they got farther into <hi>Favour</hi> than what <hi>before</hi> they
had deſerv'd. 'Tis alſo eaſie to believe, That as His
<hi>Majeſty's Reſtauration</hi> drew nigh, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> obtain'd
from Him all the <hi>good Words</hi> imaginable; ſo that when
He came into <hi>England,</hi> He lay under this <hi>Contradiction,</hi>
of having promis'd to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe

                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpared not, on their part, to fortifie the
<hi>Promiſe</hi> they had, by a <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>general Guilt</hi> on the
<hi>Iriſh:</hi> And the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were as lowd in the <hi>Juſtification</hi>
of their <hi>Innocence.</hi> So that to reconcile this <hi>Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
there was Advantage taken from what <hi>Both</hi> averr'd,
in perſuading the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to <hi>reſtore</hi> what might belong
to an <hi>Innocent,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to forego their <hi>Hopes,</hi> if
upon Trial they ſhould appear to be <hi>Guilty.</hi> However,
to make this go eaſier down on <hi>either ſide,</hi> there was a
<hi>Notion</hi> ſet up, and ſtrangely imbib'd, of a <hi>prodigious
Stock</hi> of <hi>undiſpoſed Acres,</hi> which were ſufficient to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
not only the <hi>Diſappointments</hi> of <hi>ſome,</hi> but even
the <hi>Expectations</hi> of <hi>all.</hi> Upon this an <hi>Act</hi> is fram'd
by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and tho' by the <hi>Tenor</hi> and <hi>Contexture</hi>
of it, nothing was more <hi>improbable</hi> than the <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of <hi>Innocence,</hi> yet by <hi>Favour</hi> in a <hi>Majority</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:65997:275"/>
                     <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> ſent, and <hi>inſtructed</hi> how to execute <hi>that
Law,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> prov'd <hi>fortunate</hi> beyond all <hi>expectation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> was always <hi>more open</hi> and
<hi>avowed</hi> in his <hi>Patronage</hi> of them from the <hi>beginning;</hi>
and <hi>frequent Eſſays</hi> were made by his <hi>Power</hi> with the
<hi>King</hi> to <hi>advance</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> them by <hi>Marks</hi> of
<hi>Favour.</hi> But the <hi>King</hi> was <hi>ſo cautious</hi> of His own
<hi>Safety,</hi> and He Reigned <hi>ſo long,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
time to flouriſh. For there was an <hi>Army</hi> kept up of
<hi>Seven thouſand Proteſtants,</hi> and all the <hi>Commands</hi>
and <hi>Offices,</hi> both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military,</hi> were in the
Hands of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> However, as His <hi>Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
drew nigher to the <hi>Throne,</hi> and as his <hi>Influence</hi>
with the <hi>King</hi> increas'd, ſo began this <hi>Flouriſhing State</hi>
of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to be <hi>undermin'd.</hi> And no ſooner
had he gotten the <hi>Scepter,</hi> but he began openly to <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,</hi>
what ſurely was <hi>before intended,</hi> and the <hi>whole
Frame</hi> and <hi>Contexture</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Government</hi>
was <hi>ſubverted</hi> and <hi>diſſolv'd.</hi> However, we live to ſee,
as at this day, how dearly King <hi>James</hi> hath paid for
<hi>that Experiment,</hi> and for the <hi>Hopes</hi> He had, and the
<hi>Attempts</hi> he made, of an <hi>equal Succeſs</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
And this alſo is worthy of <hi>ſome Remark,</hi> That <hi>thoſe
very Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were
driven out by His <hi>Command,</hi> and took Refuge in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
ſhould <hi>ſo ſoon return</hi> under the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Orange, (out now Happy King</hi>) and aſſiſt in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Him not only out of <hi>England,</hi> but to take Refuge
in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where theſe <hi>Windings</hi> and <hi>Revolutions</hi> will end,
God Almighty only knows; but ſince we have <hi>ſo hopeful
a Proſpect</hi> that they may determine to the <hi>Honor</hi> of <hi>His
Majeſty,</hi> to the <hi>Advantage</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> the
<hi>Reſtauration</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants,</hi> and the <hi>Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment</hi>
of <hi>True Religion</hi> in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> I ſee no

TOUCHING
The Controverted Points in this HISTORY.</head>
                  <p>BECAUSE contrary Intereſts have perplexed this
Affair, and prevailed with a <hi>Party</hi> ſometimes to ſtifle
and ſometimes to diſguiſe the Truth, and becauſe
the Papiſts have repreſented ſeveral Parts of this
Hiſtory, not only in another manner, and in a more ſoft
and palliating Stile than I have done, but have reported
ſundry conſiderable Matters of Fact quite contrary to what
I have related; it will be neceſſary to make a particular Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of their moſt material Allegations, and a ſtrict
ſcrutiny into my Aſſertions, and the Proofs of them, or Reaſons
for them; and becauſe I would not interrupt the Series of
the Hiſtory with theſe inquiries, I thought it convenient to
inſert them here by way of Introduction.</p>
                  <p>But before I deſcend to particulars, it is neceſſary to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
this great Preliminary that will run through the whole,
and that is, <hi>What credit the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Roman Catholick Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
deſerve in theſe matters,</hi> and certainly it is ſo very little,
that I hope the greateſt fault that will be found with this
Collection, will be, that I have honoured Mr. <hi>Sullevan</hi> and
others of them, with too large a Confutation; for beſides the
direct Teſtimony of <hi>Peter Walſh,</hi> that theſe Popiſh Authors do

                  <p>But certainly it is more difficult to believe, that any one
could be ſo ſhameleſs to make this Objection, then it is to give it
a full and undeniable Anſwer; for the Slaughter at <hi>Magee</hi> did

of the many Murders committed by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> on the <hi>Scots,</hi>
whom they ſpared for the firſt Ten days, whilſt in the mean

World, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion broke out the 23d. day of

that very day, and every day after for a long time; all
which is teſtified by a Cloud of Witneſſes, and that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion

I ſhould not mention the Act of Adventurers, 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.
in <hi>England,</hi> which adjudged this War, not only to be <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi>
but alſo, ſo general a One, that they thought ſeveral
Millions of Acres of Land would be (as they were) forfeited
thereby; nor the Act of Settlement in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ſtiles it,
<hi>An unnatural Inſurrection and Rebellion,</hi> but that the former
ſhews the Judgment of the King and Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
in the Point, and this latter Act was expoſed to the cenſure
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, and every word was expung'd which
they could contradict.</p>
                  <p>But if the Murder of the Kings Subjects in a Hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
the declaring againſt his Religion, the Ejection of his
Clergy, the ſeizing of his Forts and Caſtles, the beſieging
of his Towns, the fighting of Battles with his Armies, the
Uſurpation of all his Prerogatives; the ſeizing of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
and the Preſumption to Act as a <hi>Separate State</hi> be not
a Rebellion, it is very difficult to define what is.</p>
                  <p>But they Reply,<note place="margin">The Third Queſtion.</note> That if it be a Rebellion, and not ſimply
juſtifiable, yet it ought to be excuſed, becauſe the Motives

the Monarchy was to be ſuppreſt, and conſequently they, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </p>
                  <p>To this I Anſwer, That they thought, and will ever think

plain Truth in their Books Printed beyond Sea, acknowledge
that it was for the Liberty of their Religion, <hi>Bellum fuit pro

that even the Regulars, <hi>In omnibus fere Regni locis,

                  </p>
                  <p>They really had leſs cauſe to Rebel in 1641, than at any
time before, they never had greater indulgence than at that
time; and ſeveral new Graces and Favours were but the
<hi>Auguſt</hi> before condeſcended unto them: As for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
Letters, they could never ſhew any that were Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
nor indeed any at all, and if the Forgery of a Lye, or
the intercepting of a Letter, perhaps written for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb facs="tcp:65997:278"/>
by one of themſelves, is in their Opinion a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for ſo general, and ſo inhumane a Rebellion; how
much does it import the Government to take care <hi>that they
ſhall never be able to Rebel any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But could they really be afraid that it was a Puritanical
War, when they ſaw it managed by the Marquiſs of <hi>Ormond</hi>
from the very beginning, or if their Jealouſie of the <hi>Puritans</hi>
was Earlier, and the Motive to their Inſurrection, why then,
did they fall upon the Biſhops and their Clergy, and Murder
the conformable Proteſtants. And as for their Extirpation,
it was far from being deſigned, or any thing like it in his
Majeſties Reign, and in Truth is ſo contrary to the Nature of
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, that we find, that when the Parliament
had ſubdued them, and brought the whole <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Power, and tho' they were provoked by this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Rebellion, and a Ten years War, yet they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
them, nor indeed leſſen their number to that degree
that in Prudence they ought to have done for the ſecurity of
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to prevent their Expulſion out of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
a ſecond time.</p>
                  <p>But it is neceſſary to obſerve, that moſt of the things they
offer to juſtifie or excuſe this premeditated Rebellion, were <hi>ex
poſt facto,</hi> and happened after the Rebellion broke out; to which;
they had no regard in their firſt Conſpiracy, which the Earl
of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> aſſures us,<note place="margin">Review 22.</note> was laid partly at home and partly
abroad, ſeveral years before the Troubles either of <hi>England</hi>
or <hi>Scotland</hi> began.</p>
                  <p>The next Objection is,<note place="margin">The Fourth Queſtion.</note> That there were great Cruelties,
and many Murthers committed on both ſides, and that ſome
<hi>Engliſh</hi> gave Orders not to ſpare Man,<note place="margin">Review 29.</note> Woman nor Child in
the Enemies Quarters, and that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> deſired the Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
on both ſides might be puniſhed; and they deſire you to
Read <hi>R. S.</hi> his Collection of Murthers.</p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer, That if the Aſſertion were true, yet
it muſt be conſidered, that what the <hi>Britiſh</hi> did, was in time
of War, in the greateſt Paſſion, and upon the higheſt Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
that could be; and it is not ſtrange, that Men whoſe
Subſtance was plundered, and whoſe Relations were murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſhould whilſt the Anguiſh was upon them be intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in their revenge; if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> could murder ſo many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cauſeleſs and pretended Fears and Jealouſies in a time of
Peace, why ſhould they object ſome few Exceſſes in a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
for real Injuries in a time of War: And indeed the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> being the firſt Aggreſſors are anſwerable even for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
they occaſioned upon themſelves, but there is no need
of farther arguing, if a difference be not made between <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
in War,</hi> and <hi>Murder in cold Blood,</hi> and <hi>in time of
Peace.</hi> But 'tis ſaid, they did conſent the Murderers on both
<pb facs="tcp:65997:278"/>
ſides ſhould be puniſhed; but who ſhould be the Judges? No
others but an Iriſh Parliament <hi>of their own chooſing,</hi> which
they knew would condemn the moſt Innocent Proteſtant, and
acquit the moſt Criminal Papiſt; beſides, though it be no
evidence to a Court, that I left 500 perſons behind me in ſuch
a Pariſh, and that none of them can ſince be found or heard
of, and I believe were all murdered: This I ſay is no Evidence
againſt <hi>A. B.</hi> and yet it would ſatisfy any impartial Hearer,
that theſe perſons came to untimely Ends, and by the means
of thoſe <hi>in whoſe power they were;</hi> ſo that the makers of the Act
of Settlement had good reaſon to ſay, <hi>That the Rapines, Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
and Maſſacres, committed by the Iriſh, and Popiſh Rebels
and Enemies, were not only well known to that Parliament, but are
notorious to the whole World,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iriſh Stat. 502.</note> 
                     <hi>not withſtanding the many Means and
Artifices, which for many years together have been uſed to Murder
ſuch Witneſſes, Suppreſs ſuch Evidences, and alſo to Vitiate and
Imbezil ſuch Records and Teſtimonies, as might prove the ſame
againſt particular Perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to <hi>R. S.</hi> his Collection of Murders, it is a mere heap
of Forgeries, deſigned only to make a noiſe; he begins with
the aforeſaid Story of the Maſſacre in the Iſle of <hi>Magee,</hi> which,
he ſays, was the firſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> though really it was ſubſequent
to many hundreds of Murders committed by the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> on the
23d of <hi>October,</hi> and thenceforward, he will not allow the
Lord <hi>Mayo</hi> nor Lady <hi>Roch</hi> to be guilty, though they were
Condemned and Executed after a fair Tryal, on full Evidence;
he falſly brags, That there were no Murders in the County
of <hi>Cork,</hi> but I have mentioned ſome, and given the reaſon
why there were none publiſhed, <hi>viz. The Murder of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon</hi>
Byſs, <hi>who had the account of them:</hi> Finally, he ſays,
that 238 <hi>Iriſh</hi> were murdered in <hi>Cloghinkilty,</hi> and 88 ty'd back to
back; and drown'd in <hi>Bandon.</hi> And becauſe I have for ſome years
lived in both thoſe Towns, I can aſſure the Reader, That the
firſt is no more than what I have related, page 113. ſaving
that perhaps there might be ſome Women and Children in the
number I there mention; and the ſecond is utterly falſe, as I
am credibly informed from ſeveral ancient Inhabitants of that
Town.</p>
                  <p>The next Queſtion is,<note place="margin">The Fifth Queſtion.</note> Whether the King Countenanced or
Commiſſioned the <hi>Iriſh Rebellion,</hi> becauſe the Iriſh Clergy
aſſured the People he did, and Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi> ſhewed the
Original Commiſſion to ſeveral. The <hi>Supreme Council</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
this Report, by pretending to act for His Majeſty's
Service, and by alledging. That the Support of His Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
was the chief Motive of their Inſurrection; and their
Generals, <hi>Owen Roe</hi> and <hi>Preſton,</hi> did in effect avouch it, by
ſummoning Caſtles and Gariſons in His Majeſty's Name, to
Surrender to them to the uſe of His Majeſty; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Preſton</hi> did ſo at <hi>Caſtlejordan</hi> and <hi>Duncannon.</hi> Moreover
<pb facs="tcp:65997:279"/>
the Iriſh called themſelves <hi>The Queen's Army,</hi> and the King
ſent but 40 Proclamations againſt them, and the Lord of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim</hi>'s
Information, <hi>Appendix</hi> 49. and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's
Letter to reſtore that Lord, <hi>becauſe what he did was by the King's
Order,</hi> do create abundance of Suſpicion in this particular.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That the King was altogether innocent
in this matter; and firſt, I muſt premiſe, That they who abett
this Objection, do greater Service to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> than they are
aware of, for if the King Commiſſioned them there could be
no Rebellion, they might be <hi>Robbers</hi> or <hi>Murderers,</hi> (as many
as were guilty reſpectively) but not <hi>Rebels;</hi> if they had the
King's Commiſſion for what they did, and conſequently the
Forfeiture of their Eſtates for that Rebellion, whereof they
could not be guilty, would be unjuſt and void, and thoſe that
Enjoy them would be bound to make Reſtitution, But this
Obſervation is nothing to the Truth or Falſity of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and is therefore offered only to prepare and diſpoſe
ſome prejudiced and prepoſſeſſed Minds to the Reception and
Entertainment of Truth, when it is diſcovered and proved.</p>
                  <p>As to the Reaſons of the Objection, they ſhall be conſidered
in order. And firſt, whoever reads the enſuing Hiſtory, or
knows any thing of the Popiſh Clergy at that time in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
will be eaſily ſatisfied, that their Teſtimony in this caſe
is the worſt ſort of <hi>Iriſh Evidence;</hi> and as for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
ſhewed by Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal,</hi> it is certain that he
forged it, and made one <hi>Michael Hariſon</hi> take a Seal from
a Patent he found at <hi>Charlemont,</hi> and fix it to this Counterfeit
Commiſſion; and thus much Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> and <hi>Hariſon</hi> confeſſed
at Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Tryal, and Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> did the ſame at the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,<note place="margin">☞</note>
although he was offered to have his Life ſpared, and his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
reſtored, if he could ſhew any Commiſſion from the King.</p>
                  <p>As for the Pretences of the <hi>Supreme Council</hi> and their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
all the world knows, that <hi>their Contradiction and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy
were apparent,</hi> for they made the ſame Pretences, even
whilſt they fought againſt the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> and His
Majeſty's Army; and they pretended to maintain His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Prerogative, whilſt they were actually uſurping all His
Prerogatives, even to that of making War, and againſt Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and with the ſame confidence and deſign they enjoyned
<hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> in the firſt Clauſe of that <hi>Oath</hi> of Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was to diſſolve all their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and to be the
Cement of their <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the number of the Proclamations His Majeſty ſent, I do
aver from Authentick Copies of the Lords Juſtices, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
Letters, that they did at firſt write but for 20, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they deſired that they might have 20 more, ſo that they
had the full number they ſent for, and all Signed by the King's
own Hand and Seal, with his Signet; and if it be conſidered
what uſe could be made of theſe Proclamations, it will be eaſily
<pb facs="tcp:65997:279"/>
allowed, the Number was more than ſufficient; for they could
only ſerve to undeceive thoſe that doubted, <hi>Whether the King
countenanced the Rebellion, or not?</hi> And it is manifeſt from
the Succeſs, that not one of the Confederates thought <hi>that he
did,</hi> for we do not find that one of them was converted or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
from the Rebellion by all theſe Proclamations.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Information, <hi>Appendix</hi> 49,
it expreſly clears the King from giving any Commiſſion for
the Rebellion; and as to the Letter in favour of that Lord 1663,
and his Reſtoration to his Eſtate thereupon, it may argue the
Prevalence of Popiſh Councils at Court at that time, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
infer any Guilt on the King that was dead 15 years before,
and in good manners we ought to ſay, they were the words of
the Secretary, and not the words of the King, ſince it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
known that they are not true, whoſever words they
are; for <hi>Antrim</hi> was ſo far from acting by the King's Orders,
that he ſided with the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and public<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ly oppoſed the Peace
of 1646. and 1648. and accordingly the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and
the Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did, by their Letter of the 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th day of
<hi>July,</hi> 1663. at large diſcover to the King, that His Majeſty
was miſinformed both in the Man and the Matter.</p>
                  <p>And I muſt add, that neither the Ceſſation nor the Peaces
of 1646. and 1648. nor any Fav<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>r extended to the Iriſh,
after the War broke out between the King and Parliament,
do concern this Argument, becauſe they were done upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a different Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> To reconcile His Subjects of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that they might joyntly contribute to His Majeſty's
Aſſiſtance in <hi>England;</hi> he was attacked on both ſides, and
tryed to get rid of one Enemy, that he might the better proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the other; he made ſeveral Eſſays to that purpoſe, with
the reſpective Parties both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and it were
as good Logick to argue him guilty of Favouring the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters,</hi>
becauſe of the Treaty at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> as to ſay, He Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
the <hi>Iriſh Rebels,</hi> becauſe of the Treaty at <hi>Sigginſtown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And having thus anſwered the Objections, I proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
That the King had no hand in that Execrable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
Firſt, becauſe he Signed 40 Proclamations againſt it,
and in his Commiſſion to hear their Grievances at <hi>Trim,</hi> there
is this paſſage, <hi>[Although We do extremely deteſt that odious
Rebellion, which the Recuſants of</hi> Ireland <hi>have without ground
or colour raiſed againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, Our Crown and Dignity,]</hi> which
the Iriſh would never have endured, (for they were highly
diſſatisfied with the Expreſſion) nor the King have offered, if
they could have made ſo good a Juſtification of themſelves as
His Majeſty's Commiſſion would have amounted to.</p>
                  <p>I do not think it neceſſary to add, That His Majeſty
devolved the Management of that War on the Parliament,
and diſpoſed of 2500000 <hi>Acres</hi> of their Forfeited Eſtates to
<pb facs="tcp:65997:280"/>
the Adventurers, though by theſe two Actions His Majeſty
did in a great meaſure put it out of his power of ſhewing the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> any favour, and much leſs ſhall I inſiſt upon his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Offer <hi>to go in Perſon againſt the Iriſh,</hi> nor his frequent
Expreſſions of his deteſtation of that Rebellion, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to an Engliſh Earl, of unqueſtionable Honour and
Integrity, yet living, who expoſtulated with His Majeſty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that point, <hi>anno</hi> 1642. and to whom the King denyed his
knowledge of it with Aſſeverations and Abhorrence, and
vowed, <hi>That if his Son had a hand in it, He would cut off his Head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, that I will not enlarge upon theſe Matters, becauſe
this one Conſideration muſt convince all Mankind of the
King's Innocence in this Affair, and that is, <hi>That an Iriſh
Rebellion was the moſt unlucky and fatal thing that could
happen to His Majeſty at that juncture,</hi> it broke all his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and was ſo evidently againſt his Intereſt, that no body
can ſuſpect him to contrive it, that does not at the ſame time
think he was <hi>mad,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☞</note> for if <hi>Ireland</hi> had ſtood quiet, His Majeſty
might have drawn vaſt aſſiſtance of Men, and ſomething of
Treaſure, from that Kingdom, either againſt the Parliament,
or againſt the Scots, as he had occaſion; whereas by that
Rebellion, all his Friends in <hi>Ireland</hi> were otherwiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
and became rather a burden than an help to him.
In a word, the very ſame Reaſons that moved His Majeſty
afterwards to the Ceſſation and the Peaces, were as ſtrong,
and would have been as prevalent with him, to prevent the
Rebellion, if he had had the leaſt notice or ſuſpicion of it;
and accordingly we find, that what little jealouſie he had of
it, was ſeaſonably imparted to the Lords Juſtices, by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mentioned, <hi>Page</hi> 65. as his ſurprize at that unexpected
Rebellion is expreſſed in his Letter to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<hi>Appendix</hi> 49.</p>
                  <p>The next thing in Diſpute,<note place="margin">The Sixth Queſtion.</note> is, <hi>The Number of thoſe that
were Maſſacred,</hi> which Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> computes not to
exceed 37000: Not the twentieth part of what is reported,
ſays the Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven;</hi> not exceeding ſome hundreds,
ſays <hi>P. W.</hi> not above 400, ſays the Author of the <hi>Settlement</hi>
and <hi>Sale</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> not above 4000, ſays <hi>R. S.</hi> in his Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Murders.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That by Depoſitions upon Oath it does
appear, that many thouſands of Britiſh were murdered, and
many more came to untimely Deaths by the Cruelty of the
Iriſh; and this is an undeniable way of Arguing, That all the
Britiſh that did not eſcape, did periſh by that Rebellion; and
though the Difficulty ſtill remains to aſcertain the number of
thoſe that eſcaped, yet it is certain, they could not be half of
what were in the Kingdom, becauſe the Towns that were left
for their Refuge, were not capable to Receive or Entertain ſo
<pb facs="tcp:65997:280"/>
great a number; and even thoſe that did eſcape to Towns did
periſh in heaps, by reaſon of the ill uſage they had received
from the Iriſh.</p>
                  <p>And indeed Sir <hi>W. Petty</hi> does allow this method of Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
but his miſtake is occaſioned by leaving out an <hi>Item</hi>
that I conceive ſhould have been added, and that is, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and tranſported thither out of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> during the interval between 1641. and
1652. for his Compution runs thus:

                  <p>But he ſhould have added, That in thoſe ten Years, from
1641. to 1652. there were born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there came
thither out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in all about 300000
Souls; and he ſhould have added a proportion of that number
to the other, and then he had been near the Computation,
which other Judicious Men have made in that matter.</p>
                  <p>But others, well knowing that the greateſt part of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
that were in <hi>Ireland</hi> did really periſh in the firſt year of that
Rebellion, do deny that there was any ſuch Number there as
is pretended to have been Maſſacred; and one of them is ſo
vain to ſay, That the Iriſh were a hundred to one: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
conſiders, that the Britiſh Plantations in <hi>Munſter</hi> had
been ſetled forty years before, and that of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> almoſt thirty
years; that half the Kingdom was the Propriety of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;
that there were no leſs than 100000 Scots, as the Earl
of <hi>Strafford</hi> affirmed upon his Tryal; that the Earl of <hi>Cork</hi>
alone had above 10000 Proteſtant Souls upon his Eſtate;
that all the Officers of State, War and Juſtice, and moſt of
the Mechanicks, were Britiſh, will find no Grounds for
that Objection.</p>
                  <p>However, I will not pretend to determine the Number, but
this I will ſay, That it was great enough to draw the Curſe
of God, and the Revenge of Man, upon the infamous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of that Maſſacre, as it afterwards did.</p>

                  <p>But this is <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> and without Foundation, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not only by the Commiſſions and Arms given to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Lords of the <hi>Pale,</hi> which they perfidiouſly abuſed to the
prejudice of the <hi>State;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Temple 33.</note> and by the Lords Juſtices deſign to
Arm all thoſe of the <hi>Pale</hi> if need were, but alſo, by the very
inſtance of the Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven;</hi> for tho' the Lords of the
<hi>Pale</hi> went into Rebellion the Second of <hi>December,</hi> yet he lived
quietly at his Houſe at <hi>Madingſton</hi> many Months afterwards,
as himſelf Confeſſes; and 'tis certainly true, that even he and
the Marquiſs of <hi>Antrim</hi> (who was at his houſe) came down
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army near <hi>Killcullen,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> after to viſit the
Earl of <hi>O rmond,</hi> and was kindly received by him, and ſome
few days afterwards being Victorious at the Battel of <hi>Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſh;
Caſtlehaven</hi> treated him at <hi>Madingſton,</hi> and mutual Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
paſſed between them. And about the ſame time he
had ſuch Correſpondence with the <hi>State,</hi> that he took upon
him, to intercede for the Lords of <hi>Gormanſtown, Slane</hi> and
others; ſo that he might have been ſafe enough if he pleaſed,
and was not under any neceſſity to go out into Rebellion, as
he afterwards did.</p>
                  <p>And tho' I believe, that this Lord was not in the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy;
yet it will appear by what has been ſaid in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the former Objection, that moſt of the other Lords of
the <hi>Pale</hi> were, nor indeed could the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have undertaken
the Rebellion without them, for they were not able to carry
on the War by themſelves,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P. W.</hi> Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, 595.</note> without the Aſſiſtance of the Old
<hi>Engliſh;</hi> for as <hi>Peter Welſh</hi> very well obſerves. <hi>It is well known,
that the</hi> Iriſh <hi>never ſignified any thing conſiderable in any of
their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakings, and had been preſently cruſhed in this, if
the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Colonies had not joyned with and ſupported them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whoever frames an Idea of thoſe times in his own
thoughts, and reads the paſſionate Letters of the <hi>State</hi> for
Succours, cannot conceive any thing ſo ridiculous; as that
the Lords Juſtices delighted in thoſe ſad Spectacles of miſery
which daily flocked to <hi>Dublin,</hi> or in the report of the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Inhumanities every day committed on their Friends
<pb facs="tcp:65997:282"/>
and Country men; but above all the continual Danger they
were in themſelves, and their diſadvantage and loſs by the
Rebellion, do ſufficiently vindicate them, from endeavouring
to make this Rebellion more general and formidable than
really it was.</p>
                  <p>But what did the Lords Juſtices get by this Rebellion, or
did they Act or ſend any diſpatch without the Council, or did
they not importune Aid from <hi>England,</hi> even to the degree of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
troubleſome; or did they not ask enough to make a ſpeedy
end of the War, or had they a Free-hold in their Places or an
unconroulable Power while they held them, or what ſolid
Foundation is there, for all the Clamour that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have
made in this Caſe againſt the Lords Juſtces.<note place="margin">The Ninth Queſtion.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ninth Queſtion will be, whether King <hi>Charles</hi> II.
upon his Reſtoration, ſtood obliged by the Articles of the
Peace, made <hi>Anno</hi> 1646. or the other Peace made <hi>Anno</hi> 1648.
becauſe the Lords <hi>Muskery, Taaf</hi> and others did not faulter
in their Allegiance from that time forward, and therefore
could not forfeit the benefit of thoſe Articles.</p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer, That the Peace of 1646 cannot come
in Diſpute, not only becauſe the Congregation of the Popiſh
Clergy at <hi>Waterford,</hi> did publickly declare againſt it, and
<hi>Limerick, Waterford</hi> and <hi>Clonmel,</hi> &amp;c. never received it, and
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Armies perfidiouſly broke it, by indeavouring trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly
to intercept the Lord Lieutenant near <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and
afterwards actually beſieging him in <hi>Dublin;</hi> but alſo, becauſe
the general <hi>Aſſembly</hi> the proper Repreſentative of their Party
and Nation, did publickly diſown and reject that Peace by their
Declaration recited, <hi>Appendix</hi> 36.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Peace of 1648. it was made with a <hi>Society,</hi> or
a Confederate Body, and not with particular Perſons; and if
that Society hath no Right to the benefits of that Peace, it is
certain, that no particular Perſon can have any, becauſe his
Claim and Title to it is, as he is a Member of that Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
and his Caſe is the ſame, with that of an innocent Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in a Corporation, whoſe Charter is forfeited.</p>
                  <p>However, this Body Politick or Imaginary, is compoſed of
particular Men, and may forfeit its whole Right by the
fault of ſome of its Members, for <hi>malum ex quocunque defectu;</hi>
but if the greater part be Guilty, there can be no ground for
a doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>This being Premiſed, it appears by the 29th Article, <hi>That
the Confedrates and their Gariſons, Towns and Forts were to be
Commanded, Ruled and Governed in chief upon occaſion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
as to Martial and Military Affairs, by ſuch as the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
ſhould appoint:</hi> But this Clauſe of that Article of the
Peace was entirely violated by the Towns of <hi>Wexford, Roſs,
Waterford, Clonmel, Limerick</hi> and <hi>Galway,</hi> even to the degree of
<pb facs="tcp:65997:282"/>
depriving his Majeſty of all the benefits and advantages he
expected from this Peace, and at length to the loſs of the
whole Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe Towns were to be reſtored to his Majeſty,
whenever the Articles of the Peace were performed on his
Part; but the Confederates by their own Fault, and their
own Act, gave them up (eſpecially <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Galway</hi>) to
the Kings Enemies. Theſe were the Jewels his Majeſty
bought ſo very dear, and yet the Confederates are ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to expect the <hi>Price,</hi> without delivering the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
for.</p>
                  <p>And if they Reply, That thoſe Towns were forced from them,
and without their fault; yet that (if true, as it is not) would
not Entitle them to the benefits of the Peace: For if a Man
ſell Land, and it be evicted from him before he delivers Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
no Body will ſay he has Right to have the Purchaſe-Money
from the Buyer, and yet that is a parallel Caſe: Nor
have the Confederates the leaſt Spark of Equity on their ſide,
becauſe they might have ſurrendred the Towns to their King,
and ought to have done ſo, but they neither did that, nor
ſubmitted to his Authority as far as they had promiſed, and
therefore ſince they did take upon them to keep theſe Towns,
it is certainly at their Peril if they loſe them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They did diſſolve and renounce this Peace, and the
Kings Authority, (which is the firſt and chiefeſt Article, tho'
placed by way of Introduction) for the Congregation at <hi>James-town</hi>
Excommunicated the Lord Lieutenant, and Declared
againſt his Authority, and they and the Aſſembly at <hi>Loghreah</hi>
forced him out of the Kingdom; <hi>Galway</hi> treated with the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and received his Ambaſſadour, and that
Town and <hi>Limerick,</hi> and ſeveral Lords and Gentlemen, did
joyn in a Commiſſion to treat with foreign Princes, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<hi>Appendix</hi> 47. All the Kingdom did at length ſubmit to
the Kings Enemies, and moſt of the Confederates took the
<hi>Engagement</hi> to that Government; which certainly diſſolv'd
the Articles of Peace, and all Covenants with his Majeſty,
with which that <hi>Engagement</hi> was inconſiſtent.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not inſiſt upon it, that the Peace was null and void
from the beginning, and impoſſible to be performed, becauſe
the King could not repeal Acts of Parliament, much leſs give
away thoſe Eſtates, which were ſold to the Adventurers for
valuable Conſideration by Act of Parliament, but that the
Confederates had by a previous Engagemen there recited <hi>p.</hi> 205.
(which <hi>P. W.</hi> ſtifly denies, and my Lord of <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65997:283"/>
Laſtly, Thoſe Articles were not to be binding, unleſs they
ſhould be confirmed by the next Parliament; and ſince they
miſſed of that Ratification, they are totally vaniſhed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and have no manner of Obligation upon any
Body.</p>
                  <p>Another Queſtion may be made,<note place="margin">The Tenth Queſtion.</note> Whether the Quarrels of
the Confederates againſt the Marquiſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> were
founded upon a prejudice to his Perſon, a hatred to his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

                  <p>To which I Anſwer, That their Diſſatisfaction with that

hatred to him was, partly upon the Account of his Religion,

                  <p>And Laſtly, It may be demanded, Whether all and every of

                  <p>To which I Anſwer, That they are not all Guilty, but, on

                     <hi>CHARLES</hi> Lord <hi>MOUNTJOY</hi> continued Lord Deputy,<note place="margin">1603.</note> and
was afterwards made Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom, and having
received Letters from the Council of <hi>England,</hi> with a Proclamation of
the new King, he firſt Signed the Proclamation, and all the Council did
the like in Order, and then with great Solemnity they publiſhed and
proclaimed the ſame in <hi>Dublin</hi> on the Fifth of <hi>April;</hi> and about the
ſame time he received kind and gracious Letters from the King (then
in <hi>Scotland</hi>) by one Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> whom therefore the Lord Deputy
Knighted.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> (who was brought to <hi>Dublin</hi> in Company with
the Lord Deputy on the <hi>4th.</hi> day of <hi>April</hi>) could not refrain from Tears
on the News of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Death; nor can we blame him for
it, for beſides the unſecurity of the Pardon or Protection he relyed
on, being derived from a Princeſs that was Dead, and an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that was determined before it was executed: He had alſo
loſt the beſt opportunity in the World, either of continuing the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65997:285"/>
War with advantage, or of making a profitable and meritorious
Submiſſion to the new King, nor did he want Pretences and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
that would have made his free Submiſſion highly valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and exceeding honourable; however, ſince he had miſſed the
Seaſon of doing better, he thought it prudent to do the beſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that his Circumſtances would permit, and to ſecure the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

<hi>James</hi> his Name, but ſoon after gave him Liberty to return to <hi>Ulſter</hi>
to ſettle his Concerns; but firſt, the Earl put in his Hoſtages, and
alſo renewed his Submiſſion in a ſet Form of Words, wherein <hi>he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured

nor had any improvements left upon their Eſtates,<note place="margin">Bello peſte &amp; inedia fatigati Analecta Hib. 207.</note> except perhaps
a diſmal Caſtle, and a few pittiful Cabins: One might expect that
this miſerable Condition (which required a long interval of Reſt and

Loyally under this new King of <hi>their own Lineage.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Lord Deputy having ſent Proclamations of the King's Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

this Account from</hi> Cork, <hi>That Captain</hi> Morgan <hi>came thither with

Sarsfeild, <hi>then Mayor, who anſwered,</hi> That by their Charter they
might take time to conſider it. <hi>Sir</hi> George <hi>replied,</hi> That ſince they knew
the King's Right, and that he was proclaimed in <hi>Dublin,</hi> it would be taken
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65997:286"/>
ill if they delayed it. <hi>The Mayor anſwered,</hi> That <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi> was

the Country by their precipitation therein. <hi>Whereupon</hi> Saxy, <hi>Chief-Juſtice
of</hi> Munſter, <hi>ſaid,</hi> That they ought to be committed, if they refuſed: <hi>But</hi>
William Mead, <hi>the Recorder; told him,</hi> That no body there had Authority
to commit them.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Mayor and his Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> went to the Court-houſe
to conſider of ſo important a Matter; Sir <hi>George Thornton</hi>
in the mean time ſtaying in the Walk to expect their Reſolution.
After an hours ſtay there, he ſent to know their Mind; they
put him off for an hour more, and when that was expired, they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told him, <hi>They could not give their Anſwer till the next day.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he ſaid, <hi>He would proclaim the King without them:</hi> But they let
him underſtand, That he had no Authority within their Liberties to
do ſo, <hi>neither would they permit him to do it:</hi> And ſo they put it off
till the Thirteenth of <hi>April;</hi> and then Sir <hi>George Thornton</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Roch,</hi> and about 800 Soldiers and others, proclaimed the King
in the North Suburbs, near <hi>Shandon-Caſtle;</hi> but the Mayor and
Citizens deferr'd it till the Sixteenth, and then wrote a ſawcy Let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
to the Lord Deputy, importing, That they had receiv'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
on the Eleventh of <hi>April,</hi> but had delayed publiſhing it till
the Sixteenth, for the greater Solemnity; and they deſired, that <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowling</hi>
Fort (not being in the Hands of a ſufficient Commander to
ſecure it) might be put into the Hands of the Mayor and Citizens, for
whoſe Defence it was made.</p>
                  <p>But the Citizens not expecting an Anſwer to their minds from the
Lord Deputy, deſigned to ſet up their Religion by force; and to that
end they kept ſtrong Guards on their Ports and Gates, and ſtopt the
King's Boats going with Victuals to <hi>Halbowling;</hi> ſo that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
were forced to relieve that Fort with Ammunition and Victuals
from <hi>Kinſale:</hi> they alſo carried the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Proceſſion about the City,
and forced People to reverence it; they alſo defaced Sentences of
Scripture that were written on the Church-walls, and painted the
places with Pictures; they re-conſecrated the Churches, and went
daily in Proceſſion; they alſo took the Sacrament to ſpend their Lives
in defence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion; they diſarm'd ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
as were in their Power, and rejected the <hi>mixt Moneys,</hi> and
refus'd to ſuffer the King's Proviſions to be taken out of the Store,
until they ſhould be aſſured that the Soldiers ſhould be ſent out of the
Liberties of the City; they alſo endeavoured to get the South Fort
into their Hands, ſo that Sir <hi>George Thornton</hi> was forced to ſhelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in <hi>Shandon</hi> Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>Upon notice of theſe Proceedings, Sir <hi>Charles Willmot</hi> (who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging
<hi>Mac-Morris</hi> in <hi>Ballingary</hi> Caſtle) immediately repair'd to <hi>Cork,</hi>
and finding that no good was to be done by Treaty, he ſent 600
Men over the Ford by <hi>Gillabby</hi> into the South Fort; and thô two of
them were kill'd in their Paſſage by Shot from the Walls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the reſt
got in ſafe, and ſecur'd the Fort: However, the Citizens mounted
ſome Guns, and ſhot at the Biſhop's Palace, and <hi>Shandon</hi> Caſtle, thô
the Lord Preſident <hi>Carew</hi> his Wife was in the one, and the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of <hi>Munſter</hi> in the other. Nevertheleſs, on the 28th. of <hi>April</hi> the
Lord Deputy wrote a kind Letter to the City of <hi>Cork,</hi> and required
them to ſuffer the King's Stores to be iſſued out to the Army; but they
excus'd themſelves, and anſwered, That they did not know but thoſe
Stores, if delivered out, might be made uſe of againſt the Town.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65997:286"/>
Whereupon the Lord Deputy wrote a ſmart Letter to them on the Firſt
day of <hi>May:</hi> but before it came to their Hands, the Citizens under
the Conduct of <hi>Chriſtopher Murrough</hi> had removed the King's Stores
into their own Cellars;<note place="margin">Moriſon, 291.</note> and being taught, (by a Seditious Prieſt)
<hi>That he could not be a Lawful King, who was not approved by the Pope,
nor ſworn to maintain the Catholick Religion,</hi> they took a Reſolution in
Publick Council, to excite the other Cities and Towns to Confederate
with them, for the Preſervation of the Catholick Faith, and reſolved
to defend themſelves by Force.</p>
                  <p>It hapned, that ſome few were ſlain on either Side; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a Miniſter was kill'd by a Shot from the Town; and one of the
Biſhop's Servants was wounded, and taken Priſoner, and was told by
them, <hi>That the Traytor his Maſter ſhould not eſcape Death, if they could
get him within their Power.</hi> But their Inſolence will beſt appear by their
own Letter to the Lord Deputy, the Subſtance of which is to be found
here, <hi>Appendix</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Commiſſioners of <hi>Munſter,</hi> finding that they
wanted Artillery, ſent for ſome to <hi>Halbowling;</hi> but the Citizens ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

thereupon the Citizens (being frightned with the noiſe of the Great
Guns) agreed to a Ceſſation until the Lord Deputy ſhould come.</p>
                  <p>But the City of <hi>Cork</hi> was not the only Place that was Rebellious at

an Opportunity of doing ſo much Miſchief: However, they did their
Share; and firſt, they pulled down Sir <hi>Nicholas Welſh</hi> their Recorder
from the Croſs, where he was reading the Proclamation of the King's
Succeſſion: They alſo broke the Doors of the Hoſpital, and admitted
Dr. <hi>White</hi> to preach a Seditious Sermon in St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
amongſt other inveterate things, he ſaid, <hi>That Jezebel</hi> (meaning
Queen <hi>Elizabeth) was dead.</hi> They alſo took the Keys of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
from the Sexton, and cauſed a Prieſt to celebrate Maſs there.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the Towns of <hi>Clonmell</hi> and <hi>Wexford</hi> free from the like
Inſolencies; but they being the weaker, and the leſs populous Places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were ſooner ſenſible of their Faults than were other Towns where
Tumult and Noiſe gave leſs opportunity of Thinking, and Number
and Fortification encourag'd to Obſtinacy; and therefore theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
reſtored the Churches, and ſubmitted to the Lord Deputy's
Commands, before the Army approached their Walls; whilſt, on the
contrary, <hi>Limerick,</hi> which has ſeldom been backward in an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
was one of the forwardeſt in this, and gave their Prieſts the
Poſſeſſion of all their Churches, where they erected Altars, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
celebrated Maſs.</p>
                  <p>This City is ſeated in an Iſland ſurrounded with the River <hi>Shenin,</hi>
and joyned to the Continent by two ſtately Bridges of Stone: it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with good Walls and a ſtrong Caſtle, and is juſtly eſteem'd the
moſt Impregnable Town in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and certainly its Strength and
Reputation has often prov'd a <hi>Snare</hi> to the Inhabitants, and prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to ſuch Acts of Diſloyalty as otherwiſe they would not have

a Siege, becauſe all its Accomplices had firſt done ſo, yet in the
ſucceeding Rebellion it not only defied all His Majeſty's Forces, abus'd
His Herald, and affronted His Lord Lieutenant, but at laſt put the
whole Power of <hi>England</hi> to the Neceſſity of making a Second Tedious
and Bloody Siege before they could reduce it; which I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65997:287"/>
in this place, becauſe I would loſe no Opportunity to put the

only by a People faithful to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: The Religious at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> were not leſs precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and inſolent than their Brethren elſewhere. <hi>Edmond Raughter,</hi> a
<hi>Dominican,</hi> headed the Sedition in that City, and broke open the
<hi>Black-Friers,</hi> which had for ſome time been uſed as a Court-houſe, and
pulled down the Seats, and erected an Altar; and forced the Keys
of his Houſe from one Mr. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that lived in part of that Abby,
and gave Poſſeſſion of the whole Abby to the Friers, altho' by Act of
Parliament it was turned to a Lay-Fee, and by Legal Conveyances
became the Propriety of other Men.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Rebellious Proceedings in ſo many principal Cities and
Towns, neceſſitated the Lord Deputy to undertake a Progreſs to <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi>
and on the Fifth of <hi>May</hi> he came to <hi>Gracedea</hi> near <hi>Waterford,</hi> and
ſummon'd the Mayor and his Brethren to open their Gates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

purpoſe, by vertue of an Ancient Charter from King <hi>John;</hi> yet when
the Lord Deputy had told them, <hi>That no King could give that Privilege
to his Subjects, whereby his Succeſſors ſhould be prejudiced in the due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
they were to expect from them; and that if they did not open their
Gates immediately, but put him to the Neceſſity of entring by Force, he would
cut King</hi> John'<hi>s Charter with King</hi> James'<hi>s Sword, and ruin their City,
and ſtrew it with Salt;</hi> they tamely opened their Gates, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their former boaſting, and the Lord Deputy and the Army march'd
into the City.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt he was in his Camp at <hi>Gracedea,</hi> the Mayor at his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
Requeſt ſent out Doctor <hi>White,</hi> and a young pert <hi>Dominican</hi>
Frier, to diſcourſe with his Lordſhip in Matters of Religion, and to
ſhew him the Grounds and Reaſons of theſe Proceedings, which his
Lordſhip thought ſo temerarious and unaccountable: And the Friers
had the confidence to come in their Habits, with the Crucifix ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
before them,<note place="margin">Sullivan 199.</note> and to tell the Deputy, <hi>That the Citizens of</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford
<hi>could not in Conſcience obey any Prince that perſecuted the Catholick
Faith.</hi> This led them into Diſcourſe, wherein at length Doctor <hi>White</hi>
cited a Paſſage in St. <hi>Austin</hi> for the Proof of ſomething he aſſerted,
and it hapning that the Lord Deputy had the Book in his Tent, he
caus'd it to be ſent for, and publickly ſhew'd to all the Company,
that the Words cited by the Doctor were not St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Opinion,
but were quoted by him as an Objection, which in the ſame place he
oppoſes and confutes; and inferr'd, That it was highly diſingenuous
in the Doctor to quote that Sentence as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Judgment, when
he knew that his Opinion was directly contrary to it. Whereupon
the Doctor was confounded, the Citizens were aſhamed, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
ended.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Lord Deputy, to prevent farther Miſchief
at <hi>Cork,</hi> and to humble them with the certain notice of his Approach,

not exceeding One and twenty, was (by Aſſurances from the Earls of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>

the War; his main Deſign was upon <hi>Derry,</hi> which he ſurprized and

Books (as he call'd them) refuſing to let them be redeem'd for an

                  <p>But for the better underſtanding of this matter, it is neceſſary to
inform the Reader, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> finding it convenient to
plant a Gariſon at <hi>Loghfoyle,</hi> made ſeveral Attempts to that purpoſe,
but they all miſcarried until Sir <hi>Henry Dockwra</hi> Landed at <hi>Kilmore</hi>
or <hi>Culmore,</hi> and erected a ſmall Caſtle there; and a Month after he took
<hi>Derry</hi> without Reſiſtance, and built two Forts and a good Houſe there;
but afterwards, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1617. that place was built by the <hi>Londoners,</hi>
and became a fair and ſtrong City, well known by the Name of
<hi>London-Derry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Sir <hi>Henry Dockwra</hi> alſo built the Caſtles of <hi>Dunalong</hi> and <hi>Lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and afterwards aſſigned the Government of <hi>Derry</hi> to Sir <hi>George
Pawlett</hi> a <hi>Hampſhire</hi> Gentleman, and the Command of <hi>Culmore,</hi> to
Captain <hi>Hart</hi> a Man of great Courage.</p>
                  <p>After Sir <hi>John O Dogharty's</hi> Death, his Son <hi>Cahir</hi> ſhewing great Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and being a Youth of great hopes, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Graced with Knighthood, and made a Juſtice of Peace and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
in moſt of the Commiſſions that came to that Countrey,
but was alſo treated with all due Reſpect upon all occaſions, and he
on the otherſide contracted an intimate Friendſhip with the Chief of
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and particularly with Captain <hi>Hart</hi> Governour of <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
to whoſe Son he was Godfather, and to whom he had Sold
Three thouſand Acres of Land for ready Money.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Sir <hi>Cahir</hi> invited Captain <hi>Hart</hi> to Dinner, and he came
accordingly with his Wife and the little Child (Sir <hi>Cahir's</hi> Godchild)
and were liberally treated; but after Dinner Captain <hi>Hart</hi> was called
aſide, and plainly told by <hi>O Dogharty;</hi> that he had received Affronts
from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and eſpecially from Sir <hi>George Pawlett</hi> (who they
ſay gave him a Box on the Ear) and was reſolved to be revenged,
and in order to it, he muſt have <hi>Culmore;</hi> which if the Captain would
quietly ſurrender, he ſhould receive no harm, but if not, then the
Lives of himſelf, Wife and Child ſhould pay for his Obſtinacy; and
thereupon ſeveral armed Men ruſhed into the Room, and kept a ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
to make thoſe Threats the more terrible; nevertheleſs Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Hart's</hi> Courage was Proof againſt them all, and thereupon Sir
<hi>Cahir</hi> ordered the armed Men to execute him.</p>
                  <p>But in the Nick of time in came both their Wives; and <hi>Hart</hi>'s Wife
immediately fell into a Swoon at this diſmal Spectacle: Whereupon
the Lady <hi>Dogharty</hi> was exceedingly troubled, and diſſwaded her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
from this violent Courſe.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, Sir <hi>Cahir</hi> ſent his own Lady and Captain <hi>Hart</hi> into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Room, and only kept <hi>Harts</hi> Wife and ſome few Soldiers with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65997:291"/>
him, and as ſoon as ſhe came to her Self, he told her, that unleſs
ſhe would go along with his Soldiers, and get them a Peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into <hi>Culmore,</hi> her Self, her Husband and Child ſhould be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
at which ſhe was ſo terrified, that ſhe ſubmitted to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking;
and went with the Rebels to the Caſtle that Night, and told
the Centry a formal Story, that her Husband had broke his Leg:
Whereupon ſhe was without ſcruple admitted in by the Soldiers
that knew her Voice; but the fatal Conſequence of this Folly was
the Murder of all the Gariſon (not excepting her own Brother,
who had come thither to ſee her) and the Plunder of all they had;
ſo that ſhe was utterly undone, altho' her Life and her Husbands was
ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Moreover being fledged with this Succeſs, the Rebels about two a
Clock in the Morning attempted the Fort and Town of <hi>Derry</hi> ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly
that they took them with little or no Reſiſtance,<note place="margin">May 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1608.</note> and they
Murdered the Gariſon and the Governour Sir <hi>George Pawlett,</hi> and
plundered the Town and burnt it to Aſhes; they alſo took the Biſhop
of <hi>Derry</hi>'s Wife and Children, whom they kept Priſoners, and then
proceeded to beſiege the Caſtle of <hi>Lifford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Undoubtedly the Government well enough underſtood, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
was deſigned to be the moſt general that had ever been in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>

Rebellion in the bud, if poſſible; and accordingly Sir <hi>Richard Wingfeild</hi>
was firſt ſent with a Detachement to hold the Rebels in play, and was
followed by the Lord Deputy and the reſt of the Army: Nevertheleſs

this Rebellion with his Life: there were ſome of the Rebels taken and
executed, who, Mr. <hi>Sullivan</hi> ſays, died Martyrs for denying the King's
Supremacy, and yet, he confeſſes, they were concern'd in this Rebellion:

                  </p>
                  <p>The King was highly provoked at this Ingratitude of the Rebels,
whom he had formerly pardoned and reſtored, and therefore cauſed ſuch
of them, as were alive, to be Outlawed, and both them and the reſt to be
afterwards attainted by Parliament; whereby part of the Counties of

                  <p>There hath been given already a ſhort hint of the Commiſſion of
Grace, or, rather, the Commiſſion for Remedy of defective Titles,
and it ſeems there were ſeveral Commiſſions that had a Tendency that
way, <hi>viz. To eſtabliſh and ſecure the Subjects in the quiet Poſſeſſion of the
Eſtates they enjoy'd;</hi> for on the 4th of <hi>June</hi> 1606, the King, by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents dated at <hi>Hatfeild,</hi> did authorize and impower the Lord-Deputy,
and other Commiſſioners, to Bargain, Sell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> forfeited, or otherwiſe belonging to the Crown, to
any Perſon in Fee-Simple, and diſcharged of all mean Profits. And on
the 15th of <hi>July</hi> following, a Proclamation was publiſhed to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
That if any Perſon, deriving Title ſince 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. ſhall, before
the 25th of <hi>July</hi> 1607, petition the Commiſſioners for a new Patent,
he ſhall have one on an eaſie Fine, and without diſcovery of his Title.
And that whereas a former Commiſſion of the 19th of <hi>July</hi> 1605, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
them to take Surrenders of thoſe that held by Taniſtry, and
had no Title but Poſſeſſion; if any ſuch will make their Surrenders at
any time before the ſaid 25th of <hi>July</hi> 1607, they ſhall have new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
granted to them immediately after ſuch Surrender. And now, by
another Proclamation of the 19th of <hi>June</hi> 1609,<note place="margin">1609.</note> the Period of time
was enlarged, and the Subjects were aſſured, that their Surrenders ſhould
be accepted, and Regrants ſhould be made to them notwithſtanding
any Meſne Signiory, ſaving the Rents and Services to the Meſne Lords
as formerly, and reſerving the eſtabliſhed Compoſition and Rent to the
King.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Cities and Towns of <hi>Dublin,</hi>

had ſubmitted to the King's Pleaſure, as to the Cuſtoms and Poundage,
his Majeſty did, by Letters of the 3d of <hi>March</hi> 1608, order the Lord-Deputy

Privileges: And about the ſame time the City of <hi>Waterford</hi> petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

finding Quarters for 100 Soldiers, whereas they ought not to find
Quarters for more than 50.</p>
                  <p>There were a great many Projects in <hi>England</hi> for the Plantation

                     <note place="margin">1610.</note> but many things that ſeem'd ſpeclous in the Theory, were

Notion was ſignified by his Letter to the King, and is to be

                        </gap>ſcitatio, pag.</hi> 255. but it is not ſo exact as reſt of
that Great Man's Works: However, the Lands deſigned for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
were this Year diſpoſed to them, and two Books of Articles
were printed for their better direction; and it was particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in their Agreements, <hi>That they ſhould not ſuffer any Labourer
that would not take the Oath of Supremacy, to dwell upon their Lands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the incomparable City of <hi>London</hi> was the Soul and Life of the
intended Plantation; and therefore the Lords of the Council in his
Majeſty's behalf entred into Articles with that City, the Twenty eighth
day of <hi>January,</hi> 1609. to this effect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Twenty thouſand Pounds be levied by the City, Fifteen
thouſand Pounds of it to be expended in the Plantation, and Five

                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65997:292"/>
Secondly, That Two hundred Houſes be built at <hi>Derry,</hi> and room
for Three hundred more, and Four thouſand Acres profitable Land
to be laid thereto; and that the Biſhop and Dean ſhall have conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Plots for their Houſes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That a hundred Houſes be erected in <hi>Colerain,</hi> and room
for Two hundred more, and Three thouſand Acres to be annexed
thereto, and the King to maintain a Bridge for ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the whole County of <hi>Colerain</hi> be cleared by the
City from all Claims, except three or Four <hi>Iriſh</hi> Free-holders, and the
Biſhop and Dean of <hi>Derry;</hi> and the City to have the whole Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Glancanken</hi> and <hi>Killetragh,</hi> and the Patronage of Churches.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That the aforeſaid Four thouſand and three thouſand Acres
pay a Fee-farm Rent of Fifty three Shillings and four Pence, and be
held in Free Burgage, and all the reſt in Common Socage.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That the City ſhall have all Cuſtoms, Tonnage, Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Ninety nine Years, at Six ſhillings eight pence <hi>per Ann.</hi>
and the Fiſhing of the <hi>Ban</hi> and <hi>Laghfoyl</hi> as far as it ebbs.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The City to have liberty to tranſport Prohibited Goods
growing on their own Lands, and the Office of Admiralty in the
Counties of <hi>Tyrconell</hi> and <hi>Colerain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, That no Flax, Hemp, Yarn, or Raw Hides, be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>Derry</hi> or <hi>Colerain,</hi> without Licence of the City-Officers.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, That their Land be freed from all Patents of Privilege,
and all Compoſitions and Taxes.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, That they have the Caſtle of <hi>Culmore,</hi> keeping a Ward
in it.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, That the Liberties of each Town ſhall extend three
Miles each way, and ſhall have ſuch farther Liberties as ſhall be thought
fit on view of the Charters of <hi>London, Cinque-Ports, Newcaſtle,</hi> and
<hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the King ſhall keep neceſſary Forces a convenient time,
and that the City ſhall have Seven years to make demand of any
thing reaſonable and neceſſary, which cannot be now foreſeen; and
that an Act of Parliament ſhall paſs to ratifie theſe Articles, and the
City to build ſixty Houſes in <hi>Derry,</hi> and forty in <hi>Colerain,</hi> with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fortifications, by <hi>November</hi> next, and to finiſh all by <hi>November,</hi>

finding that they could not poſſibly accompliſh their Undertaking
within the appointed time, petitioned the King that they might be

the Army, which they reduc'd to 176 Horſe, 1450 Foot, and

Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> and four Friars to have been apprehended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
There were alſo Orders iſſued to tender the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

to diſplace thoſe that would not take it.</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>Auguſt</hi> there was an Inquiſition by Jury to diſcover the
Breaches of Articles made by the Planters and Undertakers in <hi>Munſter,</hi>

were permitted to inhabit or dwell on the Lands granted to the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers?</hi>
Moreover there was a general Muſter of the Signiory-men, or

it was neceſſary to countenance and protect it with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Militia in that Province; to ſupport the Charge of which, the
King,<note place="margin">1611.</note> on the <hi>22th.</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> inſtituted the Order of <hi>Baronets,</hi>
which was to be Hereditary, and not to exceed the number of Two
hundred; and every of them, upon paſſing the Patent, was to pay
into the Exchequer as much Money as would maintain Thirty Men in

                  <p>But there had not been a Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> for Seven and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years paſt, ſince the Twenty ſeventh Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
Reign; ſo that it was high time to call one now; and the Miniſters
of State were at work to manage that Matter to the advantage of his
Majeſty, and the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> in that Kingdom, which
they foreſaw would be oppos'd with might and main by all thoſe of
the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party; and therefore they propos'd that an Order ſhould
iſſue for every Parliament-man to take the Oath of Supremacy, and
that the Lords ſhould declare their Suffrages openly, Content or Not
content, as in <hi>England,</hi> and not riſe and whiſper in the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's
Ear, as was the Cuſtom in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that the King ſhould
find ſome Pretence to ſend for ſome few of thoſe Noblemen that
would moſt briskly oppoſe his Intentions, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth had
formerly done; and particularly, that the Lord <hi>Courcy</hi> might not be
ſuffered to ſit in the Houſe, becauſe his Anceſtors were called by Writ,
and ſo his Honour being in Fee-ſimple, did deſcend to Daughters, who
were Heirs-general of his Family; and that the Lord <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>'s
Titles of Honour in <hi>Ireland</hi> were not<note n="*" place="margin">Contra <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd,</hi> 4. Inſt. cap. Ireland.</note> forfeited by the Act of Abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,
and therefore he might have a Voice in that Parliament, or make
his Proxy; and that for the Credit of the Buſineſs, the Lord Deputy
might be Ennobled before the Parliament ſat. But ſome of theſe were
not practicable, and the reſt not thought fit to be done at that time.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt not forget to take notice of a neceſſary Office in thoſe
days, tho now it be obſolete, <hi>viz. the Interpreter to the State,</hi> which was
enjoy'd by <hi>Thomas Cahill,</hi> with an Annual Sallary of 26 <hi>l. 6 s. 8 d.</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>September</hi> the Lord Deputy publiſhed a Proclamation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Parliament, and thereby invited the Subjects to exhibit their
Grievances, and to conſider of Propoſals for the Publick Good, to be

the Guard was but 100 Men, as was uſual and Cuſtomary; and that
it was impoſſible to blow up the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> alſo,

he ſays was obſervable for the</hi> Cruelty <hi>of the</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>and the</hi> Civil
reſiſtance <hi>of the</hi> Catholicks: <hi>And firſt he tells you,</hi> That when the Senate
meddles with Religion, it becomes a wicked Conventicle rather then a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
that the Old <hi>Iriſh</hi> Grandees, had Hereditary Voices in Parliament
<hi>long before the Engliſh Conqueſt,</hi> but are now denied them, unleſs they
have <hi>Engliſh</hi> Titles, which alone makes the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi>
void, ſince the principal Members are excluded: The Catholick Biſhops are
ſerv'd in the ſame manner, and <hi>the Heretical Uſurpers of their Sees and
Titles,</hi> vote in Parliament in their ſtead.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> thought the Advancement of thoſe Laws, which they
had made againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to be the readieſt way of ſuppreſſing
the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> if they could get them Enacted here;
but knowing the <hi>Catholicks</hi> would be moſt numerous in Parliament, they
us'd all imaginable Artifices of force and fraud, to get <hi>Proteſtants</hi> unduly
return'd, they Elected their new Colonies into <hi>Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Counties,</hi> to
encreaſe the number of Heretical Parliament men; they made ſmall Villages
into Corporations, and made Porters, Barbers and Strangers Burgeſſes for
thoſe Corporations, and cauſed four Miniſters to repreſent the Clergy of every
Dioceſs; nevertheleſs many <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentry were choſen, whom the People
(Men Women and Children) deſir'd, to take Care of Religion, aſſuring them,

perhaps any thing ſhould happen contrary to Expectation.</p>
                  <p>The Catholicks were troubled, becauſe they could not find out what was to
to be treated of in Parliament; till at length they got ſight of a Bill to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

Sir <hi>Oliver Saint John</hi> told him, that if he would not come
out, they ſhould be oblig'd to pull him out; and accordingly the
Treaſurer and Marſhal did take <hi>Davis,</hi> and fet him in the Chair on

Treaſurer Maſter of Ordnance and others did gently remove him, and
did place. <hi>Davis</hi> in the Chair, altho Sir <hi>Daniel O Brian,</hi> and Sir <hi>William

the Houſe on their firſt ſitting) and Sir <hi>John Bleverhaſſet,</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant
<hi>Beer</hi> being ſent to them, to deſire their return to the Houſe,

that They were the Houſe, and Sir <hi>John Everard,</hi> their Speaker, and

                  <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> after, the Houſe ſat, to the number of 130, whereof 14
Privy Counſellors; and the Lord-Deputy ſent for Mr. Marſhal and the
Maſter of the Ordnance, and told them, That <hi>William Talbot</hi> had been
with his Lordſhip and receiv'd Commands, that the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Houſe; and that <hi>Talbot</hi> had deſir'd an hours time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
an Anſwer; and that his Lordſhip had given time till Three in
the Afternoon; and therefore deſir'd, that the Commons would ſend
their Sergeant at Arms to ſummon the Recuſants, to be at the Houſe
at that time; but the Houſe refuſed to ſend their Sergeant at Arms,
becauſe the Recuſants had appeal'd to the Deputy: ſo they roſe, and
met again at Three a Clock, but no <hi>Papiſts</hi> came near them, and
therefore they went by themſelves to the Deputy, and preſented their
Speaker; and being ask'd, whether they were the greater number of
the Houſe, and unanimous in the Election: They anſwered in the
Affirmative, ſo their Speaker having made the uſual Speech, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of; and then he made an excellent Diſcourſe about Parliaments
in general, and This in particular, and then the Commons went to
their own Houſe, and adjourned to the next day.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, on the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the Popiſh Lords wrote a
Letter to the King full of Complaints, of the ſtrange and prepoſterous
Proceedings (as they term'd it) about the Speaker; they expreſs'd
their Paſſions with moving Epithits, ſtiling their Sedition <hi>Pins

the new Corporations, and even to intimate ſome Menaces of Rebellion,
and in a manner delineated and diſcrib'd how it would be Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame day, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of the Houſe of Commons did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
write to the Lords of the Council in <hi>England,</hi> about the new Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations;
and the wrong done their Speaker <hi>Everard,</hi> and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated
their Complaints to that degree, as if their Extremities
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65997:296"/>
and Sufferings were ſo ſtrange and ſo intolerable, that they wanted
Words to expreſs or Patience to bear them; and they laid all the
blame on the Principal Officers and Counſellors of State: And on the
twentieth of <hi>May</hi> the ſame Men petition'd the Lord Deputy to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence
with their Attendance in the Houſe of Commons, becauſe they
were afraid of their Lives; and they deſir'd he would ſhew them
by what Authority thoſe ſat in the Houſe that were now in poſſeſſion
of it; and they demanded to have a ſight of the King's Letters, the
Grants and Charters of the New Corporations, and of the Returns
of Elections.</p>
                  <p>And the next day, being the 21th of <hi>May,</hi> they petition'd the
Lord Deputy again, importing, That if they might be ſecure of their
Lives, and have the Benefit of the Law, and that the Returns may be
rectified, that then they would repair to the Houſe and preſent the
Speaker: All which the Lord Deputy granted and promis'd; and
thinking <hi>that they ſincerely meant as they ſpoke,</hi> his Excellency went to
the Upper Houſe, in expectation that they would joyn with the reſt
of the Lower Houſe, and attend him with the Speaker: But in ſtead
of that, on the ſame day they petition'd again, That the new Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
might be firſt excluded, and not admitted into the Houſe, till
their Caſe was debated and determin'd; altho they well enough knew,
that what they propos'd was unpracticable, until, firſt a Speaker was
ſetled. But their Buſineſs was to baffle and avoid this Parliament, if
poſſible; to effect which, they little matter'd what vain Pretences
they made uſe of: And therefore tho the Lords had nothing to do
with the Lower Houſe, yet to make a Clamour, as if they had been
wonderfully abus'd they alſo petition'd the Lord Deputy the ſame
21th, of <hi>May,</hi> to the effect aforeſaid; and in their Petition aſſerted,
That the Lord Deputy's Commiſſion did not authorize him to make
New Corporations; and concluded with a Requeſt to be excuſed from
attending the Parliament, and to have leave to wait on the King in
<hi>England.</hi> The Deputy told them, <hi>That the Affairs of the Lower Houſe
did not concern them,</hi> and therefore commanded them to attend their
own Houſe, and to proceed in a Parliamentary way to the Buſineſs of
the King and Kingdom: But they perſiſted in their Obſtinacy, and on
the 23th. of <hi>May</hi> they ſent him a Writing in the Form of a Petition;
whereby they poſitively refus'd to come to Parliament, until the King
ſhould take ſome better order to ſettle Matters as to the Lower Houſe;
for tho the Houſes were diſtinct, yet they made but <hi>One Body,</hi>
and were but <hi>One Parliament;</hi> and they proteſted againſt all Laws
that ſhould be made in their abſence, and that if any be made, <hi>the
Subjects will reject them</hi> as diſorderly and unjuſtly enacted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this
was followed with a Petition of the Commons, on the 25th, of <hi>May,</hi>
wherein in a very ſawcy and undutiful manner they preſſed the Lord
Deputy for a ſight of the King's Letters about the New Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and for their Charters and the Returns of all the Elections,
and for a Copy of his Commiſſion to hold that Parliament, and for
Licenſe to ſend Agents to <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint the King with their
Complaints.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the Lord Deputy by Proclamation commanded them
to their reſpective Parliament houſes, to paſs the Act of Recognition
of his Majeſty's Title; aſſuring them, that no other Bill ſhould be
read that Seſſion: And he alſo ſent a Meſſenger to every Lord parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
to Summon him to attend the Houſe: But the Commons were
ſo far from complying, that on the ſame day, <hi>viz.</hi> the 26th of <hi>May.</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65997:296"/>
they preſented him with a Petition Recognizing the King's Title,
but utterly refuſing to ſit in the Houſe, unleſs their Speaker <hi>Everard</hi>
might be approved, and the new Burgeſſes rejected.</p>
                  <p>And the next day the Lords did in like manner by Letter Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
the King's Title, but refus'd to come to their Houſe until the
Affairs of the Lower Houſe were rectified and ſetled.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, both the Popiſh Lords and Commons had ſuch a great
Attendance, and there was ſo great a Concourſe at <hi>Dublin</hi> from all
parts of the Kingdom, (<hi>which probably did wait but for ſome Pretence to
be in Action</hi>) that the Government did not think fit to impriſon any of
the Mutineers, but took a wiſer Courſe, by adjourning the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that ſo his Majeſty's Pleaſure might be farther known.</p>
                  <p>The Recuſants loſt no time, but ſent over Agents to the King,
<hi>and levied a Tax upon the People to bear their Charges,</hi> altho' the Deputy
publiſh'd a Proclamation to prohibit any body to contribute to the
Charge of the Agents, or to levy any Tax for that purpoſe; and
aſſur'd the People, that the Agents went over for their own private
Buſineſs, or Caprichio, and not for the Publick Good. Nevertheleſs,
it appears by the Examination of <hi>John O Drea</hi> and <hi>Donough O Drea,</hi>

                              <p>THeſe Noblemen and Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland</hi> are called hither this day to
hear my Concluſion and Determination in a Cauſe of great conſequence,<note place="margin">Lib. C.</note>
which hath depended long in Trial. Thus far it hath had Formality; for
it is a Formality that Kings hold in all Proceſſes of importance, to proceed
ſlowly, to give large Hearings, and to uſe long Debate, before they give their
Sentence.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="26" facs="tcp:65997:297"/>
Theſe Gentlemen will not deny that I have lent them my own Ear, and
have ſhewed both Patience and a Deſire to underſtand their Cauſe at full:
It reſteth now, that we make a good Concluſion, after ſo long Debate.</p>
                              <p>It is a good Rule to obſerve Three Points in all weighty Buſineſſes; Long
and curious Debate, Grave and mature Reſolution, and Speedy Execution.
The Firſt is already paſt; the Second is to be perform'd this day; and the
Laſt muſt follow as ſoon after as conveniently may be.</p>
                              <p>I promis'd to theſe Noblemen and Gentlemen of the Recuſant Party of
Parliament, Juſtice with Favour; let them ſee whether I have perform'd
my Promiſe: Sure I am, but for performance of that Promiſe, I ſhould not
have given ſuch a patient Hearing, nor made ſuch a curious Search into
the Cauſes of their Complaints; neither ſhould I make ſuch a Concluſion as
I am now like to make of this Buſineſs.</p>
                              <p>In the Search (tho' I doubted not of the Honour and Juſtice of the Lord
Deputy's Government) yet I dealt not with him as with my Servant, not
as with one the moſt unreprovable Governor that ever was in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(as ſome of your ſelves have acknowledg'd him to be to my ſelf) but
as with a Party: But after the Commiſſioners had heard all that could be
alledged, I found him indeed a faithful Servant by their Certificate, which
was <hi>Concluſio in Cauſa.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Gentlemen I ſent were ſuch as no Exception could be taken againſt
them: Some were never there before; ſome, ſo long ſithence, that <hi>rerum
facies fuit mutata,</hi> ſince they lived in that Kingdom.</p>
                              <p>It reſts in me now to ſet down my Concluſion; but before I declare my
Judgment, I will ſpeak of ſome things offered by you the Recuſant Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,
which are called Parliament-Becuſants. I have heard of Church-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants,
but not of Parliament-Recuſants; this Difference was never before
heard of.</p>
                              <p>Firſt, The Letter you ſent unto me in the beginning of the Parliament
was full of Pride and Arrogance, wanting much of the Reſpects which
Subjects owe to their Sovereign.</p>

                              <p>For you made offer, That if you failed to prove any one Point of that

would have the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> like the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                              <p>But commonly Offenders are moſt bold to make Offers of their Innocency;
for they (being in paſſion) begin in heat, and continue in heat; but when
they ſee themſelves in the Glaſs of their own Vanity, they find their Error,
And this I have found in my own Experience in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſince my
coming hither.</p>
                              <p>Now I will divide my Speech into Two Parts; touching the Offences
done by you, and your Complaints againſt the State and Government.</p>
                              <p>To the Firſt, An unuſual Favour was offer'd you by my Deputy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he
ſent for you, and adviſed you to conſider what Laws were fit to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
for that Commonwealth, and offer'd to concur with you. Your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
ſhould have been Humble Thanks on your Knees; but you neglected
that Favour, and anſwered by your Agent in the name of the reſt, <hi>That
you would firſt be made acquainted with ſuch Bills as the Deputy and
Council there had reſolv'd to tranſmit.</hi>
                              </p>

Before the Parliament, there was ſent to me by a few Men a Letter
raſh and inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>lent, That nothing ſhould be purſued in Parliament, but you
ſhould be acquainted with it; and withal <hi>threatning me with Rebellion</hi> in a
ſtrange faſhion, with Similitudes unſavoury and unmannerly, and unfit to be
preſented to any Monarch; and after that, you did nothing but heap Complaint
upon Complaint, till the Parliament was ſat down.</p>
                              <p>The Parliament being ſat, you went on with a greater Contempt: There
were in the Lower Houſe Two Bodies, and but One Head; a greater Monſter
than Two Heads upon One Body. And whereas you ſhould have made an
humble and dutiful Anſwer to the Commendation which I made of a Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
you the Recuſant-party (being the fewer) when the greater Number
went out to be numbred, ſhut the Door, and thruſt one into the Chair as a
Speaker <hi>manu forti.</hi> After this, the Recuſants of both Houſes depart from
the Parliament. The like was never heard of in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> or any
other Kingdom of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Then come Petitions to the Deputy of a Body without a Head, a Headleſs
Body: You would be afraid to meet ſuch a Body in the Streets: A Body
without a Head to ſpeak; nay, half a Body; what a Monſter were this,
a very Bughear! Methinks you that would have a Viſible Body Head of the
Church over all the Earth, and acknowledge a Temporal Head under Chriſt,
ye may likewiſe acknowledge my Viceroy or Deputy of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Then did the Deputy give you warning to come to the Parliament, to paſs
the Bill of Recognition, but that you put it off with <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Shifts,</hi> which
thing I will urge no farther; but why ſhould the Lords refuſe to come, they
had no colour of Abſenting themſelves, having nothing to do with the Orders
or Diſorders of the Lower Houſe, the Lords here, and the Lower Houſe, are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as great Strangers in thoſe Matters, as the Parliament Houſes of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>France;</hi> neither had the Recuſants of the Lower Houſe any juſt Cauſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
ſince <hi>an Indifferent Committee</hi> was offered to them.</p>
                              <p>This was ſuch an ill Example, and ſuch a Crime, to refuſe to appear at the
King's Summons, as if you ſhall adviſe with Lawyers upon it, I know not
what it may import: After this, hither you came, and only your Appeal to me
hath inclined me to Mercy, yet I ſpeak not this to encourage your Complaints
to be brought hither, when the Deputy and State may determine them, though
this being a Matter of Parliament, was fit for the King's Hearing, and your
Appeal, hath been heard and heard <hi>uſ<expan>

                              <p>And whereas it ſhould have wrought Humility and Thanks, the Fruit hath
been, that (I will not ſay in a prepoſterous, but) in a Rebellious manner, you
have heaped Complaints upon Complaints, and Petitions upon Petitions, <hi>not
warranted with any Truth,</hi> to make the more noiſe; whereas you ſhould have
look'd back to your own Miſcarriages.</p>
                              <p>Then I ſent Commiſſioners to examine, as well the By as the main Buſineſs,
which you firſt preſented to be the Cauſe of your Appealing to me, but, in ſtead
of Thanks for that Favour, there came yet more new Complaints, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Council here have already anſwered, I will not ſpeak of. Now, if
you look back to your own Miſcarriage, and my Lenity, you ſhall find; that
your Carriage hath been moſt Undutiful and Unreaſonable, and in the next

                              <p>The Lower Houſe here in <hi>England</hi> doth ſtand upon its Privileges as much
as any Council in Chriſtendom, yet, if ſuch a Difference had riſen there, they
would have gone on with my Service notwithſtanding, and not have broken
up their Aſſembly upon it: You complain of Fourteen falſe Returns, Are there
not many more complained of in this Parliament, yet they do not forſake the

                              <p>

Now, for your Complaints touching Parliament Matters, I find no more
amiſs in that Parliament, than in the beſt Parliament in the World; Eſcapes
and Faults of Sheriffs there may be, yet not them proved; or if it had been
proved, no cauſe to ſtay the Parliament, all might have been ſet right by an
ordinary Courſe of Tryal, to which I muſt refer them. But you complain
of the new Boroughs, therein I would fain feel your Pulſe, for yet I find not
where the Shoe wrings.</p>
                              <p>For, Firſt, you queſtion the Power of the King, Whether he may Lawfully
make them? And then you queſtion the Wiſdom of the King and his Council;
in that you ſay, There are too many made: It was never before heard, that
any good Subject did diſpute the King's Power in this point. What is it to you,
whether I make many or few Boroughs; my Council may conſider the fitneſs,
if I require it; but what if I had made Forty Noblemen, and Four hundred
Boroughs, the more the merrier, the fewer the better Chear.</p>
                              <p>But this Complaint, as you made it, was prepoſterous, for in contending
for a Committee before you agreed of a Speaker, did put the Plough before the
Horſe, ſo as it went on untowardly like your <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ploughs; but becauſe the
Eye of the Maſter maketh the Horſe fat, I have uſed my own Eyes in taking
a view of thoſe Boroughs, and have ſeen a Liſt of them all, God is my Judge
I find the new Boroughs, except one or two, to be as good as the old, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Boroughs new with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Boroughs old; (for I will not ſpeak of the
Boroughs of other Countries;) and yet, beſides the neceſſity of making them,
like to encreaſe and grow better daily; beſides, I find but few erected in each
County, and in many Counties but one Borough only, and thoſe erected in fit
Places near Forts or Paſſages for the Safety of the Country: Methinks you, that
ſeek the good of that Kingdom, ſhould be glad of it.</p>
                              <p>I have cauſed <hi>London</hi> alſo to erect Boroughs there, and when they are
throughly planted, will be a great Security to that part of the Kingdom; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you quarrel with that, which may bring Peace to the Countrey, for the
Perſons return'd out of thoſe Boroughs, you complain they have no Reſidence,
if you had ſaid they had no Intereſt, it had been ſomewhat, but moſt of them
have Intereſt in the Kingdom, <hi>&amp; qui habent intereſſe,</hi> are like to be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as you for the Weal thereof.</p>
                              <p>I ſeek not <hi>Emendicata Suffragia,</hi> ſuch Boroughs as have been made
ſince the Summons are wiped away at one word for this time; I have try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that and done you fair Play, but you that are of a contrary Religion,
muſt not look to be <hi>the only Law-makers;</hi> you that are but <hi>half Subjects,</hi>
ſhould have but <hi>half Privilege;</hi> you that have an Eye to me one way, and
to the Pope another way; the Pope is your Father in <hi>Spiritualibus,</hi> and I
in <hi>Temporalibus</hi> only, and ſo have your <hi>Bodies torn one way, and your
Souls drawn another;</hi> you that ſend your Children to the <hi>Seminaries of
Treaſon;</hi> ſtrive henceforth to become FULL Subjects, that you may have
<hi>Cor unum,</hi> and <hi>vlam unam,</hi> and then I ſhall reſpect you all alike; but your
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts teach you ſuch grounds of Doctrine, <hi>as you cannot follow them
with a ſafe Conſcience, but you muſt caſt off your Loyalty to your
King.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Touching the Grievances whereof you have complain'd; I am loath to ſpend
Breath in them, if you charge the inferiour Miniſters of the Country, all
Countries are ſubject to ſuch Grievances; but if you charge the Deputy and
State <hi>nihil probatur:</hi> Indeed I hear (not from you, but from others,) there
is one thing grievous to the Country; that notwithſtanding the Compoſition
eſtabliſh'd in the Provinces, the Governours there do ſend out their Purveyors,
who take up their Achates, and other Proviſion upon the Country; if this
had been complain'd of to the Deputy, or to me, it had been reformed, the
Deputy himſelf at <hi>Dublin,</hi> doth not grieve the Country with any ſuch
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

                              <p>
                                 <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65997:298"/>
Another thing there is, that grieveth the People, which is that in the
Country, where there is half Peace and half War; the Sheriffs and Soldiers
in their paſſage do commit many Extortions.</p>
                              <p>For theſe Grievances I my ſelf will call the Deputy unto me, and ſet
down ſuch Orders in this time of Vacation, as theſe Abuſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall be redreſſed
and clear taken away; and if any ſuch diſorder he ſufferd hereafter, it ſhall
be only for fault of Complaining; and becauſe the meaner ſort will perhaps
fear to complain, I would have ſuch Gentlemen of the Country, as are of
beſt Credit, to preſent Complaints, which they may do in ſuch manner as
the Parties who prefer the Complaints may not be known.</p>
                              <p>There is a double cauſe, why I ſhould be careful of the welfare of
of that People: Firſt, as King of <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the long Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
the Crown of <hi>England</hi> hath ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap> of that Land; and alſo as King of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> for the ancient <hi>Kings of</hi> Scotland <hi>are deſcended of the Kings
of</hi> Ireland; ſo as I have on Old Title as King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> therefore you ſhall
not doubt to be relieved when you Complain ſo as you will proceed without
Clamour.</p>
                              <p>Moreover my Care hath been that no Acts ſhould be prefer'd that ſhould
be grievous to that People; and to that end I peruſed them all except one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that I ſaw not till of late, that is now out of Door; for I proteſt I have
been more careful for the Bills to be paſt in that Parliament, then in the
Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Laſtly, For Imputations that may ſeem to touch the Deputy, I have found
nothing done by him; but what is fit for an honourable Gentleman to do in his
Place, which he hath diſcharged as well as any Deputy did, and divers of
you have Confeſſed ſo to me; and I find your Complaints againſt him, and
the State, to be but cauſeleſs Expoſtulations.</p>
                              <p>To conclude, my Sentence is, That in the matter of Parliament, you have
carried your ſelves tumultuarily and undutifully; and that your Proceedings
have been rude, diſorderly and inexcuſable, and worthy of ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which by reaſon of your Submiſſion I do forbear, but not remit, till
I ſee your dutiful Carriage in this Parliament; where by your Obedience to
the Deputy and State, and your future good Behaviour, you may redeem your
by-paſt miſcarriage, and then you may deſerve not only Pardon, but Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Cheriſhing.</p>

                  <p>Hereupon they were all diſmiſt, and the Lord Deputy having <hi>O Dogharty</hi>'s Eſtate in <hi>Iniſowen</hi> given to him by the King for his good

ſo on the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1614.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>ARTHUR CHICHESTER,</hi> Lord Deputy to <hi>Ireland;</hi> and held the

and now were the Recuſants at a ſtand for ſome invention

did ariſe, and tho' it was formally determin'd on the <hi>11th.</hi> of

a ſpecial Commiſſion; yet the Lord of <hi>Slane</hi> being egged on by others
of the diſcontented Lords, deſir'd are hearing, which was granted;
and on the <hi>18th.</hi> of the ſame Month, there was a ſecond Debate,
which produced the Confirmation of the former Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>nce, in favour of

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65997:299"/>
he might have his right place; but at length being charged upon his
Allegiante to appear in the Houſe, he did ſubmit tho very unwillingly.</p>
                  <p>The Arguments urg'd by the Baron of <hi>Slane</hi> were. 1. That his
Predeceſſors were from the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, ſtyled Barons of
<hi>Slane.</hi> 2. That in all Records they are named before the Lords of
<hi>Kerry,</hi> and particularly in a Record in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second,
3. That the Lord of <hi>Gormanſtown</hi> had precedence of the Lord of
<hi>Kerry,</hi> at the Parliament 48 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and the Lord of <hi>Slane</hi> took place
of him. 4. The Lords of <hi>Kerry,</hi> from 50 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3, to 1. <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
never ſerved the Crown, nor held any Correſpondence with the
Government; and therefore forfeited their Dignity. 5. That the Lord
of <hi>Kerry</hi> was indicted of Rebellion, 42 <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and pleaded his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
laſt Term; ſo that his Call to the Parliament is <hi>quaſi</hi> a new
Creation.</p>
                  <p>The Lord of <hi>Kerry</hi> anſwered to the firſt, That <hi>Huſſy Fippo</hi> and others
that held <hi>per baroniam</hi> of the Palatines, or Lords of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> were ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Barons of <hi>Galtrim, Skrine</hi> and <hi>Bergy,</hi> yet were not really Lord
Barons, becauſe they did not hold their Lands immediately from the King.
To the Second, That it is falſe; and that there was no Regular Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> till 12. <hi>Edw. 3 Ergo,</hi> No Lord of Parliament till that
time; That the Lord of <hi>Kerry</hi> was there, and ſo was not the Lord
of <hi>Slane,</hi> beſides the Lord <hi>Slane</hi> held his Barony of a Subject <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew
Burgheſe,</hi> one of the Heirs General of <hi>Hugh de Lacy;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Lord of <hi>Kerry</hi> held his Barony of the <hi>King</hi> in Capite. To the
third, it is denied that the Lord of <hi>Gormanſtown</hi> was at that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of 48 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. To the fourth, That it is falſe, and is objected
becauſe the Records of thoſe times are loſt, but if true, makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this Caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is notorious, that in the Parliament, 33. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.
and 3. and 4. <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Kerry</hi> had his right place. To
the fifth, that the Lord of <hi>Kerry</hi> was not Attainted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd
was Pardoned, and ſo he forfeited nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if he had
not an ancient Right to Sit in the Parliament, the Lord Deputy could
not Summon him a new, having received no Orders from the King to
do ſo.</p>
                  <p>But that which was moſt remarkable in this Tryal was, That one
<hi>Velden</hi> came in and depos'd, that on St. <hi>George's</hi> day 1594, in the
Cavalcade at <hi>Killkenny,</hi> the Lord <hi>Slane</hi> had Precedence of the Lord of
<hi>Kerry,</hi> and his Horſe was accordingly led before the others Horſe; but
this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Witneſs was contradicted by the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the Earl of

                     </hi> all which affirmed that
they were then at <hi>Killkenny</hi> (which <hi>Velden</hi> Confeſs'd) and they proteſted
that the Lord of <hi>Kerry</hi> was not there at all.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the next Year, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1615. the Earls of <hi>Suffolk,
Paenox,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. G.</note> 
                     <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Pembrooke;</hi> who by Commiſſion excented the

                  <p>This rub being removed, the Parliament proceeded to buſineſs, and

Fourthly, That the Miniſters do exact Money for Marriages and
Chriſtnings, tho they don't officiate; and the Ordinaries exact great
Sums for Commutation of Penance: And in all theſe Particulars they
pray Relief.</p>
                  <p>By Virtue of the King's Letter, of the 12th of <hi>April</hi> 1615, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
iſſued to enquire into his Majeſties Title to the Counties of
<hi>Longford</hi> and <hi>Letrim;</hi> whereupon a Jury was impanelled, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
return'd, that the Territory of <hi>Annaly</hi> (now the County of
<hi>Longford,</hi>) containing Nine hundred and Ninety Cartrons of Land
was, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, granted to <hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi> who built
Caſtles, and planted Engliſh there; and that they were ouſted by the
<hi>O Feralls</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt; and that <hi>Faghan O Ferall</hi>
ſurrendered that Territory to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the 13th of <hi>November,</hi>
in the Twenty ninth Year of her Reign, and that her Majeſty regranted
it to him 20 <hi>Decemb. 30 Eliz. Proviſo,</hi> the Patent to be void, if the
Queen had any other Title than that Surrender, and it finds the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Abſentees.</p>
                  <p>And by another Inquiſition taken about the ſame time, it appears,
that the <hi>Brehny (i. e.</hi> the County of <hi>Letrim,</hi>) was, by King <hi>John,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Walter de Lacy,</hi> who likewiſe planted it with Engliſh, which
were afterwards violently diſpoſſeſſed by the <hi>O Rourks</hi> and <hi>Mac Grannells;</hi>
and that <hi>O Rourk</hi> had three Legitimate Sons, and ſix Baſtards, that
<hi>Teige,</hi> one of his Baſtard Sons, ſucceeded him in the Eſtate, and that
he had Iſſue <hi>Teige,</hi> who had Iſſue <hi>Daniel</hi> now living; and that <hi>Brian,</hi>
Second Son of <hi>O Rourk,</hi> had Iſſue Sir <hi>Brian,</hi> who ſurrendered that
Territory, and agreed to take out a Patent, but never did it: He was
executed in <hi>England,</hi> and it was his Son <hi>Teige</hi> that ſubmitted, and took
out a Patent, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. And this <hi>Teige</hi> married <hi>Mary</hi> Daughter of
<hi>Hugh mac Manus O Donell,</hi> whoſe two former Husbands (Sir <hi>Moylmurry
mac Swiny,</hi> and Sir <hi>Donell O Cohan</hi>) were ſtill living, by whom the ſaid
<hi>Teige</hi> had Iſſue <hi>Brian,</hi> and died; and whether <hi>Brian</hi> be a Baſtard or
not, <hi>Juratores predict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ignorant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the like Inquiſition was found about the Territory of <hi>Ely O
Caroll,</hi> whereby it appear'd, that that Signiory, containing Ninety
three Plow-lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was ſurrendred to <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, who regranted
it to <hi>Teige O Caroll,</hi> and made him Baron of <hi>Ely;</hi> and he dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Iſſue, his Baſtard-ſon Sir <hi>William O Caroll</hi> intruded, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to the Queen 28 <hi>July, 20 Elizabethae,</hi> and had it regranted to
him in Fee-ſimple; and that he died, leaving one Daughter, <hi>Joan,</hi>
Mother of <hi>Redmond Burk,</hi> pretended Baron of <hi>Letrim;</hi> that Sir <hi>Charles
O Caroll,</hi> Baſtard-ſon of Sir <hi>William,</hi> intruded, and that <hi>Joan</hi> releas'd to

                  <p>About this time another Plot was diſcovered to Sir <hi>Thomas Phillips</hi>

to him ſhould paſs for nothing, he has added another Dedication, by

he avers, That the Iriſh look for nothing, but that the King would uſe
them <hi>like a King, i. e.</hi> not like a Tyrant; and when I have added that,

                  <p>The Exorbitances of the Papiſts did indeed at this time oblige the
Government to keep a ſtricter hand over them than hitherto they had
done, and two things were reſolved on to humble them; one was to
baniſh all their Regulars, which did in great numbers ſwarm almoſt
every where in that Kingdom: And the other was, to ſuffer no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
or Officers, but what ſhould take the Oath of Supremacy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law; and in order thereunto, there did iſſue a Proclamation
againſt the Popiſh Clergy on the 13th of <hi>October,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1617.</note> 
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1617.
And afterwards, on the 5th of <hi>March 1617, Donogh</hi> Earl of <hi>Twomond,</hi>
Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did (by Virtue of a Commiſſion under the Great Seal,
bearing date the 23d. of <hi>January</hi> 1617) ſeize on the Liberties
of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and all their Rent Rolls, Enſigns of Authority, and
their publick Revenues, which amounted to Three Hundred and
Four Pounds Ten Shillings <hi>per Annum,</hi> and kept Aſſizes in the City
for the County of <hi>Waterford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this Seizure was, becauſe <hi>Nicholas White</hi> (who from
<hi>Michalmas</hi> 1615. to the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> then next following, did exerciſe
the Office of Mayor of <hi>Waterford</hi>) did on the <hi>20th.</hi> day of <hi>October</hi> 1615.
refuſe the Oath of Supremacy, being then tendered to him by the
Lord Preſident, by Virtue of a ſpecial Commiſſion to that purpoſe;
and that upon his refuſal, the City Elected <hi>John Skiddy,</hi> who Acted
as Mayor till the <hi>1ſt.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1616. and then refuſed the ſame Oath,
being tendred to him by the Lord Preſident; whereupon the City
choſe <hi>Alexander Cuffe,</hi> and ſwore him Mayor on the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi>
who likewiſe on the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> refuſed the aforeſaid Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
before the Lords Juſtices; whereupon he forbore to Act
any farther in the Mayoralty, and ſo it ſtood till the <hi>1ſt.</hi> of <hi>April</hi>
1617. at which time <hi>Walter Cleer</hi> was ſworn Mayor, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the City had no Recorder ſince the Death of <hi>Nicholas
Walſh, Anno</hi> 1615, and yet in <hi>January</hi> 1616; there was a Goal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
held before the ſaid <hi>John Skiddy</hi> without any Recorder, and

                  <p>In the mean time, there were ſharp Conteſts between ſeveral great

<hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Dingwell</hi> Heir General of
<hi>Thomas Duff</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who died <hi>Anno</hi> 1614. Their Caſe is to

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65997:302"/>
refer'd to the King, who <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. made his Award, and divided
the Eſtate between the contending Parties; but the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>
thought that Diſtribution ſo unequal, that he refuſed to ſubmit to it,
and therefore endured a long Impriſonment, and many other Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
from the Court; but after his Death that Controverſie was alſo
happily Compos'd by the Marriage of his Grandſon the young Earl of
<hi>Ormond,</hi> with the ſole Daughter, and Heir of the Lady <hi>Dingwell;</hi> and
that happy Couple improved that divided and ſhattered Eſtate, to be
the greateſt and beſt belonging to any Subject in the Kings Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and are well known to the World, by the Names of the <hi>firſt
Duke and Dutcheſs of</hi> Ormond.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1620.<note place="margin">1620.</note> The famous Doctor <hi>Uſher</hi> was made Biſhop of

of Juriſdiction before Conſecration, but after ſome Expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the Controverſie was peaceably Compos'd.</p>
                  <p>The Year 1621.<note place="margin">1621.</note> was famous for the Congregation <hi>de Propaganda
fide</hi> then Erected at <hi>Rome;</hi> the influence whereof the Subjects of <hi>Great
Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have felt to the purpoſe, and in the ſame Year
<hi>Thomas</hi> Viſcount <hi>Thurles,</hi> Father of the firſt Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> was
drowned.</p>
                  <p>It was in this Year that the King to mortifie ſome of the moſt
active Members of the Houſe of Commons, that had fallen under his
Diſpleaſure, reſolv'd to ſend them into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and therefore a
Commiſſion under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> was directed to Sir
<hi>Dudly Digs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ruſhworth 55.</note> Sir <hi>Thomas Crew,</hi> Sir <hi>Nathaniel Rich,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Perrot,</hi>
and others, to inquire of ſundry Matters concerning his Majeſties
Service in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well in Point of Government, Eccleſiaſtical and
Civil, as of Revenue; and to inſpect the State of the Kingdom, and
propagate Religion, ſettle the Government, and improve the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.</p>
                  <p>The Pretence of this Commiſſion was, the many Complaints of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt the Lord Deputy, not that there was any juſt occaſion for
thoſe Accuſations, but that it is always their Cuſtom to complain of
any Governour, <hi>That is a good</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>and a good</hi> Engliſhman (as
this Lord Deputy was in perfection) and is therefore to the laſt Degree
hated and ſcandaliz'd by the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts;</hi> and it is no wonder it ſhould
be ſo, <hi>for their Intereſts are Diametrically oppoſite to that of an</hi> Engliſh
<hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and therefore it does neceſſarily follow, that whoever Is
<hi>faithful to the</hi> Engliſh, will be <hi>odious to the</hi> Iriſh, and ſubject to their
Clamours and Contempts,</p>
                  <p>However, the Lord Deputy was not wanting to his own Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore wrote to the King, that he met a Cloud of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Enemies, inſtead of good Subjects; and that even ſome of the
Privy Council were Spies upon him, and took occaſions to leſſen him,
tho' they had no other Provocation for doing ſo, but his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a certain Patent, according to his Majeſties ſpecial Order, and
his righting the Church againſt their Depredations.</p>
                  <p>And tho' the King in Anſwer,<note place="margin">August, 1621.</note> aſſur'd him, <hi>That his Reputation ſtood
without blemiſh;</hi> and that his Majeſty had ſent him ſome Propoſitions,
which he was ordered to obſerve; yet the Deputies Enemies not only
prevail'd to have the aforeſaid Commiſſion of inſpection iſſued, but
having gain'd that Point, they urged that the Commiſſion could not
have any conſiderable Effect, whilſt the Lord Deputy continued in
the Government; and therefore procured, that a Succeſſor ſhould be

nam'd, and that being alſo accompliſh'd in the Choice of the Lord
Viſcount <hi>Falkland:</hi> The Lords of the Council on <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi>

Proteſtants publick Affronts,</hi> nor <hi>to take Poſſeſſion of their Churches before
their Faces;</hi> the reaſon of his ſaying ſo was, becauſe the Fryars of
<hi>Multifernam</hi> were erecting a new Abby at <hi>Molingar;</hi> and becauſe that
Mr. <hi>Anker</hi> going to read Prayers in a Church of his in <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi>
found an old Prieſt, and forty People with him in the Church, who
were ſo bold to bid Mr. <hi>Anker</hi> depart until the Prieſt had done his
Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>However, the Papiſts took ſuch Exceptions at this Sermon, and
made ſuch a noiſe about it (as if the Biſhop had adviſed, that the
Sword which had been ſo long born in vain, ſhould now be exerciſed
to their Deſtruction;) That how groundleſs ſoever this Clamour was,
the Biſhop was fain to Preach an Explanatory Sermon to appeaſe it.</p>
                  <p>This Year there happened a dreadful Fire in <hi>Corke,</hi> which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Profits that accrued in the Vacancy. And the like Order was ſent to
make <hi>Archibald Hamilton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Killalla</hi> and <hi>Ardconry;</hi> and on the
10th. of <hi>March</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Villars</hi> was made Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi>

but the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> being not a little out of Order, the <hi>Iriſh</hi>

they were much encouraged by the Bull of <hi>Urban,</hi> the 8th. of the 30th. of

amounted unto 64240 <hi>l. 1 s. 2 d.</hi> which was more then the Kings
Revenue, out of which the Civil Liſt was nevertheleſs to be
paid; ſo that it was neceſſary to find out ſome other Bund,
for the ſupport of the Army; and until that could be done the Lord
Deputy and Council, on the 14th. of <hi>September,</hi> by their Letters did
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65997:306"/>
recommend ſeveral Troops and Companies of the Army, to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

and ſo from three Months to three Months, until the laſt day of <hi>March</hi>
1628; and this whole Charge or Incumbrance on the Countrey, was
eſtimated at 36951 <hi>l. 6 s. 7 d. ½,</hi> and in the King's Letter of the 22d. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
1626. to raiſe this Army; and that the Countrey ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                  <p>On the 16th. of <hi>May,</hi> 1626.<note place="margin">1626.</note> The King reciting a Complaint of Sir
<hi>Samuel Smith's</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and that there was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Lord Deputy and <hi>Chancellor.</hi> 1. Becauſe the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi>
refuſed to Seal ſome Patents offered to him. 2. Becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to appoint Judges for Circuits, when thereunto required by the
Deputy. 3. Becauſe he refuſed to appoint Juſtices of Peace, at the
Lord Deputies Nomination; and made one Juſtice of the Peace
againſt his Expreſs prohibition, to which, the Lord Chancellor made
Anſwer: That in the firſt Caſe, there was matter of Equity, Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of State, and Queſtion in Law unreſolved; and that in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſond
Caſe, he had directions in the time of King <hi>James;</hi> and that in
the third Caſe, it was the Priviledge and Juriſdiction of his
place.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the King orders, That the Chancellor bear fitting reſpect
to the Lord Deputy, who is his Majeſties Repreſentative; and as to the
Matters in Debate, if the Chancellor refuſe to Seal any Patent in queſtion
for Reaſons of State, that the Cauſe be debated in Council; and if then
they think it fit, and the Chancellor ſtill refuſes, till he has appeal'd
to his Majeſty (as he may) it ſhall be at his Peril, if the State ſuffer
by his delay; if the Queſtion be in Law, that the Judges decide it,
and if the Chancellor be not ſatisfied therewith, he ought to appeal
to the King for farther Directions; and particularly about the Patent
for Tanning Leather. As to the Second, if the Chancellor will not
appoint Judges as the Lord Deputy deſires, that then it be refer'd to
the Council-board; and their Sentence be definitive as to that. And
as to the Third, the Chancellor will not refuſe to make any Man, a
Juſtice of the Peace recommended by the Lord Deputy; if he does,
that then the Order of the Council-Table ſhall govern that Matter;
and in all theſe Caſes, it becomes the Chancellor to repair to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,
and acquaint him with his Reaſons whenever he refuſes.</p>
                  <p>And as for Sir <hi>Samuel Smith</hi>'s Complaint, his Caſe was, that he
had the ſole Nomination of thoſe that ſhould be Licenſed to Sell <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quavitae;</hi>
and did ſet that Priviledge to one <hi>Miagh</hi> for the County of
<hi>Cork,</hi> the King appoints the Chief Juſtice, Chief Baron, and Sir <hi>John
King</hi> to Arbitrate that Matter, and to make Reparation to <hi>Miagh,</hi>
whoſe Patent muſt be called in; becauſe he is an infamous Perſon, and
unfit for that Truſt, and a new Patent for that County muſt be Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to whom Sir <hi>Samuel Smith</hi> ſhall name.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Month of <hi>May,</hi> the King ſent an Order to the Lord
Deputy, to make a Lord High Steward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Tryal of the
Lord of <hi>Dunboyn</hi> by his Peers, upon an Indictment found againſt him
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65997:306"/>
in the County of <hi>Typerary,</hi> for killing a Man; and in <hi>January</hi> after,
the Earl of <hi>Marleburgh,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,
Dorſet, Grandiſon, Conway,</hi> and <hi>Carlton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Weſton,</hi>
were made Commiſſioners (or rather a Committee) for <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs.</p>
                  <p>And on the Eighth of <hi>February, Edward Brabazon</hi> Baron of <hi>Ardee</hi>
was ordered to be Earl of <hi>Catherlogh;</hi> but, for what Reaſons I know
not, he had not that Title, but was afterwards made Earl of <hi>Meath.</hi>
And on the Second of <hi>March</hi> his Majeſty ſent an Order for Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Saintleger</hi> to be Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter.</hi> And on the Fifteenth
of <hi>March</hi> he ordered the Vice-Treaſurer to pay what the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
and Eight Privy-Counſellors ſhould think fit, for the Charges of
the Lord Deputy's Progreſs.</p>
                  <p>On the Ninth of <hi>May,</hi> 1627. upon Complaint of the Lord <hi>Courcy,</hi>
That Sir <hi>Dominick Sarsfeild</hi> had obtained the Title of Viſcount <hi>Kinſale,</hi>
it was referred to the Lord preſident of the Council, the Steward of
the Houſhold, Earl of <hi>Totneſs,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> and Chancellor of
the Dutchy; who report, That the Lord <hi>Courcy</hi> and his Anceſtors
were Lords <hi>Courcy,</hi> and Barons of <hi>Kinſale</hi> and <hi>Ringrone:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Defendant endeavor'd to carry the Barony to another Line,
and alſo alledged an Attainder, but made out neither; and then he
propos'd, That both Titles were conſiſtent, one to be Baron, and the
other to be Viſcount of <hi>Kinſale:</hi> But that being not thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
his Majeſty orders, That Sir <hi>Dominick</hi> quit the Title of <hi>Kinſale,</hi>
but retain the Name and Precedency of Viſcount <hi>Sarsfeild,</hi> and chuſe
ſome other Place to denominate his Honour; and afterwards he did
ſo, and was created Viſcount <hi>Killmallock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on the 24th. of <hi>July</hi> the King orders, That <hi>Nathaniel Catlin,</hi>
his ſecond Serjeant at Law, ſhould have Precedence of the Attorney-General
and Sollicitor-General; and in <hi>February</hi> following his Majeſty
likewiſe gave Orders to make a new Examinator for the Court of
Chancery, there being but one Examinator in that Court before that
time.</p>
                  <p>But in order to make the Papiſts the more willing to bear the great
Charge of the Army, and to conſent to a conſtant Tax for its Support,
certain Propoſitions were ſet on foot in their favour, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuſpend
all Proceedings againſt them for Marriages and Chriſtnings by Prieſts,
and to give them liberty of Suing out Liveries and <hi>Ouſter le mains</hi>
without taking the Oath of Supremacy, with deſign to introduce a
more Publick Toleration of Religion, for which a good Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
ſhould be paid to his Majeſty, to maintain the Army; to which
end, a Great Aſſembly of the Nation was Convok'd by the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty:
But the Proteſtant Archbiſhops and Biſhops abhorring this groſs
and ſcandalous Propoſal, did on the 26th day of <hi>November,</hi> 1626.
at the Lord Primate's Houſe, unanimouſly vote and ſubſcribe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Proteſtation, <hi>viz.</hi>

Firſt, It is to make our ſelves acceſſory not only to their Superſtitions,
Idolatries, and Hereſies, and, in a word, to all the Abominations of Popery;

People, which periſh in the Deluge of the Catholick Apoſtacy.</p>

                  <p>This zealous Proteſtation of the Biſhops againſt Popery (which
<hi>Downham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Derry</hi> read to the State in the midſt of his Sermon

from the Houſe of Commons in <hi>England,</hi> to his Majeſty, to
this effect; <hi>That the Popiſh Religion was publickly profeſt in every Part of</hi>
Ireland, <hi>and that Monaſteries and Nunneries were thsre newly erected, and
repleniſhed with Votaries of both Sexes, which would be of evil Conſequence,

                  <p>Theſe two extraordinary Actions put a ſtop to any farther Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors

becauſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Agents in <hi>England</hi> did conſent to the payment of
120000 <hi>l.</hi> in three Year, it was thought reaſonable that the King
ſhould ſignifie his Gracious Acceptance thereof, by conferring ſome
extraordinary Favours on the Agents and Contributors.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the King did on the 24th day of <hi>May</hi> not only grant
them the following Graces, which were tranſmitted to <hi>Ireland</hi> by way
of Inſtructions to the Lord Deputy and Council; but alſo ſent with
it a Letter, recommending the Lord of <hi>Killeen,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Poer,</hi> and
the reſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Agents, to the Lord Deputy's Favour, deſiring
that he would order ſuch Moneys to be paid them by the Country as
they were promis'd for their Agency; and that he ſhould iſſue neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

                  </p>

not without the oppoſition of ſome Papiſts, one of which moved,
<hi>That the Matter concerning the Subſidies might be put off to another time,

                  </p>
                  <p>By vertue of theſe Six Subſidies, which amounted to above
240000 <hi>l.</hi> and were payable Half-yearly, the Lord Deputy was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to pay a Debt of 80000 <hi>l.</hi> due from the Crown, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Charge of the Kingdom, without any Supply of Money from
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Lord Deputy had formerly obtain'd his Majeſty's Order of
the Sixteenth of <hi>January,</hi> 1633. for the free tranſportation of ſo
many Horſes and Mares out of <hi>England</hi> as he the Lord Deputy
ſhould give Licence for; by which means he changed Five hundred
Foot of the Army for Six hundred Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were extraordinary
good ones, his own Stables exceeding that of any former Governors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And indeed generally the whole Army was neither ſo well paid, nor
ſo well diſciplin'd, in any other time, as it was in his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>On the Twenty fourth of</hi> September, 1634. <hi>the King reciting,</hi> That
King <hi>James</hi> had by his Commiſſion of the Tenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1603. renewed
or revived the Court of <hi>Caſtle-chamber,</hi> as himſelf likewiſe had done by
his Commiſſion of 5 <hi>October,</hi> 1625. and that now ſome Diſputes are ariſen,
whether that Court can ſit out of Term, or more than twice a Week<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>His
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65997:313"/>
Majeſty Orders,</hi> That it it may ſit, when and as often as the Commiſſioners
pleaſe, and that a new Commiſſion iſſue to that Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And about this time, <hi>Emerus Mac Mahon</hi> (afterwards Titular Biſhop
of <hi>Clogher</hi>) diſcovered to Sir <hi>George Ratcliff,</hi> a Plot for a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and Confeſs'd, that himſelf had been imploy'd
for ſome years in foreign Courts, to ſolicite Aid to carry on a Rebellion,
which, it ſeems, they thought fit to adjourn to a more proper Seaſon.
But on the 14th. of <hi>November</hi> the Parliament met according to the
Prorogation, and ſate till the 14th. of <hi>December,</hi> and were then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogu'd
to the 26th. of <hi>January;</hi> from which time they ſate till the
21ſt day of <hi>March,</hi> and then it was again Prorogu'd to the 24th. day
of the ſame Month, and ſate from thence to its Diſſolution, which
was on the 18th. day of <hi>April,</hi> 1635.</p>
                  <p>I need not mention the Acts made in theſe ſeveral Seſſions of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
becauſe they are many, and are to be found at large in the
Printed Book of Statutes; it is enough to ſay, That they cull'd out
all the choice Statutes that were made in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the <hi>20th.</hi> of
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> that were proper for the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and added
to them ſome good new Laws, that were peculiar to that Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament being thus ended, and cloſed with an Act of Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the Lord Deputy and Council made a Progreſs into <hi>Conaught,</hi>
to inquire into his Majeſties Title to ſeveral Lands in that Province:
and on the 11th. of July at <hi>Abby-boyle</hi> (to ſtill the Jealouſies and
Alarms the People were under at this great Inquiſition) they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
an Act of Council,<note place="margin">1635.</note> 
                     <hi>That it was not his Majeſties, intention to take
any thing from his People that was juſtly theirs; and therefore, that thoſe
who had effectual Letters Patents, ſhould have the full benefit of them, as
if they were found</hi> Verbatim <hi>in the great Office then to be taken, provided
the Patents, or the Enrolment thereof, were ſhewn to the Council-board, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
Eaſter <hi>Term next, and by it approved to be good and effectual in Law;</hi>
and the like was done in other Counties of <hi>Conaught,</hi> and ſo this
great Inquiſition (which was one of the Spring-heads and Fountains
of the ſucceeding Rebellion) was with great Diligence and Succeſs
carried on and effected; and the Kings Title was found to moſt part
of that Province, and a noble <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantation was deſign'd.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon, the Patentees (and particularly the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> of
<hi>Coſtilo</hi>) produced their Patents to the Council-board, and it appearing
thoſe Patents were Granted by Virtue of a Commiſſion, 4 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1.
wherein there was no direction about the Tenure, it grew to be a
Queſtion, whether the Patents to hold by Knights Service, as of the
Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> were warranted by that Commiſſion, or valid in Law;
and after much debate it was ſolemnly adjudg'd, That thoſe Patents
were void. And this Caſe is well known to the Lawyers, by the
Name of <hi>THE CASE OF TENURES,</hi> and was excellently reported
in Print by Baron <hi>Barry,</hi> afterwards Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
Baron of <hi>Sautry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Grand Inquiſition was counted ſo great a Maſter-piece of the
Lord Deputies, and ſo beneficial to the King, and advantagious to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt; That ſome Perſons who went to <hi>England,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of it, were there not only diſcountenanced but impriſon'd, and
afterwards ſent back to be dealt by, as the Lord Deputy ſhould
think fit; which, it ſeems, produced their Submiſſion. And not long
after, the Lord Deputy (having firſt received Orders to Grant the
Impropriations belonging to the King, to the uſe of the Clergy, and
to Grant to <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> near <hi>Dublin</hi> Lands equal in value,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65997:313"/>
to the Penſion they had from the Crown, of 388 <hi>l. 15 s. per Annum</hi>)
went to <hi>England,</hi> to give his Majeſty a Triumphant Account of his
glorious Succeſſes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he performed to Admiration: Firſt,
to the King in a private Audience, and afterwards publickly at the
Council-board.</p>
                  <p>He there told the King and Council, That he had found the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Exchequer of <hi>Paper,</hi> but he had made it of <hi>Treaſure;</hi> and that he had
not only improv'd the Patrimony of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but had
alſo brought it to be Conformable to that of <hi>England,</hi> both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Government, by the Acceptance of the Thirty Nine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
there.</p>
                  <p>That before his going to <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord Juſtices wrote, That
the Expence exceeded the Income 24000 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> and they had
no ways to raiſe it, but by the Levying Nine pence a <hi>Sunday</hi> on Papiſts
for not coming to Church, but that now it was far otherwiſe without
that Perſecution. And he advis'd, That the Army ſhould rather be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
than diminſhed; it being an excellent Miniſter and Aſſiſtant in
Execution of the Kings Writs, and the great Peace-maker between the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> and the <hi>Natives,</hi> and the beſt ſecurity of paſt and future Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p>That by the Statutes of Wills and Uſes, there will more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
ariſe to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> than by the ſix Subſidies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
thereby the inſant Heirs of all great Families in the Kingdom
will unavoidably come under the Guardianſhip of the King, whereby
they will be bred Proteſtants, and of what Conſequence this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency
is, doth in part appear in the Perſon of the Earl of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
(formerly the Kings Ward) who, if bred under the Wing of his
own Parents, had been <hi>of the ſame Affections and Religion,</hi> with his other
Brothers and Siſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas he is now a firm Proteſtant, and like to
prove <hi>a great and able Servant to the Crown,</hi> and a great Aſſiſtant, as
well in inviting others to be of his Religion; as in the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it being certain, <hi>That no People are more apt to be of the Religion of
their great Lords, than the</hi> Iriſh <hi>are.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That by the Statute of fraudulent Conveyances, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
in their cunning Diſigns, by ſecret and ſleeping Conveyancies;
ſo that the King will have his Forfeitures and Wardſhips, and the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> be encouraged to purchaſe of them.</p>
                  <p>That before his time, the Pirates infeſted the very Harbours, and a
Ship was fired by them in the Port of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in ſight of his Majeſties
Caſtle; and the Pirates were robbing the Ship two days together
without oppoſition; the Reaſon was, becauſe our Sea-guard for want
of Money did not come till <hi>Auguſt,</hi> before which time the miſchief
was done; but now they are well Paid and come in <hi>March;</hi> and that now
the Exportation is double, to what is imported into the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>That he diſcourag'd <hi>Woollen,</hi> and encourag'd the <hi>Linen</hi> Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and had ſow'd 1000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of <hi>Holland-Flax Seed,</hi> and ſet
up ſix or ſeven <hi>Looms,</hi> and doubts not Succeſs; becauſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> can

                  </p>
                  <p>And then he laments, <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>of</hi> Ireland <hi>are treated as
Aliens:</hi> Firſt, In the Impoſition of 4 <hi>s. per</hi> Tun on Coal: Secondly, In
the Prohibition to tranſport Horſes or Mares hence without exceſſive

Seal to ſuperſede theſe <hi>pro tempore.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That tho' he was repreſented more like a <hi>Baſha</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi>

<hi>Anno</hi> 1640. (on private Conference with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Committee

which amounted to at leaſt 10000 <hi>l.</hi> was in effect loſt, and
this terrifying Bug-bear did not add one Acre to the Poſſeſſions of the

                  <p>In the Year 1636,<note place="margin">1636.</note> 
                     <hi>John Atherton</hi> was preferred to the Biſhoprick of

(ſays the Writer of Biſhop <hi>Bedells</hi> Life, <hi>pag.</hi> 144.) but that is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
becauſe that Biſhoprick was then ſo Poor, that it was too
ſmall a Temptation to ſo great a Sin, it is more likely, that being
a buſtling Man of active Parts and a bold Spirit; he was thought a
fit Inſtrument of State, to promote ſome Deſigns that were then on
Foot, and as proper for the Recovery of the ancient Poſſeſſions of his
<hi>See,</hi> as any Body that could be pitcht upon; and accordingly we find
him a fierce Adverſary to the Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> and a ſevere Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

                  <p>And it is obſervable,<note place="margin">1637.</note> that the Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> and this Biſhop <hi>Ather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

Deputy and Council, to appoint Arbitrators to decide their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies;
and accordingly the Biſhop of <hi>Derry,</hi> and the Maſter of the
Court of Wards were Aſſigned to that purpoſe, and in their Adward,
(which I have ſeen) they recite, that the Biſhopricks of <hi>Waterford</hi> and
<hi>Liſmore,</hi> by the Alienations of former Biſhops, were left worth but
Fifty pound <hi>per Annum</hi> Revenue in Land; and that the Earl had not
purchaſed any thing immediately from the Church, but from other
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65997:314"/>
Perſons for valuable Conſiderations near Forty years before; yet out
of Love to Religion, and the Profeſſors thereof, he was contented to
part with ſome of his Right; and ſo they Adwarded <hi>Liſmore,</hi> &amp;c. to
the Earl; and <hi>Ardmore,</hi> &amp;c. to the Biſhop; and this Adward was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
confirm'd by the Lord Lieutenant and Council, and after that
by the King.</p>

the Twelve Acts; to be found at large in the Printed Statutes, 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe four Subſidies, was Aſſeſſed at 46170 <hi>l.</hi> but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

<hi>Nicholas Plunket</hi> Aſſeſs'd in another manner, did not together amount
unto more then 23768 <hi>l. 15 s. 0 d.</hi> and the Fourth Subſidy was never
Taxed at all, by reaſon of the Rebellion that enſued.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be Noted, that the Proteſtants paid more than one
Third of the Commons part of the Subſidies (beſides 26480 <hi>l. 6 s. 0 d.</hi>
Granted in Fourteen Subſidies by the Proteſtant Clergy only,) and

whereof the Confederate Lords paid, but 10620 <hi>l. 18 s. 4 d.</hi> and it is
very remarkable, that foreknowing the Rebellion (<hi>as undoubtedly they
did</hi>) they paid not one Penny of the Second or Third Subſidies; and
the Commons paid ſo little, that of the Three Subſidies on them,
there was in Arrear when the Rebellion broke out 23855 <hi>l. 9 s. 7 d.</hi>

for impoſing a new Oath on the People, hereafter mentioned;
which was ſo much abhorr'd by many, that they quitted the Kingdom
rather then take it, and he was open alſo to the Jealouſies of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
by bringing over with him Sir <hi>Toby Mathews</hi> a Jeſuited Prieſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65997:315"/>

all this, it is certain, he was no Friend to Popery, but
only temporiz'd, until he ſhould meet with a more proper Seaſon <hi>to

                  <p>About this time, <hi>Archibald Adair,</hi> who had been Biſhop of <hi>Killalla</hi>
ſince the Year 1630<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was deprived of his Biſhoprick, upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion:
One <hi>Corbet,</hi> a Clergy-man, that fled from <hi>Scotland,</hi> for writing
a Satyrical Book againſt the Covenanters, called <hi>Lyſimachus Nicanor,</hi>
was ſent to this Biſhop for Preferment; but he being a moderate
Man, and perhaps too indulgent to his own Nation, did not approve
of <hi>Corbet,</hi> that had handled the <hi>Scots</hi> ſo ſeverely; and therefore he
gave no countenance to him, but, on the contrary, told him, <hi>That it
was a bad Bird that foul'd his own Neſt;</hi> which was the ſharper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Corby</hi> in <hi>Scotch</hi> ſignifies <hi>a Raven.</hi> And when <hi>Corbet</hi> told him,
That he had hardly eſcaped with Life, but had left his Wife <hi>to try
the Humanity of the Scots,</hi> the Biſhop replied, <hi>That he had left her to a
very baſe Office:</hi> And other things he ſaid, which the Government
thought too favourable to the <hi>Govenanters;</hi> and tho' they would not
be much conſidered at another time, yet now was thought a ſufficient
Cauſe of Deprivation, and Doctor <hi>John Maxwell</hi> was made Biſhop
in his room; but the next Year after the Execution of <hi>Atherton</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Waterford, Adair</hi> was made Biſhop of that See.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſhould it be omitted, That this Biſhop <hi>Maxwell,</hi> a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Preacher, and a hearty Royaliſt, was nevertheleſs wounded, ſtript
naked, and left amongſt the Dead, by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, <hi>whoſe Skeins

accidentally preſerved by the Earl of <hi>Twomond,</hi> who travelled that
way towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> and afterwards went to the King to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
was the firſt Man that convinced the King of <hi>the innate Hatred the</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But let us return to the Lord Lieutenant, who went again to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

ſome Inſtructions that were agreed upon by that Houſe, for a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee

                        <p>HIS Majeſty hath commanded me to acquaint your Lordſhips with an
Advice given him from abroad, and confirm'd by His Miniſters in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and elſewhere, which, in this diſtemper'd Time, and Conjuncture of
Affairs, deſerves to be ſeriouſly conſidered, and an eſpecial Care and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to be had therein: Which is, That of late there have paſſed from
<hi>Spain</hi> (and the like may well have been from other Parts) an unſpeakable
number of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Churchmen, for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſome good old

as if they expected a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Connaught,</hi>
Wherefore His Majeſty thought fit to give your Lordſhips this notice, that
in your Wiſdoms you might manage the ſame with that dexterity and ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
as to diſcover and prevent ſo pernicious a Deſign, if any ſuch there

In the mean time, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> came to his Tryal in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and it was the moſt Solemn that ever was in that Kingdom, and
at length he was Attainted by Act of Parliament, and accordingly
beheaded on the 12th. day of <hi>May,</hi> 1641. and the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>
was the ſame day appointed Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> in his ſtead.</p>
                  <p>His Tryal is excellently wrote at large by Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> to which
I muſt refer the curious Reader; but becauſe every Man has not that
Book by him I have Curſorily extracted ſo much of it only, as I
thought pertinent to his Hiſtory, wherein if I have not been very
exact, it was, becauſe the Inquiſitive may eaſily inform themſelves,
as well as I, by having recourſe to the Original, which I had not
leiſure to examine more carefully, than I have done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Third, Article</hi> (which is the Firſt relating to <hi>Ireland</hi>) is, that he
ſhould ſay, <hi>That</hi> Ireland <hi>was a conquer'd Nation, and that the King
might do with them, what he pleaſed;</hi> and that the Charters of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
were worth nothing, and did bind the King no farther than he
pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>To which the Earl Anſwers, That he never ſpoke thoſe words,
and that the Scope and Intent of what he did ſay, was, to ingratiate
his Majeſties Government to the People; and that his words were well
accepted at that time, however they come to be reſented now: That
the Charters of <hi>Dublin</hi> were <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. brought before the Council,
and ſtill are in the hands of the Clerk of the Council; becauſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
other Abuſes) the Papiſts of that City engroſſed all the Trade,
and denied Liberty to ſuch as came out of <hi>England</hi> to ſet up there;
which he hath ſo far remedied, as that there are Three <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>
now in <hi>Dublin,</hi> for One that was there when he came to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Charters are not Condemned, but enjoyed to this day,
ſo that he aim'd at a Reformation in favour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but did not
deſign the Deſtruction of the Charters.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Article was, <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Cork <hi>having begun a Suit
at Law to recover a Poſſeſſion he had loſt, by Colour of an Order from the
Lord Deputy and Council, the Lord Deputy threatned to impriſon him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he would ſurceaſe his Suit, ſaying,</hi> That he would have neither Law,
nor Lawyers diſpute or queſtion his Orders, <hi>and that he ſaid upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(the like) Occaſion,</hi> That he would make the Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> and all
<hi>Ireland</hi> know, that ſo long as he had the Government there, any Act
of State there made, or to be made, ſhould be as binding to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of that Kingdom, as an Act of Parliament; <hi>and that he queſtion'd
that Earl in the Caſtle-Chamber, upon Pretence of a Breach of an Order
of Council-Table.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> anſwered, That the Council-Table was
a Court of Record in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein they proceeded formally by Bill,
Anſwer, Examination of Witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore the Orders of
it are binding, and ought to be obey'd; he denies he compar'd it to
a Parliament, and denies that the Earl of <hi>Cork</hi> was proſecuted for
diſobedience of an Order of Council only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fifth Article was,</hi> That in time of Peace 12th. of <hi>December,</hi>
1635. he did give, and procure to be given Sentence of Death againſt the
Lord <hi>Mountnorris</hi> at a Council of War, (for ſaying of an Accidental hurt
his Kinſman had given the Lord Deputies Foot, <hi>Perhaps it was done in
revenge of that Affront, my Lord Deputy did me publickly, but I
have a Brother would not have taken ſuch a Revenge</hi>) and the like Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was given againſt <hi>Thomas Dennit,</hi> who was executed thereupon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:65997:318"/>
To this the Earl Anſwers, That he was General of the Army, and
had Power of Martial Law, which is uſual in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Mountnorris</hi> was an Officer in the ſtanding Army, and by thoſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous
Words had tranſgreſſed the Thirteenth, and the Twenty firſt
Articles of War, That he was not a Judge of it, but the Council of
War were the Judges, that the Lord <hi>Mountnorris</hi> ſuffered nothing; but
a ſhort Impriſonment; and was told at that time by the Earl, that he
ſhould not ſuffer according to the Sentence; and as for <hi>Dennit,</hi> he had
ſtoln a quarter of Beef, and alſo ran away from his Colours, which
is Felony in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and it was at a time when a Regiment was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking
for <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sixth Article is,</hi> That on a Paper Petition, without legal Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he caus'd the Lord <hi>Mountnorris</hi> to be diſpoſſeſſed of Land, that he
had enjoy'd quietly Eighteen years.</p>
                  <p>To this the Earl ſays, That that ſort of Proceeding was uſual in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and he had a poſitive Order for it (except in ſpecial Caſes)
by the King's Letter, <hi>5th, October 9 Car.</hi> 1. that Three of the Judges
aſſiſted him in the Tryal; and that the Judgment was very juſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Eight Article was,</hi> That he impriſon'd the Lord Chancellor <hi>Loftus,</hi>
for not obeying his Decree on a Paper Petition, and alſo impriſon'd him for
not giving up the Great Seal; and alſo impriſon'd the Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> for
not ſubmitting his Title to <hi>Caſtle-Ley</hi> to the Lord Deputies Pleaſure; and
that contrary to the Major Vote of the Council, He cauſed an Order of Council-board
to be made againſt the Widow <hi>Hibbott,</hi> and threatened to Fine her
ſo high if ſhe had diſobeyed it, that ſhe was thereby forced to quit her Lands,
<hi>which are ſince conveyed to the uſe of the Earl, but it ſeems the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
of the Lord Chancellor, and the Earl of</hi> Kildare, <hi>was by
the Kings Order, and ſo the Managers inſiſted only on that of</hi> Hibbotts.</p>
                  <p>To which the Earl Anſwer'd, That it was a Caſe of Fraud and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and that the Council-board in <hi>Ireland</hi> had Juriſdiction in ſuch
Caſes, and that the Major Vote was againſt her, and denies the Lands
were conveyed to his uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Ninth Article was,</hi> That he gave Warrants to the Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi>
and <hi>Connor,</hi> and others of their Officers to Arreſt and Impriſon ſuch of the
poorer ſort, as refuſe to appear upon their Summons, or diſobey their Sentences
until they give ſecurity, to ſhew cauſe at the Council-Table for ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>To which he Anſwers, That ſuch Warrants were formerly uſed, and
even at the deſire of the Papiſts, to ſave the Charge of the Writ, <hi>de
Excommunicato capiendo,</hi> that he never Granted but this one, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it abus'd, he ſoon call'd it in again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Tenth Article was,</hi> That he procured the Cuſtoms to be Farmed to
his own uſe, and advanced the Book of Rates on Native Commodities, to
exceſſive Prizes, as every Hide at 20 <hi>s.</hi> a Stone of Wooll at 13 <hi>s. 4 d.</hi> &amp;c.
whereby the Cuſtom, that ſhould be but the 20th. became the Third or
Fourth part of the true value of the Commodity; and there is a Clauſe
in the Grant, <hi>That it ſhould be good, tho' an Act of Parliament ſhould
be made againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Earl Anſwers, That the Book of Rates was advanced
before his Farm, that it was ſo moderate, that the King ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
1637. to raiſe it higher, which he oppos'd; that he was drawn
into the Farm by the Kings Command, and the Lord <hi>Portlands</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
and that the King had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the Profit of it, and that Trade
is exceedingly increaſed ſince his coming to the Government.</p>

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:65997:319"/>
And the Matter of Fact prov'd to be thus, the Cuſtoms of <hi>Ireland</hi>
were 16 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. demiſed to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> for Ten years
at 6000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and half the clear Prohts above the Rent,
which half <hi>Communibus annis</hi> amounted to 3700 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> ſo in
effect the Duke paid 9700 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> but he had allowance for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Deſalcations, as 1400 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in lieu of the Cuſtoms of
Wines, which were Leaſed to the Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi> at that Rent; and
the Cuſtoms of <hi>Derry, Colerain, Knockfergus</hi> and <hi>Strangford</hi> are reſerv'd
to the King.</p>
                  <p>On the 24th. of <hi>March,</hi> in the Seventh Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. The
Cuſtoms were ſet to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Buckingham</hi> for 20000 <hi>l.</hi> Fine,
and 11050 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> Rent, and <hi>Derry,</hi> &amp;c. are included, and the
Lord of <hi>Carliſles</hi> Leaſe was ſurrendered to the King, the 21ſt. day of
the ſame Month, and then the new Book of Rates was made.</p>
                  <p>And on the 21ſt. of <hi>April</hi> following, <hi>viz. 8 Car.</hi> 1. The Dutcheſs
of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Leaſe being ſurrendred, a new one was made to Lord
<hi>Straffard</hi> and Partners, for 8000 <hi>l.</hi> Fine, and 15500 <hi>l. per Annum:</hi> And
they manag'd it ſo well, that this branch of the Revenue yielded them

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Twelfth was,</hi> That he Monopoliz'd the whole Trade of <hi>Tobacco</hi>
by his Proclamation, that none ſhould be imported without his Licence; and
another Proclamation, that none ſhould be Sold by Wholeſale, unleſs it were made
up in Rolls, Seal'd at both ends with a Seal appointed by him; and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

Glaſſes, Tobacco-pipes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To which he Anſwers, That <hi>6th. June 13 Jac.</hi> 1. the King gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Impoſt on <hi>Tobacco,</hi> being 18 <hi>d. per Pound</hi> to <hi>William Maſſam,</hi>
and <hi>John Pit</hi> for Seven year at 10 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and <hi>8th. February
19 Jac.</hi> 1. it was let to Mr. <hi>Lyne</hi> for Twenty one years at 20 <hi>l. per

Deputy to aſſume the Pre-emption of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> &amp;c. to advance the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
and this Letter is the ground of the firſt Proclamation, which

Proclamation is, in effect, but the Duplicate of the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that hereupon the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1637. He contracted with Mr.

and if any were Pillory'd, Whipt, &amp;c. it was for Perjury
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65997:319"/>
or like Crimes, and the Fines were only <hi>in terrorem,</hi> little of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Thirteenth Article was,</hi> That he alſo Monopoliz'd all the <hi>Flax</hi> of
the Kingdom by his Proclamations, of 31ſt. <hi>May, 12 Car.</hi> 1. and 31ſt.
<hi>January</hi> in the ſame year, preſcribing and enjoyning Rules and Methods, of
making <hi>Yarn</hi> and <hi>Thread;</hi> which the unskilful Natives could not Practiſe,
and ordering all <hi>Linen Yarn,</hi> and <hi>Thread,</hi> made in any other manner to be
ſeized, which was accordingly executed with Severity, whereby multitudes
were undone, and many Starved.</p>
                  <p>To which he Anſwers, That what he did was to incourage the <hi>Linen
Manufacture</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

of making <hi>Linen Yarn, Thread</hi> and <hi>Cloth;</hi> that the Council concurr'd
in the Proclamations, which are Temporary Laws in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that
he was a Loſer of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> by this Project, for the Good of that
Country; that the evil Conſequences (if any) were Collateral and
Accidental; and that the miſdemeanors of inferior Officers could not
be Charged on him: That he never uſed more than 400 <hi>l.</hi> worth of <hi>Yarn</hi>
in a Year, which could not undoe, much leſs Starve, ſuch multitudes as
they pretend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fourteenth was,</hi> That he impos'd a new Oath (to make true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyce,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) on Maſters of Ships, <hi>&amp;c. but the Managers declin'd this
Article.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fifteenth was,</hi> That he Arbitrarily impos'd Illegal Taxes on the
Towns of <hi>Bandonbridge, Baltimore, Tallow,</hi> &amp;c. and Ceſſed Souldiers on
them, till they paid them, and by force of Arms expell'd <hi>Richard Butler</hi>
from <hi>Caſtlecumber,</hi> and impriſon'd ſeveral of the <hi>O Brenans,</hi> and their
Wives and Children, until they ſurrendred and releas'd their Rights and
Eſtates.</p>
                  <p>To this the Earl Anſwers, That when the Country granted the
King 120000 <hi>l.</hi> in Nature of a Subſidy; it was agreed between the
Lord Deputy <hi>Falkland</hi> and Them, that it ſhould not be entered upon
Record, but be Levied by Captains, by Paper Aſſignments, by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from the Lord Deputy, and ſo it was done; and the Money le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
on <hi>Bandon,</hi> &amp;c. was Arrears of that Contribution, and it was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
without Force, and that <hi>Caſtlecumber</hi> was Legally evicted, and
what Soldiers were ſent there (being but twelve) were ſent to Guard
Mr. <hi>Wandesford</hi>'s Houſe againſt <hi>Tories;</hi> but uſed no Force to Mr. <hi>Butler,</hi>
or any quiet Subject, and that it was uſual in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to lay Soldiers
on Delinquents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sixteenth Article,</hi> That he procured his Majeſties Order 17th. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
1631. that no Complaint ſhould be received in <hi>England,</hi> about <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Affairs, until it were firſt made in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Lord Deputy; and that
by Proclamation of the 17th. of <hi>September, 11 Car.</hi> 1. All Perſons that had
Eſtate or Office in <hi>Ireland</hi> (except ſuch as had imployment in his Majeſties
Service in <hi>England,</hi> or attended there by his ſpecial Command) ſhould reſide
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not depart without Licence, whereby People are hindred
from complaining againſt the ſaid Earl; And One <hi>Parry</hi> hath been puniſh'd
for ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>To this he Anſwers, That it was by him and the Council conceived
fit, to prevent unneceſſary Clamours here, but that he never denied
Licence except to the Lords of <hi>Cork, Mountnorris</hi> and <hi>Roch,</hi> becauſe
there were Suits againſt them in the <hi>Caſtlechamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and to Sir <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
Hamilton</hi> by the Kings Command, which was taken off, when he
knew the Deſign of his Voyage was, to complain againſt him, and to
Lord <hi>Eſmond</hi> for a ſhort time, becauſe he was Major General of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65997:320"/>
Army; and he ſaith, that <hi>Parry</hi> was puniſh'd for other Miſdemeanors,
by the Conſent of the whole Council.</p>

                     <hi>That by Proclamation of</hi> May 20. 1639. <hi>he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
a New Oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz.</hi> I <hi>N.</hi> do faithfully ſwear, profeſs, and promiſe,
That I will honor and obey my Sovereign Lord King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> and
will bear Faith and true Allegiance to Him, and will defend and
maintain His Regal Power and Authority; and that I will not bear
Arms, nor do any Rebellious or Hoſtile Act againſt him, or proteſt
againſt any his Royal Commands; but ſubmit my ſelf in all due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
hereunto: And that I will not enter into any Covenant, Oath,
or Bond of mutual Defence or Aſſiſtance againſt all ſorts of Perſons
whatſoever, or into any Oath, Covenant, or mutual Defence or Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
againſt any Perſon whatſoever, by force, without His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Sovereign and Regal Authority: And I do renounce all Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
contrary to what I have ſworn and promiſed: So help me God
in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>And that he grievouſly fined thoſe that refuſed to take
it, and particularly,</hi> Henry Stewart <hi>and his Wife were fined</hi> 5000 l. <hi>apiece,
and their two Daughters, and</hi> James Gray, <hi>Three thouſand Pounds apiece,
and impriſon'd them for not paying it, and explain'd the Oath</hi> to oblige
in point of Allegiance to the Ceremonies and Government of the
Church eſtabliſh'd, and to be eſtabliſh'd by His Majeſty's Authority;
<hi>and that he would proſecute</hi> to the Blood <hi>ſuch as ſhould diſobey,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>whereby many were undone, and more fled the Kingdom; and that he ſaid,
If he return'd again,</hi> he would root out Stock and Branch of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this he anſwers, That it was in a dangerous Time, and for the
Security of the Kingdom, and upon their own Petition; and that he
had His Majeſty's Orders for it, dated 16 <hi>January,</hi> 1638. That as to
the Fine of <hi>Stewart, &amp;c.</hi> it was ſetled before it came to his Vote;
ſo that he did but concur with the reſt; and that he did not ſpeak
againſt the <hi>Scotiſh Nation,</hi> but againſt the <hi>Scotch Faction</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Twenty ſecond Article was,</hi> That he procured the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to declare their Aſſiſtance in a War againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and gave Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for Raiſing Eight thouſand Foot, and One thouſand Horſe, which were
moſt Papiſts; and confederated with Sir <hi>George Ratcliff,</hi> to employ that
Army to Invade <hi>England,</hi> and ſubvert the Fundamental Laws and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
Government thereof.</p>
                  <p>To this he anſwers, That he rais'd that Army by His Majeſty's
Order; and denies any other Deſign, than to aſſiſt and ſerve the King
as they ought.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There was alſo ſome mention made about one</hi> Trueman, <hi>who was
executed for a Plot to betray</hi> Carigfergus <hi>to the</hi> Scots; <hi>touching whom,
Sir</hi> John Clotworthy <hi>made this Depoſition:</hi> That <hi>Trueman</hi> was an
<hi>Engliſhman,</hi> that dwelt not far from <hi>Carigfergus,</hi> and one that was ſent
about the Country, but by whom he knows not; but there were vehement Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions,
that he was employ'd to find out thoſe that would engage in Diſcourſe
concerning the <hi>Scotch</hi> Buſineſs: He ſpake with one Captain <hi>Giles,</hi> who
feigned himſelf a great Friend of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, and ſaid, That he
conceived they were greatly diſtreſſed, and wiſhed, That he could uſe Means
whereby they might be eaſed: Hence he diſcourſed with <hi>Trueman,</hi> who was
but a ſilly Fellow, and got from him Words whereby he diſcovered a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, and ſome Diſcourſe about the Caſtle of <hi>Carig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus;</hi>
inſomuch that he got <hi>Trueman</hi>'s Letter to recommend him into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> whither he pretended a Deſire to go, to ſerve under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65997:320"/>
Upon this <hi>Giles</hi> produced the Letter in Evidence againſt him, and
ſo he was condemned and executed. <hi>And this I take to be the Subſtance
of what was offered for or againſt the Earl of</hi> Strafford.</p>
                  <p>On the Eleventh of <hi>May</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament ſat again;<note place="margin">1641.</note> and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels
<hi>John Barry, Taaf, Garret Barry,</hi> and <hi>Porter,</hi> having Orders from
<hi>England</hi> to tranſport Four thouſand of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſome
of the Popiſh Members of the Lower Houſe did urge divers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to hinder that Deſign: As, Firſt, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> might gain
Experience abroad, and return to be evil Inſtruments at home. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
That <hi>Ireland</hi> wanted Men for Husbandry. Thirdly, That
<hi>Spain</hi> was an Hereditary Enemy to <hi>England,</hi> and therefore might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
theſe Men with dangerous Principles; concluding, That they did
not know how ſoon thoſe very Regiments (acquainted with every
Creek in the Kingdom) might be returned on their own Bowels, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
naturally a Love to their Religion, which ſuch an Incendiary as
<hi>Spain</hi> might inflame with the higheſt prejudice. So ſhameleſly did
they cloak their Deſigns' of ſtopping theſe Soldiers to aſſiſt in the
following Rebellion, under theſe Cobweb pretences of <hi>the Publick Good.</hi>
However, their Project ſucceeded to their mind; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Contract with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador for their Tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Soldiers were from time to time delay'd, and <hi>Garret Barry</hi>
and his whole Regiment, and moſt of the reſt, did afterwards joyn in
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Seſſion of Parliament was ſpent by the Papiſts (who were the
moſt numerous Party in the Houſe) in fruitleſs Declarations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
private Petitions, and Votes upon needleſs Queries: Theſe
laſt, together with the Judges Anſwers to them, are to be found at
large,</hi> Burlace Append. 1. &amp; 2. <hi>I ſhall only recite one of them,</hi> viz.
(<hi>Quere</hi> 15.) Whether the iſſuing of <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi> against Burroughs
that anciently and recently ſent Burgeſſes to Parliament, to ſhew Cauſe why
they did ſo, be Legal? And if not, What Puniſhment ought to be inflicted
upon the Occaſioners, Procurers, and Judges of and in ſuch <hi>Quo Warranto's?
To which the Anſwer is,</hi> That the Proceedings in ſuch <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi>
are <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> illegal and void; and the Right of ſending Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
to Parliament, is queſtionable in Parliament only; and the Occaſioners,
Procurer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

as in Parliament ſhall be thought conſonant to Law and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſome Members of this Parliament (who had the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rebellion in their Deſign) did, in order to inform themſelves of
the Quantity of the Stores, Ammunition, and Proviſions, and the Place
where they were depoſited, ſuggeſt, That there was a Plot by ſome
of the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s diſcontented Servants, to deſtroy the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore procured a Committee of both Houſes to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
to ſearch the Rooms under the Place where they ſat; which

Graces and Favours for that Kingdom; particularly, in reference to

and in this ſhort Interval of Parliament, buſied themſelves in framing
ſuch Bills to paſs the next Seſſion, as the Committee had obtain'd His

not ſuſpecting the leaſt Diſturbance from the Papiſts, who were not
under any Perſecution upon the account of Religion, their Clergy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
their Functions as ſafely, and almoſt as publickly, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
They were obliged to the King by the eaſieſt of Governments,
and the Graces and Conceſſions he had lately vouchſafed unto them;
and they were faſtned to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by all the Ties of Intereſt, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Marriage, and (which is more in their eſteem) Goſſipping and
Foſtering: And they were engaged to propagate the Publick Peace,
by their own happy, free, and flouriſhing Condition; for now the
Papiſts, without taking the Oath of Supremacy, freely enjoyed the
Offices of Sheriffs of Counties, Magiſtrates of Corporations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
all this was over-ballanced by their <hi>Bigotry</hi> and <hi>National</hi> Malice,
which opened one of the bloodieſt Scenes that ever was ſeen in the
World.</p>
                  <p>For on <hi>Saturday</hi> the Twenty third of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. (being a Day
dedicated to St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Temple, 16.</note> a fit Patron for ſuch a Villany) broke out a
moſt deſperate and formidable Rebellion, an univerſal Defection, and
general Revolt, wherein not only all the <hi>mere Iriſh,</hi> but almoſt all the
<hi>Old Engliſh</hi> that adher'd to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were openly or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
involved.</p>
                  <p>The Conſpirators pitched upon the Day becauſe it was Market-day
at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and therefore a Concourſe of People would the leſs be
perceived or ſuſpected; and they choſe the time of Year, becauſe
Harveſt was in, and the Half-years Rent generally in the Tenants
Hands, and becauſe the Seaſon of the Year would hinder Relief from
<hi>England</hi> until the next Spring, before which time they hoped to have
effected all their Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>It was a premeditated Rebellion,<note place="margin">Lord Juſtices and Councils Letter.</note> foretold by Sir <hi>Henry Bedingfeild,</hi>
a Roman Catholick of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> before, and ſuſpected by the

                  </p>
                  <p>But (as the Lords Juſtices and Council in their Letter expreſs it)
none of the former Rebellions could parallel this, either in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

                  </p>
                  <p>The Motives to this Conſpiracy were, Firſt, The happy Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
for ſuch a Deſign, whilſt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were embroil'd:
Secondly, The Example of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had reaped Advantage by
their Mutiny; and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> expected as much at leaſt: And, Thirdly,
The Number of able Men ready to enter into this Rebellion, which
they computed to be Two hundred thouſand, or more.</p>
                  <p>But the Pretences for this Rebellion were exceeding weak, and
ſuch as manifeſt, <hi>that they will riſe as often as they get opportunity;</hi> and,
in effect, do upbraid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with Stupidity, that after ſo much
Experience, they ſhould ſuffer them to be in a Condition to Rebel any
more;<note place="margin">Memoirs, 9.</note> and they are briefly theſe. 1. That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a <hi>Conquered</hi> Nation. 2. That the Six Counties in <hi>Ulſter</hi> (eſchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the King) were diſpoſed for the moſt part to <hi>Britiſh.</hi> 3. That
there was a <hi>Rumour,</hi> that Seven Counties more would be ſeiſed by the
King. 4. That the Popiſh Religion was perſecuted in <hi>England,</hi> and
they were <hi>afraid</hi> would be ſo in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Rumors</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> tho' without Cauſe, are by the Popiſh Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
thought ſufficent Juſtifications of an <hi>Iriſh Rebellion;</hi> and the
Author of the <hi>Bleeding Iphigenia</hi> aſſures us,<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> That this War is juſtified
by a Learned Pen; and he wonders it ſhould be called a Rebellion,
<hi>as if</hi> (ſays he) <hi>our taking up Arms for our neceſſary Defence of Lives and
Religion, againſt the Proteſtants, our Fellow-Subjects, were a Rebellion.</hi> He
argues from the Principle of Self-preſervation, and the Law in the
Caſe of Homicide <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> That it is lawful to make War for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Life or Eſtate; and, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> for Religion; and concludes,
That it may be done to prevent a Danger that is foreſeen, (<hi>i. e. ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
or feared):</hi> And that was the Caſe of the Papiſts, ſays he; they
were neceſſarily to be deſtroyed by the Presbyterians, and therefore
they did wiſely to begin firſt.</p>
                  <p>But whoever conſiders the three Antipathies of <hi>Nation, Intereſt,</hi> and
<hi>Religion,</hi> already mentioned, will eaſily find, that the true Deſign of
this Univerſal Rebellion was, 1. To deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> 2. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
their Eſtates: And, 3. To eſtabliſh Popery. And all other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
are without Foundation, and vain.</p>
                  <p>This horrid Conſpiracy was on the Twenty ſecond of <hi>October</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovered
to the Lord Juſtice <hi>Parſons,</hi> by <hi>Owen O Conally</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi>
(but bred a Proteſtant by Sir <hi>John Clotworthy</hi>) and he being drunk,
told his Story ſo odly, and delivered this ſurprizing Information ſo
incoherently, that ſmall regard was had to what he ſaid; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was diſmiſſed, with Directions to make farther Diſcoveries, if

he came again, and confirm'd his former Story: Whereupon ſeveral
of the Conſpirators were that Night apprehended; and tho' <hi>James
Warren</hi> and <hi>Paul Neale</hi> found means to eſcape out of Cuſtody, yet the
Lord <hi>Macguire</hi> (in whoſe Lodgings were found many Hatchets, Skeins,
and Hammers) and <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> were taken, and kept ſafe until their
Execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:65997:323"/>
                     <hi>It was about Five a Clock in the Morning (23d. of</hi> October) <hi>when</hi>
Mac Mahon <hi>was Examined and Confeſſed,</hi> That on that very day, all the
Forts and ſtrong Places in <hi>Ireland</hi> would be taken; that he with the Lord
<hi>Macguire, Hugh Brine,</hi> Captain <hi>Bryan O Neale,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Gentlemen, were come expreſly to ſurprize the Caſtle of <hi>Dablin,</hi> and that
Twenty men out of each County, were to be here to joyn with them; <hi>That
all the Papiſt Lords and Gentlemen in the Kingdom, were engaged in
this Plot,</hi> That what was to be done in other parts of the Country, was ſo
far advanced by that time, as it was impoſſible for the Wit of Man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, that they had him in their Power, and might uſe him as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but he was ſure be ſhould be revenged.</p>
                  <p>And it is obſervable, that <hi>Mac Mahon</hi>'s Fancy was ſo full of the
Bloody Tragedy, which was to be Acted that day, that (during <hi>Owen
O Conallies</hi> Examination) as he walked in <hi>Chicheſter-Hall;</hi> he drew with
Chalk ſeveral poſtures of Men, ſome on Gibbets, and ſome groveling
on the Ground; ſo much was he delighted with what he thought, or
rather knew, would ſoon be the Condition of the miſerable <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it to be omitted, that Sir <hi>William Cole</hi> (upon the Information of
<hi>John Cormuck,</hi> and <hi>Flagharty Mac Hugh,</hi> that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did deſign to
ſeize on the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin;</hi> and murder the Lords Juſtices and

with an Account of that Matter to the Lords Juſtices; but how
they miſ carried is not known, but it is certain, thoſe Letters never
came to hand.</p>
                  <p>On this Firſt day of the Rebellion, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſurprized the Lord
<hi>Blaney</hi>'s Houſe, his Wife and Children, and ſeized the <hi>Newry</hi> and the
Magazine there;<note place="margin">See it <hi>Burlace</hi> 22.</note> wherein were Seventy Barrels of Powder, they alſo

in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> and <hi>Caſtlemonaghan,</hi> and committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to defend themſelves, which were immediately Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and ſent to ſeveral places by Expreſſes; and from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
there was not a day, and ſcarce an hour, wherein the diſmal
Tidings of ſome new Outrage or Barbarity did not arrive.</p>
                  <p>On the 24th. the Alarms and Fears were ſo great at <hi>Dublin,</hi> that
the Caſtle Drawbridge was once let down, and ſome of <hi>the State</hi> went
to the Platform of the Caſtle to view the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, which was
(falſly) ſaid to be approaching.</p>
                  <p>The Lords Juſtices being in this deplorable Condition, did turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to all the Methods of preſerving the Kingdom; which ſo great
a Danger did require, and their ſmall Materials would allow, but tho'
their Induſtry was great, their means were inconſiderable; the whole
ſtanding Army did not exceed Two thouſand ninety ſeven Foot,
and Nine hundred Horſe, Officers included; and theſe were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in Single Troops and Companies, or ſmall Parties, into places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and far diſtant from one another, ſo that ſome of
them were cut off by the Enemy, and more of them (being <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts)
did revolt to the Rebels; however, they did ſend Potents, for
as many as they thought could ſafely March, and particularly for the
Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Troop, which came with himſelf to <hi>Dublin,</hi> on the
Second day of <hi>December;</hi> and they made Sir <hi>Francis Willoughby</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander

                  <p>But the Lords and Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale</hi> were deeper in this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conſpiracy than the Lords Juſtices ſuſpected, and therefore were ſo
far from being wrought upon by theſe Kindneſſes, and the Confidence
the <hi>State</hi> placed in them; that on the contrary from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
they induſtriouſly ſought for Pretences to break out into
Action: Their firſt Eſſay was, on the 27th day of <hi>October,</hi> at which
time they picked a Quarrel at the words <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> in the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
againſt the Rebels, as being Terms ſo General and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive,
that themſelves might ſeem included; and tho' they (being
<hi>Old Engliſh</hi>) had ſcarce a fair Pretence for that Cavil, yet to ſatisfie
them, thoſe words were by a Second Proclamation of the 29th. of
<hi>October</hi> explain'd to extend to none, but ſuch as were in Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>Their Second Attempt was, at the Seſſion of Parliament on the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>November,</hi> where they endeavoured to Palliate the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
and ſmooth and ſoften their Proteſtation againſt it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
at the Shortneſs of the <hi>Seſſion,</hi> whereby they were hindred as
they ſaid of means, to ſuppreſs the Inſurrection.</p>
                  <p>But finding neither of theſe ſufficient, they had afterwards Recourſe
to other as ill grounded Complaints hereafter mentioned, and in the
mean time they excuſed themſelves to the <hi>State,</hi> that they were not
able to raiſe Men according to their Commiſſions of Government, by
which Anſwer, and ſome other Paſſages, the Lord Juſtices perceived,
<hi>That even thoſe of the</hi> Pale <hi>were Tainted with the infection;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they recalled the Arms they had delivered out to them, and by
a great deal of induſtry they recovered about Nine hundred of them,
and the reſt were treacherouſly made uſe of againſt the State, that had
too credulouſly truſted the Roman Catholicks with them at ſo critical
a Juncture.</p>
                  <p>

In this extremity and want of all things, eſpecially Money, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
was made to the Corporation of <hi>Dublin;</hi> but that famous
City, (the Metropolis of the Kingdom) would not advance more than
Fifty Pounds, tho' upon ſo great an Emergency; whereby the <hi>State</hi>
was convinc'd, that the Rebellion was Univerſal, and that even thoſe
(the Citizens) that did not dare to appear openly in it, were yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
Well-wiſhers to the Cauſe, and in their Hearts devoted to the
Perſons and Deſigns of the Rebels. And this was the more manifeſt,
becauſe the Popiſh Citizens did rarely, if at all, adminiſter any the
leaſt Comfort to the poor and plunder'd <hi>Engliſh;</hi> inſomuch that the
Proteſtants periſhed in ſuch Multitudes at <hi>Dublin,</hi> that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
being full of Graves, the Lords Juſtices were fain to provide
two large Pieces of Ground, for new Burying-places for them.</p>
                  <p>The Lords Juſtices, by their Proclamation of the Twenty ſeventh
of <hi>October,</hi> cauſed <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term to be adjourned, and ſent Four
hundred Muſquets by Sea to the Lords Viſcounts of <hi>Clandeboys</hi> and
<hi>Ardes;</hi> and alſo ſent Commiſſions to them to raiſe the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>to
receive Submitting Rebels to Mercy;</hi> and they alſo wrote to the Lords
Preſident of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Connaught</hi> to be on their Defence.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe of the great Concourſe to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the danger that
City was in, upon the Complaint of the Magiſtrates thereof, all
Strangers were commanded by Proclamation to depart the City, upon
pain of Death; but no body was puniſhed for diſobeying that Order,
altho' there was a ſecond Proclamation againſt the Harbourers of ſuch
Strangers.</p>
                  <p>But how general ſoever this Rebellion was, and how cruel ſoever
the Authors of it were,<note place="margin">Vid. Appendix, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>altho' the very Women and Children were active
in ſtripping and murdering the diſtreſſed Engliſh;</hi> yet the Execution
could not be ſo great, nor with ſo little Loſs to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were wheedled to put a Confidence in their <hi>Iriſh</hi> Landlords,
Tenants, Servants, and Neighbors, with whom they had lived kindly,
and to whom they had given no manner of Provocation; and ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the proper Means of defending themſelves, they were miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
betrayed, and perfidiouſly deſtroyed, by thoſe they truſted; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eſteemed a Mortal Sin amongſt moſt of the Rebels, to relieve or
protect a Heretick.</p>
                  <p>But in ſome places the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to conſiderable Numbers, were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied
together; and being in a condition to make ſome Reſiſtance,
were promiſed Quarter, and good Articles, upon Oath: But as ſoon
as they ſubmitted, they were alſo treacherouſly murdered: And thus
they were ſerved at <hi>Loughell,</hi>

                     <hi>Sligo,</hi> and many other Places.</p>
                  <p>At firſt the Rebels did pretend to ſpare the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to make a
Difference between them (whom they profeſſed a Kindneſs for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were Strangers, and their Religion likewiſe perſecuted by
the parliament) and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> againſt whom they expreſſed a moſt
bitter and inveterate Hatred; and to diſguiſe their Deſigns, they did
actually Forbear them for about ten days, till the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
and then they fell upon the <hi>Scots</hi> alſo, and made no farther
diſtinction between <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Firſt of <hi>November</hi> the Proteſtants had very little left in
<hi>Ulſter,</hi> except <hi>Londonderry, Colerain,</hi> and <hi>Iniskilling,</hi> and half the County
of <hi>Down,</hi> and part of the County of <hi>Antrim,</hi> which the Government
was in an ill Condition to provide for or relieve, and had no hopes
of retrieving that part of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> which was loſt, and ſo deeply drench'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65997:325"/>
in innocent Blood, otherwiſe than by Force of Arms; but as to the
Counties of <hi>Meath, Weſt-Meath, Longford,</hi> and <hi>Louth,</hi> which were not
yet ſo deeply plung'd in Robberies and Murthers, the Lords Juſtices
had hopes of their Submiſſion, and therefore did iſſue their Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Pardon to all that would ſubmit within Ten days, Freeholders
and Murderers only excepted.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt theſe things were doing, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Firſt of <hi>November,</hi>
the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> voted a Supply of Fifty thouſand Pounds
for the Relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that all the Papiſts of Quality in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
be ſecured, and that none except Merchants ſhall paſs to <hi>Ireland</hi>
without a Certificate, and <hi>that a Pardon be offered to the Iriſh Rebels,</hi>
and that <hi>Owen O Conally,</hi> the Diſcoverer of the Plot, ſhould have Five
hundred Pounds in Money, and Lands worth Two hundred Pounds
<hi>per Annum,</hi> ſetled upon him: And this Order was, 12 <hi>November,</hi> print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and diſperſed all over the Kingdom, but without any
Effect.</p>
                  <p>For now the Rebels were elevated, and had formed a Deſign againſt
<hi>Tredagh,</hi> whereof Doctor <hi>Jones</hi> (afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi>) gave
timely notice, ſo that it was prevented; for tho' the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> had
made a ſeaſonable Entry into that Town nevertheleſs the Inclination
of the Townſmen, and of Sir <hi>John Nettervill,</hi> (who had a Foot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
there in the King's Pay) being manifeſtly favourable to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
the Place was not ſafe without a ſtronger Gariſon: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn,</hi> with a Regiment of Foot and two Troops of
Horſe, was ſent from <hi>Dublin</hi> the third day of <hi>November,</hi> and came ſafe
to <hi>Tredagh</hi> the next day.</p>
                  <p>On the Fourth of <hi>November</hi> Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi> and <hi>Rory Macguire,</hi>
from their Camp at <hi>Newry,</hi> publiſhed, That they had a Commiſſion
from the King, under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> for this Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And one <hi>Hariſon</hi> having taken the Seal from an old Patent of the
Lord <hi>Cawfeild</hi>'s at <hi>Charlemont,</hi> and fixed it to a forged Commiſſion,
they ſent atteſted Copies of it in Letters to their Confederates,
thereby blacking their Inſurrection with the worſt of Circumſtances,
<hi>viz.</hi> by laying it to the Charge of His Majeſty, who upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
expreſſed his Deteſtation of it; and by this means they raiſed
more Enemies to the King, and created more Jealouſies in the Minds
of His Proteſtant Subjects, and gave more Colour and Umbrage for
the Suſpicions that were then entertained of Him, than any other
Action of that Time could do: And indeed this ſingle Act of theirs
did His Majeſty more miſchief, than all the pretended Loyalty of that
Party ſince that time can atone for. However, to obviate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Effects of that impudent Forgery as much as they could, the
Lords Juſtices did,<note place="margin">Burlace, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. 3.</note> by their Proclamation of the Thirtieth of <hi>October,</hi>

                  <p>And it is very obſervable, That this Contrivance of theirs, from
whence they hoped to derive ſo much Advantage, was the Occaſion
of their Ruin; for the King, to vindicate himſelf from this groſs
Aſperſion, was neceſſitated to devolve the Management of the War
upon the Parliament, and to conſent to the Act of Adventurers,

                  <p>In the mean time the Lords Juſtices and Council did all that was
poſſible for the Preſervation of the Kingdom: They on the Fifth of
<hi>November</hi> diſpatched a ſecond Expreſs to the King, and another to
the Lords of the Council; and then (and not before) wrote to both
Houſes of Parliament, and ſent a Duplicate of it to the King; and
they formed a thouſand of the ſtripped <hi>Engliſh</hi> into a Regiment,
under Sir <hi>Charles Coot;</hi> and ſoon after, they raiſed two Regiments
more, under the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> and Colonel <hi>Crawford.</hi> They alſo
took care to Victual the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to clear an old Well
that was in it, and to do all things neceſſary to fit it for a Siege. And
to prevent any Surprize that might happen, by the great Concourſe of
People to the Caſtle, they removed the Council to <hi>Cork-houſe,</hi> and
often ſat there in Council; which was a great Overſight, and might
have been Fatal to them, if the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> (who ſoon after
went out into open Rebellion) had had the Courage to ſeiſe upon
them there, as they eaſily might have done.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the Sixth of <hi>November, Philip O Rely,</hi> Knight of the

County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> except the Caſtles of <hi>Keighlah</hi> and <hi>Croghan,</hi> which

                  </p>
                  <p>On the Eleventh of <hi>November</hi> the Lords Juſtices publiſhed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proclamation, prohibiting all unneceſſary Perſons from repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Dublin;</hi> which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> took very ill, and made a great noiſe
about it, tho' no Perſon of Quality or Buſineſs was in the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by that Proclamation: But their Deſign was <hi>to pick Quarrels,</hi>
and to manage all Accidents to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>On the Twelfth of <hi>November</hi> the County of <hi>Wickloe</hi> appeared in
its proper Colours; they murdered or robbed all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
within that County, and burnt the principal Houſes, and laid
Siege to <hi>Fort-Carew,</hi> which the Lords Juſtices had not Means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
The Counties of <hi>Letrim, Longford, Weſt-Meath,</hi> and <hi>Louth</hi> were
already infected: and <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Caterlogh</hi> followed the bloody Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of their Neighbours; and even the County of <hi>Kildare</hi> it ſelf
began to put on a terrible Countenance; and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> of the <hi>Pale</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten Arms from their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Neighbors, under pretence of

                  <p>The Lords Juſtices had by Proclamation Prorogued the Parliament
to the Twenty fourth of <hi>February;</hi> but at the Importunity of ſome
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Lawyers, who pretended great Affection to the King, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Deſires to quench the Rebellion, the Parliament (which was a
very thin one) was permitted to meet on the Sixteenth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi>
and then it was viſible, that more were tainted with the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
than appeared openly in Rebellion; for the Popiſh Members
did, with great Cunning and Artifice, endeavour to varniſh or excuſe
all the Actions and Cruelties of the Rebels; and thoſe who ſeemed
moſt to diſcountenance the Inſurrection, did nevertheleſs cover it over
with ſuch a Veil, treat of it ſo nicely, and handle it with ſo much
tenderneſs, as if themſelves (moſt of them being of the Conſpiracy)
were immediately to participate of the Puniſhment, as well as they
were clandeſtinely involved in the Plot: They would by do means
have them called <hi>Traytors</hi> or <hi>Rebels,</hi> but adviſed rather to uſe the ſoft
Expreſſion of <hi>DISCONTENTED GENTLEMEN:</hi> But the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
ſcorning to be put upon ſo, one of them expreſs'd himſelf ſo
briskly and ſo judiciouſly, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> finding they could not get a
better, agreed, with much ado, to the Proteſtation againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
recited here, <hi>Append.</hi> 12. And ſo having ſate two days, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was Prorogued to the Eleventh of <hi>January,</hi> having firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Committee of Both Houſes to Treat with the Rebels, and
a Commiſſion iſſued accordingly; but the Traytors were ſo pufft up
with their innumerable Victories over the naked and unreſiſting <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
that they tore the Order of Parliament, and the Letter that was ſent
them,</hi> and refuſed to Treat.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> of <hi>Coſtilo</hi> (who, ſince the Rebellion broke out,
was by His Majeſty's former Orders ſworn Privy Counſellor) was
deputed by the Popiſh Lords to attend the King; and the Lord <hi>Taaf</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Burk</hi> went with him; but before he Embarked, he preſented
the Lords Juſtices and Council a ſcandalous Letter,<note place="margin">See it <hi>Append.</hi> 3.</note> in nature of a

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65997:326"/>
demand Freedom of Religion, and a Repeal of all Laws contrary
thereunto: And this produced the Vote of the Eighth of <hi>December,</hi> in

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Agents hapned to be intercepted by the Parliament, and
impriſon'd; and their Papers being rifled, it was found to be one of
the Private Inſtructions to the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> to move, That no Forces
might be ſent over to <hi>Ireland, but that it might be left to the Remonſtrants
to ſuppreſs the Rebellion:</hi>

                  <p>But what regard theſe Lords had to His Majeſty's Service, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by their vain Expreſſions in a Letter to the Lord <hi>Muskery, Anno</hi>

Affairs, to give him Publick Countenance; yet that the King was well
pleas'd with what he did, and would in time give him Thanks for it.</hi>
Which being dſcovered to the Parliament, by Mr. <hi>Jepſon,</hi> a Member
of that Houſe, begat ſtrange Jealouſies of His Majeſty's Proceedings
then, tho' now it is manifeſt; thoſe Expreſſions related to the Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

abhorr'd.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the King ſent ſome Arms from <hi>Scotland,</hi> to Sir

                  <p>On the Twentieth day of <hi>November</hi> the Lords Juſtices wrote

his Victorious Rabble of Four thouſand Men to <hi>Liſnegarvy,</hi> and on the

                  <p>Another Party of the Rebels ſat down before <hi>Melifont, Novemb.</hi> 24.
and found a brisk Defence from the Gariſon, being Fifteen Horſe and
Twenty four Muſquetiers; but their Powder being ſpent, the Horſemen
forced their Way through the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Camp to <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and the Foot ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred

therefore on the Twenty ſeventh day of <hi>November</hi> the Lords Juſtices
ſent Six hundred new-rais'd Foot, and a Troop of Horſe, to reinforce
the Gariſon there; but the Lord <hi>Gormanſton</hi>'s Groom (by his Maſters
privity) gave notice of their March to the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> who being three

Twenty ninth of <hi>November,</hi> and by the Folly or Treachery of a

Captain that commanded a Countermarch, and the Unexperience of
the Men, they were diſordered, and above Five hundred of them
ſlain; at which the Popiſh Inhabitants of <hi>Dublin</hi> did very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> did thereupon take off their Vizard.</p>
                  <p>But much better Succeſs had Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> who marched from <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin</hi>
the ſame 27th. of <hi>November,</hi> to relieve the Caſtle of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> and
to quel the inſolence of thoſe Rebels, that had come in Hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
within two miles of the City; for on the 29th. of the ſame Month
he beat <hi>Luke Toole,</hi> and One thouſand Rebels, and put them to a
ſhameful Flight, and thereby became ſo terrible to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that they
ſeldom afterwards made any reſiſtance, where he was.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſo elevated by the Victory at <hi>Gellingſtown-bridge;</hi>
and the delay of Succours from <hi>England,</hi> that the Lords of the

Tenants and Servants were openly or&amp; ſecretly concern'd in it from
the beginning, and they themſelves had hitherto looked on, whilſt
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were robbed, and had given no help or Aſſiſtance to the

                     <note place="margin">2 Temple 18.</note> believing it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to diſſemble the Matter much longer, began to unmask them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

<hi>Mac Mahon, Philip O Rely, Roger Moor,</hi> &amp;c. came to them with a
Guard of Musketeers; whereupon the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> rode towards
them, and (as formally as the Lord Mayor expoſtulates with the Privy
Council at <hi>Temple-Bar</hi>) demanded of them, why they came Armed into
the <hi>Pale:</hi> They reply'd, <hi>That they took up Arms for Liberty of Conſcience,
and maintaining of his Majeſties Prerogative,</hi> in which they underſtood he
was abridged, and to make the Subjects of this Kingdom, as <hi>Free</hi> as
Thoſe of <hi>England</hi> were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But, ſays the Lord</hi> Gormanſtown, Are not theſe Pretences, and not indeed
the true Grounds of your taking Arms, and have you not ſome private ends of
your own? <hi>To which they anſwered,</hi> That they had no private ends, but did
it upon the aforeſaid Reaſons, and profeſſed great Sincerity to his Lordſhip;
<hi>whereupon he told them,</hi> That ſeeing thoſe were the true ends of their
Inſurrection, he and all the reſt would joyn with them, and immediately it was
proclaimed, that whoſever denied to joyn with them, or refuſed to aſſiſt them
therein, they would Account him an Enemy, and to the utmoſt of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
labour his Deſtruction, <hi>and thus</hi> Valence <hi>and</hi> Brabant <hi>were joyned (as
Sir</hi> Philemy O Neal <hi>phraſed it) and the Lords of the</hi> Pale <hi>Confederated
with their ancient and hereditary Enemies, and became ſo barbarouſly
Cruel, that they bragged afterwards,</hi> That they had killed more Proteſtants
in <hi>Fingall</hi> only, than were Slain in ſome other whole Counties.</p>
                  <p>But on the Third of <hi>December,</hi> the Lords Juſtices and Council diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
their knowledge of theſe Tranſactions, wrote to the Lords
of the <hi>Pale</hi> to come to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and conſult for the ſafety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
whereupon the Lords of <hi>Kildare-Merion</hi> and <hi>Hoath</hi> came, but
the other Lords had another meeting at the Hill of <hi>Taragh,</hi> on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth

                  <p>In like manner, <hi>Luke Nettervill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> upon
three days Summons, aſſembled Twelve hundred armed Men at
<hi>Swords,</hi> within Six Miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and arrayed them under the
Captains <hi>Golding, Ruſſell, Travers, Holywood, &amp;c.</hi> which would have
been impoſſible to have done on ſo ſhort warning, if they had not
been privy to the Conſpiracy long before, and had not made Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for it.</p>
                  <p>The Lords Juſtices ſent a Meſſage to them ro diſperſe; but they
return'd for Anſwer, That they were conſtrain'd to aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the ſafety of their Lives; that they were ſo terrified by
the Excurſions of ſome Horſe and Foot from <hi>Dublin,</hi> that murder'd
Foor Catholicks, merely for being ſo, that they durſt not ſtay at
home, and therefore reſolved to continue together for their mutual
Preſervation until they ſhould be aſſured by their Lordſhip of the
ſafety of their Lives.</p>
                  <p>But theſe were but Pretences to palliate their Inſurrection, and to
inſinuate a Neceſſity of the Rebellion they had entred into; and
therefore the Lords Juſtices did endeavor in vain, by two Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Thirteenth of <hi>December,</hi> to remove theſe Jealouſies, and
ſatisfie or anſwer the Objections, altho' in one of them they aſſured
<hi>Nettervill</hi> and his Comragues of free egreſs and regreſs,<note place="margin">2 Temple, 29.</note> and that the
Four that were killed were in actual Hoſtility, and one of them was
a Proteſtant; and in the other they declar'd, That neither Sir
<hi>Charles Coot,</hi> nor any other, did ever utter at the Council-board, or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65997:329"/>
elſewhere, any Speeches tending to a Purpoſe or Reſolution to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
on the Papiſts, or any other, a general Maſſacre; nor was it
ever in their thoughts, to diſhonor His Majeſty or the <hi>State</hi> by ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
impious, and deteſtable a thing; and gave the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi>
aſſurance of their Safety, if they would repair to <hi>Dublin</hi> the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of that Month. But all theſe Condeſcenſions had no good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
on the contrary, theſe Favours were interpreted to proceed
from the weakneſs of the <hi>State,</hi> and conſequently tended to heighten
the Inſolencies of the Rebels.</p>
                  <p>For that very day after the Proclamations were publiſhed, ſome of
<hi>Netervill</hi>'s Party ſeiſed a Boat in the Harbor of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Temple, 27.</note> and robbed it,
and put the Pillage into Mr. <hi>King</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Clontarfe,</hi> and threatned
to encamp at <hi>Clontarfe,</hi> which is but two ſmall Miles from <hi>Dublin.</hi>
Whereupon, the next day, being the Fourteenth of <hi>December,</hi> the
Lieutenant-General was ordered to ſend out a Party to <hi>Clontarfe</hi> to
remove them, which Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> on the Fifteenth of <hi>December</hi>
performed effectually, without any Oppoſition, and burned the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
and Mr. <hi>King</hi>'s Houſe.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> ſlighted the aforeſaid Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
and on the Sixteenth day of <hi>December</hi> proceeded to appoint
General Officers, and declared the Lord <hi>Gormanſtown</hi> General of the
<hi>Pale, Hugh Birne</hi> Lieutenant-General, the Earl of <hi>Fingall</hi> General of
the Horſe, and gave ſuch Order about raiſing Men and Proviſions, as
they thought convenient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nettervill</hi> and his Party being reinforced from <hi>Kildare</hi> and <hi>Wicklow,</hi>
continued at <hi>Finglas</hi> and <hi>Santry</hi> from the Fifteenth of <hi>December</hi> to the
Twenty ſecond, at which time Colonel <hi>Crawford</hi> drove them from
<hi>Finglas</hi> with much ado, and the very Name and Approach of Sir
<hi>Charles Coot</hi> frightned them from <hi>Santry</hi> in ſuch haſte, that they left a
great deal of their Equipage and Proviſions behind them: And yet
at the ſame time Three hundred Rebels appear'd again at <hi>Clantarf,</hi>
and had the day before robb'd two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Barks in the Harbor,
and carried the Booty to <hi>Barnwall</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Brimore,</hi> and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
to the Lord <hi>Gormanſtown</hi>'s Houſe, whence they were ſent to
<hi>Balruthery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Dublin</hi> was in a manner blockt up: <hi>Naas, Kildare, Trim,</hi>
and <hi>Aſhboy</hi> were in the Rebels Hands, and the City was almoſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soldiers. <hi>Nettervill</hi> lying at <hi>Swords</hi> with Two
thouſand Men, took the Caſtle of <hi>Artain,</hi> within two Miles of <hi>Dublin;</hi>
and Colonel <hi>Roger Moor</hi> lay at <hi>Rathcool</hi> with Two thouſand more;
and Four thouſand of the County of <hi>Wicklow</hi> came within four Miles
of <hi>Dublin</hi> on that ſide; ſo that the Government could give no Relief
to the Diſtreſſed Proteſtants, who were coopt up in ſeveral Caſtles,
and made piteous Complaints: And therefore the <hi>State</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to ſuffer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of the Inland Counties to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,
and all the Walled Towns in the Kingdom (<hi>Tredagh</hi> and
<hi>Carigfergus,</hi> and the Walled Towns of the Counties of <hi>London-derry</hi>
and <hi>Cork,</hi> only excepted) to be reduced under the Power of the
Rebels; who, in imitation of the <hi>Holy League</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> ſtyled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>THE CATHOLICK ARMY,</hi> and took the following Oath of
Aſſociation, framed by the Clergy; ſo that all the Government could
do was, to write a mournful Letter to the Lord Lieutenant, which is
to be found 2 <hi>Temple</hi> 39. and is very well worth peruſal, but too long
to be here inſerted.</p>

                  <p>In the mean time, a Foot Company of the Standing Army (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Lexlip,</hi> a Papiſt) revolted entirely to the Rebels,
and ſo many diſguiſed Papiſts revolted from the Army, which was
full of them, that in ſome Companies there were not above ſeven or
eight Men left, which manifeſts, the Conſpiracy was <hi>general,</hi> when Men
ſo circumſtanced ſhould betray their Truſt; and leaves a neceſſary
Caution to Poſterity, <hi>not to truſt any more of that Kidney in ſuch Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
However, the Gariſon of <hi>Tredagh</hi> was not diſcouraged by this
Accident, but on the third of <hi>October</hi> made a ſucceſsful Sally, to the
ſlaughter of Two hundred Rebels.</p>
                  <p>But on the firſt of <hi>January</hi> the King declared the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to be Rebels,
by Proclamation, <hi>Appendix</hi> 13. and ſigned Forty of them (being the
Number deſir'd by the Lords Juſtices and Council) with his own
Hand, and affixed his Privy Signet unto them; and they were brought
to <hi>Dublin</hi> on the twentieth of <hi>January,</hi> and publiſhed, without any
effect.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Lords Juſtices, on the twenty eighth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
iſſued a Proclamation, to prohibit Strangers from flocking to
<hi>Dublin</hi> without Licenſe; and another, ordering the Country People
to bring in their Corn to Market, or elſe that their Haggards ſhould
be put under Military Execution; by which means the Market was
pretty well ſupplied: And on the laſt day of <hi>December,</hi> Sir <hi>Symon Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi>

at <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>

4. The Titles of</hi> Rebels <hi>and</hi> Traitors <hi>ſhould be taken off the File by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</hi>
But theſe Terms were too diſhonorable, and therefore were
rejected. Nevertheleſs, ſome Popiſh Prieſts, that pretended to more
Moderation and Humanity than the reſt, were permitted to Treat
with the Rebels, and Doctor <hi>Cale</hi> obtain'd a Commiſſion from the
<hi>State</hi> to do ſo, and promis'd great Succeſs of his Negotiation: But
the Rebels were elevated with their Fortune, inſomuch that Sir <hi>Philemy
O Neal</hi> refuſed to Treat, unleſs <hi>Macgulre</hi> and <hi>Macmahon</hi> were ſet at
Liberty; and ſo that Affair determined.</p>
                  <p>And now Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt</hi> being made Governor of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Sir
<hi>Charles Coot</hi> on the Tenth of <hi>January</hi> was ſent abroad to remove the
Enemy from <hi>Swords,</hi> a Village Six Miles from the City. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> had

forced the Paſſage, and routed the Party, with the ſlaughter of Two
hundred of them, and returned to <hi>Dublin</hi> with little or no Loſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that of Sir <hi>Lorenzo Cary,</hi> who was killed in this Action.</p>
                  <p>On the Eleventh of <hi>January</hi> the Parliament was by Proclamation
prorogued to the Twenty firſt of <hi>June,</hi> 1642. But the Speakers decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

which the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> framed a falſe and ſcandalous Proteſtation.</p>
                  <p>But it is time to return to <hi>Tredagh,</hi> which, by the importunity of
thoſe of the <hi>Pale,</hi> was become the Rebels chief Aim, and, next to
<hi>Dublin,</hi> the chief Care of the <hi>State.</hi> It was the principal Scene of
Action during the Months of <hi>December, January,</hi> and <hi>February;</hi> and
therefore I have preſerved the Relation of that Siege intire, without
mixing it with other Affairs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tredagh,</hi> in <hi>Iriſh, Drogheda;</hi> in <hi>Latin, Pontana,</hi> is an ancient Walled
Town, ſituate on both ſides the River <hi>Boyne,</hi> and united by a Stone
Bridge, from which the Town derives its Name. It is about two
Miles in Circuit, and about three Miles diſtant from the Sea. It had
neither Bulwark nor Rampire, nor any other Fortification than an
ordinary Ditch, and the old Wall. The Haven is not good, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65997:331"/>
being very narrow and difficult, by reaſon of a Bar in the
Mouth of the Harbor, which is not paſſable but at Full Sea, and then
(eſpecially on Spring-tides) a Ship of Sixty Tuns may ſail to the Key
of <hi>Tredagh.</hi> Finally, This Town is Governed by a Mayor, Aldermen,
and Sheriffs, and is a County of it ſelf, and ſtands in a plain, open,
fruitful, and Champion Country.</p>
                  <p>To this Town came the Lord <hi>Moor,</hi> with his Troop of Horſe,
from his Houſe at <hi>Mellefont,</hi> upon the firſt notice of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
even on the Twenty third of <hi>October,</hi> about Midnight; and
being alarm'd by the diſmal Stories of ſome which had eſcaped the
Cruelties of the Rebels, he cauſed the Mayor and Aldermen to be
awakened, and excited them to a ſpeedy and vigorous Preparation
for their Defence: <hi>They promiſed fairly,</hi> but <hi>acted ſlowly;</hi> inſomuch
that altho' many hundreds of the Townſmen well armed uſed to
appear on Muſter-days, yet now they could not get above Forty Men
together, and thoſe but very ill armed; but afterwards the Number
encreaſed to Two hundred.</p>
                  <p>However, this Noble Lord was not diſcouraged, but having got
ſome old Guns out of a Dungeon, and Four more and ſome Powder,
out of a Ship in the Harbor, he ſcowred the Ditch, and repaired the
Walls, and mounted his Artillery, and reviewed Captain <hi>Nettervill</hi>'s
and Captain <hi>Rockby</hi>'s half Companies, each conſiſting of Forty four
Men of the Standing Army, and did every thing elſe in his power
that was neceſſary for the Defence of the Place.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, finding that all this would not do without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Succour, he went to <hi>Dublin</hi> in a dark Night, and effectually
repreſented to the Government the Weakneſs and Importance of
<hi>Drogheda,</hi> and offered to augment his own Troop of Sixty to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and to raiſe a hundred Foot at his own Charge.</p>
                  <p>But what he obtained, was a Promiſe, <hi>That Succours ſhould be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
ſent:</hi> And in the mean time Captain <hi>Seafoul Gibſon</hi> had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and Arms for a hundred and twenty Men, which he raiſed
in <hi>Tredagh</hi> in two Hours time, and that very Night they were ſet
on the Watch, and were kept to ſo hard Duty, that this Captain
and the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> did watch Ten Nights together in their own
Perſons; which was the more troubleſom to them, becauſe they were
frequently on every day (eſpecially at Church-time) diſturb'd with
Alarms, purpoſely made by the Popiſh Inhabitants to diſtract them.</p>
                  <p>And altho' the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> had the good Succeſs in ſeveral Sallies
and Excurſions to kill Two hundred of the Rebels, and to take Eighty
Priſoners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof Six only were hang'd; yet the Popiſh Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(finding that no Supply was come to the Town, nor, as they
thought, likely to come, and that, on the contrary, the Rebels had
taken <hi>Dundalk</hi> and <hi>Dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>miskin</hi>) formed ſeveral Contrivances to give
up the Town. One Night when they deſign'd it, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by a Rumour, That the Proteſtants had re-taken <hi>Newry;</hi> and
another Night, Captain <hi>Nattervill</hi> (who had form'd his half Company
to his mind, and was in the Plot with the Popiſh Inhabitants) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to quarrel with the Lord <hi>Moor,</hi> and to commend the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and to
affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap>hey were not Rebels,</hi> purpoſely to begin a Commotion; but
the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> by his Patience wiſely baulked the others Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by ſecret Orders got all his Men in readineſs, and thereby
prevented the Execution of their Treachery for that time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:65997:331"/>
But on the Fourth of <hi>November</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Titchburne,</hi> the new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
with his Regiment of 1000 men, arrived at <hi>Tredagh;</hi> and
there came with them Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>Adam Loftus</hi>'s Troops
of Horſe; but they were ſo coldly received by the Popiſh Inhabitants,
that the Governor waited in the Streets from two of the Clock till nine,
before he could get a Lodging, and even then was fain to take one by
his own Authority. Whereby, and by their former Carriage, the
Townſmen became ſo ſuſpected, that the Governor would not truſt
them with the Watch, but drew out 300 of his wearied Soldiers to
keep Guard that night.</p>
                  <p>The next day, being the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> the new Governor took
a diligent View of the Fortifications, and cauſed four Pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to be mounted on the <hi>Mill-mount;</hi> and on the Tenth he received
three new Companies of Foot, under the Captains, <hi>Bryan, Trevor,</hi> and
<hi>Martin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Moor</hi> made another Journey to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to be preſent at
the Parliament, which ſat the Sixteenth of <hi>November,</hi> and generouſly
offered to raiſe and cloath 600 Men, to make the four Independent
Companies at <hi>Tredagh</hi> a compleat Regiment, but it was not accepted;
and inſtead of that, a Recruit was ſent from <hi>Dublin,</hi> which was beaten
at <hi>Gellinſton-Bridge</hi> the Twenty ninth of <hi>November,</hi> as hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mentioned, ſo that only 100 Foot, and half of the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s
Troop of Horſe, under the Command of Sir <hi>Patrick Weymes,</hi> Major
<hi>Roper,</hi> and the Captains <hi>Cadowgan</hi> and <hi>Sounſly,</hi> arrived at <hi>Tredagh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>O Reyly,</hi> having taken <hi>Kells, Ardbrackan,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi>
advanced to <hi>Platten,</hi> to which place <hi>Darcy</hi> had invited ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Officers of <hi>Tredagh</hi> to Dinner, and if they had gone they had
been finely entrapped; but tho' they miſt of that, yet being fledg'd
with the Victory at <hi>Gellingſton-Bridge,</hi> and well ſupplied with the Arms,
Ammunition, and Money they got there, they reſolved to Beſiege
<hi>Tredagh;</hi> and they were farther encouraged to it by their Surprize of
a Bark from <hi>Cheſter</hi> with Ammunition and Arms, which purpoſely ran
aground at the <hi>Skirryes</hi> by the Treachery of ſome that were in her.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, on the laſt Day of <hi>November,</hi> the Rebels, to the number of
14000, ſat down before <hi>Tredagh</hi> on both ſides of the Town, and blocked
up the River, ſo that there could be no farther Correſpondence with
it by Sea or Land. On the Third of <hi>December</hi> happened the firſt Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
for 350 Foot and two Troops of Horſe being ſent out to convey
ſome Carriages from <hi>Greenhills,</hi> notice thereof was given to the Rebels
by ſome of the Town; whereupon above 2000 of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> by means
of a Fog, fell upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> before they were deſcried, and that with
ſo great a Shout as proclaimed their Number to be very great: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſome of the Popiſh Troopers that were in the Rear, either through
Cowardize or Treachery, ran back to the Town with the bad News
of being defeated; whereupon the Carriages, that were juſt come to
the Gate, preſſed in for haſte, and ſtopt up the Gate, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
a great Confuſion; but the valiant Governor, not at all diſmaid,
alighted from his Horſe, and led on the Foot, and having commanded
the Musketeers up the Hill, he ordered the Pikes, in that narrow Paſſage
of the Lane, to open for the Horſe, and ſo charged the Rebels briskly,
and immediately forced them to run; and having purſued them for
a Mile, and ſlain 200 of them, he returned victoriouſly to his Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:65997:332"/>
It would be incredible that the Rebels ſhould charge the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
twice, as they did, and yet not kill one man of them, if the like had
not hapned very lately at <hi>Liſniskeagh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This prodigious Victory animated the Proteſtants exceedingly, and
diſcouraged the others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as much. Nevertheleſs ſeveral Popiſh Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of the Gariſon, daily deſerted: And Captain <hi>Darcy,</hi> and a Fryer
of the ſame Name, were ſent by the Confederates to demand the Town
<hi>For His Majeſties Uſe and Service;</hi> but were Anſwered, <hi>That it was by
His Majeſties Command and Commiſſion they held it;</hi> and ſoon after, the
better to engage the Gariſon and Inhabitants, and to ſecure their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
the Governor deviſed an Oath, <hi>To Defend the Town until it ſhould
be ſurrendred by the Conſent of the Governor, Mayor, and major part of the
Captains and Aldermen, without ſpecial Command of the King or the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
But the Mayor and Aldermen flatly refuſed the Oath; and ſome
others that did take it, did afterwards moſt perfidiouſly break it.</p>
                  <p>But on the Twenty firſt of <hi>December</hi> at night, the Rebels (upon a
Watch-word, or rather Notice from ſome of the Popiſh Inhabitants in
the Town) approached the Walls with a terrible Shout; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
commanded all the Townſmen to keep their Houſes, on pain
of Death, whereby the Rebels were diſappointed of that Aſſiſtance
they expected in the Town, and were beaten off with conſiderable
Loſs.</p>
                  <p>But this did not hinder the treacherous Inhabitants from proceeding
in their Conſpiracies.<note place="margin">Burlace, 62.</note> Some of them had formed a clandeſtine Oath
to ſeize on the Soldiers Arms, and kill them in their Beds; but that
bloody Project was diſcovered <hi>by a Prieſt,</hi> and ſo prevented.</p>
                  <p>On the Seventh of <hi>January</hi> part of the Gariſon made a Sally, and
ſlew a hundred and drowned another hundred of the Rebels, and took
ſome Arms, Cows, and other Booty, to the value of 100 <hi>l.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
the Gariſon continued more preſſed by Famine than by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
when in the midſt of their publick Devotion on the Eleventh of
<hi>January</hi> a Pinnace, a Frigat, a Gabbard, and two Shallops and another
Veſſel, with Supplies of Ammunition, Bisket, Victuals, and Money,
arrived in the Harbour: The Popiſh Townsmen conceived they were
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and could not conceal their Joy, till it was turned into Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
upon the diſcovery that they were <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs this Supply had like to occaſion the loſs of the Town;
for the Soldiers had, notwithſtanding the Governor's Caution, carouz'd
too liberally, being enticed by the Friers and other Papiſts, (in ſhew
of Kindneſs) to drink to Exceſs, ſo that the Gariſon were really <hi>Vino

They made a Breach in the Wall in an obſcure place, and entred
with above 500 Men, and marched as far as the <hi>Key</hi> undiſcovered;
and then, thinking the Town was their own, they made a great Shout;
whereat the Governor, unarm'd, with his Piſtols only in his hand, ran
down Stairs, and was the firſt that cauſed a Drum to beat, and ſoon
got a good number of Soldiers about him, and it hapning that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Pikes were longer than the Rebels Pikes, they charged home;
and the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> coming in ſeaſonably with 15 Horſe only, they put
the Rebels to flight, and beat them quite out of the Town, with the
Slaughter of above 200 of them, and ſome of their beſt Officers; nor
muſt it be forgotten, that the Popiſh Houſes in the Town were <hi>marked
with Chalk,</hi> that ſo the Rebels, if they had prevailed, might diſtinguiſh
them from thoſe they intended to murder. Neither will I pretermit a

Stratagem uſed by the Gariſon, in placing ſome Pipers upon the Walls
to play, and others to toſs up their Caps, and cry, <hi>The Town is our own,
make haſt in,</hi> and the like, by which means many of the Rebels, that
ſtill waited to have a Gate opened for them, ran haſtily into the Town,
and were made Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>The Pinnace that came with the firſt Relief hapned unfortunately to
run aground, and was briskly attackt by the Rebels, who deſperately
came with Pickaxes and Iron Barrs even to her very Stern; but Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Stutfield</hi> threw ſome Granadoes amongſt them, and by that means
got rid of them with much ado, and killed above Threeſcore of the

                  </p>
                  <p>But after a while, Neceſſities and Diſeaſes began to return upon the

Search was made for Proviſions, and the Fryers (contrary to their
Vow of Poverty) were found to have great Quantities of Money, Plate,
and other Treaſure, which they not owning, (moſt of it probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Rebels,) it was divided amongſt the Soldiers; but that
was no Relief to a hungry Belly, when Victuals could not be had for
Money, and therefore the Governor made a hard ſhift to ſend a Boat
to <hi>Dublin</hi> to haſten Supplies.</p>
                  <p>And tho' the Governor did by frequent Sallies incommode the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and ſometimes recover a little Proviſions, yet that did not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
the Gariſon, but that they were reduced to the greateſt Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
even to the eating of Horſes, Dogs, and Cats, when on the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>February</hi> they Sallied, and took from the Rebels a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Booty of 80 Cows and 200 Sheep; and the Twentieth day (being
Sunday) at four a Clock in the Morning, Sir <hi>Philemy O Neal,</hi> with all
his Strength, made ſo bold an Attempt as to apply Scaling Ladders to
the Wall, and the Sentinel's Gun miſſing Fire, they made good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
before the Gariſon took the Alarm; but as ſoon as the Soldiers
came to the Walls, they did ſuch Execution upon the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that their
Officers could by no means oblige the Soldiers to return to the Aſſault:
And the ſame day two Pinnaces and ſeveral other Veſſels (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Boom at <hi>Tredagh,</hi> which broke the day before) came up
to the Town with a plentiful Supply of all Neceſſaries.</p>
                  <p>Encouraged by this Recruit, and theſe Succeſſes, the Governor of
<hi>Tredagh,</hi> with 220 Foot and 120 Horſe, Sallied to <hi>Beaubeck</hi> on the
Twenty ſixth of <hi>February,</hi> and ſecured ſome Corn and Hay for the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
and then advanced to <hi>Smiths Town,</hi> where they defeated a Party
of Rebels, and ſlew 300: And about the ſame time Major <hi>Forteſcue</hi> had
good Succeſs near <hi>Gellingſton</hi> againſt Colonel <hi>Preſton</hi> in the ſame Field
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had formerly ſuffered a Defeat; and to follow the Blow,
the Lord <hi>Moor,</hi> with 600 Foot and 120 Horſe and two Field-Pieces,
Sallied out the Twenty eighth of <hi>February,</hi> and aſſailed <hi>Stainime,</hi> but
finding it fortified, they took ſome Corn at <hi>Colp,</hi> and returned.</p>
                  <p>On the Firſt of <hi>March</hi> the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> and Sir <hi>John Burlace</hi> made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sally, and took the Caſtle of <hi>Colp,</hi> and killed many of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels:
And on the Second of <hi>March</hi> Colonel <hi>Wainman</hi> made another
Sally as far as <hi>Marlengton,</hi> burned Mr. <hi>Draicot</hi>'s Houſe and ſome other
conſiderable places, and return'd home with good ſtore of Corn; and
on the Fourth the brave Lord <hi>Moor</hi> made another Sally towards <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagh-hallon,</hi>
amongſt his traiterous and ungrateful Tenants, and routed
the Rebels, killing ſeven Captains and 400 Soldiers, and took Capt.
<hi>Mac Mahon</hi> and <hi>Barnwell</hi> of <hi>Rahasket</hi> Priſoners, and got good ſtore of
Arms, whereby the Siege of <hi>Tredagh</hi> was raiſed, and the Gariſon was
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65997:333"/>
at leiſure to viſit the Enemies Quarters, and ſoon forced <hi>Darcy</hi> of
<hi>Platten</hi> his Servants to ſurrender his Houſe, and obliged ſome of
the Lord of the <hi>Pale</hi> to write Letters of Excuſe to the State, and
to deſire to know upon what Terms they might come in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the
Lords Juſtices deſpis'd that Inſolence, and the caſe being alter'd, did
not think fit, without new Orders, to proſtitute His Majeſties Mercy
to ſuch as had no other ſenſe of their Duty than that was taught
them by neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt ſome of them deſired to be pardoned, others of them
committed barbarous Crimes, that were unpardonable, and murdered
all the Proteſtants at <hi>Atherdee,</hi> to be revenged for their Loſſes before
<hi>Tredagh;</hi> and it ought never to be forgotten, as an eſpecial Providence
of God, that during this long Siege, and in all theſe Sallies, there
were but Twelve Proteſtants that fell by the Sword, or were ſlain;
which nevertheleſs is very believable, becauſe the like hath lately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in proportion at the famous Siege of <hi>Londonderry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the Seventh of <hi>March,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> with Three
thouſand Foot and Five hundred Horſe, marched out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Tredagh,</hi> not knowing the Siege was rais'd, and having burned
<hi>Feildſtown, Kilſalan,</hi> and <hi>Ratooth,</hi> and ſeveral Houſes in the County of
<hi>Meath,</hi> he came to <hi>Tredagh</hi> on the Eleventh; and having recruited the
Governor and the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> with Four hundred Foot and Two
Troops of Horſe, and burnt and pillaged great part of the <hi>Pale,</hi> he
return'd to <hi>Dublin</hi> on Buſineſs of Importance, by the ſpecial Order of
the Lords Juſtices.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Tichburne</hi> on the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
firſt of the ſame Month, marched out with One thouſand Foot and
Two hundred Horſe, and having burnt the Country about <hi>Slane,</hi> on
the Twenty third advanced to <hi>Atherdee,</hi> and having diſcovered the
Enemy to the number of near Fifteen hundred, they ſent out their
<hi>Forlorn,</hi> which ſtumbled on an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ambuſcade, and drove them to
the Main Body, of whom they killed about Four hundred. At the
Foot of the Bridge the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did again make ſome Reſiſtance; but ſome
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> found a Paſſage over the River, and galled them in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and forced them to abandon that Poſt, and then forced their
way into the Town. In this Skirmiſh one <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel
and five Captains were ſlain, beſides what fell of the Common Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> encourag'd with this Succeſs, advanc'd to <hi>Dundalk</hi> on
the Twenty ſixth of <hi>March;</hi> and tho' the Town was fortified with a
double Wall and a double Ditch, and had a Bog on the one ſide, and
the Sea on the other, yet a Party of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> led by Lieutenant-Colonel
<hi>Wainm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> forced the Gate with Pickaxes, and entred the
Town with their Horſe, and purſued the Enemy on a full Gallop;
but at the turn of a Street were warmly received by Five hundred
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> who had mounted two or three Braſs Pieces, and were forced to
retreat; and from a Caſtle at the end of that Street, the Rebels had
killed Enſign <hi>Forteſcue</hi> (who was the firſt Officer that was ſlain ſince
the Defeat at <hi>Gellingston</hi>) and ſome few Soldiers: Whereupon the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſet Fire to the Houſes near the Caſtle, ſo that the Smoak
blowing towards the Caſtle, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came undiſcover'd to the
Gate, and blew it up with Gunpowder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereat thoſe within were
ſo frightned, that they fled out of the Window, and a Serjeant and
Five Men entred, and were afterwards reinforced with Twenty four
more; and the Fire being quenched, Two Pieces of Ordnance were
drawn up againſt the inner Gate, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being ſheltered by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65997:333"/>
ſome Wooll-packs found in the Caſtle, got an Opportunity to gall
the Enemy, whilſt Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourne</hi> with a Party of Horſe marched
on the back ſide of the Town to the North Gate, and killed Forty
Rebels in his way, and entring at a Bye-gate, found the Town de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
whereby a hundred and twenty Proteſtants were relieved, and
good Booty recovered, with the Slaughter of a hundred Rebels, and
not above Fourteen or Fifteen of the Royaliſts; which was the more
conſiderable, becauſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in this Place were about Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
and the Aſſailants not full a thouſand.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Philemy</hi> and his Myrmidons were mightily enraged at this Defeat,
and in revenge murdered the Lord <hi>Cawfield</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blany,</hi> and about
Fifteen hundred other Proteſtants, whom till then they had reſerved
for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Rely</hi> alſo murdered Sixty more of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Bolturbet;</hi> and
indeed it was ſeldom that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> met with any diſappointment, but
they vented their Rage on the miſerable Proteſtants that they had in
their Power; as if by ſacrificing ſo many innocent Souls, they could
expiate the Guilt of their Cowardiſe and Treachery.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Succeſſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> forced the Lords and Gentlemen
of the <hi>Pale</hi> into <hi>Ulſter,</hi> where thoſe loſing Gameſters fell together by
the Ears: for Sir <hi>Philemy O Neal</hi> and the <hi>Ulſter</hi> Men upbraided thoſe
of the <hi>Pale,</hi> that they had formerly been their <hi>National</hi> Enemies, and
falſe to them and their Religion; and that it was not paſt Memory,
ſince the Papiſts of the <hi>Pale</hi> had perſuaded <hi>Ulſter</hi> to a Religious Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and left it in the lurch; but that now the <hi>Ulſter</hi> Men were quit
with them, having firſt expoſed the <hi>Pale</hi> to the Fury of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
In ſhort, they renewed <hi>their Ancient and Hereditary Animoſities;</hi> and their
Confederacy and Aſſociation was too feeble to extinguiſh or even ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend
their <hi>National Antipathy,</hi> derived from their <hi>different Extractions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This unexpected and unſeaſonable Treatment from <hi>Ulſter,</hi> made
ſuch a deep Impreſſion on the Mind of the Lord <hi>Gormanſtown,</hi> that it
broke his Heart, ſo that he died lamenting his great Folly <hi>in ſiding
with the Iriſh againſt his own Country-men;</hi> and ſome that ſurvived were
fully ſenſible of this Overſight; but they were too far engag'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and therefore they ſought for Pretences, and fiſh'd for Excuſes, to
colour or extenuate their Crimes; many of which being notoriouſly
falſe, and ſome of them <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> and ſo not pertinent, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
jumbled together in an Apology, which they afterwards
ſent to the King.</p>
                  <p>But we ought to caſt an Eye on the reſt of the Provinces, and firſt
on <hi>Munſter,</hi> where the firſt Appearance of the Rebellion was on the
Twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> at which time a numerous Rabble of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> plundered Mr. <hi>William Kingsmill</hi> at <hi>Ballyowen,</hi> in the County of
<hi>Typerary,</hi> and carried away a great number of Cows and Sheep from
him and his Neighbors. This Attempt was the bolder, becauſe he
was the Lord Preſident's Brother-in-Law; and the Conſequence of it
was, that the Lord Preſident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on notice thereof, came with two
Troops of Horſe to <hi>Ballyowen,</hi> and purſued the Tories, killed ſome,
and hanged others, and recovered ſome part of the ſtollen Cattel;
and afterwards, in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Time, Mrs. <hi>Kingsmill</hi> ſued ſome of theſe
Robbers, and got a Decree againſt them for 1500 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> pretend, that ſome innocent People were kill'd in this
Expedition, and that the Lord <hi>Dunboyn,</hi> and ſeveral Gentlemen of
the County of <hi>Typerary,</hi> came to the Preſident to <hi>Clonmell,</hi> and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulated
with him about the Violence of this Proceeding; and that he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65997:334"/>
ſhould tell them, that they were Rebels, and that it was more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to <hi>hang</hi> than to <hi>truſt</hi> any of them. And when they have told this
ſimple Story, they think they have ſaid enough to juſtifie their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Clonmell</hi> the Lord Preſident went into the County of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
upon notice that a Party of the <hi>Leinſter</hi> Rebels had paſſed that
way into his Province; and he had the good fortune to rout them
on the Second of <hi>December,</hi> with the Slaughter of Two hundred of
the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in his abſence, the Inhabitants of <hi>Typerary,</hi> to the number of
Fifteen hundred, aſſembled together to ſeiſe on the City of <hi>Caſhel,</hi>
and deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there; and tho' they were (by the Perſuaſions
of ſome leſs barbarous than themſelves) diverted for that time from
ſo cruel an Enterpriſe; yet they could not abſtain much longer, but
on the laſt day of <hi>December,</hi> under the Leading of <hi>Philip O Duir,</hi> they
took <hi>Caſhell,</hi> and in cold Blood (for there was no Reſiſtance) they
murdered <hi>William Beaves</hi> and his Servant, <hi>Thomas Sadler, William Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi>
and his Wife, <hi>John Baniſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Car, John Lents, Richard Lane,
John Anderſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Franklin, Toby</hi> a Joyner, and <hi>John Fowks.</hi> The
reſt were ſaved for that time, chiefly by the Piety and Compaſſion
of <hi>Redmond Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Everard,</hi> two <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friars; who
for that very Reaſon were in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Time not only acquitted,
but privileged to live in the Country, whilſt others, <hi>viz.</hi> Colonel
<hi>Teige O Magher,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Donough. O Dwir, Theobald Butler,
Hugh Ryan, Ulick Burk, &amp;c.</hi> were in <hi>November,</hi> 1653. tried, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
and executed for theſe barbarous Murders.</p>
                  <p>And the very next day, being the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> another Rabble
ſeiſed on <hi>Fethard,</hi> where they plundered all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but murdered
none except Mr. <hi>Low;</hi> for which Fact three of the Murderers, <hi>viz.
Thomas Quigly, James mac Hugh,</hi> and <hi>Richard Nagle,</hi> were afterwards
condemn'd and hang'd. The Loſs of <hi>Fethard</hi> was followed with the
Revolt of <hi>Clonmell, Carrick,</hi> and all the Towns in <hi>Typerary;</hi> and of
<hi>Waterford, Limerick, Kilmallock,</hi> and <hi>Dungarvan:</hi> And on the Twenty
third day of <hi>January</hi> ſome of the <hi>Kennedyes</hi> murdered Twenty two
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> Servants to Sir <hi>George Hamilton</hi> at the <hi>Silver Mines,</hi> and Two
more, <hi>viz. Thomas Gallop</hi> and <hi>Thomas Sadly,</hi> were left wounded amongſt
the Dead; but in the dark Night they made a ſhift to eſcape to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagh,</hi>
and were there preſerved.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did not diſſemble the Matter any longer, but in this
very Month of <hi>January</hi> began to form their Men into Troops and
Companies; and hearing (ſays an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt) that the Lord <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garret</hi>
had a Commiſſion from the Lords Juſtices to raiſe Arms to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the Inſurrection, (as indeed he had a Commiſſion to the Earl
of <hi>Ormond</hi> and him to Govern the County of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> of the ſame
Tenor as <hi>Appendix</hi> 8.) they thought to <hi>colour</hi> their Proceedings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and therefore invited him to be their General; And it ſeems
his Lordſhip was ready to embrace the Offer; for in the latter end of
<hi>January</hi> he came with Fifteen Companies to <hi>Caſhell,</hi> and being aſſiſted
by <hi>Purcell</hi> Titular Baron of <hi>Loghmore,</hi> (to whom likewiſe the Lords
Juſtices had ſent Arms) and by the Lords of <hi>Ikerin, Dunboyn, Cahir,</hi>
and <hi>Caſtleconell,</hi> they took <hi>Ballyowen,</hi> and blockt up <hi>Gowlin</hi> and <hi>Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordan,</hi>
and then marched to <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> and ſo towards <hi>Mallow;</hi> but
near the Mountain above <hi>Donerayl</hi> the Lord preſident faced the Rebels.
He had with him the Lords <hi>Barymore, Dungarvan,</hi> and <hi>Broghill,</hi> Sir
<hi>Hardreſs Waller,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Denny,</hi> Sir <hi>John Brown,</hi> Major <hi>Searle,</hi> and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65997:334"/>
Captain <hi>Kingsmill,</hi> and about Six hundred Foot and Three hundred
Horſe. Whilſt he ſtaid there, the Rebels did not dare to advance;
but his Preſence being neceſſary at <hi>Cork,</hi> he was after eight days ſtay
thereabouts obliged to retire to that City; whereupon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
to <hi>Mallow,</hi> and took the ſhort Caſtle there upon Articles, which
they did not perform.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Mallow</hi> there aroſe a Difference amongſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> about the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Command of the Army: The Lord <hi>Roch</hi> and others of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
thought they ought to have a General of their own <hi>Province;</hi>
and to avoid Competition amongſt the Lords, they pitch'd upon
<hi>Garret Barry,</hi> and appointed the Lord <hi>Muskery</hi> and other Great Men to
be the Council of War.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Lord <hi>Mountgarret</hi> return'd to <hi>Typerary,</hi> where he met
the News, That the Men which were in <hi>Gowlin</hi> Caſtle had eſcaped
into the Mountains, where moſt of them were murdered by <hi>James
Butler</hi> of <hi>Ruskagh,</hi> (for which Fact he was tried before Colonel <hi>Sanky,
Anno</hi> 1653. and afterwards hang'd) and that the Women and Children
left in the Caſtle were likewiſe inhumanly butcher'd by the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> for
which Barbarity, <hi>Peirce Butler,</hi> and his Son <hi>Thomas, James Butler</hi> of
<hi>Boyton-Rath,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Kent,</hi> were likewiſe tried, condemned, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1653.</p>
                  <p>As for the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> which, by the noble Plantations made
by the Earl of that Name, became the beſt inhabited with <hi>Engliſh</hi> of
any County in that Kingdom, it was in a great meaſure preſerv'd by
the Generoſity and Diligence of that Earl, who was then newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
out of <hi>England;</hi> he rais'd Two Troops of Horſe under his
Sons the Lords of <hi>Kinalmeky</hi> and <hi>Broghil,</hi> and Four hundred Foot; all
which he maintained for ſome Months as his own Charge, and ſent
a hundred of them to <hi>Asketon,</hi> a hundred to <hi>Liſmore,</hi> and kept Two
hundred with himſelf at <hi>Youghall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, that County was not without its ſhare of Diſturbance,
tho' it was the laſt County wherein the Rebellion broke out; and they
began it as elſewhere, by robbing and plundring bare-fac'd, and at
Noon-day, and in Multitudes, and afterwards committed ſome Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but not ſo many as in other Places, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were
powerful in this County, and therefore the Rebels were in more fear
to be called to account for their Exorbitances: However, at <hi>Glandore</hi>
they gagg'd ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> to death, and in another place they ty'd
an <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s Guts to the Poſt, and made him dance round it till
he died; they broil'd a piece of a <hi>Scotch</hi> Miniſter's Breech, and made
him eat it; they hang'd <hi>Robert Scot</hi> of <hi>Newceſtown</hi> and his two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in <hi>Muskery,</hi> tho' he went voluntarily there to a Friend for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
and in like manner <hi>John Burrows</hi> was ſerv'd at <hi>Ballynorohur,</hi>
by his Landlord <hi>Mac-ni-crimin</hi> (who was tried and executed for it
afterwards at <hi>Bandon.</hi>) They hang'd <hi>Andrew</hi> a Servant of Mr. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell</hi>'s, and, which was worſe than all he reſt, Mr. <hi>Linſcomb,</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
of <hi>Cloghnikilty,</hi> having much Intimacy with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ſtaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his Neighbors, in confidence of Protection; but, contrary to his
Expectation and their Promiſes, they firſt made him drunk till he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and then made him eat it up, and immediately hang'd him at
his own Door; and having (by Promiſes of ſending her ſafe to <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale</hi>)
perſuaded his Wife to diſcover 120 <hi>l.</hi> in Money ſhe had hid at
<hi>Muckrus,</hi> as ſoon as they got it, they threw her and her Siſter into
a deep Pit, and there they left them till they were ſtarved.</p>

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:65997:335"/>
And altho' there were not many downright Murthers committed
in this County, yet by reaſon of the univerſal Robbing and Plundring,
and the great Want and Hardſhips this Inſurrection expoſed the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to, many thouſands of them periſhed; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the Town of <hi>Bandon,</hi> there died above a Thouſand in the firſt
Year of this Rebellion; and great Numbers likewiſe met with the
ſame Fate at <hi>Cork, Kinſale,</hi> and <hi>Youghall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſtop this Torrent, the Lord Preſident raiſed a Regiment of
Foot and Two Troops of Horſe, and did what he could to prepare
for his Defence: And it was but needful to do ſo; for the Rebels
being extraordinary numerous, thought themſelves able to beſiege
<hi>Cork, Kinſale,</hi> and <hi>Bandon</hi> at the ſame time. In order to this, Mr. <hi>Long,</hi>
High Sheriff of the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> form'd a Camp at <hi>Belgooly,</hi> about
Two Miles from <hi>Kinſale;</hi> and to him came <hi>Mac-Finin</hi>'s Brother, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Captain <hi>Sugane,</hi> and march'd from <hi>Kerry,</hi> (through <hi>Muskery</hi> and
<hi>Carbery,</hi> to the Camp) and <hi>Dermond ni Glack</hi> of <hi>Littergorman,</hi> with
another Party, march'd down to <hi>Kilgoban</hi>-Caſtle, on the River of
<hi>Bandon,</hi> and ſurprized it.</p>
                  <p>This Camp at <hi>Belgooly</hi> continued the reſt of this Winter, and was
ſupplied with Ammunition and other Neceſſaries even from ſome of
the Popiſh Inhabitants of <hi>Kinſale;</hi> but at length half the Lord <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinglaſs</hi>
his Company (being Forty five Men) arrived by Sea at <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi>
on the Fifth of <hi>April,</hi> and brought with them Eight Barrels of
Powder, whereof Six were the next day ſent to <hi>Bandon,</hi> guarded by
the <hi>Bandon</hi> Troop, which fell into an Ambuſcade; but the <hi>Kinſale</hi>
Troop (juſt then parted from them) return'd ſeaſonably to their
Succour, and between them they kill'd Eighty of the Rebels, and then
each Troop return'd ſafe to their reſpective Gariſons; and the next
day the Camp at <hi>Belgooly</hi> was diſſolv'd, and moſt of the Soldiers went
to reinforce the Blockade at <hi>Cork.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And about the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>February, Mac Carthy Riagh</hi> (who
had diſſembled the Matter, and pretended Loyalty, and that he would
ſide with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> until he got ſome Arms from the Lord Viſcount
<hi>Kinalmeky,</hi> and then declared the very next day) with about Three
thouſand raw Men, and ill armed, came to beſiege the Town of <hi>Bandon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the valiant <hi>Bandonians</hi> ſcorned to be pent up by ſuch a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Rabble, and therefore having form'd themſelves into Four Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
under the Captains <hi>Watkins, Woodhouſe, Jefford,</hi> and <hi>Hooper;</hi>
and One Troop,<note place="margin">Battel of <hi>Knockagarane.</hi>
                     </note> under their Governor the Lord <hi>Kinalmeky,</hi> they ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
out, and whilſt the Foot marched up the direct Road to <hi>Cloghna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kilty,</hi>
the Horſe went round by <hi>Caſtlemahon,</hi> ſo to fall on the Rear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but the Foot came up firſt, and one Company, led by Captain <hi>Watkins</hi>
within-ſide the Ditch, came undiſcovered very near the Enemy, (who
were gazing at the reſt that march'd in the High-way) and at the
firſt Volley kill'd Sixteen Men; whereupon all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fled, and being
light of Foot, and the Horſe not come up, no farther Execution was
done at this famous Battel of <hi>Knockagarane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Cork,</hi> it was blocked up on the South-ſide by General <hi>Barry</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Muskery,</hi> who expected the Lord <hi>Roch</hi> and others to do
the like on the North-ſide; but to prevent that, the Lord Preſident
ſent the Lord <hi>Inſiquin</hi> and Colonel <hi>Jepſon,</hi> with the Two <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Troops newly arrived from <hi>England,</hi> into <hi>Roch</hi>'s Country and <hi>Orrery,</hi>
where they had the good Fortune to relieve <hi>Rathgogan,</hi> and to take
<hi>Ballyha,</hi> and to kill Two hundred Rebels, on the Twenty ſeventh of
<hi>February.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65997:335"/>
And the Lord Preſident being reinforced by Sir <hi>Charles Vavaſor</hi>'s
Regiment likewiſe, newly arrived from <hi>England,</hi> did on the ſecond of
<hi>March</hi> draw out a Party, with which he burnt <hi>Tallow,</hi> viſited <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
and took <hi>Dungarvan</hi> by Surrender, and left Lieutenant <hi>Roſſington</hi>
and Forty Men in it, (from whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> afterwards ſurpriz'd it)
and ſo having kill'd Three hundred Rebels in this Journy, he returned
ſafely to <hi>Cork.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on the Thirteenth of <hi>April</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> beat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scouts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Suburbs of <hi>Cork;</hi> whereupon the Lord <hi>Inſiquin</hi> and Colonel <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſor</hi>
iſſued out with Three hundred Muſquetiers and Two Troops
of Horſe, and not only beat that Party, but alſo routed the whole
Army, and took the Lord <hi>Muskery</hi>'s Armor, Tent, and Baggage, and
killed Captain <hi>Sugane</hi> and above Two hundred of the Rebels, without
the Loſs of a Man.</p>
                  <p>And as to <hi>Youghall,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did plant Three Pieces of Ordnance
on the other ſide of the River, to block up the Harbor; but that did
not hinder the ſafe Arrival of Sir <hi>Charles Vavaſor</hi> and his Regiment in
that Port, on the Twenty fifth day of <hi>February</hi> 1641. as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Connaught,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ranelagh</hi> was Lord Preſident of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and being at <hi>Dublin</hi> when the Rebellion broke out, he went to
his Government the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> and found the Counties
of <hi>Mayo, Letrim, Roſcomon,</hi> and <hi>Sleigo</hi> in open Rebellion: At firſt he
thought to reclaim them by Mildneſs, and the Acquaintance he had
amongſt them; but he was quickly baffled in that Expectation, as
every body elſe will be, that thinks <hi>an Iriſh Rebel will prefer the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
or Solicitations of a Proteſtant Friend before thoſe of a Popiſh Prieſt.</hi>
On the contrary, to manifeſt their Sincerity to their Religion, <hi>per ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod
facinus dignum,</hi> they are moſt ſevere to their Proteſtant Friends;
and the Lord <hi>Ranelagh</hi> fared as bad as others, being beſieged in the
Caſtle of <hi>Athlone</hi> all this Winter; and many Towns in his Province
(and particularly, <hi>Roſcomon</hi> and <hi>Elphin</hi>) were burned by the Rebels;
and ſome Caſtles of the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>'s, in the County of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
were by them likewiſe ſurprized, tho' generally that County
was by the Conduct and Loyalty of the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> kept in
pretty good order.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be noted, That Commiſſions of Government and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Law were likewiſe ſent to the Roman Catholicks of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
<hi>viz.</hi> to the Lord of <hi>Mayo, &amp;c.</hi> that nothing might be omitted
to keep them quiet, if they were ſo inclin'd; but they, deſpiſing the
weak Forces of this Province, were more forward than others to
plunge themſelves into this Common and Univerſal Rebellion, and kept
the Lord Preſident beſieged in the Caſtle of <hi>Athlone</hi> all this Winter.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>January</hi> the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to the number of Twelve hundred, beſieged
young Sir <hi>Charles-Coot</hi> in <hi>Caſtle-Coot;</hi> but he valiantly raiſed the Siege
within a Week, and not long after defeated <hi>Hugh O Connor</hi> and his
Forces, and on the Second of <hi>March</hi> encountred <hi>Con O Rourk</hi> and his
Followers, who came to fetch the Prey of <hi>Roſcomon,</hi> and took himſelf
Priſoner, and killed moſt of his Party. Afterwards the Rebels, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of Colonel <hi>Walſh,</hi> formed a Camp at <hi>Kregs;</hi> but
young Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> and the Gariſon of <hi>Caſtle-Coot</hi> ſallied out upon
them, and gave them a total Defeat, and took all their Baggage and
Proviſions; and not long after, he got a conſiderable Prey, from about
<hi>Ballyniſlow,</hi> and in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-week relieved <hi>Athloane</hi> with ſome Proviſions
and other Neceſſaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:65997:336"/>
Nor did the Governors and Gariſons of <hi>Roſcoman, Tulsk, Elphin, Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicar,
Abbyboyle, Carrigdrumrusk,</hi> and <hi>Bealanfad,</hi> behave themſelves leſs
bravely, tho' at length this latter Place was loſt for want of Water.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Ulſter,</hi> becauſe the Rebellion began there; I have already
mentioned ſeveral paſſages in that Province; ſo that I have only to
add, that on the Twenty third of <hi>October, Cormock O Hagan</hi> ſurpriz'd
the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Monymore</hi> belonging to the Company of <hi>Drapers</hi>
in <hi>London:</hi> Whereupon a Rumour was immediately noiſed about the
Country, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were in Rebellion, which coming to the Ears
of Mr. <hi>William Rowly,</hi> who had been an active Man againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
he preſently poſted to <hi>Colerain,</hi> where he brought the firſt notice of
the Inſurrection, about Eight a Clock on <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, which was
ſoon after confirmed by multitudes of pillaged People that flockt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Town that day. It was wonderful to ſee the <hi>Scots</hi> ſo deluded
with the wheedling of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that they ſate ſtill as Newters till the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were deſtroy'd; and particularly. There was one Mr. <hi>William
Stewart</hi> of the <hi>Irry,</hi> who had Married the Earl of <hi>Tyrones</hi> Grand-Daughter;
he had Six hundred <hi>Scots</hi> together, and might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that Country; but being aſſur'd by ſome of his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Relations,
that no harm was deſign'd to his Country-men, he diſmiſt his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
to their reſpective Dwellings, and that very Night moſt of
them were murdered; and this was the firſt Action that Alarm'd the
<hi>Scots,</hi> amongſt whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from that time forward made a ſad
Slaughter, and the <hi>Scots</hi> in due time did not fail to Pay them in their
own Coyn; and particularly at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of <hi>Magee,</hi> within few Weeks after.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Colerain,</hi> Colonel <hi>Edward Rowly,</hi> raſed a Regiment of Foot
and a Troop of Horſe, and Colonel <hi>Cozens</hi> raiſed a Regiment of Foot,
but the former marched into the Country, and for ſome time kept in
an open Village called <hi>Garvaghy;</hi> but at length the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to a very great
number (whereof many were his own Tenants) fell upon him, and kill'd
all his Men but Eight, and barbarouſly murdered himſelf after they
had given him Quarter, and then burnt and plundered to the Gates
of <hi>Colerain;</hi> Mr. <hi>Hugh Rowly,</hi> who is ſtill living, aſſures me, he ſaw
them burn <hi>Deſertmartin, Maghara, Vintners Town, Drapers Town,</hi> and
<hi>Maghrafelt;</hi> and he ſaw them take a Poor Scotchman and knock him
in the Head with ſtones; and he alſo ſaw them take Mr. <hi>Matchet</hi> a
Miniſter out of Lieutenant <hi>Thurbye</hi>'s Houſe, and murder him, and he
alſo likewiſe ſaw the Lord of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and Sir <hi>Philemy O Neal</hi> meet at
the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>March, Archibald Steward</hi> marched out of <hi>Colerain</hi> with Six
hundred <hi>Scots,</hi> and Three hundred <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and had the misfortune to
meet with <hi>Alexander Mac Donald, alias Culkittagh,</hi> who gave him a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Attack; whereupon the <hi>Scots</hi> gave way, and the whole Party
was routed, and Six hundred Proteſtants ſlain: And ſoon after the
Rebels animated with this Succeſs beſieg'd <hi>Colerain,</hi> but the Lord of
<hi>Antrim</hi> not only perſwaded the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to raiſe that Siege, but alſo ſent
Proviſions and other relief into the Town, believing that this obliging
Carriage would prevail with the Town voluntarily, to put it ſelf
under his Protection; but in that he found himſelf miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>In this Extremity was the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> ſo that every Man that
was left was neceſſitated to betake himſelf to Arms; whereby ſuch a
Competent force was raiſed, as put a ſtop to the Career of the Rebels,
there were Three Troops, and Three Regiments of Foot under Sir
<hi>Robert Stewart,</hi> Sir <hi>William Stewart,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Audly Mervin,</hi> in and
near <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and theſe were called the <hi>Lagan</hi> Forces; Sir <hi>John
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65997:336"/>
Clotworthy</hi> had a Regiment and a Troop in the Town of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and
the Lord <hi>Conwey</hi> had the like at <hi>Lyſnegarvy;</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Ardes,</hi>
Sir <hi>James Mongomery,</hi> Colonel <hi>Hill,</hi> Captain <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringham,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> had likewiſe ſome Forces in the County
of <hi>Downe,</hi> all which did Service; but none did that prodigious Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon the Rebels, as Sir <hi>Frederick Hamilton</hi>'s Regiment at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
Hamilton,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Cole</hi>'s Regiment at <hi>Iniskilling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it will be fit to inquire, how the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs were managed in
<hi>England,</hi> where the Parliament (upon whom the King had devolv'd
the Management of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War) did during his Majeſty's abſence
(in <hi>Scotland</hi>) heartily eſpouſe the Cauſe of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proteſtants, and
not only voted briskly for their Relief, as hath been already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
but did alſo effectually ſet all Engins at work for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Kingdom, and appointed a particular Committee for <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Affairs. And now, when the King was return'd to <hi>London,</hi> His Majeſty
expreſſed no leſs Zeal in that Matter, and Deteſtation of that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
than the Parliament had done; They ſeem'd to vie with one
another, who ſhould do moſt to ſave that Iſland, and to revenge that
barbarous Maſſacre, committed upon the Proteſtants there; and yet
at length, by unhappy Differences that aroſe between Themſelves,
both of Them were hindred from doing what each of Them deſign'd:
So that whilſt <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were deſtroying each other in Civil Wars
here, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> were expos'd to the Inſults of a numerous
and inveterate Enemy without their Gariſons, and to the want of all
Neceſſaries within them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to proceed:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1641.</note> 
                     <hi>On the Twenty eighth of</hi> December <hi>the King ſent
the following Meſſage to the Houſe of Lords,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Husbands</hi>'s Collect. 33.</note> viz. His Majeſty being
very ſenſible of the great Miſeries and Diſtreſſes of His Subjects in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which go daily increaſing ſo faſt, and the Blood which
hath been already ſpilt by the <hi>Cruelty and Barbarouſneſs of thoſe Rebels,</hi>
crying out ſo loud; and perceiving how ſlowly the Succours deſign'd thither
go on; His Majeſty hath thought fit to let your Lordſhips know, and deſires
you to acquaint the Houſe of Commons therewith, That His Majeſty will
take Care, that by Commiſſions which He ſhall grant, Ten thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Voluntiers ſhall be ſpeedily raiſed for that Service, if the Houſe of Commons
ſhall declare that they will pay them.</p>
                  <p>But the Diſturbance about the Impeachment of the Five Members,
hapning ſo ſoon after this as it did, ſuſpended the further Debate of
that Matter; and tho' the Commons on the Fifth of <hi>January</hi> adjourn'd
their Committee for <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs to <hi>Guildhall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibidem, 64.</note> yet the next Vote rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I find, is that which center'd in an Order of
Both Houſes, dated the Twenty ninth of <hi>January,</hi> to apprehend and
examine all ſuch ſuſpected Papiſts as are going to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to ſtay
all Arms, Ammunition, Money, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> intended for the Relief of
the Rebels; and to ſend back or proſecute ſuch wandring <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts
as lately landed in the Weſt: And in a day or two after, there was
a Complaint, That notwithſtanding this Order, the King had licenſed
ſeveral Papiſts to tranſport themſelves to <hi>Ireland,</hi> who had joyned
with the Rebels; and Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> ſpeaking freely of that Matter in a
Conference, amongſt other things, he ſaid, <hi>That ſince the Stop upon
the Ports by both Houſes againſt all</hi> Iriſh <hi>Papiſts, many of the Commanders
now in the Head of the Rebels have been ſuffered to paſs by His Majeſty's
immediate Warrant:</hi> And afterwards the Parliament inſtanc'd Colonel
<hi>Butler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nettervill,</hi> Sir <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Delvin,</hi> and Four
more. Whereupon His Majeſty, by His Meſſage of the Second of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65997:337"/>
                     <hi>February,</hi> expoſtulated with them, and affirms, That the Licence to
<hi>Butler, Nettervill,</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> was before he had any Intimation of
that Order; and that tho' they were Papiſts, He had reaſon to believe
they would not joyn with the Rebels; and deſires them to clear Him
from that Aſperſion, by a Publick Declaration.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>January</hi> there was a Treaty with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners

                              <p>4. That Proviſion of Match, Powder, and Ball, be preſently ſent to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickfergus;</hi>

                     <hi>Which Propoſals were approved of by Both Houſes; but the King
diſliked the Third Article, as appears by His Anſwer,</hi> viz. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
having peruſed and conſidered theſe Eight Propoſitions preſented by the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65997:337"/>
                     <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, doth willingly conſent to them all, except only the
Third, which His Majeſty doth not approve, and wiſheth the Houſes to
take that Article again into Conſideration, as a Buſineſs of very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
which His Majeſty doubts may be prejudicial to the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> and the Service intended: And if the Houſes deſire it, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhall not be unwilling to ſpeak with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, to ſee
what Satisfaction he can give them therein. <hi>And the next day they wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon him, and told him, That ſince it was only Matter of</hi> Truſt
<hi>that was in debate, they hoped that he, who was their Native King,
would not ſhew leſs Confidence in them than the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation had
done. Whereupon His Majeſty conſented, rather than the neceſſary
Supplies for</hi> Ireland <hi>ſhould be delay'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And on the Fourteenth of</hi> February <hi>a Committee of Both Houſes
went with a Meſſage to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Ambaſſador, to this effect,</hi> That
the Parliament were informed,<note place="margin">Husbands, 79.</note> That ſome Veſſels in <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> laden with
Arms and Ammunition, were deſigned for <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that if they, or any
ſuch Ships, were ſuffered to go thence, it ſhould be interpreted a Breach of
the Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain. To which the Ambaſſador an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi>
That he would be careful to continue the League between both
Crowns, and did aſſure them, that thoſe Ships were not bound for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And on the ſame Fourteenth day of</hi> February, <hi>His Majeſty ſent a
Meſſage to Both Houſes, in which are theſe Words:</hi> For <hi>Ireland,</hi> (in
behalf of which His Majeſty's Heart bleeds) as His Majeſty hath concurred
with all Propoſitions made for that Service by His Parliament, ſo He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to leave nothing undone for their Relief, which ſhall fall within His
poſſible Power; nor will refuſe to venture His own Perſon in that War, if
His Parliament ſhall think it convenient for the Reduction of that miſerable
Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And in the ſame Month, the Parliament, knowing that the Sale of
the Rebels forfeited Eſtates was the beſt way to prevent future Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
(by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>Ireland</hi>) and to raiſe Money for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
of this, did vote as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THe Lords and Commons taking into their ſerious Conſiderations,<note place="margin">Husbands, 84.</note> as well
the Neceſſity of a ſpeedy Reducing of the Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> to their
due Obedience, as alſo the great Sums of Money that the Commons of this
Realm have of late paid for the Publick and Neceſſary Affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whereof the Lords and Commons are very ſenſible, and deſirous to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
all good and honorable Ways tending to His Majeſty's Greatneſs and
Profit, the Setling of that Realm, and the Eaſe of His Majeſty's Subjects of
<hi>England:</hi> And whereas divers Worthy and Well-affected Perſons, perceiving
that many Millions of Acres of the Rebels Lands of that Kingdom, which go
under the name of <hi>Profitable Lands,</hi> will be confiſcate, and to be diſpoſed
of; and that in caſe Two Millions and a half of thoſe Acres equally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the Four Provinces of that Kingdom, may be allotted for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of ſuch Perſons as ſhall disburſe any Sums Money for the Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

theſe Propoſitions enſuing.</p>
                  <p>1. That Two Millions and a half of thoſe Acres may be aſſigned, allotted,
and divided amongst them, after this Proportion, <hi>viz.</hi>For each Adventurer of

all according to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaſure, and conſiſting of Meadow, Arable, and

common Soccage of the King, as of his Caſtle of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That out of thoſe two Millions and a half of Acres a conſtant Rent
ſhall be reſerved to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> after this Proportion, <hi>viz.</hi> Out of each Acre thereof in

                  </p>
                  <p>3. That for the erecting of Mannors, ſettling of Waſte and Commons,
maintaining of Preaching Miniſters, creating of Corporations, and regulating
of the ſeveral Plantations, one or more Commiſſions be hereafter granted by
Authority of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>4. That Monies, for this great Occaſion, may be the more ſpeedily advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
all the Undertakers in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and within 20 Miles diſtance
thereof, ſhall under-write their ſeveral Sums before the Twentieth day of
<hi>March,</hi> 1641. and all within Sixty Miles of <hi>London,</hi> before the Firſt day
of <hi>April,</hi> 1642. and the reſt of the Kingdom before the Firſt day of <hi>May,</hi>
1642.</p>
                  <p>5. That the ſeveral Sums to be under-written ſhall be paid in at four Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>viz.</hi> one fourth part within ten days after ſuch under-writing, and the
other three parts at three Months, three Months, and three Months, all to be
paid into the Chamber of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. That for the better Securing of the ſaid ſeveral Sums accordingly, every
one that doth ſo under-write, ſhall at the time of his Subſcription pay down the
twentieth part of the Total Sum that ſhall be by him then under-written.</p>
                  <p>And in caſe that the reſidue of his firſt fourth part be not paid in to ſuch
perſon or perſons as ſhall be appointed to receive the ſame, within the ten days
before limitted; then ſuch Party ſhall not only forfeit the twentieth part of the
Sum total formerly depoſited, but ſo much more of his firſt fourth Payment,
to be added thereunto, as ſhall make up the one Moyety of the ſaid firſt Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And if the ſame Perſon ſhall fail in any other of the three Payments, he
ſhall then Forfeit his entire firſt fourth, and all the Benefit of his Subſcription,
which Forfeiture ſhall accrue to the common Benefit of the reſt of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers.</p>
                  <p>The Lords and Commons, upon due and mature Deliberation of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
have approved of them, and given their conſent unto the ſame, and
will become humble Petitioners to His Majeſty for His Royal Approbation
thereof, and that hereafter he will be pleaſed, upon the humble Suit of both
Houſes of Parliament, to give His Royal Aſſent to ſuch Bills as they ſhall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto him for the ſetling of thoſe Propoſitions, and all other things neceſſarily
conducing thereunto.<note place="margin">Ibid. 86.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And on the Twenty fourth of</hi> February <hi>His Majeſty returned His Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Anſwer in Approbation of theſe Votes,</hi> in haec verba, <hi>viz.</hi> That
as he hath offered, and is ſtill ready to venture His own Royal Perſon, for the
Recovery of that Kingdom, if His Parliament ſhall adviſe him thereunto, ſo
He will not deny to contribute any other Aſſiſtance he can to that Service, by
parting with any Profit or Advantage of his own there; and therefore, relying
on the Wiſdom of His Parliament, doth conſent to every Propoſition now made
to him, without taking time to examine whether this courſe may not retard
the reducing of that Kingdom, by exaſperating the Rebels, and rendring them
deſperate of being received into Grace if they ſhall return to their Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:65997:338"/>
It would be too tedious to relate all that was done in this Affair of
the <hi>Adventurers,</hi> and therefore all that I ſhall mention here upon that
Head is, That theſe Votes produced ſeveral Acts of Parliament in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of them, and raiſed the Sum of 400000 <hi>l</hi> for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But on the 9th day of</hi> March, <hi>in the Declaration preſented to the
King at</hi> Newmarket,<note place="margin">Husbands, 97.</note> 
                     <hi>the Parliament inſerted this Article, viz.</hi> That the
Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> was framed and contrived here in <hi>England,</hi> and that
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts ſhould have riſen about the ſame time we have ſeveral Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
and Advertiſements from <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that is a common Speech
amongſt the Rebels, wherewith concur other Evidences and Obſervations of
the ſuſpicious Meetings and Conſultations, the tumultuary and ſeditious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
of thoſe of that Religion, in divers parts of this Kingdom, about the
time of the breaking out of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; the Depoſition of <hi>O Conally;</hi>
the Information of Maſter <hi>Cole,</hi> Miniſter, the Letter of <hi>Triſtram Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe,</hi>
the Depoſition of <hi>Thomas Crant,</hi> and many others which we may
produce, do all agree in this; the publick Declaration of the Lords, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and others, of the <hi>Pale,</hi> That they would joyn with the Rebels, whom
they call the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, or any other, to recover unto His Majeſty His Royal
Prerogative wreſted from him by the Puritan Faction in the Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in <hi>England,</hi> and to maintain the ſame againſt all others; as alſo to
maintain Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, and the lawfulneſs thereof; theſe two being
Quarrels upon which His Majeſties late Army in the <hi>North</hi> ſhould have
been incenſed againſt us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which His Majeſty Anſwers thus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. 106.</note> If the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> (ſo
odious to all Chriſtians) ſeems to have been framed and maintained in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or to have any countenance from hence, We conjure both Our Houſes of
Parliament, and all Our loving Subjects whatſoever, to uſe all poſſible means
to diſcover and find ſuch out, that we may joyn in the moſt exemplary Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon them that can be imagined. But We muſt think Our ſelf highly
and cauſeleſly injured in Our Reputation, if any Declaration, Action or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, any Letter from Count <hi>Roſettie</hi> to the Papiſts
for Faſting and Praying, or from <hi>Triſtram Whitcombe,</hi> of ſtrange Speeches
uttered in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall beget any Jealouſie or Miſapprehenſion in Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Our Juſtice, Piety and Affection; it being evident to all Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
That thoſe miſchievous and wicked Rebels are not ſo capable of great
Advantage as by having their falſe Diſcourſe ſo far believed as to raiſe Fears
and Jealouſies to the Diſtraction of this Kingdom, the only way to their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity:
And we cannot expreſs a deeper ſenſe of the Sufferings of Our poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Subjects in that Kingdom, than We have done in Our often Meſſages to
both Houſes; by which We have offered, and are ſtill ready to venture Our
Royal Perſon for their Redemption, well knowing, That as We are (in Our
own Intereſt) more concerned in them, fo We are to make a ſtrict Accompt
to Almighty God for any Neglect of Our Duty or their Preſervation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And on the 15th of</hi> March,<note place="margin">113.</note> 
                     <hi>from</hi> Huntington, <hi>the King ſent this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
viz.</hi> That he doth very earneſtly deſire that they will uſe all poſſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
in expediting the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which they ſhall find ſo chearful
a Concurrence by his Majeſty, that no Inconvenience ſhall happen to that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
by his Abſence, he having all that Paſſion for the reducing of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which he hath expreſſed in his former Meſſages, and being unable by
words to manifeſt more Affection to it than he hath endeavoured to do by thoſe
Meſſages, (having likewiſe done all ſuch Acts as he hath been moved unto by
his Parliament;) therefore if the Misfortunes and Calamities of his poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Subjects there ſhall grow upon them (tho' His Majeſty ſhall be deeply
concerned in and ſenſible of their Sufferings) he ſhall waſh his hands before all
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65997:339"/>
the World from the leaſt Imputation of Slackneſs in that moſt neceſſary and
pious Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereupon the Parliament Voted the next day,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That thoſe Perſons
that adviſe His Majeſty to abſent himſelf from the Parliament, are Enemies
to the Peace of this Kingdom, and juſtly to be ſuſpected to be Favourers of the

                  </p>
                  <p>The Year 1642. began with Sir <hi>Symon Harcourt</hi>'s Expedition againſt
<hi>Carrickmain,</hi> in the County of <hi>Dublin,</hi> on the Twenty ſixth of <hi>March,</hi>
which proved fatal to him; nevertheleſs his Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
took the Caſtle, and put all within it to the Sword, refuſing to
give Quarter to thoſe obſtinate Rebels that had ſlain his beloved Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel.
And about the ſame time, all the Popiſh Prieſts that could be
found in <hi>Dublin</hi> were by the Lords Juſtices ſent in <hi>French</hi> Bottoms to
<hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the beginning of</hi> April, 1642. <hi>Doctor</hi> Jones <hi>afterwards Biſhop
of</hi> Meath, <hi>and Seven other Divines, who by Virtue of a Commiſſion
dated the 23d. of</hi> December, 1641. <hi>had taken many Examinations
about the Rebellion, and the Murders, Plunders and Robberies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the</hi> Iriſh; <hi>did out of their Depoſitions form a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance,
and being recommended by the Lords Juſtices and Council,
they did Preſent it to the Commons Houſe of Parliament in</hi> England:
<hi>It ſet forth,</hi> That the Rebellion was occaſioned by the ancient Hatred,
which Papiſts bear to Proteſtants, and by their Surfet of Freedom and
Indulgence in that Kingdom, That the Deſign was to eradicate the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, and the Profeſſors of it, that the Rebellion was general and
of a long Contrivance; that ſometimes they pretended the Kings Commiſſion,
and ſometimes ſpoke Contemptibly of his Majeſty, that they deſigned to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
all of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Extraction, even the very Papiſts, that they kicked
Bibles up and down, and ſometimes tore and burnt them; and that they
were inhumanly Cruel in ſeveral inſtances, of Men, Women and Children,
and much more of the ſame ſort; <hi>for which I refer to the Remonſtrance
it ſelf, which is already in Print with the Examinations annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe there is great noiſe made about the Kings ſworn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
Sir <hi>John Read,</hi> and the Queſtions demanded of him upon the
Rack: It is fit I ſhould give a brief Account of that Matter, and it
happened to be thus: Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Read</hi> was in the latter
end of <hi>December</hi> intruſted with a Meſſage to the King, from Three
Lords and four Chief Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale;</hi> but they finding that
Succours come out of <hi>England</hi> but ſlowly, and being in great hopes to
take <hi>Tredagh,</hi> kept <hi>Road</hi> with them to attend the Succeſs of that
Siege, which not hapning according to their Expectation, they were
forced to raiſe it in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and then, and not till then
did <hi>Read</hi> ſurrender himſelf as a Priſoner to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, which
was at that time abroad under the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond;</hi> and he was
immediately ſent to <hi>Dublin</hi> with a Guard of Twenty Horſe; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with many Oaths, Curſes and Imprecations denied any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; he was, together with Captain <hi>Mac Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hown,</hi>
put upon the Rack, where they were asked theſe Three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.
1. <hi>Who were the chief Complotters in this Rebellion. 2. The
Time when it was Plotted. 3. The Place where, and how to be Acted;</hi>
To which they anſwered, <hi>That Sir</hi> Philemy O Neal, Macguire, <hi>and</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65997:339"/>
O Rely <hi>were the chief Conſpirators; and that the Plot was laid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after the Diſſolution of the Army in the</hi> North, <hi>and that it was to
be Acted in all parts of the Kingdom, and to kill Man, Woman and Child of
the Proteſtants, utterly to root them out; and that all the Papiſts in the</hi> Pale
<hi>had Conſented to it, and promiſed their Aſſiſtance to their utmoſt Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 2d. of <hi>April,</hi> the Lieutenant General (<hi>Ormond</hi>)
marched out with Five hundred Horſe, Three thouſand Foot, and Five
Field Pieces, and encamped that Night at <hi>Rathcoole;</hi> and tho he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an Expreſs there, that his Lady and Children (whom he had
not ſeen in Six Months before) were arrived at <hi>Dublin;</hi> yet preferring
the <hi>Publick</hi> before his <hi>Private</hi> Concern, he marched (without ſeeing
them) to <hi>Naas,</hi> and burnt the Country as he went; and having loſt
a Trumpeter and Four Soldiers by the Gariſon of <hi>Tipper,</hi> he cauſed
that Caſtle, and all that were in it to be blown up, and ſent his
wounded Men on Carrs to <hi>Dublin,</hi> with a Guard of Twelve Horſe,
but they were ſet upon by the Rebels, and tho' the Horſe eſcaped, yet
the wounded Men and Carr-men were taken and Murdered; and by
this Accident, all intercourſe was ſtopt between the <hi>State</hi> and the
<hi>Army.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the Army came near <hi>Killcullen,</hi> the Lords of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi>
and <hi>Antrim,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> came in a Coach to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
the Lieutenant General, and were kindly received by him, and the
whole Army paſſing by ſaluted them; which I note, to ſhew the Reader,
that the Lord of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> was not under any neceſſity of joyning
in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, but might have lived quietly at home if he had
pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>On the 5th. at Night the Army came to <hi>Athy</hi> and relieved that
Town, and the next day Sir <hi>Patrick Weams</hi> was ſent with a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of four Troops to relieve the Caſtle of <hi>Catherlogh;</hi> but upon
their approach, the Rebels being Seven hundred ſtrong burned the
Town and fled, however, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> loſt Fifty Men in the purſuit; and
ſo <hi>Weams</hi> having relieved that Caſtle, and therein Five hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi>
almoſt ſtarved, and alſo the Caſtle of <hi>Cloghgrenan,</hi> and taken good ſtore
of Cattel, returned the ſame Night to the Army; and the Caſtle of
<hi>Ballilivan,</hi> was relieved the ſame day by another Party under Sir
<hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Rheban</hi> by another Detachment, which
alſo took the Caſtle of <hi>Bert,</hi> and in it Eight Rebels who were
hanged.</p>
                  <p>On the 7th, the Lieutenant General (leaving Colonel <hi>Crawford</hi> at
<hi>Athy</hi>) marched to <hi>Stradbally,</hi> and on the 8th, came to <hi>Maryburogh,</hi>
and the next day fell Sick of a Fever, which laſted till <hi>Tueſday</hi> after;
however, on the 10th. being <hi>Eaſter</hi> day, Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas

other places; they were to paſs a Cawſeway which the Rebels broke,
and had caſt up a Ditch at the end of it, but <hi>Coot</hi> made Thirty of his
Dragoons alight, and in Perſon lead them on, and beat off the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
with the Slaughter of Forty Rebels and their Captain, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Caſtles of <hi>Bir, Burrous</hi> and <hi>Knocknemeaſe;</hi> and having ſate

Horſe in this Expedition; they returned to the Camp on <hi>Munday</hi>
Night, without the loſs of one Man, and this was the prodigious Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
through <hi>Montrath</hi> Woods, which indeed is wonderful in many
Reſpects; and therefore juſtly gave occaſions for the Title of Earl of
<hi>Montrath,</hi> to be entail'd upon the Poſterity of Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> who
was the chief Commander in this Expedition.</p>

On the ſame 10th. day of <hi>April,</hi> about Seven thouſand <hi>Iriſh</hi> Men,

<hi>Barrow,</hi> within two miles of <hi>Athy,</hi> whereof Colonel <hi>Crawford</hi> ſent No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to the Lieutenant General; whereupon he marched to <hi>Athy</hi> on
the 13th, and reſted there the 14th; and finding the Enemy had
more than double his number, and that he had done the work he
come out for, by relieving the aforeſaid Gariſons; he thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
to Fight at ſuch diſadvantage, or upon ſuch odds to hazard
his Army, and conſequently the Kingdom, and therefore intended to
march towards <hi>Dublin</hi> without ſeeking the Enemy, and yet reſolved
not to ſhun them if they came in his way; but the Rebels had by ſome
means or other got notice of his Deſign, and therefore paſſed the

the Rebels kept another way on the Right hand, divided from the
former, by a Bog about a mile broad and four mile long; both Armies
marched in view of each other with Drums beating, Colours flying,
and kept equal pace until both Rodes met; whereupon the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General fearing they might fall upon his Reer in that narrow
Paſs, gave Orders to draw up the Army in Battalia: Saying, <hi>That
he was reſolved to fight the Enemy, tho' all the Rebels in</hi> Ireland <hi>were
there together;</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did the like, and (not being incumbred with
Garriages as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were) their Army was ſooneſt in Order, which
might have been of advantage to them, but they made none of it;
chuſing rather to <hi>Receive</hi> than <hi>Give</hi> the Charge; in ſhort, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
came up to their Ground, and attacked them ſo briskly, that they
quickly fled; but by reaſon of the adjacent Bog, and the harraſs'd
Condition of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe, there was not much Execution done;
the number of the Slain not exceeding Five hundred, amongſt which
were the Lord <hi>Dunboyn</hi>'s Brother, the Lord <hi>Ikerin</hi>'s Son, and Colonel

the Generals Waggon drawn with Eight Oxen, his and the

for this great Service the Lieutenant General had a Letter of thanks

                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after arrived at <hi>Dublin, Philip</hi> Lord <hi>Liſle</hi> Lieutenant General of
the Horſe; and his firſt Eſſay was to relieve the Caſtle of <hi>Geaſhill,</hi> which
with Three hundred Horſe, and One hundred and twenty Foot he eaſily
effected; he was accompanied by old Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> in this Action,
who at a Council of War told the reſt, that if they made haſte they
might eaſily paſs the Defiles and Cauſeways, before the Enemy could
get together to oppoſe them, whereto another reply'd, that perhaps
that might be ſo; but when the Countrey was Alarm'd, how ſhould
they get back; <hi>I proteſt,</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Charles Coot, I never thought of that
in my Life, I always conſidered how to do my buſineſs, and when that was
done, I got home again as well as I could, and hitherto I have not miſt
of forcing my way;</hi> and accordingly they went, and their march was
ſo ſwift, that they came unexpectedly to <hi>Phillipſtowne</hi> and took it;
and on their return, they followed ſome of the Popiſh Lords of the
<hi>Pale</hi> to <hi>Trim,</hi> and forced that place likewiſe, and by <hi>Coot</hi>'s advice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to make it a Gariſon, and therefore in order to ſettle this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65997:340"/>
Affair with the Lords Juſtices, the Lord <hi>Liſle</hi> (guarded by ſome of the
Horſe) went to <hi>Dublin;</hi> but the next night after he was gone, the
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> to the number of Three thouſand, came in the dead of the night
to ſurpriſe <hi>Trim;</hi> but the Centinel gave the Alarm, and thereupon
Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> with all the Horſe he could get, being not above Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen)
iſſued out of the Gate, and was followed by others as faſt
as they could get ready: The Succeſs was anſwerable to ſo generous
an Undertaking, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were routed, without any other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Loſs on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Side, except that of Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who was ſhot dead; but whether by the Enemy, or one of his own
Troopers, is variouſly reported.</p>
                  <p>Upon his Death, the Government of <hi>Dublin</hi> was given to the Lord
<hi>Lambert,</hi> on the Twelfth of <hi>May;</hi> and tho' in <hi>July</hi> Colonel <hi>Monk</hi>
had it by the Lord Lieutenant's Order, yet as ſoon as the King was
informed that it had been prediſpoſed to the Lord <hi>Lambert, Monk</hi> was
removed, and the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> was confirmed.</p>
                  <p>And on the Twenty third of <hi>May</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> publiſh'd
a Proclamation againſt the Exorbitances of the Soldiers; and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their Neceſſities, the Lords Juſtices gave them <hi>Cuſtodiums</hi> on the
Villages in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Quarters, which produced good Effects, both in
relieving the Soldiers, and in annoying the Rebels.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt of <hi>June</hi> came over ſome Regiments under the Conduct
of Sir <hi>Foulk Hunks</hi> and Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Kirke;</hi> whereupon the Earl
of <hi>Ormond,</hi> with Four thouſand five hundred Foot and Six hundred
Horſe, marched to the Relief of <hi>Athlone,</hi> and in his way took in the
Caſtles of <hi>Knocklinch, Trimletſtown,</hi> and <hi>Kinkelfe,</hi> and beat Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Rebels from <hi>Ballynecurr;</hi> but upon his approach, the Rebels burnt
<hi>Molingar</hi> and <hi>Bullymore,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Dillon</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army thought
fit to withdraw; ſo that the Lord Preſident of <hi>Connaught,</hi> with Fifty
Horſe and Two hundred Foot, met the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> Five Miles
from <hi>Athlone,</hi> and received from him Two Regiments of Foot and
Two Troops of Horſe; and then both theſe Lords return'd, the one
to <hi>Athlone,</hi> and the other to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> (marching to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce
the Lieutenant-General) took <hi>Caſtleknock,</hi> and killed Eighty
Rebels, beſides ſome that he hanged; and a while after he took the
Caſtles of <hi>Rathroffy</hi> and <hi>Clongowſwood</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and
did good Execution upon the Enemy, and of Seventy which he had
taken Priſoners, moſt of them, being murdering Rebels, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
executed at <hi>Dublin:</hi> And on the Twentieth of the ſame
Month, Colonel <hi>Gibſon</hi> made a proſperous Incurſion into <hi>Wicklow,</hi> and
killed many of the Confederates, and brought home a conſiderable
Prey.</p>
                  <p>But on the Twenty firſt of <hi>June</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament ſat, according
to the Prorogation; and the Lower Houſe voted, <hi>That the Oath of
Supremacy ſhould be tendred to all their Members,</hi> that ſo the Rotten ones
may be cut off, and new ones choſen in their room; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
a Bill was prepar'd, and ſent into <hi>England;</hi> and it ſeems that
they did proceed to chuſe new Members for the Corporations and
Counties within their power, in ſtead of thoſe that were in actual
Rebellion; which was one of the Grievances the Confederates after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
complain'd of.</p>
                  <p>And it is worthy Obſervation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace Append. p. 57.</note> That the Lords Juſtices and Council
finding the Rebellion to be ſo general, that all Degrees and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had with hateful and bloody obſtinacy, either publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65997:341"/>
or privately, contributed to the Deſtruction and Extirpation of the
<hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and that thoſe under Protection abuſed that Favour, to
murder and rob the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the more ſlily and ſecurely; they did by
their Order of the Nineteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> revoke, repeal, and annul
all Protections that had been given to any Rebel before that time:
which was one of the wiſeſt Acts that was done in the whole War;
for nothing is more experimentally true than this, <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>never or very ſeldom ſuffered by the</hi> Iriſh <hi>at open Defiance, but have been
often deſtroyed by their Perfidiouſneſs and Treachery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed: In <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Lord <hi>Moor,</hi> Sir <hi>John Burlace</hi> junior,
and Colonel <hi>Gibſon,</hi> with Fifteen hundred Men, two Pieces of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and two Field-pieces, marched into the Counties of <hi>Louth</hi> and
<hi>Meath,</hi> and took the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Sedan,</hi> with the Slaughter of Five
hundred Rebels; whereat the Lords <hi>Gormanſtown</hi> and <hi>Nettervill</hi> were
ſo frightned, that the former quitted the Fort of <hi>Nabar,</hi> and the other
deſerted the Caſtle of <hi>Newtown,</hi> whereby thoſe Counties of <hi>Louth</hi>
and <hi>Meath</hi> were cleared of the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>And this good Succeſs was followed by more of the ſame ſort; for
the Captains <hi>Piggot</hi> and <hi>Grim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> defeated a Party of Eight hundred
Rebels near <hi>Athy,</hi> and killed Two hundred of them; and the Lord
<hi>Liſle,</hi> in the midſt of <hi>September,</hi> marched without controul through
<hi>Weſt-Meath</hi> and <hi>Cavan,</hi> and deſtroyed the Country, burnt the Earl of
<hi>Fingall</hi>'s Houſe and his Town of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and at laſt ſat down before
<hi>Carrickmacroſs,</hi> which after one days Battery was deſerted by the
Cowardly Ward.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>October,</hi> the Rebels, to the number of Two thouſand, did
again beſiege it; and tho' Captain <hi>Vaughan,</hi> with One hundred Foot
and Fifty Horſe, did kill Forty of the Enemy, and raiſe the Siege;
yet the Place being ſo remote, could not at all times be relieved, and
therefore by Order of Council was demoliſhed.</p>
                  <p>But the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> were deſirous to manage the War of
<hi>Ireland</hi> by a Committee, at leaſt till the Lord Lieutenant ſhould go
over; but the King oppoſed that, as needleſs, becauſe the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
was juſt then ready for the Voyage; But whether it was
thought that he would not be propitious to the Ceſſation and Peace
with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> which were then in deſign, or for what other Reaſons
he was delay'd, it is hard to determine; but this is certain, <hi>That tho'
he was always going, yet he never went.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed the Differences between the King and the Parliament
were grown to that heighth, that each Side prepared for War; and
at length it came to a Battel at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> that very day Twelve-month
on which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion broke out, <hi>viz. 23 October,</hi> 1642. And in
this Fight the Loſs ſeem'd equal, and each Party boaſted of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
whilſt both of them were thereby hindred from ſending neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Relief to <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ſo the unfortunate <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuffered every
where, and were deſtroy'd by one another in the Civil War in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and by the Common Enemy in that of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, the Parliament did not totally neglect <hi>Ireland,</hi> but on the
Fourteenth of <hi>October</hi> ſent over Mr. <hi>Robert Godwin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>

Two Parliament-men, and one Captain <hi>Tucker</hi> from the City of
<hi>London,</hi> to inquire into the Condition of the Army and the State of the
Kingdom, and to ſee how their Money was diſpoſed of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They brought
with them Twenty thouſand Pounds in Money, and ſome Ammunition,
and arrived ſafe on the Twenty ninth of <hi>October,</hi> and on the Second
of <hi>November</hi> preſented themſelves to the <hi>State,</hi> and being received
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65997:341"/>
with Reſpect, were placed on a Form behind the Council, and ſate
covered. They did good Service in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and particularly, gave
great ſatisfaction to the Army, <hi>that Care was taken for Pay and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</hi>
They alſo made a Book, which contained a Subſcription of
moſt of the Officers in the Army, to take Debentures on the Forfeited
Lands, for a certain Proportion of their Pay, as believing <hi>they would
fight the better, and end the War the ſooner, if they were intereſted in the
Fruits of the Victory, as well as in the Quarrel.</hi> But the King diſliked
that Courſe, becauſe it might take up ſo much of the Rebels Lands,
that would hinder all Hopes of a peace with them, which His Majeſty
began to have ſome Hopes of; and therefore ſeveral Officers (well
enough inclined to the Propoſal) omitted to ſubſcribe; and ſome that
had ſubſcribed, deſired to retract; So that at length theſe Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were ſo ſharply threatned, that they delivered up the Book to be
cancelled. Nevertheleſs, they promoted the March of the Army to
enlarge their Quarters, which afterwards produced the Battel of
<hi>Roſs:</hi> but ſome of the Cavalier-party looking upon theſe Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
as Spies, procured a Reprimand to the Lords Juſtices, for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to ſit covered in the Council-chamber, and the King's poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Orders for their Return; which was performed the Twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>February,</hi> to the very great prejudice of the Affairs of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and to the great diſguſt of the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> under their General <hi>Preſton,</hi> had beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Ballynakill,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> with Six hundred Foot and Two
Troops of Horſe, was ſent to relieve it: He marched out of <hi>Dublin</hi>
the Fifth day of <hi>December,</hi> and upon his approach the Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from the Siege, and politickly marched to a Place of Advantage
between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army and <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Battel of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machoo.</hi>
                     </note> to intercept them in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
But the Rebels had not ſo much <hi>Courage</hi> as <hi>Cunning;</hi> for tho'
they were Fourteen hundred Foot and Three hundred Horſe, yet upon
the loſs of about Threeſcore that were ſlain upon the firſt Volley,
they baſely ran away, and left the Road open for <hi>Monk</hi> to march to
<hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, Sir <hi>Richard Greenvill,</hi> with Two hundred Horſe and
One thouſand Foot, on the Twentieth of <hi>January</hi> marched to raiſe the
Siege of <hi>Athloan,</hi> and carry Supplies to that Gariſon, both which he
effected; but in his Return he was encountred by Three thouſand four
hundred Foot,<note place="margin">Battel of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conell.</hi>
                     </note> and Six Troops of Horſe, at <hi>Raconell,</hi> in a place of
great diſadvantage to him: Nevertheleſs, he had the good fortune to
defeat the Rebels, with the ſlaughter of Two hundred and fifty of
their Men, and to take the General <hi>Preſton</hi>'s eldeſt Son, and ſome other
Priſoners. But that which rendred this Victory the more valuable,
was an ancient Prophecy, <hi>That whoever won the Battel of</hi> Raconell,
<hi>ſhould gain all</hi> Ireland; therefore this Victory troubled and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Superſtitious <hi>Iriſh</hi> exceedingly.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt return to the Lords Juſtices, who in <hi>November,</hi> 1642.
tranſmitted to His Majeſty a Petition from the Confederates, by the
Name of <hi>The Roman Catholicks of Ireland,</hi> deſiring His Majeſty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
Commiſſioners to hear their Grievances: And accordingly a

and by him confidently delivered at the Council-Board, to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>State:</hi> It impowered the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Earls of
<hi>Clanrickard</hi> and <hi>Roſcomon,</hi> Sir <hi>Maurice Euſtace,</hi> and others, to hear and
report their Complaints; and in order to it, the Three laſt went to

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:65997:342"/>
and <hi>John Walſh,</hi> (the Confederates Agents) on the Seventeenth of
<hi>March,</hi> 1642. preſented a Remonſtrance of Grievances, which one
truly calls <hi>an Infamous Pamphlet,</hi> and contains ſo much falſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Arguments <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> and downright Untruths, as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifeſts, <hi>That the</hi> Iriſh <hi>firſt reſolved to rebel, and then ſet their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
and Divines on work to fiſh for Arguments to juſtifie, or at leaſt excuſe

the falſe and ſcandalous Remonſtrance of the inhuman and bloody Rebels of
Ireland,</hi> which ſufficiently confuted all their vain Pretences; and both
of them being eſſentially neceſſary to this Hiſtory, are in ſubſtance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>Appendix 5, &amp;</hi> 6. But this Remonſtrance met with better For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament, which ſat the Ninth of <hi>April;</hi> for the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were then unluckily dividing into the Factions of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and
<hi>Puritan,</hi> and ſome of the former, very unwiſely, to back their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt that Remonſtrance, compared it with the <hi>Scots Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
which engendred ſuch Heats in the Houſe, that the Parliament
was prorogued to the Sixth of <hi>May,</hi> 1643.</p>
                  <p>However, the Proteſtant Army did not neglect to ſollicit their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs

at <hi>Oxford, (quod vide Burlace,</hi> 112.) and on the Firſt of <hi>December</hi>
they received the following Gracious Anſwer from the King.</p>
                  <p>THat His Majeſty hath, ſince the beginning of that monſtrous Rebellion,
had no greater Sorrow, than for the Bleeding Condition of that His

be afforded to the ſame, and conſented to all Propoſitions (how diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
ſoever to Himſelf) that have been offered Him for that purpoſe; and
at firſt recommended their Condition to Both Houſes of Parliament, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
of His own mere Motion ſent over ſeveral Commiſſions, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſome Proportion of Arms and Ammunition (which the Petitioners well
know to have been a great Support to the Northern Parts of that Kingdom)
to be conveyed to them out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and offered to find Ten thouſand
Voluntiers to undertake that War, but hath often ſince preſt by many ſeveral
Meſſages, that ſufficient Succours might be haſtned thither, and other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ſmaller Importance laid by, which did divert it; and offered, and
moſt really intended, in His own Royal Perſon to have undergone the Danger
of that War, for the Defence of His Good Subjects, and the Chaſtiſement of
thoſe <hi>perfidious and barbarous Rebels;</hi> and in His ſeveral Expreſſions of
His Deſires of Treaty and Peace, hath declared the miſerable preſent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and certain future Loſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be one of His principal Motives,
moſt earneſtly to deſire, that the preſent Diſtraction of this Kingdom might
be compos'd, and that others would concur with Him to the ſame End: So
His Majeſty is well pleaſed that His Offers, Concurrence, Actions, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
are ſo rightly understood by the Petitioners, and thoſe who have

                  <p>But whatever good words the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proteſtant Committee met with,
it is certain they got but very little Aſſiſtance; ſo that the Lords Juſtices
were reduced to the laſt Extremity, whereupon they ordered the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens

Two thouſand five hundred Foot, and Five hundred Horſe under the

<hi>Caſtlemartin</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> and on the Fourth took <hi>Tymolin</hi> with the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of One hundred Rebels; and on the Twelfth they came before
the Town of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and having made a Breach in the Walls they aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, but without effect; whereupon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army under General

moſt of them were Men of known Courage, yet they fled very early,

On the Eighteenth of <hi>May,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Inſiquin</hi> defeated a Party

at <hi>Kilcrea</hi> had notice of it, and believing that the Troop had

<hi>Bandon,</hi> and took away the Cattel belonging to the Town; but the

deſigned) were juſt ready mounted when this Adventure happened;
ſo that they immediately iſſued out and recovered the Prey at <hi>Brinny

                  <p>But theſe ſmall Victories were balanced by ſome conſiderable Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

                  <p>Neither was it a ſmall Misfortune to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that about this time

he pleas'd into the County of <hi>Londonderry.</hi> To revenge this, the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Gariſon at <hi>Charlemont</hi> built ſome Boats, with which they ſailed down
the <hi>Black-water</hi> into <hi>Loghneagh,</hi> and preyed and plundered all the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
thereof. Hereupon thoſe at <hi>Antrim</hi> built a Boat of Twenty Tun,
and furniſh'd it with Six Braſs Guns; and they alſo got Six or Seven
leſſer Boats, and in them all they ſtowed Three hundred Men, under
the Command of Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Owen O Conally</hi> (the Diſcoverer
of the Rebellion, who was a ſtout and active Man) and Captain <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
Theſe ſailed over the <hi>Logh,</hi> and Landed at the Mouth of the
<hi>Black-water,</hi> where they caſt up Two ſmall Forts, and return'd: But
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> found Means to paſs by theſe Forts in dark Nights, and not
only continued their former manner of Plundring, but alſo raiſed a
ſmall Fort at <hi>Clanbrazill,</hi> to protect their Fleet upon any Emergency.
Upon notice of this, <hi>Conally</hi> and <hi>Langford</hi> Mann'd out their Navy
again, and met the <hi>Iriſh</hi> near the Shore of <hi>Clanbrazill;</hi> whereupon a
Naval Battel enſued: But the Rebels being Freſh-water Soldiers, were
ſoon forced on Shore; and the Victors purſuing their Fortune, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them to the Fort, and forc'd them to ſurrender it: And in
this Expedition Sixty Rebels were ſlain, and as many were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
which, together with the Boats, were brought in Triumph to
<hi>Antrim.</hi>

very Soul for the Calamities of His Good Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and being
moſt tenderly ſenſible of the falſe and ſcandalous Reports diſperſed amongst
the People concerning the Rebellion there, which not only wounds His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
in Honour, but likewiſe greatly retards the Reducing of that unhappy
Kingdom, and multiples the Diſtractions at home, by weakning the mutual
Confidence betwixt Him and His People; Out of His Pious Zeal to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of Almighty God, in Eſtabliſhing the True Protestant Profeſſion in that
Kingdom, and His Princely Care for the Good of all His Dominions, hath
firmly reſolved with all convenient ſpeed to go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to chaſtize thoſe
<hi>wicked and deteſtable Rebels,</hi> (odious to God and all good Men) thereby ſo
to ſettle the Peace of that Kingdom, and the Security of This, that the very
Name of Fears and Jealouſies may be no more heard of amongst us.</p>
                  <p>And as His Majesty doubts not, but that His Parliament will chearfully
give all poſſible Aſſistance to this good Work; ſo He requires them, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65997:345"/>
all His Loving Subjects, to believe, That he ſhall upon thoſe Conſiderations
as earneſtly purſue this Deſign, (not declining any Hazard of His Perſon in

                  <p>His Majeſty hath further thought fit to advertiſe His Parliament, That
towards this Work He intends to raiſe forthwith by His Commiſſions, in the
Counties near <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> a Guard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Charge of Raiſing and Paying whereof, His Majeſty deſires
His Parliament to add to their former Undertakings for that War, which
His Majeſty will not only well accept, but if their Pay be found too great a

                  <p>Towards this good Work, as His Majeſty hath lately made Diſpatches
unto <hi>Scotland</hi> to quicken the Levies there for <hi>Ulſter,</hi> ſo he heartily wiſhes,
That His Parliament here would give all poſſible Expedition to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſuch Perſons as were recommended to
Him by Both Houſes of Parliament) will raiſe full Sums of Money for the
doing thereof.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty hath been likewiſe pleaſed (out of His earneſt deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all Occaſions which do unhappily multiply Miſunderſtandings between
Him and His Parliament) to prepare a Bill to be offered to them by His
Attorney, concerning the Militia, whereby He hopes the Peace and Safety of
this Kingdom may be fully ſecured, to the general ſatisfaction of all Men,
without violation of His Majeſty's juſt Rights, or prejudice to the Liberty of
the Subject. If this ſhall be thankfully received, He is glad of it; if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
He calls God and all the World to judge on whoſe part the Default is.
One thing His Majeſty requires, (if this Bill be approved of) That if any
Corporation ſhall make their Lawful Rights appear, they may be reſerved to
them.</p>
                  <p>Before His Majeſty ſhall part from <hi>England,</hi> He will take all due Care

tranſported, and maintained at their Charge; which You are pleaſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to us, not as a Matter wherein Your Majeſty deſires the Advice of
Your Parliament, but as already firmly reſolved on, and forthwith to be put
in Execution, by granting out Commiſſions for the Levying of Two thouſand
Foot and Two hundred Horſe for a Guard for Your Perſon, when You ſhall
come into that Kingdom: Wherein we cannot chuſe but with all Reverence
and Humility to Your Majeſty, obſerve, That You have declined Your Great
Council, the Parliament, and varied from the uſual Courſe of Your Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors;
That a Buſineſs of ſo great Importance, concerning the Peace and
Safety of all Your Subjects, and wherein they have a ſpecial Intereſt by Your
Majeſty's Promiſe, and by thoſe great Sums which they have disburſed, and
for which they ſtand ingaged, ſhould be concluded and undertaken without
their Advice. Whereupon we hold it our Duty to declare, That if at this
time Your Majeſty ſhall go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> You will very much endanger the
Safety of Your Royal Perſon and Kingdoms, and of all other States profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and make way to the Execution
of that cruel and bloody Deſign of the Papiſts, every where to root out and
deſtroy the Reformed Religion, as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts have in a great part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
effected in that Kingdom, and in all likelihood would quickly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
in other Places, if the Conſideration of the Strength and Union of
the Two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> did not much hinder and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Execution of any ſuch Deſign. And that we may manifeſt to Your
Majeſty the Danger and Miſery which ſuch a Journy and Enterprize would
produce, we preſent to Your Majeſty the Reaſons of this our humble Opinion
and Advice.</p>
                              <list>
                                 <item>1. Your Royal Perſon will be ſubject not only to the Caſualty of War, but
to Secret Practices and Conſpiracies; eſpecially Your Majeſty continuing Your
Profeſſion to maintain the Proteſtant Religion in that Kingdom, which the
Papiſts are generally bound by their Vow to extirpate.</item>
                                 <item>2. It will exceedingly encourage the Rebels, who do generally profeſs and
declare, That Your Majeſty doth favour and allow their Proceedings, and
that this Inſurrection was undertaken by the Warrant of Your Commiſſion;
and it will make good their Expectation of great Advantage by Your
Majeſty's Preſence at this time of ſo much Diſtraction in this Kingdom,
whereby they may hope we ſhall be diſabled to ſupply the War there, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
there appearing leſs Neceſſity of Your Majeſty's Journy at this time, by
reaſon of the manifold Succeſſes which God hath given againſt them.</item>
                                 <item>3. It will much hinder and impair the Means whereby this War is to be
ſupported, and increaſe the Charge of it, and in both theſe reſpects make it
more inſupportable to Your Subjects. And this we can confidently affirm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
many of the Adventurers who have already ſubſcribed, do, upon the
knowledge of Your Majeſties Intention, declare their Reſolution, not to pay in
their Money; and others, very willing to have ſubſcribed, do now profeſs the
contrary.</item>
                                 <item>4. Your Majesties Abſence must neceſſarily very much interrupt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of Parliament, and deprive Your Subjects of the Benefit of thoſe
further Acts of Grace and Justice which we ſhall humbly expect from Your
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65997:346"/>
Majeſty for the Eſtabliſhing of a perfect Union and mutual Confidence, between
Your Majeſty and Your People, and procuring and confirming the Proſperity
and Happineſs of both.</item>
                                 <item>5. It will exceedingly increaſe the Jealouſies and Fears of Your People,
and render their Doubts more probable, of ſome force, intended by ſome evil
Counſels near Your Majeſty, in oppoſition of the Parliament, and favour of
the Malignant Party of this Kingdom.</item>
                                 <item>6. It will bereave Your Parliament of that advantage, whereby they were
induced to undertake this War, upon Your Majeſties Promiſe, that it ſhould
be managed by their Advice, which cannot be done, if Your Majeſty contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to their Counſels, ſhall undertake to Order and Govern it in Your own
Perſon.</item>

                              <p>Upon which, and divers other Reaſons We have reſolved, by the full and
concurring Agreement of both Houſes, that We cannot with diſcharge of our
Duty, Conſent to any Levios or raiſing of Soldiers to be made by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
for this your intended Expedition into <hi>Ireland;</hi> or to the Payment of
any Army or Soldiers there, but ſuch as ſhall be employed and governed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Our Advice and Direction; and that if ſuch Levies ſhall be made by
any Commiſſion of your Majeſty, (not agreed too by both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
We ſhall be forced to interpret the ſame to be raiſed to the Terror of
your People, and diſturbance of the publick Peace; and hold our ſelves bound
by the Laws of the Kingdom, to apply the Authority of Parliament to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the ſame.</p>
                              <p>And We do further moſt humbly Declare, That if your Majeſty ſhall by ill
Counſel be perſwaded to go contrary to this Advice of your Parliament, (which
We hope your Majeſty will not) We do not in that Caſe hold Our ſelves bound
to ſubmit to any Commiſſioners which your Majeſty ſhall chuſe, but do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to preſerve and govern the Kingdom, by the Counſel and Advice of
Parliament, for your Majeſty and your Poſterity, according to Our Allegiance
and the Law of the Land.</p>
                              <p>Wherefore We do moſt humbly Pray and Adviſe your Majeſty, to deſiſt
from this your intended Paſſage into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from all Preparations of
Men and Arms tending thereunto, and to leave the managing of that War
to your Parliament, according to your Majeſties Promiſe made unto Us, and
your Royal Commiſsion Granted under your Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of both Houſes; in Proſecution whereof by God's Bleſſing, We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made a proſperous Entrance by many defeats of the Rebels, whereby
they are much weakened and diſheartened, and have no probable means of
Subſiſtence, if Our Proceedings ſhall not be interrupted, by this Interpoſition of
your Majeſties Journey; but that we may hope upon good Grounds, that within
a ſhort time, without hazard of your Majeſties Perſon, and ſo much dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Confuſion to your Kingdoms (which muſt needs enſue) if you ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in this Reſolution; We ſhall be enabled fully to vindicate your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Right and Authority in that Kingdom, and puniſh thoſe horrible Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
Cruelties, which have been committed in the murthering and ſpoiling
ſo many of your Subjects; and bring that Realm to ſuch a Condition as may

that Declaration; We have great cauſe to doubt, whether it be in Our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to ſay, or do any thing which ſhall not fall within the like Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but as we have in that Meſſage called God to witneſs the Sincerity of the
Profeſſion of Our only Ends, for the undertaking that Journey: So We muſt
appeal to all our good Subjects, and the whole World, whether the Reaſons
alledged againſt that Journey, be of weight to ſatisfie Our underſtanding,
or the Counſel Preſented to diſſwade Us from it, be full of that Duty, as is
like to prevail over Our Affections.</p>
                              <p>For Our Reſolving of ſo great a buſineſs without the Advice of Our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
We must remember you, how often by Our Meſſages We made the
ſame offer if you ſhould Adviſe Us thereunto. To which, you never gave
Us the leaſt Anſwer; but in your late Declaration told Us, That ye were not
to be ſatisfied with Words: So that we had Reaſon to conceive you rather
avoided (out of regard to our Perſon) to give Us Counſel to run that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
than that you diſapproved the inclination. And what greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
or Security can the Proteſtants of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> receive, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap>n by ſeeing
a Proteſtant King venture and engage his Perſon, for the defence of that
Profeſſion, and the Suppreſſing of Popery; to which, We Solemnly proteſted in
that Meſſage, never to Grant a Toleration upon what Pretence ſoever, or
an Abolition of any of the Laws there in force, againſt the Profeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And when We conſider the great Calamities and unheard of Cruelties, Our
poor Proteſtant Subjects in that Kingdom, have undergone for the ſpace of near
or full Six Months, the growth and increaſe of the Strength of thoſe barbarous
Rebels, and the evident Probability of foreign Supplies, (if they are not ſpeedily
ſuppreſſed) the very ſlow Succours hitherto ſent them from hence; That the Officers
of ſeveral Regiments, who have long time been allowed Entertainment from

That many Troops of Horſe have long lain near <hi>Cheſter</hi> untranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;

And when We conſider, the many and great Scandals raiſed upon Our Selves
by report of the Rebels, and not ſufficiently diſcountenanced here, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo many Profeſſions of Ours; And had ſeen a Book lately Printed by the
Order of the Houſe of Commons, Entituled, <hi>A Remonſtrance of divers
remarkable Paſſages, concerning the Church and Kingdom of</hi> Ireland:
Wherein ſome Examinations are ſet down, which (how improbable or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
ſoever) may make an impreſſion in the Minds of many of Our weak
Subjects; And Laſtly, when We duly weigh the Diſhonour, which will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
lye upon this Kingdom, if full and ſpeedy Relief be not diſpatched
thither, We could, not nor cannot think of a better way to diſcharge Our Duty
to Almighty God, for the defence of the true Proteſtant Profeſſion, or to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
Our Affection to Our Three Kingdoms for their Preſervation, than by
engaging Our Perſon in this Expedition, as many of Our Royal Progenitors
have done, even in Foreign parts, upon Cauſes of leſs Importance and Piety,
with great Honour to themſelves, and advantage to this Kingdom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
We expected at leaſt Thanks for ſuch Our inclination.</p>
                              <p>For the Danger to Our Perſon, We conceive it neceſſary and worthy of a
King, to adventure his Life to preſerve his Kingdom; neither can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
That We will ſit ſtill and ſuffer Our Kingdoms to be loſt, and Our
good Proteſtant Subjects to be Maſſacred, without expoſing Our own Perſon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65997:347"/>
to the utmoſt hazard for their Relief and Preſervation; Our Life when it
was moſt Pleaſant, being nothing ſo precious to Us, as it is and ſhall be to
govern and preſerve Our People with Honour and Juſtice.</p>
                              <p>For any Encouragement to the Rebels, becauſe of the Reports they raiſed,
We cannot conceive, that the Rebels are capable of a greater Terror, than by
the Preſence of their Lawful King in the Head of an Army: Beſides, it
will be an unſpeakable advantage to them, if any Reports of theirs could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Us from doing any thing which were fit for Us to do if ſuch Reports
were not raiſed; This would quickly teach them in this jealous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Age, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
by ſuch Reports any other Perſons coming againſt them, whom they had
no Mind ſhould be employed.</p>
                              <p>We marvel that the Adventurers, whoſe advantage was a principal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

We hope (by Gods Bleſſing) to uſe in this Service, this being the moſt

                              <p>We think not Our Self kindly uſed, That the Addition of ſo few Men to
your Levies (for a Guard to Our Perſon in <hi>Ireland</hi>) ſhould be thought fit for

in their being there to be Armed, and that not till they were ready to be

(all which appears ſufficient to deſtroy all Grounds of jealouſie, of any force

                              <p>Neither can it be underſtood, That when We recommended the managing of
that War to you, that We intended to exclude Our Self, or not to be concerned

not put it in Practice. We look upon you as Our great Council, whoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

to find the work of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo eaſie, as you ſeem to think it, which did not
ſo appear by any thing known to Us, when We ſent our Meſſage. And tho
We will never refuſe, or be unwilling to venture our Perſon, for the good

and therefore, ſince you ſeem to have received Advertiſement of
ſome late and great Succeſſes in that Kingdom, We will ſtay ſome time to

make (in which We will obſerve punctually the former, and all other Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

what is legal) will be ſo much to the Satisfaction of our Subjects; as no

                              <p>We were ſo careful, that our Journey into <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould not interrupt the
Proceedings of Parliament, nor deprive our Subjects of any Acts of Juſtice,
or further Acts of Grace, for the real benefit of our People; that We made
Free offer of leaving ſuch Power behind; as ſhould not only be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the Peace and Safty of that Kingdom, but fully provide for the
happy Progreſs of the Parliament. And therefore, We cannot but wonder,
ſince ſuch Power hath been always left here by Commiſſion for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the Land have ye now found, to diſpenſe with you, from ſubmitting to
ſuch Authority, legally derived from Us in our abſence, and to enable you to

                              <p>For our Return towards <hi>London,</hi> We have given you ſo full an Anſwer

If you will not provide for our Security with you, nor agree to remove to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that (ſince We have been ſo particular in the Cauſes and Grounds of our

                              <p>To this the King made a Reply, which in Effect was, <hi>That He did

and Council did ſend a preſſing Letter to the Lieutenant General
to keep the Army abroad, becauſe there was no Subſiſtence for them
in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and the better to enable him thereunto, they ſent him Six
thouſand Pound of Bisket, and Ten Barrels of Powder, and the like
quantity of Match and Musket Bullet; yet the Wants of the Army
were ſo great in all manner of Neceſſaries, that it was impoſſible to
keep the Field; and therefore they returned to <hi>Dublin.</hi>

                              <p>It is one of the moſt difficult things in the World, to keep an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid
Army in exact Diſcipline, for the Soldier that is denied his Due,
will expect a Connivance upon any Extortion, that is leſs than Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to his Pay; and from one Degree it paſſes to another, till it Centers
in Licentiouſneſs, and thus it happened in <hi>Dublin;</hi> the Officers at firſt
winked at the little Rapines of the Soldiers, till at length they openly
plundered the Markets, but this was the way to ſpoil all, and, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
the Market Folks to ſtarve themſelves; therefore it was
ſtrictly prohibited by a ſevere Proclamation, and ſome Offenders
were made Examples; whereupon many of the Officers of the Army
on the Fourth of <hi>April</hi> 1643, preſented the Government with a very
bold and threatning Remonſtrance, (<hi>quod vide Appendix</hi> 20.) which
they ſay was another Cauſe of the enſuing Ceſſation.</p>
                              <p>But General <hi>Preſton</hi> having again beſieged <hi>Ballynakill,</hi> Colonel <hi>Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>

could not perform it; and ſo that place was ſurrendred.</p>

                              <p>But the Lords Juſtices and Council were tyred in contriving ways
to ſupport the Soldiery, and at length they thought upon an <hi>Exciſe,</hi>
and by their proclamation of the Twenty fourth day of <hi>June</hi> impoſed it
for Six Months, unleſs other relief for the Army ſhould be ſent in
the mean time: This Exciſe was exceeding high, amounting to half
the value of the Commodity, in lieu whereof the Retailer was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to advance his Price a Moiety more than it was before. The
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> conſidered the neceſſity of this Tax, and patiently ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

But in <hi>Connaught</hi> the Proteſtant Affairs were in a worſe Condition,
for tho' they made a ſhift to repell the Incurſions of <hi>Owen Roe,</hi> and at
lenghth to drive him out of that Province; yet in <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Fort of
<hi>Gallway</hi> was ſurrendred to the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> whereupon the Rebels marched to
the Siege of <hi>Caſtlecoot,</hi> to which, the Town of <hi>Gallway</hi> contributed
Three hundred Pound; and altho' the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had Notice of a Ceſſation
by a Meſſenger ſent on purpoſe, yet they impriſoned him as a Spy, and
ſhot the more furiouſly againſt the Caſtle,<note place="margin">☞</note> until at length, perceiving
their Labour was in vain, they claimed the benefit of the Ceſſation to

                              <p>On the Twenty third of <hi>June,</hi> 1643. the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commiſſioners, <hi>viz.</hi>

his Lordſhip ſitting in his Chair covered, and they uncovered; his
Lordſhip told them, <hi>He was come according to their Deſires, and expected their

alledging that they were ready to ſhew theirs and give a Copy,

<hi>The Negotiation might be kept ſecret, and concealed from all others

for the way of proceeding, he was by his Majeſty truſted therewith, and
ſhould do nothing therein, but what he conceived to be fit;</hi> then having
received a Copy of their Commiſſion, and ſent them a Copy of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Letter of the Third of <hi>May,</hi> 1643, and Promiſed them upon
concluſion of the Treaty, a Copy of his Majeſties Letter of the
Twenty third of <hi>April</hi> 1643; they tendered Propoſitions, and having
agreed, that the time of the Ceſſation ſhould be a Twelvemonth; the
Marqueſs propoſed that they would firſt declare, what they would
contribute towards the ſupport of His Majeſties Army during the Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

the Name or Title attributed by the Commiſſioners to their Party,

to their Propoſals, and Tacked to it Four demands, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
2. A Declaration how far the Quarters of each Party extended.
3. For Caution of Payment of ſuch Supply, as they ſhould Promiſe;

                                 <hi>Hereupon the Treaty was adjourn'd, that the Commiſſioners might

to the Firſt,</hi> That 'tis not warranted by His Majesty's Letter;
however, on the Concluſion of the Ceſſation they will do what is fit. <hi>To the
Second,</hi> They agree to ſettle that Point. <hi>To the Third,</hi> That a Free Gift

Anſwers are neither ſo particular nor ſo ſatisfactory as he expected, yet he
deſign'd to meet them; but that his neceſſary Attendance on other Buſineſs
prevents it; which being over, they ſhall have timely notice of a Day of

reply,</hi> That they are loth to give an ill Conſtruction of this Delay,
until they know of that Service that taketh place of This; but muſt take
notice, that they meet in Theſe, as in all other Proceedings whereby they may
have any expectation to enjoy the Benefit of His Majeſty's Grace and Favour,
ſome Interruption and Slackneſs in conveying any part of His Good Intentions
to His Faithful Subjects the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which they may add to
their other Grievances, and will endeavour, in diſcharge of the many Harms
which may enſue by reaſon of this Protraction, to have it rightly repreſented

                                 <hi>To this ſmart Reply,</hi> Ormond, <hi>on the Twenty firſt of</hi> July, <hi>return'd
this Anſwer,</hi> That he was not accountable with the Knowledge of any of his
Majeſty's Services wherewith he had the Honor to be intruſted, to any but
His Majeſty: That nevertheleſs they were not ignorant of the Cauſe of that
Interruption, ſince their General <hi>Preſton</hi> with their Forces approach'd ſo near

                                 <hi>But on the Fifth of</hi> August, <hi>the Lords Juſtices</hi> Borlace <hi>and</hi> Titchborn,
<hi>together with the Marquis of</hi> Ormond, <hi>ſent the Commiſſioners a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
importing,</hi> That they had received His Majeſty's Letter, authorizing
<hi>Them</hi> to conclude a Ceſſation for a Year; and that purſuant to it, <hi>Ormond</hi>
would meet the Commiſſioners at <hi>Sigginſtown</hi> on the Seventeenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
and proceed where he left off. <hi>But afterwards, at the deſire of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Note,</hi> In the New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Lord <hi>Gormanſtown</hi> was omitted, and <hi>Nicholas Plunket</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Barnwall</hi> were added.</note>
(<hi>their Commiſſioners being diſperſed) the Meeting was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the Twenty ſixth of</hi> August; <hi>and then inſiſting upon the</hi> Title,
Name, <hi>and</hi> Protestation <hi>aforeſaid, they give a Reply in Writing to the
Anſwers formerly given by the Marquis. On the Twenty eighth of</hi>
August, Ormond <hi>anſwers that Reply; and the Twenty ninth of</hi> August,
<hi>they anſwer that: And ſo after many alternate Meſſages and Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations,
on the Firſt of</hi> September <hi>they began to aſcertain the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Quarters; and the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Commiſſioners having on the Second of</hi>
September <hi>propoſed,</hi> That the Limitation of Quarters ſhould relate to the
Day of Concluding the Ceſſation, <hi>the Marquis of</hi> Ormond <hi>on the Third
of</hi> September <hi>did offer</hi> a Temporary Ceſſation from that Day, <hi>that they
might be at the more leiſure to manage the Treaty. To which they
anſwer, (the ſame day</hi>) That the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> and Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
their Quarters, and Gariſon'd ſome Undefencible Houſes and Castles;
and if thoſe be restor'd, they are contented that both Armies may withdraw
to their reſpective Gariſons. Ormond <hi>replies,</hi> That he will conſent to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
both Armies; and as to the Reſtitution of Places, it ſhall be conſidered
in the Settlement of the Quarters; and that many of thoſe called Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencible
Places, tho' not thought worthy of a Gariſon, yet were for a long time
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65997:353"/>
abſolutely in his Power, and in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarters, and ſome of them not
far from the Gates of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and therefore not fit to be reſtor'd. <hi>On the
Fifth of</hi> September <hi>they proceeded about limiting the reſpective Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and on the Sixth of</hi> September, Ormond <hi>writes to them,</hi> That he
heard their Forees beſieged <hi>Tully,</hi> a Gariſon Commanded by Sir <hi>George
Wentworth,</hi> who was imployed in procuring Neceſſary Proviſions for him,
and deſires the Siege might be rais'd: <hi>But the Commiſſioners reply'd,</hi>
That <hi>Monk</hi> went to <hi>Wicklow</hi> the Twenty ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and continues
there ravaging and deſtroying the Country: That this very Gariſon of <hi>Tully</hi>
took away the Corn at <hi>Madingſtown,</hi> and therefore they could not hinder a
Repriſal; but if any of his Lordſhips Proviſions be intercepted, they ſhall be
reſtor'd. <hi>On the Seventh of</hi> September, Ormond <hi>inſiſted on withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Forces from</hi> Tully, <hi>and thereupon they ſent an Order to</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlehaven
<hi>to draw off his Army, (knowing, I ſuppoſe, that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Caſtle) and propos'd a Temporary Ceſſation to the Marquis.
On the Eighth of</hi> September, Ormond <hi>propoſes,</hi> That the Proteſtant
Clergy and Proprietors may have a Proportion of their Eſtates in the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Quarters, to ſupport them; and that where Goods were delivered in truſt to
any <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> they may be reſtor'd. <hi>On the Ninth, Quarters were ſetled,
and the Preſervation of Woods agreed upon; but for the Clergy and
Proprietors nothing could be done, becauſe the Ceſſation was Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
and Sufferings of that kind, they ſaid, were reciprocal.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>On the Tenth of <hi>September</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commiſſioners denied to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a Ceſſation as to the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> unleſs it may be for the
whole Province of <hi>Leinſter;</hi> which <hi>Ormond</hi> would not conſent to:
Then they offered a Supply of Thirty thouſand Pounds; but on the
Eleventh the Marquiſs ſent a Meſſage to the Commiſſioners, to order
the Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> to forbear farther Acts of Hoſtility, ſince the
Treaty was ſo near a Concluſion; which they did, and <hi>Ormond</hi> did
the like to his Forces: But it ſeems <hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> notwithſtanding their
<hi>publick</hi> Orders, knew their <hi>private</hi> Meaning, and therefore marched
farther off, to the Caſtle of <hi>Diſert</hi> in the <hi>Queens County,</hi> which he took
after the Ceſſation was finiſhed: But on the Twelfth they inſiſted
upon the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>His Majeſty's moſt Faithful Subjects the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
of Ireland,</hi> and ſaid, That they uſed it in their immediate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to the King; but <hi>Ormond</hi> replied, <hi>That he held it not proper at
that time to be uſed to him.</hi> On the Thirteenth they agreed, That the
Quarters ſhould relate to the Day of the concluding the Ceſſation;
but the Marquis inſiſted, That it was indecent for them to uſe Force
in the County where His Majeſty's Commiſſion of Favour was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and therefore required the Reſtitution of what they had taken
in the County of <hi>Kildare</hi> ſince the laſt of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> But on the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>September</hi> this was refuſed, on pretence that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
incroach'd upon them in the ſame County, by Gariſoning undefenſible
Places; but they offered the fourth Sheaf of <hi>Tully,</hi> and all ſuch Places
ſo ſubdu'd, or 800 <hi>l.</hi> in lieu of it. The Marquis then propos'd to
have the Ceſſation declar'd as from that time, ſince all was agreed;
but the Commiſſioners ſaid, the Articles might be perfected by next day
Noon, and till then the Ceſſation could not be ſaid to be made. And
ſo on the Fifteenth day of <hi>September</hi> the Ceſſation was concluded, and
the Articles and Inſtrument mentioned <hi>Appendix</hi> 16. were perfected,
and a Proclamation <hi>by the Lords Juſtices and Council,</hi> for the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, iſſued accordingly, bearing date at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Nineteenth
day of <hi>September,</hi> 1643. and Circular Letters were likewiſe ſent by
<hi>them</hi> to all Parts of the Kingdom, to give Obedience thereunto. But
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65997:353"/>
before the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> would finiſh this Treaty, he conſulted
all the Great Men and the Chief Commanders then with him, who
gave their Opinions as in the following Inſtrument is contained.</p>

                              <p>But the News of this Ceſſation met with different Entertainment,
according to the Intereſts and Inclinations of thoſe it was carried to.
At the Court of <hi>England</hi> it was received with Joy, and <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Fidelity magnified beyond meaſure: It was admired, that he
could preſerve His Majeſty's Grandeur throughout the whole Treaty,
by not admitting the <hi>Title</hi> nor <hi>Protestation</hi> of the Confederates; his
Prudence and Integrity, in continuing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament, were highly
commended: But that he ſhould be able to get a greater Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from a beggarly Enemy, than the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had ſent
over at any one time till then, could never be ſufficiently applauded;
and to this effect Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> writes in his Letter of the Ninth
of <hi>October,</hi> and adds, <hi>That it is believed there, that the</hi> Iriſh <hi>will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Ceſſation; and therefore adviſes his Excellency to be upon his Guard;
and to take care the King's good Subjects do not ſuffer by their violation of
it; and that the young Lord</hi> Moor, <hi>purſuant to</hi> Ormond'<hi>s Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath all his Father's Offices granted unto him.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had different Sentiments of this Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
they inveighed againſt it, as deſtructive to the diſpoſſeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were kept out of Poſſeſſion by it another
Year at leaſt: They ſaid, it was a Diſcouragement to the Adventurers,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65997:354"/>
whoſe Satisfaction was likewiſe delay'd hereby; They ſaid, it gave an
opportunity to the Rebels to recruit their Forces, and to ſupply
all their Wants: But that which troubled them moſt, was, that they
perceiv'd the King deſign'd to draw ſome of the Proteſtant Forces,
and hoped for ſome of the Popiſh Army from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to aſſiſt Him
againſt the Parliament. In ſhort, they were enraged to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that they Voted to Impeach the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> as a
Traytor againſt the Three Kingdoms, and to diſable him of his
Lieutenancy, and of all Command in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and they alſo made
a formal Declaration againſt the Ceſſation, which is inſerted at
large here, <hi>Appendix</hi> 18. In anſwer to which, the King publiſhed
<hi>The Grounds and Motives of the Ceſſation;</hi> which in effect were, <hi>That
the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Army in</hi> Ireland <hi>could no longer ſubſiſt without Supplies, and
that the Parliament took no care to ſend any; but, on the contrary, the Earl
of</hi> Warwick <hi>intercepted thoſe that His Majeſty ſent; and that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
endeavor'd to draw the</hi> Scotch <hi>Army out of</hi> Ireland <hi>into</hi> England:
<hi>So that, in fine, there was an abſolute Neceſſity of this Ceſſation, as prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to a Peace; which, nevertheleſs, he will never admit, unleſs it be ſuch a
Peace as may be agreeable to Conſcience, Honor, and Juſtice.</hi> But all
this did not ſatisfie thoſe that were periſhing for want of their
Eſtates and Properties, which the Rebels poſſeſt; and were yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inrag'd by the freſh Inſolences and Violences daily committed by
the Confederates; ſo that their Sufferings depriv'd them of that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi>
which at another time would have conſidered the Diſtreſſes of
the Crown, the Neceſſities of the Army, and the other powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to this Temporary Agreement.</p>
                              <p>In like manner, the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> declar'd againſt the Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Adventurers at <hi>London</hi> petition'd againſt it; and even
ſome of the Cavaleers were ſo diſſatisfied at this unfortunate Truce,
that many of the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi>'s Army laid down their Arms, and
the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> withdrew from <hi>Oxford,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s Memoirs.</note> affirming, <hi>That after he had
heard of the Ceſſation, his Conſcience would not give him leave to stay any
longer there:</hi> And ſome others of Quality afterwards followed his
Example.</p>
                              <p>And indeed it appear'd by the Sequel, that the Ceſſation was a mere
Plot of the Confederates, to ruin thoſe by <hi>Treaty,</hi> whom they could
not deſtroy by the <hi>War:</hi> Not that it would have proved ſo, if it had
been honeſtly perform'd, according to their Stipulations and Pretences;
but that by a thouſand Tricks and Subtilties they contraven'd every
Point of it; and beſides the opportunity of reinforcing and furniſhing
themſelves, (which no body blames them for) they left nothing undone
that could tend to the Ruin of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> For whereas before the
Ceſſation the Army lived moſtly upon what they forced from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that Courſe being ſtopped by the Truce, there was no way left to
ſupport them but the 30800 <hi>l.</hi> promiſed by thoſe Articles, and which
was depended upon for that purpoſe; but moſt part of that Money
was delivered in by ſuch Driblets, and ſo very long after it was due,
that it did little Service to thoſe that were to receive it.</p>
                              <p>But that was not the worſt; for the Rebels made uſe of another
Stratagem which no body could ſuſpect, and that was <hi>a Prohibition to all
their Party not to ſell Proviſions to the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>even for ready Money.</hi>
There was no Defence againſt this Flail; and therefore many Places
were deſerted by the Warders, who were ſtarved out of them by this
Contrivance: <hi>Carlo, Athy, Leix, Trim, Dundalk,</hi> and <hi>Naas,</hi> ſuffered
much in this Particular; but it was worſe with the Gariſons in <hi>Conaught,</hi>
                                 <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65997:354"/>
as appears by their Declaration of Grievances ſent to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
wherein they affirm <hi>a Conſpiracy amongst the Iriſh to ſtarve them,</hi>
and that the Iriſh <hi>County Councils</hi> had iſſued out Warrants to ſeize the
Goods and Eſtates of ſuch Confederates as ſhould buy or ſell, <hi>or uſe any
Traffick with the Engliſh,</hi> as appears <hi>Appendix</hi> 19.</p>
                              <p>They alſo committed many ſecret, and ſome publick, Murders, <hi>Peter
St. George</hi> was ſo ſerved at the Caſtle of <hi>Letrim,</hi> where <hi>William St. George</hi>
was likewiſe mortally wounded; and it is reported (but how truly, I
cannot ſay) of a malicious Jeſuit that ſheltered himſelf at <hi>Kinnegad,</hi>
well known thereabouts by the name of Father <hi>Roe,</hi> that he committed
many Murders even in the Highway; but this is more certain, that the
Engliſh were fain to pay Toll or Tribute for paſſage through the Iriſh
Quarters in many places, and that particularly at St. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s Bridge
great Sums of Money were extorted upon that ſcore.</p>
                              <p>Moreover, they had, by cunning and ſecret Intruſions into deſerted
Caſtles and old Houſes, two or three days before the Ceſſation, gotten
Poſſeſſion of much more Land than did belong to them, or than they
could have kept in time of War; nevertheleſs, this Poſſeſſion, though
obtained by Fraud or Violence, was detained by them under the umbrage
of that Treaty. They had alſo another Liberty by theſe Articles, viz. <hi>To
declare in whoſe Quarters they would chooſe to be;</hi> and by this fetch, whole Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies
were loſt, and particularly the Baronies of <hi>Barrymore</hi> and <hi>Imokilly,</hi>
ſcituate between <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Youghall,</hi> and which had been always in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Quarters, and under the Protection of thoſe Gariſons, did, a day or
two before the Ceſſation, declare themſelves to be in the <hi>Iriſh Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and ſo were privileged even to the Gates of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Youghall,</hi>
from Contribution to thoſe Gariſons, until the beginning of the
year 1645.</p>
                              <p>But beſides the Breaches of the Ceſſation in <hi>Conaught,</hi> contained in
their Declaration of Grievances, and the Complaints of <hi>Munſter,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
hereafter <hi>Appendix</hi> 17, there were ſeveral other Violations of thoſe
Articles; as, 1. That the Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> after he had notice of
the Ceſſation, did nevertheleſs batter the Caſtle of <hi>Deſert</hi> in the <hi>Queen</hi>'s
<hi>County,</hi> and when he had taken and plundered it, he ſhewed them the
Articles of the Ceſſation, pretending that they were juſt then come
to hand, and that he was ſorry they did not come ſooner. 2. By the
like Action in continuing the Siege of <hi>Caſtle Coot,</hi> after notice of the
Ceſſation as aforeſaid. 3. By Publiſhing the Pope's Bull after the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
which was an Encouragement to the Rebels to perſiſt in their
Rebellion, and did ſeduce others of the Papiſts that were not then
engaged in it. 4. By taking 369 Head of Cattel from the Suburbs of
<hi>Dublin</hi> on the 18th of <hi>September.</hi> 5. By ſeizing on the <hi>Black Caſtle</hi> of
<hi>Wicklow,</hi> and murdering the Proteſtants there. And, 6. In not ſending
any formed Troops or Regiments to the King's Aſſiſtance, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to do. And laſtly, In not paying the 30800 <hi>l.</hi> according to Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                              <p>But if we are curious to know what was done in <hi>England,</hi> in reference
to the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> we may find, That on the 5th of <hi>May</hi> Sir <hi>Robert
King,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jepſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> waited on His Majeſty with a Bill, <hi>For a
ſpeedy Payment of Moneys ſubſcribed towards the Reducing the Rebels in</hi> Ireland,<note place="margin">Husbands, 2. Part. 161.</note>
                                 <hi>which yet remains unpaid,</hi> which they prayed Him to paſs into an Act;
but His Majeſty deſired firſt to be ſatisfied, how the reſt of that Money
was diſpoſed of, and how he ſhould be ſecured, that what is yet unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſhall not be miſemployed; and whether it be fit to compel
voluntary Subſcribers by a greater Penalty than was at firſt made known
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65997:355"/>
to them, <hi>viz.</hi> The loſs of what they have already paid; and whether
the Power given by this new Bill to <hi>Warner Towſe</hi> and <hi>Andrews,</hi> (whoſe
Integrity he has no aſſurance of) be not too great; and whether Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers
and Creditors may not be prejudiced by the Extents mentioned
in this new Act.</p>
                              <p>And on the 16th of <hi>June</hi> both Houſes iſſued a Declaration, purpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
That the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> is in a ſad condition, but that the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> are in as much want as the <hi>Proteſtants;.</hi> and therefore, if the
later were well ſupplied; the former would be eaſily ſubdued; that <hi>their
Ambition to be independent from</hi> England, <hi>and their inveterate Hatred againſt
the Proteſtant Religion,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Ibid. 217.</note> have been the cauſes of their Barbarouſneſs to the
Engliſh; that they have been aſſiſted by the Catholicks of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
<hi>And can it be,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that God's Enemies ſhould be more violent
and indefatigable for reſtoring Idolatry in a Kingdom foreign to theirs, than we
zealous in propugning God's Truth in our own, againſt Barbarous Traytors and
Monſtrous Idolaters?</hi> Shall the common Incendiaries of both Kingdoms
ſtrip themſelves of all they have to accompliſh our Deſtruction, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
that rich and fruitful Iſland? And ſhall the good People of this
Nation, <hi>of the ſame Blood and Religion with them,</hi> think any thing too
dear to redeem them, ſeeing thereby <hi>we ſecure our ſelves, by preventing
the Rebels from coming hither?</hi> We will therefore, even in this diſtracted
time, aſſeſs 200000 <hi>l.</hi> on the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to be paid in two
Years, which will give credit for the preſent Relief of the Starving
condition of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſhall be reprized to the ſeveral Counties in the
nature of the Adventurers for Land in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Therefore we cannot
doubt of chearful Submiſſion hereunto, ſince we cannot expect, <hi>that God
ſhould bleſs us, if we be wanting to our diſtreſſed Brethren,</hi> and indeed to our
ſelves, <hi>for the malice of the Rebels is ſuch, that if they can root us out of that
Kingdom, they will not deſpair of extirpating us out of this;</hi> and therefore
we recommend all well-affected perſons to a liberal Contribution to ſuch
a pious and commendable Work.</p>
                              <p>And on the 14th of <hi>July</hi> they iſſued another Declaration,<note place="margin">Ibid. 233.</note> for the
farther encouragement of Adventurers.</p>
                              <p>And on the 25th of <hi>July</hi> the Parliament publiſh'd their long Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which deduces the Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi> hiſtorically from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the King's Reign, and concludes, that the Iriſh Rebellion was
projected and incited by thoſe Councils then prevalent with the King,
and that the Queen and her Prieſts, and the Papiſts of all the three
Kingdoms, have been principal Actors and Sticklers therein.</p>
                              <p>And on the 5th of <hi>September</hi> they made an Ordinance, That no man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
upon pain of loſing his Ship, do tranſport any Perſon out of <hi>Ireland</hi>
into <hi>England,</hi> without licenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And on the 18th, they made an
Ordinance, for a Collection for the Clergy of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and on the 18th
of <hi>October,</hi> they made a Weekly Aſſeſſment for the Support of ſuch
Forces in <hi>Ireland</hi> as oppoſe the Ceſſation; and on the 24th, they order,
That no Iriſh man, or Papiſt born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall have Quarter in
<hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                                 </hi> and in <hi>November,</hi> they ordered, That the Solemn League and
Covenant ſhould be taken in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But the Ceſſation being confirmed by Patent under the Great Seal,
the Lieutenant General, purſuant to His Majeſty's repeated Orders, was
buſie in ſending Forces to the Kings Aſſiſtance in <hi>England</hi> and becauſe the
Soldiers were generally very unwilling to fight againſt their own Country
men; whilſt the Iriſh Rebels would inſult over their diſtreſſed Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Relations that ſhould be left behind there was an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oath of

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65997:355"/>
ſeveral Penal Edicts were publiſhed againſt thoſe who ſhould deſert or
return, and ſo in <hi>January</hi> the Regiments of Sir <hi>Michael Ernly,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard
Fleetwood,</hi> Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> Colonel <hi>Gibſon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Warren, &amp;c.</hi> were ſent
from <hi>Leinſter,</hi> as Sir <hi>William Saintleger</hi> and Colonel <hi>Myn</hi> were from
<hi>Munſter;</hi> and though moſt of the former met with their Deſtiny at
<hi>Nantwich,</hi> and the later at the Siege of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> yet the arrival of theſe,
and other Forces out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did influence the Parliament to conſent
to the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> which nevertheleſs did not produce that
happy effect which all good men deſired.</p>
                              <p>And little more than this was done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> except Conteſts about
ſetting out of Quarters, and other Executions of the Articles of Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(which ſhall be mentioned in each Province apart,) and the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for the Treaty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> (which ſhall alſo be taken notice of in

time,</p>
                              <p>JAMES <hi>Marquis of</hi> ORMOND <hi>was ſworn Lord-Lieutenant
at</hi> Chriſtchurch <hi>in</hi> Dublin, <hi>and took the following Oath: Viz.</hi> You ſhall

Lord the King's Majeſty, in the Room and Authority of Lord Lieutenant and
Chief Governor of this His Realm of <hi>Ireland;</hi> you ſhall maintain and defend

the Right of the Crown to be deſtroyed by any way, but ſhall Lett it to your power,

Book.</p>
                              <p>The Lord Lieutenant did immediately ſet himſelf to reform the
Army, and reduced his own Troop to 40, and <hi>Lucas</hi> and <hi>Armſtrong</hi>'s
Troops to 30 each, and the other two Troops to 25 each, ſo that he
had in all but 150 Horſe and 2000 Foot; and to maintain theſe, he was
forced to revive the <hi>Exciſe,</hi> and to lay a Tax of <hi>3d. per</hi> Acre through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that part of the <hi>Pale</hi> under his power, and to ſeize on ſome Debts
and Tobacco belonging to the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and on the 16th of <hi>March</hi> he
iſſued a Proclamation to prohibit Outrages and Robberies on pain of
Death. And thus Matters ſtood in <hi>Ireland</hi> at the end of the Year
1643.</p>
                              <p>Nor can we open the following Year with a better Scene than a Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

the very next day the Speakers of both Houſes iſſued Letters to the

League and Covenant,</hi> and in thoſe Letters they took notice of the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices

Goods and Commodities that ſhall be imported for the Relief of the

                              <p>The Ceſſation being made as hath been already related, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates

the Lords Juſtices and Council, <hi>To tranſmit that Addreſs to His Majeſty,

                              <p>And thus it ſtood till <hi>January,</hi> when His Majeſties Letter of the
Sixth of <hi>November</hi> arrived, and thereby Licenſe was granted to the
Petitioners to ſend their Four Agents; whereupon the Petitioners
choſe Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and Captain <hi>William Parſons</hi> to be added to the
Four they had pitched upon before, and preſented their Names to the
Lord Lieutenant; and on the Seventeenth day of <hi>February</hi> following,
the Commons of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament approved of what the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
had done, and declared their Concurrence therewith; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Petitioners moved the Lord Lieutenant and Council for a
recommendation to His Majeſty, both of their Cauſe and Agents, and
(being demanded) they produced their Inſtructions, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
as is mentioned <hi>Appendix</hi> 22. and then they were informed, that
it would gain them favour with the King, if they carried over their
Companies with them, except Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi>'s which was in <hi>Conaught,</hi>
but Captain <hi>Parſons</hi> his Troop choſe rather to be disbanded, then to
go over to Fight againſt their Countrey-men, but Captain <hi>Ridgway's</hi>
and Sir <hi>Francis Hamiltons</hi> Companies were Tranſported under their
reſpective Lieutenants, tho' very unwillingly; whereupon Major <hi>Jones</hi>
one of the Agents declined the Voyage, rather than remove his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and ſo His Majeſties Letter of the Twenty ſeventh of <hi>February,</hi>
arriving on the Twenty ninth of <hi>March;</hi> whereby Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">1644.</note>
and Captain <hi>Parſons</hi> were Licenſed to attend His Majeſty with the reſt
of the Agents, they had Sealed Letters (of Recommendation) to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<hi>Nicholas,</hi> and took Ship the Second of <hi>April,</hi> and came to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
the Seventh, and on the Eighth kiſſed the Kings hand and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
their Petition (which is to be found at large, <hi>Burlace Appendix
pag.</hi> 62.) ſetting forth, That <hi>the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Rebellion was raiſed out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
to his Bleſſed Government, and for rooting out the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and for diſpoſſeſſing His Majeſty of that Kingdom, without the leaſt
occaſion given by His Majeſty, or his Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> &amp;c. upon reading
whereof the King was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>THAT HE KNEW THE CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENTS
OF THE PETITION WAS TRUTH, AND THAT IT
COULD NOT BE DENIED;</hi> and thereupon it was thus indorſed, <hi>His
Majeſty being very ſenſible of the Petitioners Loſſes and Sufferings, is ready
to hear relieve them, AS THE EXIGENCY OF HIS AFFAIRS WILL
PERMIT, and wiſheth the Petitioners to propoſe what they think fit, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
for His Majeſties information, and the Petitioners remedy and future
Security.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The King alſo told them, <hi>That the</hi> Iriſh <hi>proteſted upon their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to him, that at firſt the Conſpiracy was not General, but that thoſe of
the Pale were forced into Rebellion by the Governours of</hi> Ireland, and that
if the Parliament had permitted him to go into <hi>Ireland</hi> when he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he doubted not, but he ſhould ſoon have ſuppreſſed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                              <p>But the Agents to leave nothing undone that might juſtly advance
their Cauſe, did take Notice of the falſe and Scandalous Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance
of the Confederates from <hi>Trim,</hi> (as they called it) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Printed by <hi>Thomas Burk</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Printer at <hi>Waterford,</hi> with His
Majeſties Arms affixed thereon; was now with Oſtentation and
Inſolence publiſhed at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and they made ſo ſmart an Anſwer
thereunto, as was beyound Reply; both which (Remonſtrance and
Anſwer) are in Subſtance recited, <hi>Appendix</hi> 5. and 6. they alſo, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65997:357"/>
with that Anſwer,<note place="margin">27 April, 1644.</note> preſented unto the King the Propoſals
mentioned <hi>Appendix</hi> 21.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Writings were referr'd by the King to the Committee for
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs, ſome of which were ſo diſaffected to the Proteſtants of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that they ſaid, <hi>The Propoſals were drawn by the Cloſe Committee at
London;</hi> and they wonder'd His Majeſty would receive ſuch a Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Petition.</p>
                              <p>But the Petitioners were Men of Courage, and would not be eaſily
daunted;<note place="margin">30 April.</note> they went next day to the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> Chief of the
Committee, and prayed a Copy of <hi>the Iriſh Propoſals:</hi> He made ſtrange
of it, as if he knew no ſuch thing, and told them, <hi>That they meant
the Iriſh Remonſtrance.</hi> They replied, That was in Print, and common,
and they did not mean It, but they meant the <hi>Iriſh Propoſitions.</hi> His
Lordſhip told them, If any ſuch were, it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at the Committee <hi>April</hi> 19. when thoſe propoſitions were read,
and by him and the reſt, with Charge of inviolable Secreſie, given to
Sir <hi>William Stewart,</hi> and the other Commiſſioners from the Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
Hereupon the Agents addreſs'd themſelves to Sir <hi>William Stewart,</hi> and
the other Commiſſioners from the Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> deſiring them to
get them Audience from the King before Matters went too far in the
Treaty, and to obtain a Copy of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Demands: To which the
next day Sir <hi>George Ratcliff</hi> return'd anſwer, <hi>That they had acquainted
the Lords of the Committee with the Deſires of the Agents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they
were offended that the Agents ſhould be ſo forward in prejudicating His
Majeſty's Juſtice and Theirs, and that they ſhould be heard before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of the Treaty.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>The next day, being the Firſt of</hi> May, <hi>the Agents were ſent for to
the Committee; and their Inſtructions and Propoſals, and the Order
of Concurrence of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Houſe of Commons being read, the Earl
of</hi> Briſtol <hi>told them,</hi> That the King and the Committee were ſenſible of
the prejudicate Opinion the Agents had of their Juſtice, in preſſing to be
heard, and by their belief of vulgar Reports; but that the Agents could not
be more careful of the Proteſtants Perſons and Religion than they were. <hi>The
Agents replied,</hi> That if they had erred in preſſing to be heard, it proceeded
from their Zeal to the Service, and for the Preſervation of that Remnant of
poor Proteſtants that intruſted them, and out of a deſire His Majeſty and
their Lordſhips might be rightly informed of their paſt Sufferings and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Calamities; <hi>and deſired to be admitted to Proof of Particulars.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Hereupon they were ordered to withdraw; and being afterwards
call'd in again, they were commanded to ſubſcribe their Propoſitions,
which they did, and then were ordered to attend the Primate <hi>Uſher,</hi>
the Biſhop of <hi>Downe,</hi> Sir <hi>George Ratcliff, &amp;c.</hi> in the Afternoon; which
they did, and were told by them, how offenſive the Heighth and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs
of their Propoſals were, and that the Committee ſent
them the Meſſage mentioned <hi>Appendix</hi> 21, to which they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
return'd the Anſwer there likewiſe recited. Hereupon Sir
<hi>George Ratcliff</hi> told them, <hi>That whilſt they continued ſo high in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
they muſt expect nothing but War.</hi> They anſwer'd, They were ill
provided for it, but would rather run the hazard of it, than have a
diſhonorable and deſtructive Peace; and that they could not make
farther Alterations in their Propoſals, without betraying their Truſt.
Sir <hi>George</hi> replied, <hi>That if they would abate Three parts of them, he was
ſure the Fourth part would not be granted them: That they were ſent to
preſerve the Protestants; but that if the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Agents return'd without a Peace,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65997:357"/>
they would deſtroy the Remainder of the Proteſtants, ſince the King was not
in a Condition to help them;</hi> and therefore deſired the Agents to think
of ſome way of ſecuring them. They anſwered, That there were
Five Months of the Ceſſation unexpir'd, within which Time, Means of
Relief may be found; and if not, <hi>it were better to quit</hi> Ireland <hi>for a
time, than to make a deſtructive Peace.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Then Sir</hi> George <hi>asked,</hi> How the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould get out of <hi>Ireland?
They ſaid,</hi> By keeping the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Agents in <hi>England</hi> till it is done. <hi>He
replied,</hi> That he would rather adviſe the King to loſe <hi>Ireland,</hi> than break
His Faith with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Agents, who came to Treat with Him upon His
Word; <hi>and that it was not likely, if the</hi> Iriſh <hi>had not good Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Peace, that they would</hi> forbear Arms <hi>till the end of the
Ceſſation.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>On the next day the Agents gave Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> a new Set of
Propoſitions, (to the ſame effect with the former, only a little more
moderate) to be preſented to the King.</p>
                              <p>But on the Seventh of <hi>May,</hi> Sir <hi>William Saintleger</hi> being come to
<hi>Oxford,</hi> told the Lord <hi>George Digby,</hi> That the Proteſtant Forces that
came from <hi>Munſter</hi> were much diſſatisfied that the Proteſtant Agents
from <hi>Ireland</hi> received ſo little Countenance. His Lordſhip anſwered,
<hi>That the greateſt Kindneſs he could do them, was to call them Mad-men,
that he might not call them Roundheads, for putting in ſuch mad Propoſals.</hi>
And he deſired to ſpeak with ſome of them; but they refus'd to come
to one that had expreſſed ſo much Prejudice againſt them.</p>
                              <p>On the Ninth of <hi>May</hi> theſe Agents were ordered to attend the
King and Council, which they did; and His Majeſty told them, <hi>They
were ſent by His Protestant Subjects to move Him in their behalf; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to know in what Condition the Protestants of</hi> Ireland <hi>were to defend
themſelves, if a Peace ſhould not enſue.</hi> They anſwered, <hi>That they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceived, they were employed first to prove their Petition, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the ſcandalous Aſperſions which the Rebels have cast upon His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
Government, and the Protestants of</hi> Ireland. The King replied,
<hi>That it needed not any more than to prove the Sun ſhines, when we all ſee
it.</hi> They anſwered, <hi>That they thought His Majesty was not ſatisfied,
but that thoſe of the Pale were forced into Rebellion by the Governors.</hi> The
King ſaid, <hi>That was but an Aſſertion of the</hi> Iriſh; and then He renew'd
His former Queſtion about their Condition to reſiſt if a Peace did not
enſue. The Agents deſired time to anſwer; but the King told them,
He thought they came prepared to declare the Condition of the whole
Kingdom; and asked them, <hi>Would they have Peace, or no?</hi> The Agents
anſwered, They were bred up in Peace, and were not againſt it, ſo
that it might ſtand with His Majeſty's Honor, and the Safety of His
Proteſtant Subjects in their Religion, Lives, Liberties, and Fortunes.
Then the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> interpos'd, and ſaid, <hi>That the Agents deſir'd a
Peace. Yes,</hi> ſays the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Lindſey, provided
it conſiſts with the King's Honor, and the Proteſtants Safety. And I would
rather</hi> (ſays the King) <hi>that they ſhould have their Throats cut in War,
than SUFFER by a Peace of my making; but I will take Care the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
of</hi> Ireland <hi>ſhall be ſecured.</hi> And then His Majeſty told the Agents,
they ſhould have a Copy of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Propoſals, and Liberty to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
them; but that they were to conſider of Two things: Firſt,
That He was not in a Condition to relieve them with Men, Money,
Ammunition, Arms, or Victuals: And, Secondly, That He could not
allow them to joyn with the New <hi>Scots,</hi> or any others that had taken
the <hi>Covenant.</hi>

The Proteſtant Agents having got a Copy of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
did on the Thirteenth of <hi>May</hi> preſent to His Majeſty a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to them, recited at large <hi>Appendix</hi> 23.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>This Anſwer being read, the King asked,</hi> Whether they had anſwered
according to Law and Juſtice, or prudentially with reſpect to Circumſtances?
<hi>The Agents replied,</hi> That they looked upon the Rebels Propoſitions (<hi>as they
appeared to them</hi>) deſtructive to His Majeſty, His Laws, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and His Proteſtant Subjects of <hi>Ireland. Whereupon the Earl of</hi>
Briſtol <hi>interpos'd, and ſaid,</hi> That if they asked what in Law and Juſtice
was due from the Rebels, their Anſwer was full; but that the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from them what was prudentially fit to be done; <hi>ſeeing the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
are not in a Condition to defend themſelves, and the King will
not admit them to joyn with any</hi> Covenanters.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>The King alſo asked,</hi> What would become of the Proteſtants, if the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Agents ſhould break off the Treaty; which 'tis feared they will do, if
their Propoſitions for the moſt part are not yielded unto? <hi>To which the
Agents replied,</hi> That the Rebels might be brought to better Terms, if they
were held to it; and that they were aſſured the Lord <hi>Muskery</hi> refuſed to
come with limited Inſtructions, but would be at liberty to do as he ſhould
ſee cauſe. <hi>Whereupon they were ordered to withdraw.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But the Proteſtant Agents hearing that Sir <hi>Robert Talbot</hi> and <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
mac Teig O Bryan</hi> had left <hi>Oxford</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> and that
the Lord <hi>Muskery</hi> and the reſt departed thence the 22th, addreſſed
themſelves to Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to know if His Majeſty had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Service for them; and thereupon, on the Thirtieth of <hi>May</hi> they
kiſt the King's Hand, and were told by His Majeſty, <hi>That he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the Marquis of</hi> Ormond <hi>concerning the Proteſtants of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and
that He would uſe His beſt Endeavors for them there, as He did for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
here;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>He meant His good Proteſtant Subjects, and not Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters
or their Adherents.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> you have the Secret of this Great Tranſaction,
whereby you will perceive, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Agents, filled with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of their own Power, and the evil Circumſtances of His
Majeſty's Affairs, thought that the King would purchaſe their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
at any Rate; and therefore inſiſted upon ſuch exorbitant and
unreaſonable Demands as would have ſubverted the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Government, and would have rendred the Proteſtant
Religion at moſt but Tolerated, and that it ſelf but poorly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariouſly.</p>
                              <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agents did not fail to chaſtize this
Vanity, and to mortifie the Confederates with a Scorn and Contempt
both of their Conduct and Courage: They repreſented to the King,
<hi>That the Rebels got more by the Ceſſation, than they could do by the War.</hi>
In fine, they preſs'd the Execution of the Laws, and demanded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for Damages ſuſtained during the Rebellion, and deſir'd that
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> might be diſarm'd, and reduced to a Condition of not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
any more.</p>
                              <p>The Commiſſioners from the Council would gladly have moderated
theſe matters, but they found, <hi>there was no truſt to be repoſed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,</hi>
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Iriſh would not agree to any other terms than what
continued the Power in their own hands; ſo that the Engliſh ſhould
have no other ſecurity of their future Tranquility, but the Honour and
Promiſe of the Rebels.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="143" facs="tcp:65997:359"/>
It was very difficult to reconcile theſe Jarring and Differing Intereſts,
and indeed impoſſible to do it in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore the Iriſh Agents
(who were men of Parts and Addreſs) having cunningly inſinuated to
the King, <hi>That they believed that their Principals, when truly informed of
His Majeſty's circumſtances, would comply with them ſo far, as to moderate
their Demands to what His Majeſty might conveniently grant,</hi> and promiſed
they would ſollicite them effectually to that purpoſe, prevailed with
His Majeſty to ſend over a Commiſſion under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>
to the Lord Lieutenant, to make Peace with his Catholick Subjects,
<hi>upon Conditions agreeable to the Publick Good and Welfare, that might produce
ſuch a Peace and Union in</hi> Ireland, <hi>as might vindicate his Royal Authority
there, and ſuppreſs thoſe in Arms againſt him in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland;
and he alſo ſent Inſtructions to continue the Ceſſation for another
Year.</p>
                              <p>This Commiſſion came to the Lord Lieutenant on the 26th of <hi>July,</hi>
but in regard the Confederates choſe a Clergyman (I ſuppoſe the Biſhop
of <hi>Fernes</hi>) to be one of their Commiſſioners, which <hi>Ormond</hi> would by
no means admit of, the Diſputes about this and other Preliminaries
delayed the Treaty until the 6th of <hi>September,</hi> at which time the Lord
Chancellor (who was Chief of the Commiſſioners for the King) averr'd
before the Confederate Commiſſioners, <hi>That to that day no body had loſt
one drop of Blood upon the Statute of</hi> 2. Eliz. c. 1. <hi>which nevertheleſs was ſo
much complained againſt;</hi> however the Confederates (notwithſtanding
the fair Promiſes their Agents had made at <hi>Oxford</hi>) inſiſted ſtifly on the
Repeal of part of that Statute, and on ſeveral unreaſonable Demands;
whereupon the Treaty was adjourned, until the King's Pleaſure ſhould
be known, in the Particulars wherewith <hi>Ormond</hi> had acquainted him.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Hereupon the King (who had promiſed Archbiſhop</hi> Uſher <hi>at</hi> Oxford,<note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>

That he would not give Toleration to the Papiſts) <hi>writes back to</hi> Ormond,
That he approves his Anſwers to the Rebels Propoſals,<note place="margin">Febr. 16. 1644.</note> and orders him to inſiſt
on them; but if the Iriſh will not be perſwaded to Moderation, then rather to
yield to Terms, (<hi>remitting much of what his Dignity and Intereſt would
inſiſt on at other Times and Circumſtances</hi>) than enter into a new War;
however not to conſent to a Repeal of <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Act, unleſs in caſe of abſolute
neceſſity, and by no means to admit of the Repeal of the Penal Laws againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants,
becauſe that might endanger his Proteſtant Subjects, for whoſe Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
he makes the Peace, ſince he is not able to carry on the War.</p>
                              <p>And about the ſame time His Majeſty ſent Orders to paſs Pardons to
all his Councellors and Servants, <hi>Toties quoties,</hi> as the Lord Lieutenant
and Council ſhall think fit, and to make the Lord Chancellor Baron of
<hi>Bolton,</hi> to him and his Heirs Males, and that the Lord Lieutenant ſhould
make any two Lords he thought fit to be Earls, and ſo the year 1644,
was cloſed with an Adjournment of the Treaty of Peace to the 10th
of <hi>May</hi> following.</p>
                              <p>But it is neceſſary to inſpect the condition of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and how they were manag'd ſince the Ceſſation; and firſt let
us caſt our Eye on <hi>Munſter,</hi> which we ſhall find diſcontented at the
Ceſſation, but much more troubled at the many and daily Infractions

and therefore is added to <hi>Appendix</hi> 25.</p>
                              <p>The Revolt of the Engliſh Forces in <hi>Munſter</hi> occaſioned ſome Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations
between <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Inſiquin,</hi> but without effect, for the later
was reſolved not to hazard himſelf and his Friends by a readmiſſion of
the Secluded Citizens of <hi>Cork,</hi> which the Parliament having notice of,
and being deſirous to Encourage and Reward his Steadineſs and Zeal for
the Engliſh Intereſt, made him Lord Preſident of that <hi>Province.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Nevertheleſs, the Parliament not being in a condition to furniſh <hi>Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
with Supplies, little or nothing was done this year; on the contrary,
the Iriſh and he agreed to a new Temporary Ceſſation, becauſe the
Engliſh were weak, and the Iriſh deſired to preſerve the Baronies of
<hi>Imokilly</hi> and <hi>Barrymore</hi> from Contribution, and ſo it continued until the
Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> renewed the War early in the Spring; and in the
mean time, the ſtrong Fort of <hi>Duncannon</hi> (which had never ſubmitted
to the Ceſſation) was ſurrendered to General <hi>Preſton</hi> on the 6th of
<hi>March</hi> for want of Proviſion, whilſt Sir <hi>Arthur Loftus</hi> (though he got
within the Harbor) was by a Storm, which laſted ten days, hindered
from putting Supplies into the place, which therefore he carried to
<hi>Cork.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But becauſe the Iriſh do deny that there was any deſign to betray
<hi>Cork,</hi> and that it may appear that it was deſigned more than once,
I have thought it neceſſary to add an Extract out of Sir <hi>Richard
Gething</hi>'s Diſpatch to Secretary <hi>Lane,</hi> and to ſubjoyn a certain Letter;
whereof I have ſeen the Original.<note place="margin">Jan. 2. 1644.</note> Sir <hi>Richard Gething</hi> writes, That
one Colonel <hi>Croning</hi> ſent to Major <hi>Muſchamp</hi> to give him a Meeting,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65997:360"/>
which done, after ſome wiſe Preparatives, <hi>exhorting him to be faithful
and loyal to his Majeſty, &amp;c.</hi> He pretended to open him a way to
great Preferment; and <hi>Muſchamp</hi> asking him how, the other replyed,
<hi>By delivering up the Fort of</hi> Cork, <hi>as the Lord Lieutenant ſhould direct.
Muſchamp</hi> anſwered, <hi>That he deſired no eaſier Step to Preferment, than the
Obſervance of the Lord of</hi> Ormond'<hi>s Directions.</hi> Then <hi>Croning</hi> deſired
him to meet a certain Lord the next day, which <hi>Muſchamp</hi> did, and
being firſt obliged to Secrecy, (ſaving liberty to communicate his
mind to an Eccleſiaſtical Friend) that Lord told him plainly, <hi>That
if he would ſurrender the Fort of</hi> Cork <hi>into his hand, he ſhould have the
Lord Marquis of</hi> Ormond'<hi>s warrant for it, and for his Reward great Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Muſchamp</hi> ſaid, he was willing to obſerve the Marquis his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
provided he ſaw an Authentick Warrant; whereupon the aforeſaid
Lord pulled forth a Warrant written with the Marquis his own hand,
(as he pretended) importing, <hi>That whereas he the Marquis was diſabled
to put neceſſary Proviſions of Victuals and Ammunition into the Fort of</hi> Cork
<hi>for the preſent Defence thereof, that therefore he</hi> (Muſchamp) <hi>was required
to deliver up the ſame into the hands of the aforeſaid Lord, aſſuring
him, That whatever Conditions that Lord ſhould condeſcend unto, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
would confirm them.</hi> Hereat <hi>Muſchamp</hi> being aſtoniſhed, did
nevertheleſs promiſe to perform the Contents, if his Lordſhip would
give him the Warrant, but his Lordſhip told him, <hi>He muſt perform the Work
firſt;</hi> but <hi>Muſchamp</hi> thought that prepoſterous, his Lordſhip replyed,
<hi>That then he might write to his Excellency for farther ſatisfaction;</hi> and ſo
they parted, and <hi>Muſchamp</hi> diſcovered all to the Lord <hi>Inſiquin,</hi> as he
was pre-engaged to do; and though (by <hi>Inſiquin</hi>'s advice) <hi>Muſchamp</hi>
ſent twice to the aforeſaid Lord for a Copy of the Warrant, yet he
could get no other anſwer, but <hi>That it was ſent back to the Marquis of</hi>
Ormond; and all this, Major <hi>Muſchamp</hi> declared upon Oath before a
Council of <hi>War.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>At the Diſcovery of this Contrivance, the poor Engliſh were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
and enraged; they thought it equally improbable, that <hi>Ormond</hi>
ſhould give ſuch an Order, or any body elſe ſhould pretend it if it
were not ſo: But as ſoon as the Noiſe of this Affair reached the Lord
Lieutenant's ears, he did not fail to do Juſtice to his own Reputation,
by a ſevere Expoſtulation with that Lord, which produced this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Letter.</p>

pleaſed to Command me to deliver my Knowledge in a Report given out by
one Major <hi>Muſchampe,</hi> wherein your Excellency, as you are pleaſed to take
notice, finds your Self highly concerned. My Lord, before I ſhall proceed to
deliver my Knowledge of that Buſineſs, in the firſt place, I ſhall crave your
Excellency's Pardon, if for compaſſing my own Ends it ſhall appear, that I
have made uſe of your Excellency's Name without warrant, through which
there may ariſe any Blame or Blemiſh to your Lordſhip; this being granted me,
all that I can remember is as followeth.</p>
                                    <p>It is very true, (my Lord,) <hi>Muſchamp</hi> employed one of his Friends unto
me, ſignifying his diſlike of my Lord of <hi>Inchequin,</hi> whom he found to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
in his Actions and Reſolutions for the Parliament, and therefore thought
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65997:361"/>
fit to ſeek my Advice to put him in a preſent way, whereby he may ſecure the
Fort for His Majesty's Service. Truly, my Lord, I was loth to loſe ſuch an
Opportunity to do my Country Service, and immediately returned him
an Anſwer to meet me the next day after at a Caſtle of mine, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that day or the next day after, (as near as I can remember,) and
upon our meeting, he being ſworn to Secrecy in all things, I moved unto him
concerning the Fort, to which he ſeemed to incline, making great Expreſſions
and Fervency in all reſpects to preſerve his Loyalty, and to obſerve (upon the
leaſt inclination or notice) any Commands that ſhould come unto him from your
Excellency: Then, upon further Diſcourſe, he fell to wiſh I had the Fort in my
Poſſeſſion, ſo he were ſure that the Party whereof I was, and my Self, were for
the King; to which I anſwered, That by the good Countenance and Uſage the
reſt of the Commiſſioners and my Self had in <hi>England,</hi> and our coming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Rub or Interruption from thence, might in ſome ſort aſſure him thereof;
which proving not altogether ſatisfactory unto him, he replyed, That if he had
ſeen any Directions from your Excellency for him to diſpoſe of the Place, he
would obey it, to the loſs of his Life, and deliver it either unto me, or any
body elſe your Lordſhip would appoint, which I apprehended a Buſineſs much
conducing to His Majeſty'<hi>s</hi> Service, and the Preſervation of this Province
againſt the Rebels in <hi>England,</hi> into whoſe hands, I was aſſured, the ſame
ſhould be put as now it is; and preſuming that it would not have been prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to His Majeſty or your Lordſhip for me to uſe any Slight or Means to get it
out of their hands, I preſumed to frame a Warrant in your Lordſhip's Name,
authorizing him to Surrender me that Hold to His Majeſty's Uſe, and that
your Lordſhip had received ſufficient Aſſurance from me, to redeliver it upon
Demand, which I read unto him, he would have it into his own hands (as
he alledged) for his Juſtification; but I inſiſted, that I would not part with
the Inſtrument, until the Work were accompliſhed according to the Directions;
whereupon he took time to prepare and conſider of the Buſineſs for two days, as
near as I can remember, and then he was to ſend his farther Reſolution unto
me, or to appoint another Meeting; and ſince I have not heard any thing from
him, but within ſix days after I could hear, that he diſcovered it unto my Lord
of <hi>Inſiquin,</hi> and ſome others, at a Council of War. My Lord, he thought
to catch me, and I was hopeful to catch him; and if in the Progreſs or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the Matter I have ſaid or done any thing that gives your Lordſhip
cauſe of Offence, I crave your Forgiveneſs and Pardon. Your Lordſhip may be
the more Indulgent unto me in this Particular, for that upon my Salvation I
had a full Reſolution (if I had compaſſed the Place upon thoſe Terms) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
all the Engliſh without any prejudice, either in their Lives, Religion or
Goods, and to Surrender it unto your Lordſhip, or ſuch as you would Appoint,
whenſoever your Lordſhip would call for it. My Lord, This is the Truth of
what paſſed between <hi>Muſchamp</hi> and me in that place; I have no more to add
unto it, but that I deſire, if in this I have forfeited any thing of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Opinion, I may be reſtored and accounted by your Excellency,</p>

whereupon Orders were iſſued, bearing date the Eighteenth of <hi>March,</hi>
and Twenty ninth of <hi>March,</hi> to examine the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Complaints againſt

but deſired to adjourn to Thurſday in Eaſter week at <hi>Roſcomon,</hi> which
was agreed to; but when that day came, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commiſſioners did

in <hi>Tulsk</hi> (which place belonged to Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> afterwards Lord <hi>Lanes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burough,</hi>)
the Proprietor demanded the Houſe, which could not be

and having no other Convenient place to carry his Soldiers unto; he
cunningly declared againſt the Ceſſation, and kept Correſpondence
with thoſe of that Faction in <hi>Ulſter;</hi> and hereupon he preyed upon
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to that Degree, that his Gariſon lived, whilſt moſt of the reſt
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were Starving; inſomuch, that as many as could did
flock to him, whereby the other Gariſons were left almoſt empty,
and ſo he continued until the Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> forced him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Ceſſation as that Lord wries in his Memoirs; but I believe
he continued ſo, until his Caſtle was taken by the Lord <hi>Taaf, Anno</hi> 1645.</p>

Monroe <hi>complained to the Lords Juſtices,</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> who were by the

about Midſummer 1644. <hi>Owen Roe</hi> being at the ſame time near
<hi>Portleſter;</hi> but hearing that the Enemy approached, he was glad to
retreat towards <hi>Portleſter;</hi> and having left 600 Foot, and One hundred
Horſe to Guard the Bridge of <hi>Feynagh</hi> over the <hi>Jany,</hi> which had a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

intercepted Letters, who in <hi>November</hi> 1644. wrote to the Supream
Council, to the Effect following, <hi>viz.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>That my Lord (Abbot) <hi>Mountague</hi> ſaid to him in his Ear, that he
ſhould write to your Lordſhips, not to truſt moſt of the <hi>Engliſh, even the
very Catholicks,</hi> who have more <hi>National</hi> then Religious Thoughts.—
That the Queen, talking of <hi>Ormond,</hi> ſaid, it was hard to Truſt Believe, or
Rely upon any <hi>Iriſh-man</hi> that is a Proteſtant, for every ſuch <hi>Iriſh-man</hi> that
goes to Church, does it againſt his Conſcience, and knows he betrayes God.—
That <hi>Clanrickard</hi> had ſomething of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Brother-in-Law, othe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rwiſe
he ſhould be for the Catholicks, which are known to be faithful
to the King, whereof no Man doubts now.—That he ſhould know
all little Paſſages, Reſolutions, and Things that paſs daily in <hi>Dublin,
Ulſter</hi> and <hi>Cork;</hi> and you ſhould write the words uttered by <hi>Ormond,
Clanrickard</hi> and <hi>Inſiquin, even when they are at Table, and
in Converſation;</hi>—That you ſhall have Succours to prevent your
inglorious falling to Peace,—and <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France</hi> will diſpute,
who ſhall contribute moſt to you, ſo that you may ſee <hi>Father Wadding,</hi>
and I do not ſleep in your Affairs,—That <hi>Clanrickard</hi> Robs more from
the Catholick Party than the Villanous <hi>Scots.</hi>—That the King is eaſie
and not to be truſted;—That the Confederates are backward in decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Old Engliſh,</hi>—That if they had Gallantry, they might expect a
Temporal Crown in reward.—That <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> is more <hi>Nationally</hi>
then Religiouſly inclined;—That <hi>Ormond</hi> is a Viper and an Idolater of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
—That the Queen will be caſt upon the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes
them, to Play the cunning Workmen to take meaſure of her.</p>
                              <p>

But we need ſay no more of this Embaſſador, than what the Queen
obſerves of him in her Letter to the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Husbands,</hi> 2 part, 833.</note> 
                                 <hi>viz. That many things

                              <p>In <hi>England</hi> the Lord <hi>Macguire</hi> and <hi>Macmahon</hi> were brought to their
Trial, and found Guilty, Condemn'd, and Executed at <hi>Tyburn;</hi> but
becauſe <hi>Macguire</hi> was a Peer of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it was made a Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could be Tried in <hi>England</hi> for Treaſon committed in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
ſince thereby he loſt the Benefit of his Peerage? And tho' it ſeems to
me, that the Point had been formerly determin'd in the Caſe of the
Lord <hi>Leonard Grey,</hi> who was Viſcount <hi>Grany,</hi> yet it held a long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
and there being many Curioſities in that Trial, I deſign to add
it by way of <hi>Appendix,</hi> unleſs this Book grow too Voluminous for ſuch
an Addition.</p>
                              <p>And in <hi>January</hi> began the Treaty of <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> where the King's
Power to make the Ceſſation was denied, both becauſe of His Delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Management of the War to the Parliament, and becauſe of the
Intereſt of the Adventurers. To which it was anſwered, That the King
by authorizing the Parliament, did not exclude Himſelf. There were
alſo reciprocal Accuſations and Recriminations from each Party to the
other, which are too tedious to be here recited; and therefore I refer
the Reader for them to <hi>Dugdale's View of the late Troubles,</hi> where he
may find them at large.</p>
                              <p>Nor is it to be omitted, that even whilſt this Treaty was in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in order to it, the Treaty with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> was in effect ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded,
a certain <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lord was no leſs unſeaſonably than importunately
preſſing His Majeſty to be made a Privy-Counſellor, and to have a
<hi>Cuſtodium</hi> granted him of Sir <hi>Robert King</hi>'s Eſtate; tho' either of theſe
being granted, and divulg'd, would have daſh'd in pieces all Hopes of
Reconciliation between the King and Parliament: So little did they
conſider the King's Intereſt, when it ſtood in competition with their
own. And when I have added, That the Confederates did publiſh a
Declaration of the Terms upon which Proteſtants might live within
their Quarters, which is to be found <hi>Appendix</hi> 11. and that the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>Dublin</hi> being numbred on the Eighth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> were found
to be 2565 Men, and 2986 Women, Proteſtants; and 1202 Men, and
1406 Women, Papiſts; I have inſerted all that I think material for
the Year 1644.</p>
                              <p>The Year 1645. could not begin better than in reviving the Treaty
of Peace, (which was then reaſſumed) if the Confederates had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
candidly and ſincerely therein; but they perceiving that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
would never be prevailed upon to grant them the Terms they
deſir'd, did keep this Treaty on foot to cover their other Deſigns;
and in the mean time, by their Agent Colonel <hi>Fitz-Williams,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the Queen, That if Her Majeſty would prevail with the
King to condeſcend to <hi>the Juſt Demands of the Iriſh,</hi> at leaſt in private,
that then they would aſſiſt His Majeſty with Ten thouſand Men.
Whereupon the Queen, either through Her Indulgence to Popery, or
to purchaſe ſo conſiderable Aids for the King, did promiſe Her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Endeavors to effect their Deſires; and accordingly She ſent
Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he made the Articles recited at large
<hi>Appendix</hi> 26. which nevertheleſs had no effect, becauſe the<note n="*" place="margin">Vindiciae everſae, 48.</note> King
could not by any means be brought to confirm them. And She alſo
procured the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> to be ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who made a
Peace ſecretly with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> on the 25th day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> as we ſhall
ſee anon; and which alſo met with the ſame Fate, and for the ſame
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65997:363"/>
Reaſon. And this unfolds the Secret of ſome Myſteries which at
that time were unintelligible; for it was a Paradox to <hi>Ormond</hi> and
thoſe Cavaliers who were ſo zealous for the King, that they paſſionately
coveted a Peace with the <hi>Iriſh, as that which they thought the only proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Means left to preſerve His Majesty;</hi> I ſay, it amaz'd theſe Men, to
find the <hi>Iriſh</hi> delay and indeed reject the Peace, which themſelves at
firſt had courted, and which was their Intereſt to haſten, even upon
worſe Terms than were offered them: Nevertheleſs, the Confederates
continued to quibble upon Niceties, and to reaſſume Debates that were
determined before, and particularly the Words in one of the Articles,
<hi>That Officers of Both Religions be equally preferr'd,</hi> being, upon an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> explain'd by themſelves to intend only <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,</hi>
were now ſo ſtrained, that they would admit no other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the Word <hi>Equally,</hi> but that it muſt extend to <hi>Number;</hi>
whereat His Majeſty was exceedingly diſguſted.</p>
                              <p>But in <hi>May</hi> there was a General Aſſembly of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> which, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant
to a Deciſion of their Clergy, <hi>Appendix</hi> 29, did on the Ninth
of <hi>June</hi> Vote, <hi>That as to the Demand of</hi> Reſtoring <hi>the Protestant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
the Commiſſioners ſhall give a poſitive Denial:</hi> And the Truth of it
is, that they thought themſelves ſo ſure of what Conditions they
pleas'd from the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> that they little minded what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
they gave to the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> or his Commiſſioners.
And, on the other ſide, the King thought himſelf ſo ſure of the Ten
thouſand Men from them, that Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> was in <hi>July</hi>
ſent with Seven hundred Horſe to <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> to receive and conduct
them as there ſhould be occaſion. But when their Expectation in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
began to tire, and no News came either of a Peace or of Succors,
the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> (Secretary of State) wrote the following Letter to the
Lord of <hi>Muskery,</hi> and the reſt that had been Agents for the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
at <hi>Oxford.</hi>

                                    <p>HIS Majsty having long expected a Concluſion of a happy Peace within
your Kingdom, and His Affairs having <hi>highly ſuffered</hi> by the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of His Expectations from thence, cannot chuſe but wonder what the Cauſe
is of it; calling to mind thoſe <hi>fair Profeſſions and Promiſes</hi> which you
made unto Him when you were imployed here as Agents. And knowing
well what Power and Instructions He hath long ſince given to my Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
to comply with you for your Satisfaction, as far forth as with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Honor His Majesty could in Civil Things, or with <hi>Prudence or
Conſcience</hi> in Matters of Religion; and in the latter, as to the <hi>utmoſt of
what for any worldly Conſideration He will ever be induced to:</hi> So
did He conceive nothing leſs than what you declared unto Him you were
perſuaded the Catholicks would be ſatisfied withal; nay, <hi>ought not in their
own Intereſt to ſeek more,</hi> in the preſent Condition His Majesty is in, leſt
further Conceſſions might (by confirming former Scandals cast upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in Matters of Religion) ſo alienate the Hearts of His faithful and
loyal Adherents, as to make them abandon Him: Which, as it would draw
inevitable Ruin on Him; ſo were you rightly apprehenſive, that when the
Parliament ſhould by that means have prevailed here, that must ſoon after
bring a certain Destruction upon your ſelves. What the change of Princples
or Reſolutions are, His Majesty knows not; but He finds by the not conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a Peace there, that your Party (it ſeems) is not ſatisfied with <hi>the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65997:364"/>
utmoſt that His Majeſty can grant</hi> in Matters of Religion; that is, the
taking away of the Penal Laws againſt Roman Catholicks within that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And His Majeſty here hears, that you inſiſt upon <hi>the Demands of
Churches</hi> for the Publick Exerciſe of Religion, which is the Occaſion that
His Majeſty hath commanded me to write thus frankly unto you, and to
tell you, That He cannot believe it poſſible, that Rational and Prudent Men
(had there been no Propoſitions made to the contrary) can inſiſt upon that
which muſt needs be ſo deſtructive to His Majeſty at preſent, and to your
ſelves in the Conſequences of His Ruin, (that is) inevitably to be made a
Prey to the Rebels of theſe Kingdoms, or to a Foreign Nation. Wherefore,
my Lords and Gentlemen, to diſabuſe you, I am commanded by His Majeſty
to declare unto you, That were the Condition of His Affairs much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
than they are, <hi>He would never redeem them by any Conceſſion
of ſo much wrong both to His Honor and Conſcience.</hi> It is for the
Defence of His Religion principally, that he hath undergone the Extremities
of War here; and He would never redeem his Crown by deſtroying It there.
So that to deal clearly with you, as you may be happy your ſelves, and be
happy Inſtruments of His Majeſty's Reſtoring, <hi>if you would be contented
with Reaſon,</hi> and give Him that ſpeedy Aſſiſtance which you well may;
ſo, if nothing will content you <hi>but what muſt wound His Honor and
Conſcience,</hi> you must expect, howſoever His Condition is, and how dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
ſoever the Rebels of this Kingdom are to Him, He will in that Point
joyn with them, the <hi>Scots,</hi> or with any of the Protestant Religion, <hi>rather
than do the leaſt Act that may hazard that Religion,</hi> in which and <hi>for
which</hi> He will live and die. Having ſaid thus much by His Majesty's
Command, I have no more to add, but that I ſhall think my ſelf very happy

could make of it) was diametrically oppoſite to the Nature and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of a <hi>Peace,</hi> becauſe this would reduce them to the Obedience and
Condition of Subjects, and that would ſtill keep them up in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a <hi>Separate State;</hi> yet there was a deeper Intrigue in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>viz.</hi> That if they would not part with their <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
followed, that they could not part with their <hi>Army,</hi> which was
the Ligament and Support of it: And therefore, notwithſtanding <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan</hi>'s
Conceſſions, yet that Earl muſt have Patience, and wait for
the expected Succors, until the King ſhould <hi>publickly</hi> ratifie what his
Lordſhip had <hi>privately</hi> done; and they did not doubt, but the ſame
Neceſſities continuing, or rather encreaſing, would compel His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to comply with their Expectations.</p>
                              <p>And in order to bring about their Deſigns, they continued the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with <hi>Ormond</hi> until the 21th of <hi>November;</hi> and to cloak their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
the whole Aſſembly on the Ninth of <hi>September</hi> did Vote, <hi>That
they would ſend Ten thouſand Men to aid the King, and would refer to His
Majesty's Pleaſure ſuch things about Religion as</hi> Ormond <hi>either had not
Power, or not Inclination to grant.</hi> But on the Fifteenth of <hi>November</hi>
following, they did in effect invalidate that Vote, by alledging, That
they never undertook the Tranſportation of the Ten thouſand Men
to help the King, but intended only their Aſſiſtance therein.</p>
                              <p>Nevertheleſs, I muſt not conceal, that the <hi>Anti-Nunciotiſts</hi> do aver,
That they deſign'd ſincerely to ſend Succours to the King, and to
conclude a Peace with the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> on the Terms after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
agreed on, and to refer the Secret Articles about Religion to
His Majeſty's Pleaſure, wherein they doubted not of as much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion
as His Majeſty could ſafely give, becauſe it had been ſo
promis'd to them by the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan:</hi> But the <hi>Nuncio</hi> arriving
in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the nick of this Buſineſs, quite altered their Meaſures
and confounded their Affairs: And whether it be ſo, or not, is ſcarce
worth our Inquiry, ſince we are ſure of theſe few Truths, <hi>That the
Confederates ſent no Succors at all to the King, nor made the Peace till it
was too late, and did moſt perfidiouſly break it almoſt as ſoon as it was
made.</hi>

                              <p>But we muſt make room for a very extraordinary Man, <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta
Rinuccini</hi> Archbiſhop and Prince of <hi>Firmo,</hi> the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi>
who arrived in the River of <hi>Kilmair</hi> on the 22th day of <hi>October:</hi> He
ſent before and brought with him 2000 Swords, 500 Petronels,
20000 Pound of Powder, and Five or Six ſmall Trunks of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Gold; and had in his Train 22 <hi>Italians,</hi> beſides ſeveral Clergy-men.
His Frigat, which carried but 21 Guns, was cloſely purſued by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Plunket</hi> in a Parliament Ship, and had certainly been taken or
ſunk, if the Cook-room of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship had not accidentally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Fire. Never were People more troubled at a Diſappointment,
than were the Seamen at this; and yet ſcarce any Diſappointment
was ever more lucky: For this <hi>Nuncio</hi> afterwards renew'd the fatal
Diſtinction between <hi>Old Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Old Engliſh,</hi> and ſplit the <hi>Iriſh</hi> into

                              <p>Nevertheleſs, he was ſo little mindful of that Oath, and had ſo
ſmall regard to the Peace and true Intereſt even of the Papiſts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that tho' he knew, that the King, in hopes of Succors from
that Kingdom, did ſo earneſtly deſire a Peace, that the Fanaticks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd
him with being <hi>an Humble Suitor to the Rebels for good Terms;</hi>
yet he made advantage of the King's Neceſſities, and refus'd any
Agreement that ſhould not reſtore the Eccleſiaſtical Revenues, <hi>and the
Splendor of Popery;</hi> and accordingly he poſitively wrote to his intimate
Friend the Biſhop of <hi>Killalla, That if the Supreme Council ſhould agree

                              <p>But the Reader muſt take notice, that all this while <hi>Ormond</hi> and
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were totally ignorant of the ſecret Negotiations of the
Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> until after the Defeat at <hi>Sligo,</hi> which hapned on

of the Articles made with the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> which diſcovered
ſuch an Ocean of Contrivance and Intrigue, as amazed the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant

                              <p>The Articles of this Peace, and the Commiſſion it was ſounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

made thoſe Conceſſions, but that it was done under mutual Oaths of Secreſie;
<hi>and,</hi> That he conceived he had Warrant for what he did; <hi>and,</hi> That he did
it with deſign to ſerve His Majeſty, and not to hurt the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Circumſtances conſidered; <hi>and,</hi> That he conceives thoſe Articles are not
Obligatory to His Majeſty; <hi>and,</hi> That he did not engage His Majeſty's
Faith or Honor, further than by ſhewing his Authority, and leaving it with
them.—<hi>And then he gave the Committee Counterparts of all the
Writings between him and the</hi> Iriſh.</p>
                              <p>And tho' the King was exceeding angry at the firſt News of this
Affair, as what he foreſaw would be made uſe of by the Parliament
to juſtifie all the Aſperſions they had laid upon him in point of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;
yet when he had calmly conſidered, <hi>that the Earl's Error pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the Exceſs of his Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>that all this was done to haſten
the Conſiderable Succors of Ten thouſand Men unto him; That it was to no
purpoſe to conſult</hi> Ormond <hi>in the Point,</hi> ſince it was manifeſt, (and he had
often declar'd as much when the like Articles were formerly propos'd)
that he would rather quit the Government, than conſent to Articles
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65997:365"/>
ſo prejudicial to the Proteſtants: <hi>That the Earl had done it with all the
Caution and Secreſie imaginable, even to the enjoyning it by Oath; ſo that
it did not come to be diſcovered but by an extraordinary Accident;</hi> and
that His Majeſty remain'd not poſitively obliged, becauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſance
mentioned alſo <hi>Appendix</hi> 27: So that the Penalty was only,
<hi>That the Army ſhould not ſerve him till he did ratifie the Agreement;</hi> and
when the Army was once in <hi>England,</hi> the Earl thought that the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
would eaſily have been moderated by mutual Conſent, rather than
it ſhould go back again <hi>re infecta.</hi> All theſe things being conſidered,
His Majeſty was at length reconcil'd to the Earl, and on the Eighth
of <hi>July,</hi> 1646. by Mr. <hi>Walſingham</hi> ſent his Lordſhip a moſt kind and
gracious Letter, containing great Aſſurances both of Favour and
Friendſhip.</p>
                              <p>On the other ſide, the Confederates were netled at <hi>Glamorgan</hi>'s
Commitment, and the <hi>Supreme Council</hi> by their Agents did on the
Third of <hi>January</hi> offer to engage for his Appearance, and ſuggeſted,
that Three thouſand Men were ready to be ſent to the King, ſo that
nothing was wanting but Shipping for their Tranſportation, and the
Liberty of their deſign'd <hi>General.</hi> And on the 36th they renew their
Solicitation, and <hi>refuſe to reſume the Treaty until he be releas'd,</hi> and
urge, that his Conſinement retards the Succors intended for <hi>Cheſter:</hi>
And ſo on the 21th of <hi>January,</hi> on his own Recognizance of 20000 <hi>l.</hi>
and the Earls of <hi>Kildare</hi> and <hi>Clanrickard</hi> of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> apiece, that he
ſhould appear on Thirty days notice, he was enlarg'd, and ſoon after
went to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where theſe Three things were recommended to
his Care, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. To haſten the Commiſſioners to conclude the Peace.
2. To expedite the 3000 Men to the Relief of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> And, 3. To
get 3000 <hi>l.</hi> to help pay the Army. To which he return'd theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
<hi>viz.</hi> To the Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they will renew the Treaty as ſoon
as the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> hath digeſted Matters for the Commiſſioners. To the
Second, That they are ready, and ſhall be ſent <hi>as ſoon as the Peace is
concluded.</hi> And to the Third, That it cannot yet be done.</p>
                              <p>But <hi>Glamorgan</hi>'s Peace being thus diſcovered, and thereupon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ownd
and diſſolv'd, the Confederate Commiſſioners began to think
ſeriouſly of making a more firm and laſting Agreement with the
Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who to haſten the Peace, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>But the Caſe was altered; and the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and the Clergy, and their
Party, who would not be contented with any thing leſs than <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>'s
Conceſſions, thinking His Majeſty's Condition to be ſo low and
diſtreſſed, that he would be neceſſitated to purchaſe their Aſſiſtance at
their own Rate, gave all the Obſtruction they could to the preſent
Agreement.</p>
                              <p>This unexpected Oppoſition to the Peace,<note place="margin">Nihil ſe quod alicujus eſſet momenti in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus pacis que belli inconſulto Nuncio eſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturos decreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint. <hi>Beling.</hi> 15.</note> very much embroil'd
the Confederates, ſo that they knew not what to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, on the one

                              </p>
                              <p>In this Strait they had recourſe to a <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> which met

Conditions they deſired, and ſuch as would infallibly render the Popiſh Party
triumphant in that Kingdom, and that it would be eaſy to get more on a fitter

they had Liberty of Conſcience, and all that was neceſſary to the Exerciſe and
Enjoyment of Religion, and that nothing was wanting <hi>but what ſerved for

affected to them, for that ſhe had lately wrote a Reſpectful Letter to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Council of the Confederate Catholicks of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by that Title; <hi>the
Pope replied,</hi> That it was no wonder, if the moſt Serene King thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
publickly to grant the <hi>Iriſh</hi> the Conditions they demanded, leſt it might
diſoblige His Proteſtant Subjects, and therefore A CONNIVANCE
ought to content them for the preſent. <hi>And accordingly the Pope did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of the firſt Ceſſation, and the continuance of it.</hi>

                              <p>On the other ſide the Popiſh Clergy (who will never be ſatisfied

and ſhewed but ſmall regard, either to His Majeſty's Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,

That he was amazed to find the Lieutenant Colonels <hi>Ridgway</hi> and

it ſo happened to them by the Knavery of an Iriſh Sutler, who

of God he would beat the Enemy, and bid them not to be diſcouraged
at the Flight of any of their Fellows, becauſe what would happen of
that kind, would be done by his order upon Deſign, and accordingly
he did command Major <hi>Peiſley</hi> to keep the Road, and after his Squadron
of 80 Horſe had fired their Carbines, to fly and rally again in the
Rear of him, and ſo he drew up a quarter of a mile farther from the
Enemy; and, according to his expectation, the Iriſh came boldly up to
<hi>Peiſly,</hi> and upon his flight they purſued with great violence and diſorder,

the <hi>Lagan</hi> Army was employed in <hi>Conaught;</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> were for the

                              <p>However, their Arrival yielded an opportunity to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant

the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to a ſpeedy and reaſonable Peace: And Mr. <hi>Galbreth</hi> who
was entruſted with this important Secret, did ſo well execute his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
that he miſt his deſign very narrowly; and theſe Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were amuſed to that Degree, that they wrote the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to the Speaker, but in two or three days after they found out the
Secret of this Affair, and ſo the deſign vaniſhed.</p>

                                    <p>THere are ſome Paſſages which we omitted in our Letters to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
becauſe we judge it expedient to expreſs them in Cipher, the
Rebels grew higher in their Demands, ſince the Kings Affairs have been in
a declining Condition, which with abuſing the Kings Name and Authority in
the taking our Gariſon in <hi>Conaught,</hi> and turning the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of ſome
of them, hath ſo incenſed the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> that he deſires but Power
and Opportunity to break off all Treaty and fall upon them; and in Order
thereunto we have had an Overture, by one that came from him to us, for
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Forces to joyn with him againſt the Rebels upon theſe

                              <p>If you think fit to proceed, we doubt not but to bring the Buſineſs into

                              <p>But on the Sixteenth of <hi>February</hi> theſe Commiſſioners did by their
Letter from <hi>Belfaſt</hi> offer to treat with the Lord Lieutenant; but he
foreſaw they would not ſubmit to His Majeſty's Authority, without
which he could not incorporate with them: Beſides, he was too far
advanced in the Treaty with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to ſtop it upon ſuch ſlender Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
and therefore he was reſerv'd in his Anſwer to this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65997:370"/>
And they finding by his Coldneſs to them, that he had cloſed
with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or at leaſt deſign'd it, they broke off this Negotiation
the very ſame day whereon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peace was concluded.<note place="margin">28 March. 1646.</note>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Year 1646.<note place="margin">1646.</note> opened with the Concluſion of the Peace, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of which being drawn by Mr. <hi>Darcy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
on the 28th of <hi>March,</hi> and depoſited as an Eſcrol in the Hands
of the Marquis of <hi>Clanriccard,</hi> until ſome Conditions promiſed by the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> (in a ſeparate Inſtrument) which were to be fulfill'd by the Firſt
of <hi>April,</hi> ſhould be performed, which were never done; and if they
had been honeſtly performed, yet thoſe Succors would have come too
late; for thus the Secretary of State writes from <hi>Oxford,</hi> (26 March)
<hi>That for want of Supplies from</hi> Ireland, <hi>the Army in the West of</hi> England
<hi>is disbanded; ſo that now Supplies will do no good.</hi> Nevertheleſs, the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> knew nothing of this, and therefore pretended to be very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in getting their Men together, and Ships were prepar'd, and the
Lords of <hi>Antrim</hi> and <hi>Glamorgan</hi> were at <hi>Waterford</hi> to forward the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
and on the Third of <hi>April</hi> the <hi>Supreme Council</hi> wrote to the
Lord Lieutenant, <hi>That they had Six thouſand Men ready, and deſired they
may be Muſtered;</hi> But notwithſtanding all this, it is believed, that they
never really intended to ſend any Succors to the King; for the Lord
<hi>Muskery</hi> the very ſame day, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Third of <hi>April</hi>) and by their
Command, ſignified to the Lord Lieutenant <hi>the Difficulties of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
in</hi> England, <hi>and deſired that they might be imployed against the
King's Enemies in</hi> Ireland. And being reſolv'd to imploy thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as they pleas'd, whatever Directions <hi>Ormond</hi> ſhould give to the
contrary, they did on the ſame Third of <hi>April</hi> diſcharge the Ships at
<hi>Waterford</hi> from Demurrage; and without expecting an Anſwer to their
Meſſage, they did within a day or two after (without the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's
privity) imploy moſt part of thoſe Forces againg the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
at <hi>Bunratty,</hi> and on the Eighth of <hi>April</hi> ſent the Lord Lieutenant
word, <hi>That a Fleet was ſeen at Sea, which they were afraid would land
Men near the</hi> Sheuin, <hi>and therefore they had ſent Three thouſand of the
Forces deſign'd for</hi> England <hi>to reduce</hi> Bunratty: So that no more of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Army was ſent over than Three hundred Men, under <hi>Milo Power,</hi>
which were deſign'd a Guard for the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and went to
him to <hi>Scilly,</hi> together with the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
the Prince into <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Whereupon <hi>Ormond,</hi> who was as ſenſible as any Man alive of the
Levity of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> having receiv'd a Letter from the King of the
Third of <hi>April, recommending to his eſpecial Care the Management of His
Majeſty's Affairs in</hi> Ireland, <hi>as he ſhall conceive moſt for the King's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Service,</hi> cauſed that Letter to be printed, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> might
know, that there was no Peace to be expected from any other Hand
than his: And having informed the King by his Letter of the Seventh
of <hi>April, That the Treaty was ſo far concluded, that Matters of Religion
were ſubmitted to His Majeſty, and the King oblig'd to nothing unleſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in Proportion and Time mentioned in His Majeſty's Letter of the Firſt
of</hi> December; he was as induſtrious as could be to make that Peace
effectual to His Majeſty, by a ſpeedy Publication, and a conſiderable
Supply:—But finding the promiſed Succors diverted another way,
he began to deſpair of any Good from the Confederates.</p>
                              <p>And whilſt he was in this Opinion, the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> and the reſt
of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners being come over, endeavoured by their
Letter of the Fifteenth of <hi>April</hi> to renew the Treaty with him, and
tho' they did propoſe to have ſome of their Soldiers admitted into
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65997:370"/>
                                 <hi>Dublin,</hi> and that <hi>Ormond</hi> ſhould ſubmit to King and Parliament, yet
there were mutual Paſſports granted for Commiſſioners to Treat and
the Intereſt of both Parties centring <hi>in the Proſecution of the Common
Enemy,</hi> inclin'd them to Moderation; and gave great hopes of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
when the News of the King's Surrender to the <hi>Scots</hi> drew <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile</hi>
home to his own Country,<note place="margin">☜</note> and ſo the Treaty was diſſolved.</p>
                              <p>However, <hi>Ormond</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> could not agree; and it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for they aim'd at quite different Ends. The Confederates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to expel the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Names of <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
Parliamentarians, the King's Enemies, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Ormond</hi> deſign'd to
get Ten thouſand <hi>Iriſh</hi> to be ſent to the King's Aſſiſtance in <hi>England.</hi>
The <hi>Iriſh</hi> intended to preſerve their Government in the Form of <hi>a
diſtinct Republick;</hi> and the Lord Lieutenant hoped to reduce them to
the Condition of Subjects: And accordingly their Negotiations were
managed on both Sides with a Tendency to their reſpective Ends;
inſomuch that the Confederates, in the Sixth Article of their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Seventeenth of <hi>April,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Nicholas Plunket,</hi> order
him to let his Excellency know, <hi>That if he cauſe the Articles of Peace</hi>
(depoſited with the Lord <hi>Clanriccard) to be proclaim'd, that then they
muſt publiſh thoſe Articles concerning Religion made with the Earl of</hi> Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan;
<hi>and that it is not in their power to do otherwiſe, for fear of
loſing their Foreign Friends, and the danger of a Rupture at home.</hi> But in
the Two next Inſtructions they add, That if <hi>Ormond</hi> will agree, that
they may on all Sides fight to clear the Kingdom of the Common
Enemy, that then their Councils in Civil and Martial Matters ſhall be
manag'd by his Advice, and he ſhall have as much Influence over their
Debates,<note place="margin">☜</note> 
                                 <hi>us if he ſat at the Board;</hi> and as much Power as he was to
have by the Articles during the Interval of Parliament. And in their
Additional Inſtructions of the Tenth of <hi>May,</hi> they repeat to the ſame
effect, and deſire the <hi>Nuncio</hi> may be countenanced, and order their
Agent to declare, <hi>how they may be neceſſitated not to relie more upon his
Excellency, if he keep himſelf longer in ſuſpence.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But, on the other ſide, the Lord Lieutenant very well unerſtood
the Inconvenience of joyning with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> by way of <hi>League,</hi> which
would be a tacit Allowance of their Government; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
not to unite with them upon any other Terms than that of the
<hi>Peace:</hi> And tho' he ſtood in great need of an Agreement with them,
yet not having freſh Orders to proceed in the Peace, ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Tranſporting Men was not perform'd, he could not have
publiſhed the Peace if they would have conſented to it; and therefore
he was glad to find them making Objections againſt it; to which he
<note n="*" place="margin">2 June.</note>return'd this Anſwer, <hi>That if they publiſh'd</hi> Glamorgan'<hi>s Articles,
that then he would in the Name of the King publickly diſavow them, as
His Majeſty had already done.</hi> And in this manner the Intercourſe and
Correſpondence between them was kept afoot; and upon the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> on the Fourth of <hi>July,</hi> with poſitive (Verbal)
Orders to make the Peace, they began to treat more cloſely. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
that did not hinder the Confederates from purſuing their
little Advantages underhand, as appears by the following Letter of

happened two ſtrange Accidents; the one was the King's Surrender of

<hi>Supream Council,</hi> had not prevented it, as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter:
But theſe two grand Accidents muſt be handled apart, and it is but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Duty that we give preference to that of the King.</p>
                              <p>His Majeſty was not a little influencd by the Queen, and upon her
account by the <hi>French,</hi> who had an Agent in the <hi>Scots</hi> Camp; they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Zeal for the King's Re-eſtabliſhment; and the Cardinal did

                              <p>However the King confided much in this <hi>French</hi> Agent; and it was
he that managed the Treaty between His Majeſty and the <hi>Scots;</hi> and
either he did really obtain, or perſuaded the King that he had got

Rebels have three Armies in the Field, viz. <hi>Munſter</hi> Army, which is before
<hi>Bunratty; Conaught</hi> Army, which is before <hi>Roſcomon;</hi> and <hi>Ulſter</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which hovers towards <hi>Dublin;</hi> and that the Parliament Frigats are in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65997:371"/>
the Harbor, and all over the Coaſt, hindering Proviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from coming
to them, and that the Ceſſation will determine the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> and that they
have but 13 Barrels of Powder, and want all other Neceſſaries for the War,
and therefore they hope to renew the Ceſſation for a month; and in the mean time
do earneſtly pray for Supplies; adding, That they cannot be ſure, <hi>that thoſe
that unprovoked fell upon them in a time of Quiet, will not break a
Ceſſation, as ſoon as they find themſelves baffled in their Expectations
of a Peace.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And as to the unfortunate Battel at <hi>Bemburb,</hi> wherein the Lord <hi>Blany</hi>
was ſlain, and the Lord <hi>Mongomery</hi> was taken Priſoner, as ſoon as it was
over, Mr. <hi>Anneſly</hi> and Mr. <hi>Beale,</hi> by their Letters, importuned the Lord
Lieutenant to declare againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> which at that time he could not
preſently do, in regard of the Ceſſation, that was not then expired;
but upon the Tenth of <hi>June</hi> the Lord <hi>Folliot, Monroe,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles
Coot,</hi> joyned with the others in an Addreſs to the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi>
to the ſame purpoſe; and the Lord <hi>Folliot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Galbreth</hi> came with
it, although they had no ſafe Conduct or Paſsport for doing ſo, which
is the more ſtrange, becauſe thoſe Commiſſioners (Mr. <hi>Anneſly</hi> and <hi>Beale</hi>)
had refuſed a Paſs to a Meſſenger, <hi>Ormond</hi> would have ſent to the King,
<hi>unleſs they might know his Errand,</hi> and becauſe in this Addreſs they did
not give <hi>Ormond</hi> the Title of <hi>Lord-Lieutenant.</hi> Nevertheleſs his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
anſwered them, That he would joyn with them, and (as ſoon as
the Ceſſation expired, <hi>viz. 13 July</hi>) would declare againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy; <hi>Provided they would ſubmit to His Majeſties Authority.</hi> But
they (who had all their Support from the Parliament) could not do
that; and ſo this Negotiation determined without effect.</p>
                              <p>And in this condition ſtood Affairs, when on the Fourth of <hi>July</hi> 1646.
the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> one of the Secretaries of State, and afterwards Earl
of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> returned to <hi>Dublin</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> and aſſured the Marquis of
<hi>Ormond, That notwithſtanding the King's Letter of the Eleventh of</hi> June,
(which was extorted from him by Dureſs, and proceeded from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the poſture of Affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and particularly of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the Treaty of peace) <hi>it was His Majeſties Pleaſure, That a
Peace ſhould be concluded with the</hi> Iriſh, and that he had a poſitive verbal
Meſſage from the King to that purpoſe; and thereof he made a ſolemn
and formal Proteſtation before the Lord Lieutenant and Council, which
being reduced to Writing, was entred at large in the Council-Book
at <hi>Dublin</hi> on the Twenty eighth of <hi>July;</hi> and thereupon they proceeded
to the Concluſion of the Peace, which was perfected on the Thirtieth
of <hi>July,</hi> and is contained in the Articles mentioned, <hi>Appendix</hi> 24. And
the next day they wrote to His Majeſty a full account of what they had
done, and deſired His Majeſty <hi>to ſend them no more Verbal Orders, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch as contradict the Written ones, leſt they want Vouchers of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to His Majeſties Commands, and be thought Diſloyal in doing thoſe things,
which nothing but Duty could make them do.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Peace being thus made, was ſolemnly Proclaim'd in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
by General <hi>Preſton</hi> in his Camp; and the King at Arms, and thoſe of
the <hi>Heralds-Office,</hi> (to the number of Ten) with all their Formalities,
were on the Sixth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſent to Proclaim it in the other Cities and
Corporations of the Kingdom, of whoſe Journey I will give an account
in due time. The Lord-Lieutenant did alſo ſend a kind Letter of the
Third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to <hi>Owen Roe,</hi> to invite him to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to give his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
towards the Settlement of the Nation; and that General did on
the Seventeenth return a very civil Anſwer, importing, <hi>That as yet he
had no authentick Notice of the Peace from his former Maſters, but as ſoon
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65997:372"/>
as he ſhould have it, he would haſten to pay his Duty to the Lord-Lieutenant.</hi>
And on the Eleventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Proteſtant Clergy made a grateful
Remonſtrance of Thanks to His Excellency, for his Care of Religion and
the Kingdom.</p>
                              <p>In the mean time, the reſtleſs and indefatigable Nuncio had ſummon'd
all the Popiſh Clergy to <hi>Waterford,</hi> under pretence of an Apoſtolick
Viſitation, and to prepare for a National Synod; the famous <hi>Nicholas
French,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ferns,</hi> was Chancellor of this Congregation, which
being aſſembled, (notwithſtanding their holy Pretences) did nothing
elſe but conſult how to break the Peace they had ſo lately conſented to;
and being puft up with the Succeſs their Forces had met with this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and taking advantage of the diſtreſſed condition of His Majeſty
and his Army, theſe Holy Fathers made ſhort work with the Peace; for
on the 12th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which was juſt a Fortnight after it was made,
they declared all thoſe perjur'd that would ſubmit to it, and by ſolemn
<note n="*" place="margin">Appendix 30.</note>Decree rejected it, as not having ſufficiently provided <hi>for the Liberty
and Splendor of Religion.</hi> And they afterwards ſtrictly prohibited all
their people from obeying the Peace, or paying Contributions to the
King, or to any that obeyed it, on pain of Excommunication <hi>ipſo facto:</hi>
which on the Fifth of <hi>October</hi> was formally iſſued, with Notes, as it is
recited, <hi>Appendix</hi> 31.</p>
                              <p>But now it is time to look after our Heralds, who (as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mentioned) left <hi>Dublin</hi> on the Sixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the Peace in the other Cities and Corporations: They came to
<hi>Waterford</hi> the Eighth, where they were ſo unwelcome to all the people,
that no body would ſhew them the Mayor's Houſe, until at length a
little Boy did it for Sixpence; but the Mayor would not be ſeen for
above four hours, and when he was told their Errand, he asked, why
they did not firſt proclaim the Peace at <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> and they anſwered,
That they purſued their Orders, and ſuppoſed the Reaſon might be,
becauſe <hi>Waterford</hi> was, next to <hi>Dublin,</hi> one of the moſt ancient and
conſiderable Cities in the Kingdom. However, after three day ſtay,
they could get no other Anſwer, but that the Peace ſhould be firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
at <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> and the Rabble threatned to ſend them packing
with <hi>Withes</hi> about their Necks, unleſs they made haſte away.</p>
                              <p>From <hi>Waterford</hi> they went to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where they were received with
Reſpect, and the Peace was there proclaimed even with exceſs of Joy
and Pageantry. It was alſo proclaimed at <hi>Calan, Fethard,</hi> and <hi>Caſhell;</hi>
but <hi>Clonmell</hi> would not receive it until it ſhould firſt be publiſhed at
<hi>Limerick.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>It was in the Evening of the Twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> when they came
to <hi>Limerick,</hi> where they found the Gates ſhut, ſo that they had no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
till the next day Noon, and then were civilly treated by the
Mayor, who was for the Peace; however that day they could not agree,
but on the Twenty ſecond it was carried by the major Vote of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
and Council, <hi>That the Peace ſhould be proclaimed,</hi> and all things
were prepared accordingly: Whereupon Fryer <hi>Wolf,</hi> with an armed
Rabble of above 500, came to the <hi>High-Croſs,</hi> and denounced Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
againſt the Adherers to the Peace. Nevertheleſs the Mayor
(who lived near the <hi>Croſs</hi>) was coming out in his formalities to make
the Proclamation; but the Rabble with hideous Outcries drove them
back again, and followed them into the Houſe, and purſued them even
from Chamber to Chamber; they wounded the Mayor and the King at
Arms, and drag'd them to Priſon; and they mortally wounded the
Purſivant <hi>Henry King,</hi> and moſt of the reſt were likewiſe wounded,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65997:372"/>
and all were Impriſoned for about 10 days, and the Mayor's Houſe was
broken and pillaged; and during all this Tumult the Fryers cryed out,
<hi>Kill, kill, kill, and I'le Abſolve you.</hi> And what is yet more ſtrange, is,
That the Mayor was afterwards turned out, and <hi>Dominick Fanning</hi> (a
principal Incendiary in this Commotion) was made Mayor in his room,
and was by Letters from the <hi>Nuncio</hi> thanked for what he had done, and
encouraged to go on, and the Apoſtolical Benediction was imparted
to him, for committing ſuch an Outrage upon the Privileged Perſon of
an Herald, as all other Nations in the World would abhor.</p>
                              <p>But to proceed; The Congregation at <hi>Waterford</hi> did alſo, under the
pain of Excommunication, prohibit the Lords <hi>Mountgarret</hi> and <hi>Muskry</hi>
from going to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to conſult the execution of the Peace; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they went, and in the Name of the <hi>Supreme Council</hi> invited <hi>Ormond</hi> to
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> as well to countenance the Peace, as to ſtop <hi>Inſiquin</hi>'s progreſs
in <hi>Munſter,</hi> who triumphed over all Oppoſers, and put the Country
under Contribution as far as the <hi>Black Water.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Hereupon <hi>Ormond</hi> (having firſt ſent <hi>Daniel O Neal</hi> with great Offers to
<hi>Owen Roe,</hi> whom nothing could ſatisfie <hi>but the Britiſh Eſtates in</hi> Ulſter)
prepared for his Journy, and in the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he went to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny</hi>
with about 200 Horſe and 1200 Foot, which ſmall Party was a
Guard more for State than Security, for <hi>what need an Army amongst
Friends?</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>His Excellency was received at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> with all imaginable Triumph
and Reſpect, and intended in conjunction with the Iriſh to march into
<hi>Munſter,</hi> to force <hi>Inſiquin</hi> likewiſe to ſubmit to the Peace; but when he
underſtood, what the Clergy had done, and were doing at <hi>Waterford,</hi> he
ſent ſome of Quality thither, to perſwade them not to interrupt the
Peace, which was likely to be ſo advantageous to the King and the
People, he offered his Lady and Children for Hoſtages, that they ſhould
not be diſturbed in the Poſſeſſion of the Churches they then had, (which
was the Secret Article not mentioned in the Publick, and purpoſely ſo
contrived by the Popiſh Biſhop of <hi>Clogher,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">☜</note> that on occaſion they might

be printed, and be made as firm and obliging as the preſent Peace;
that the Confederates do oblige themſelves by Union, Oath, and otherwiſe, to

Letters taken at <hi>Naſeby;</hi> that <hi>Ormond</hi> had Power to Repeal Penal Laws,

and no interruption ſhall be given them in the mean time. That the
Repeal of the Penal Laws was purpoſely omitted in the Peace, as being leſs than
<hi>Glamorgan</hi>'s Conceſſions, and therefore might derogate from them; and the

                                 <hi>This Anſwer ſo baffled the Congregation, that all the Reply they

<hi>and that</hi> the Supreme Council, being part of the Confederate Body, could
be no Security to the reſt for what they promiſed; <hi>and that</hi> the Peace being

prepares for War, and in order to it he borrowed a good Sum of

                              <p>From <hi>Calan</hi> his Excellency ſent the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the <hi>Supreme Council</hi> with his Return, and the Reaſons of it, and
to ſtay Leiger with them; and he alſo ſent ſome of his Servants for
ſome Neceſſaries he had left at his own houſe in <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> but when they
came there, they found this Inconſtant City, (which few days before
had received the Lord Lieutenant with Acclamations of Joy) pulling
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65997:374"/>
down the Monuments of his Entertainment, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Devices on the

                              </p>
                              <p>However, the <hi>Supreme Council</hi> ordered Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon</hi> and Doctor
<hi>Fennell</hi> by Letters to aſſure his Excellency, That notwithſtanding what
had hapned, there ſhould be no farther Hoſtilities us'd; whereof <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
took hold, and deſir'd them to aſcertain a competent Time of
Ceſſation, that they might come to a right Underſtanding: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they made no Reply; but in ſtead of that, <hi>Ormond</hi> had certain
Advice from other Hands, That <hi>Owen Roe</hi> had fallen into the <hi>Queens
County</hi> with great violence, and had taken ſeveral Caſtles from the
King's Party, and deſtroy'd all that oppos'd him; and particularly,
that his Soldiers had in Cold Blood murdered <hi>Major Piggot,</hi> and Fifty
others, at <hi>Diſert,</hi> to whom they had promiſed Quarter.</p>
                              <p>And about the ſame time the Caſtle of <hi>Athlone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                                 </hi> was ſurprized by
<hi>George Dillon,</hi> a Friar, Uncle to the Lord Preſident; and that Place
being the Key and principal Fortreſs of <hi>Conaught,</hi> was a great acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Strength to the Confederate Party.</p>
                              <p>And ſo the Triumphant <hi>Nuncio,</hi> not doubting but that all was his
own, came in State to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where he cauſed all the <hi>Supreme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
except <hi>Plunket</hi> and <hi>Darcy,</hi> to be impriſon'd; and immediately he
inſtituted a new <hi>Supreme Council</hi> of his own Creatures, who, to requite
his Kindneſs, did in effect commit to him the entire and abſolute
Power of Governing and Commanding as he pleas'd, as well in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
as Eccleſiaſtical Matters.</p>
                              <p>But that which was moſt ſtrange in this ſtupendious Revolution,
was, That General <hi>Preſton</hi> and his Army, being moſtly of the <hi>Pale,</hi>
and in whom <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood and Honor ſhould have had more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
than to ſuffer them to be guilty of ſo manifeſt and perfidious
Violation of a Peace, ſo lately made with their own King, ſhould be
perſuaded to joyn with <hi>Owen Roe</hi> and the <hi>Ulſter Iriſh</hi> in ſo ill a Cauſe,
and even againſt his Intereſt; and yet it is certain, that they were
tainted ſo early<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that tho' <hi>Owen Roe</hi> march'd through their Quarters to
intercept <hi>Ormond,</hi> yet none of them ſent him the leaſt notice; and
when the Marquis ſent to <hi>Preſton</hi> to come to him to conſult about
thoſe Affairs, <hi>Preſton</hi> excuſed it with a Pretence of Sickneſs.</p>
                              <p>Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Nuncio</hi> would not truſt him, until he had tied him

which he marched towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> and was ſo confident to take it by

Arguments of Probability, that it was generally believ'd in his Camp;
ſo that Colonel <hi>Fitz-Williams</hi> pretending Kindneſs to <hi>Ormond,</hi> did by

Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who was ſo enraged at this unexcuſable Perfidy
of the Confederates, that he reſolved to think no more of Treating
with them, but, on the contrary, prepared for the utmoſt Reſiſtance.
And he was likewiſe very much confirmed in thoſe Reſolutions by the
Opinion of the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> whom he had left Reſident at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi>
and who in his Letter of the 24th of <hi>September</hi> hath this Paſſage: <hi>My

large, in its proper place: And the Lord Lieutenant and Council did write
to the King,<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                                 <hi>That the</hi> Iriſh <hi>having perfidiouſly violated the Peace, had begun a
new War, to wreſt the Kingdom from His Majeſty, and transfer it to the
King of</hi> Spain <hi>or the Pope; to avoid which, they were forced to apply
themſelves to the Parliament.</hi> And the ſame day they wrote to the
Lord Mayor and City of <hi>London</hi> for Aſſiſtance, and aſſur'd them, that
the City Debts ſeiz'd in the beginning of the War, were but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
in extremity; and that an exact Account are kept of them,
and they will be juſtly repaid by the King in due time. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Captain of the Parliaments Ship that carried the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
over, furniſh'd the Lord Lieutenant with Thirty Barrels of
Powder.</p>
                              <p>There was nothing more could be done for the Preſervation of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
but to invite the Parliament Forces of <hi>Ulſter</hi> to its Aſſiſtance,
which was not neglected; and many of them were paſſionately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to the Service, as knowing, that the whole Kingdom would
ſuffer very much in the Loſs of that City: But the Chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and the Parliament Commiſſioners would not conſent, unleſs <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagh</hi>
might be put into their Hands: To which <hi>Ormond</hi> replied, <hi>That
he was in Treaty with the Parliament, and therefore could not part with</hi>
Tredagh <hi>till that were finiſhed;</hi> but deſires them to reinforce his Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,
or divert the Common Enemy by taking the Field.</p>
                              <p>However, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were afraid of this Conjunction; and therefore
<hi>Owen Roe</hi> from <hi>Athy,</hi> on the Ninth of <hi>October,</hi> invited the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
thither to treat with the <hi>Nuncio;</hi> but <hi>Ormond</hi> knew there was
no good Muſick to be made upon that String, and therefore the next
day from <hi>Trim</hi> he return'd an Expoſtulation, <hi>Why they were in Arms?</hi>
and deſired them to reſtore <hi>Athlone</hi> and <hi>Athy:</hi> To which <hi>Owen Roe</hi>
replied the ſame day from <hi>Kilka, That thoſe Gariſons are in ſurer Hands
for the King now, than they were in before, whilſt they were kept by Men
inclined to the Parliament.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But tho this <hi>Iriſh</hi> General was ſo high, being the Favorite of the
<hi>Nuncio</hi> and his Party, yet General <hi>Preſton</hi> was not ſo; but foreſeeing
the Fate and Scandal of the perfidious Breach of the Peace, both he
and his Army were ſomewhat cold in the Affair.</p>
                              <p>Beſides this, there was a <hi>National Emulation</hi> between the Two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<hi>O Neal</hi>'s being <hi>Old Iriſh,</hi> as the others was of the <hi>Old Engliſh;</hi>
and this was increas'd by the Inſolence of the former, and the Envy
of the latter: For <hi>Owen Roe</hi> and his Party, who had been lately Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
at <hi>Bemburb,</hi> and had never ſubmitted to the Peace, becauſe
the <hi>Nuucio</hi> did reject it, thought themſelves juſtly entitled to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of being the <hi>better Soldiers,</hi> and the <hi>better Catholicks:</hi> Whilſt
the other being the Civiliz'd Inhabitants of the <hi>Pale,</hi> look'd upon
the Northern Army as a ſort of <hi>Barbarians:</hi> And therefore the Lord
<hi>Digby</hi> writes thus to the Lord Lieutenant from <hi>Grangemelan, 13 Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
All here of the</hi> Nuncio <hi>and</hi> O Neal'<hi>s Parties is the height of Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and Villanies;</hi> O Neal'<hi>s and</hi> Preſton'<hi>s Armies hate one another more

                              <p>
                                 <hi>Matters ſtanding thus, General</hi> Preſton <hi>On the Nineteenth of</hi> Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>made ſome Propoſals to the Lord</hi> Digby, <hi>to which he return'd
this Anſwer by Sir</hi> Nicholas White, That if <hi>Preſton</hi> would ſubmit to the
Peace, the Lord Lieutenant would break off the other Treaty; but cannot do
it after the Proviſions and Country are deſtroy'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe then he will be tied
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65997:375"/>
by the Teeth to the Parliament, on whom he muſt depend for Bread;—
That he ſhall have reaſonable Security of Religion, but muſt decline the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Expectations of the <hi>Nuncio;</hi> That they ſhall have the Penal Laws
repeal'd, and not be diſturb'd in the Poſſeſſion of the Churches they now have,
until His Majesty's Pleaſure (cut of Restraint) be known:—And for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
hereof, they ſhall have the Engagement of the Queen, the Prince of
<hi>Wales,</hi> of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard;</hi>
and that <hi>Preſton</hi> ſhall have a conſiderable Command; and ſo ſhall as many
of <hi>Owen Roe</hi>'s Officers as will comply:—But an Anſwer must be ſent
before the Lord Lieutenant be neceſſitated to destroy his own Quarters.</p>
                              <p>And this General (<hi>Preston</hi>) did alſo ſend Sir <hi>James Dillon</hi> to offer
the Command of his Army to the Lord of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and that they
would ſubmit to the Peace, if they might be ſecur'd in their Religion.
But as <hi>Clanrickard</hi> would not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meddle without <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Conſent, ſo
<hi>Ormond</hi> began to be ſhie of <hi>Preston,</hi> and not to regard what he ſaid,
becauſe he had promis'd him <hi>not to ſhoot a Gun at any Engliſh Gariſon,</hi>
and yet he did now aſſault and take <hi>Castlejordan;</hi> which breach of
his private Promiſe more ſullied his Reputation with <hi>Ormond,</hi> than did
his Contravention of the General Peace.</p>
                              <p>Moreover, whilſt they pretended fairly, and talk'd of Peace, they
nevertheleſs march'd on, and deſtroy'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarters; and

Meſſage to the Lord Lieutenant in behalf of <hi>Preſton,</hi> and in order to
revive the Peace, he ſmartly anſwered, <hi>That now they had deſtroyed his
Quarters, and taken ſeveral of His Majeſty's Caſtles, and murdered His
Subjects without any cauſe of Complaint, they begin to talk, and but to talk,
of Accommodation:</hi> And when <hi>Preston</hi> replied, <hi>That the Peace was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious
to the Catholicks, and was therefore rejected;</hi> the Marquis
anſwered, <hi>That Oaths are not neceſſary to bind one to his Benefit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are uſeful only when they oblige to Diſadvantage; and if they may for
that Reaſon be violated, all Faith amongst Men is deſtroy'd.</hi> Whereupon,
on the Thirtieth of <hi>October, Preſton</hi> writes, That he will ſend the Lord
Lieutenant Propoſitions in two or three days; which accordinly were

                              <p>In the mean time, the Lord Lieutenant had ſent to the Lord <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickard,</hi>
to come to him with what Aſſiſtance he could, and this Lord
(who was always Loyal, and abhorred the violation of the Peace) did
his Endeavour to bring a conſiderable Party with him, but (as he words
it in his Letter of the Second of <hi>November) The ſharp Sword of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
had ſo cut his Power and means, that he could bring with
him but one Troop of Horſe to</hi> Tecroghan; however, his Preſence was
very conſiderable, and as it gave great Comfort to the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
ſo it gave mighty hopes to <hi>Preſton,</hi> who believed that <hi>Clanric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard</hi>
(who for his exemplary Loyalty would be confided in by one
ſide, and for his Religion might be truſted by the other) was a fit
Mediator to reconcile both Parties; and accordingly he applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to that Lord; and by the Aſſiſtance of the Lord <hi>Digby;</hi> they brought
the matter ſo far to bear, that on the 12th of <hi>November</hi> the Lord <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
writes thus to the Lord Lieutenant.</p>

The moſt that will be expected from you is a Declaration to this effect, That
whereas it is well known, even by His Majeſties Printed Letters, that His
gracious Intentions were to ſecure His Catholick Subjects of this Kingdom,
in the free Exerciſe of their Religion, by repeal of the Penalties of the Law
againſt them; which in the laſt Articles was left out, by the Subtilty of
ſome of their own Party, who intended to found this late miſchief upon it,
that it was far from His Majeſties intention, or Yours to take advantage of
that Omiſſion, but that they may reſt as ſecure of His Majeſties Favour, in
the repeal of the ſaid Penalties; as if it had been poſitively expreſt in the
Articles, and that for matter of their Churches and Eccleſiaſtical Poſſeſſions;
it being referred to the King, it was far from Your intentions to moleſt them
therein, till you knew His Majeſties Pleaſure in that particular.</p>
                              <p>As for your Engagement to obey His Majeſties free Commands, the Queen
and Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and my Significations to the advantage of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
during His Majeſties want of Freedom, and that you will not obey
ſuch Commands to the prejudice of what is undertaken, as ſhall be procured
by advantage of His Majeſties want of Freedom; Your Letter to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> will ſuffice, you muſt proceed frankly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And this was the Poſture of Affairs, when on the 14th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
Commiſſioners arrived from the Parliament with Fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Foot, and other Neceſſaries for the Preſervation of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which
they expected to be given up to them upon the Terms propoſed: In
what Condition was the Marquiſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> now, he had two incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
Treaties upon his hands, and both well nigh concluded, and
he was in Danger leaſt his own Army (who abhorred any farther
Correſpondence with the <hi>Iriſh</hi>) would with the Aſſiſtance of the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Men newly come; Deliver up both <hi>Dublin</hi> and him to
the Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> It is certain, he had need of all that Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
and Preſence of mind that he was Maſter of, to extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of theſe Difficulties, as he afterwards did.</p>
                              <p>It was never a Doubt with him, whether he ſhould preſerve the
Kingdom for his Majeſty, or ſubmit it to the Parliament; but the
Queſtion was, whether an Union with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would do the former,
ſince their Levity was ſuch, as that there could be no dependance upon
them; I have ſeen all the diſpatches between <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Digby</hi> upon
this occaſion, and can aſſure the Reader, that the Lord Lieutenant was
prevailed upon againſt his own Judgment, by the Lord <hi>Digby</hi>'s impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
and when he did Conſent, he foretold the iſſue of that Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</p>
                              <p>But we will firſt give an Account of the Treaty with the Parliament
Commiſſioners, and then diſcover the farther Proceedings with the
<hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Lord Lieutenant and Council, being preſſed by Enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and Neceſſities and intolerable Wants in the City, did, on the
26th day of <hi>September</hi> by Letters to the King, and to the Lord Mayor
of <hi>London,</hi> repreſent the miſerable Condition they were in; and
did alſo ſend over the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Lowther,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Paul Davis</hi> in one of the Parliaments ſhips, to the
Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> with Inſtructions from himſelf and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and other Inſtructions from the Council only. The Inſtructions
from the Lord Lieutenant and Council were: 1. That a Difference
ought to be made the between thoſe that were Contrivers, and firſt
Actors of the Rebellion, and thoſe that by the Torrent of that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
were afterwards accidently engaged therein; and that the Confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the former were ſufficient to ſatisfie the Adventurers. 2. That
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65997:377"/>
they demonſtrate the neceſſity of making the late Peace for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Proteſtants, for tho' the Proteſtants do ſurvive the
breach of the Peace, the Reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the</hi> Iriſh <hi>are now divided,</hi>
and their Frame of Government diſſolved. 3. That before the Peace,
they, the Lord Lieutenant and Council did enter into a Treaty with
the Parliament Commiſſioners in <hi>Ulſter</hi> to prevent it, but by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of the Marquis of <hi>Argile</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of Sir <hi>Robert King</hi>
into <hi>England,</hi> that Treaty fell for want of a ſufficient number of the
Commiſſioners; and that misfortune was followed by the defeat of
<hi>Monroe</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Bemburb.</hi> 4. That <hi>England</hi> has receiv'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by the Peace; Firſt, by their experience of the perfidiouſneſs
and Treachery of the <hi>Iriſh:</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">☞</note> And Secondly, by obtaining juſt cauſe to uſe
them ſeverely. 5. That the <hi>Covenant</hi> may not be impos'd until it be
done by Act of Parliament, that nothing of it may be now impoſed,
leſt it divide the Proteſtants, and hinder them from a joynt proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the War; and for the ſame Reaſon the Book of Common
Prayer be not ſuppreſſed, but let thoſe uſe the Directory that will.
6. To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>uſtifie the Goverment and Conduct of His Majeſties Servants,
and to wipe off all Scandals. 7. To preſerve the Eſtates, Perſons and
Imployments of all thoſe that went hence to ſerve His Majeſty in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and did not joyn with the Rebels, at leaſt to get them Liberty
to compound, or to tranſport themſelves and their Goods. 8. That
it be immediately publiſhed, we have free Commerce and Traffick with
the Parliaments Towns and Allies, and that three or four Ships be
ſent to Guard our Coaſts from the Rebels. 9. That Magazines of all
ſorts be ſpeedily prepared at <hi>Liverpool, Cheſter, &amp;c.</hi> 10. To adviſe
them, that if Succours be not immediately ſent, all will be loſt, and
the recovery of it will coſt ten times as much Blood and Treaſure, as
it will to keep it now. 11. That if the Soldier be not conſtantly
Paid, he will revolt to the better Pay-maſter; and that the Revenue
here does not keep the publick Perſons and Clergy from want. 11. That
Directions be ſent to the Parliaments Forces in <hi>Ulſter, Munſter</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught</hi>
to correſpond and joyn with Us. 12. That if they ſend Forces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their own Officers, Care be taken to Pay ours equally with theirs, to
prevent Difference and Mutiny. 13. That Sir <hi>Francis Butler,</hi> Colonel
<hi>Richard Gibſon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Henry Warren,</hi> Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> and Lieutenant
Colonel <hi>Gibs</hi> now Priſoners with the Parliament, <hi>Being Men that know
the Country, and are experienced in the Service,</hi> may be rather ſent than
Novices and Strangers, or any others: Laſtly, Men without Money
and Victuals, will do us more harm than good: And if as ſoon as you
are at <hi>London,</hi> you do not advertiſe us, that Succours are coming;
our Neceſſities can admit of no delay, but will oblige us to think of
ſome other Courſe.</p>
                              <p>The Inſtructions from the Council were. 1. To demonſtrate, that
the Lord Lieutenant and Officers now employ'd being experienced, will
be more Serviceable to the Preſervation and Reduction of <hi>Ireland</hi> than
any others. 2. That we prefer the intereſt of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi>
before our particular advantage; and therefore rather than our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
ſhall hinder Supplies, we will ſurrender, but becauſe Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
cannot leave their Places without His Majeſties allowance, and
are ſworn to that effect; you muſt declare, that they will reſign, <hi>So
as His Majeſties Direction be therein obtained,</hi> and all of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in Perſons and Eſtates, and indemnified from publick Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and repaid their Disburſements for the publick, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65997:377"/>
for Six Months from private Debts, and have Liberty to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport
themſelves and their Apurtenances where they pleaſe.</p>
                              <p>And Purſuant hereunto, there were two Sets of Proportions deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the Agents; the firſt from the Lord Lieutenant only was,
1. That he would proſecute the War againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
as he ſhall be thereunto enabled by the Parliament, and will
faithfully ſerve the Crown of <hi>England</hi> therein. 2. That neither the
Forces he has, nor the Forces or Supplies that ſhall be ſent him, ſhall
be otherwiſe employed, than according to the Directions of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England.</hi> 3. That he will neither make Ceſſation or Peace
with the Rebels, without Conſent of King and Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
4. That he will be oblig'd hereunto by Oath or otherwayes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
for a Man of Honor and Conſcience. The other Propoſals
were from the Lord Lieutenant and Council demanding. 1. Three
thouſand Foot, and Five hundred Horſe, which will make up thoſe
here to be Seven thouſand fifteen hundred Foot beſides Officers, and
One thouſand Horſe beſides Officers, which at three days Pay in a
Week amounts to 8258 <hi>l. 12 s. od. per</hi> Month of Twenty eight days,
and that three Months Pay for them be ſent, and 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies
and Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> convenient, and ſome ſpare Arms
and Swords. 2. That all that have conſtantly and faithfully ſerved
in this War, may be preſerved in Perſons, Eſtates and Employments
and the like, by thoſe that were for ſome time forcibly kept by the
Rebels; but left them as ſoon as they could, and the ſame of thoſe that
went to ſerve the King in <hi>England;</hi> and the like of ſo many of the
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> as are accepted of as Adherents to His Majeſties Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in this Cauſe.</p>
                              <p>They alſo wrote to the Speaker of the Houſe of Lords, That they
were neceſſitated to make the Peace, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> broke it, becauſe
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>Ulſter</hi> were not ſubverted: And Secondly,
becauſe Popery was not eſtabliſhed in its fulneſs of Juriſdiction and
Practice,—That <hi>Athlone</hi> was ſurpriz'd,—That they were reduced to
Extremity, and refer'd themſelves to the farther report of their
Agents, and prayed immediate Aſſiſtance.</p>
                              <p>Upon the Receipt of theſe Letters, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſend Succours as faſt as they could; but well knowing, that
<hi>Ormond</hi> and his Party were unmoveably fixed in their Loyalty, they
reſolved not to continue him in the Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other Overture, and to ſend Commiſſioners over to receive the
Sword and Gariſons from him, and that being done to ſettle ſuch a
Chief Governour as they ſhould think fit.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>And accordingly they did ſend over Sir</hi> Thomas Wharton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                                 <hi>Sir</hi> Robert
King, <hi>Sir</hi> John Clotworthy, <hi>Sir</hi> Robert Meredith, <hi>and</hi> Richard Salway
<hi>Eſquire: Who on the 13th day of</hi> November <hi>arrived in the</hi> Bay <hi>of</hi>
Dublin, <hi>they immediately ſent to the Lord Lieutenant, that they had
matters of importance for the Preſervation of the Proteſtants of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>to Communicate to his Excellency, and deſired his ſafe Conduct,
which was accordingly ſent them, and the next day they Landed; and
on the 15th, they delivered his Excellency a Copy of their Commiſſion,
and of the</hi> Ordinance <hi>of Parliament, and of their Inſtructions, which
were to this Effect;</hi> To aſſure the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Earl of
<hi>Roſcomon,</hi> &amp;c. that the Parliament would take the Proteſtants of
<hi>Ireland</hi> into their Protection; and if he would ſurrender up the Sword and
Gariſons in four days, that then <hi>Ormond</hi> ſhould enjoy his Eſtate, and have
Indemnity from Debts contracted on the publick Acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                                    <desc>•••</desc>

protected againſt all Debts for a Twelvemonth, that he and his followers may
have Paſſes to go where they pleaſe; that <hi>Ormond</hi> ſhould have Two thouſand
Pound <hi>per annum</hi> for five years, and longer if he cannot receive ſo much
out of his own Eſtate, and that <hi>Ormond</hi> may live in <hi>England</hi> if he will
ſubmit to all Ordinances of Parliament, and that for a Twelvemonth he
may live in <hi>England,</hi> and ſhall not be preſſed to any Oath; he engaging
his Honour not to do any thing diſſerviceable to the Parliament during that
time.</p>
                              <p>Then the Lord Lieutenant demanded, if by the word <hi>Protection,</hi>
it was intended that the Proteſtants ſhould enjoy their Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Eſtates and Employments without Moleſtation of the Parliament;
he alſo deſired to know when the aboveſaid four days were to begin,
and to what Perſons, and to whoſe uſe the Sword and Gariſons were
to be delivered.</p>
                              <p>The Commiſſioners anſwer'd, They could not explain the word
<hi>Protection,</hi> but doubted not but a fair Interpretation would be made
thereof; That the four days commenc'd 15 <hi>November</hi> at Nine in the
Morning, and the Sword and Gariſons were to be ſurrendred to them
the Commiſſioners, to the uſe of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in order
to the Preſervation of the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Ormond</hi> repli'd, That he could not remit the Safety of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
to the incertainty of a future Interpretation.</p>
                              <p>The Commiſſioners then produc'd an additional Inſtruction to give
ſuch Proteſtants as they condition withal, except ſuch as have been in
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, Aſſurance of Security to their Perſons, Eſtates and
Goods in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that they may live quietly under the Protection
of the Parliament, ſubmitting to the Ordinances of Parliament, and
compounding for their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eſtates at two years Purchaſe.</p>
                              <p>On the Sixteenth of <hi>November</hi> the Commiſſioners offered Aſſiſtances
of Men and Ammunition for the preſent Defence of <hi>Dublin,</hi> or Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they be employ'd to no other uſe, and be reſtored if the Treaty
break off.</p>
                              <p>Then <hi>Ormond</hi> demanded, Whether the Proteſtants that concluded
the Ceſſation, or Peace, ſhould be interpreted to be in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:
To which the Commiſſioners anſwered in the Negative. And
being farther demanded, Whether they expected every proteſtant ſhould
treat for himſelf, or that <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Treaty ſhould ſuffice for all, they
anſwer'd, It ſhould ſerve for all that ſubmitted to the Parliament within
twenty days after notice.</p>
                              <p>Then <hi>Ormond</hi> ask'd, Whether it was expected they ſhould ſubmit to
all Ordinances of Parliament that were or ſhould be made. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
anſwer'd, He ſaw the Words, and they had no Inſtruction
to explain them.</p>
                              <p>Laſtly, he told them, He found no Inſtruction about continuing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
and Civil Officers. They anſwered, They had no Inſtructions
about Civil Officers, but they had power, and did accordingly intend,
to employ as many of the Military Officers as ſhould be found fit for
the Service.</p>
                              <p>On the Seventeenth of <hi>November, Ormond</hi> deſir'd their Anſwer to his
Propoſitions ſent into <hi>England:</hi> But the Commiſſioners anſwer'd, They
neither had them, nor a Copy of them, nor any Inſtructions about
them; and therefore they preſt for his Excellencies Anſwer to their
Propoſals. The Marquis repli'd, That if they would declare that they
had no larger Inſtructions than thoſe that were ſhewed, he would give
a poſitive Anſwer. But they, on the Eighteenth of <hi>November,</hi> deſired
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65997:378"/>
to be excuſed from that Diſcovery. Whereupon <hi>Ormond</hi> demanded,
Whether they had His Majeſties Order for delivering up the Sword
and Gariſons. They anſwered, They had not. Then ſays he, <hi>Since
you bring no Anſwer to my Propoſitions; Nor Security to any Proteſtants as
you ſhall Condition withal; Nor can inform us what thoſe Ordinances of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
are, we must ſubmit unto; Nor any ways ſecure ſuch Papiſts as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
adhered to the Government; Nor give any Aſſurance to the Officers
Military and Civil, for their Continuance; Nor take any notice of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Clergy: Nor bring His Majeſty's Orders; It is not conſiſtent with my
Duty to part with ſo great a Truſt in ſuch a manner, without the King's p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </p>
                              <p>The ſame day the Commiſſioners repli'd, That all Proteſtants (not
having been in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion) ſhould be included in this Treaty,
and have the full Benefit of the Inſtructions; and that <hi>all Ordinances of
Parliament</hi> ſhall be conſtrued, <hi>ſuch as thoſe who have not offended the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
do ſubmit to:</hi> And the Compoſition for Eſtates in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhall be
in the ſame manner as is uſed in <hi>England;</hi> provided it be done within
Six Months: That they were willing to enlarge his 5000 <hi>l.</hi> to the Sum
he demanded in his Propoſition, <hi>viz. 13877 l. 14 s. 9 d.</hi> That they
had power of Granting Penſions, not exceeding <hi>in toto 2000 l. per An.</hi>
to continue till the perſons can receive ſo much out of their own Eſtates,
which they will apply as he thinks fit.</p>
                              <p>On the Nineteenth of <hi>November, Ormond</hi> anſwered, That ſtill the
Loyal Roman-Catholicks were not ſecured, nor the Civil or Military
Officers provided for, nor the Clergy conſidered; That the <hi>Covenant</hi>
is enjoyn'd by one of thoſe Ordinances of Parliament; That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
His Majeſty's Directions was the firſt Article of his Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Parliament; it is the firſt and fundamental Condition, from
which he cannot recede, in regard of his Oath when he took the Sword,
and the rather becauſe by ſurrendring the Government the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
will be diſſolved, which is the greateſt and beſt Security of
the Proteſtants.</p>
                              <p>Hereupon the Commiſſioners deſired a Conference; and tho' there
was but half an hour of the four days expired, yet the Marquis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to a Conference, which was to this effect, and was the next day,
by the Commiſſioners, reduced to Writing.</p>
                              <p>That <hi>Ormond</hi> had waved his firſt Propoſitions (to continue in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) by the Second Overture to Surrender, and had notice, That the
Parliament proceeded upon that ſecond Overture; That their Conceſſions are
more ample in ſome points than his Demands, and where they are leſs or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
they will repreſent it to their Employers in the beſt manner for his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
Satisfaction.</p>
                              <p>That as to Loyal Roman-Catholicks, the Parliament did not take Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of any ſuch, and 'tis not probable that their number can be conſiderable,
and if they have committed no Crime, they need not queſtion their Security:
That they had power to protect all that would come under Contribution, <hi>ergo</hi>
Papiſts; and they will alſo favourably recommend their Caſe to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                              <p>That as to Civil Officers, they have no Inſtructions about them; if they are
Offenders, they canot expect Security in their politick Capacities, but ſhall have
it in Perſon and Eſtate. As for Military Officers, it muſt be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Cauſe ſhall diſplace any of them, but it would be of ill Conſequence to
ſtipulate their Continuance; And that to Clergy and Officers the Penſion of
2000 <hi>l. per An.</hi> ſhould be diſtributed.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="180" facs="tcp:65997:379"/>
That there is no Ordinance of Parliament enjoyns taking the <hi>Covenant</hi> in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> nor have they any Orders to ſuppreſs the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and
impoſe the <hi>Directory.</hi> That if his Lordſhip were continued chief Governor,
he muſt ſubmit to Ordinances of Parliament.</p>
                              <p>That his Lordſhip's Importunity for Speedy Supplies did not afford time to
get the King's Orders. That his Letter to the King, that he would treat with
the Parliament, had no Clauſe deſiring an Anſwer, knowing <hi>That the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
and prudence of the Action would oblige the King's Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
That in his Lordſhip's Propoſitions to continue the Government, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to put all under the Protection of the Parliament, without mention of His
Majeſties Directions. And that the King's Orders were not neceſſary, becauſe
the Management of the War of <hi>Ireland</hi> was <hi>by Act of Parliament delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to both Houſes.</hi> That <hi>Oxford</hi> ſurrendred without the King's Orders.
That the Proteſtant Religion, and the Blood of many Thouſands of Proteſtants
which are in hazard by breaking this Treaty, exceedingly over-ballance the
<hi>Punctilio</hi> of having poſitive Orders in this Caſe: And that his Lordſhip's
Oath is better obſerved in concluding than diſſolving this Treaty.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>To all this the Lord-Lieutenant replied,</hi> That the Proteſtants in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and particularly the Officers and Clergy, were concern'd in his Propoſals;
and if the Parliament had proceeded upon his own Propoſitions of continuing
the Government, the King's Conſent, or ſo much Security or Proviſion for his
Loyal Subjects, had not been neceſſary, becauſe it would in a great meaſure lie
in his power to do Right to King and Subject: But ſince they proceeded upon
his Second Overture, (<hi>viz.</hi> of ſurrendring the Sword) the firſt Article of that
Paper was to obtain the King's Directions, and the reſt were for the Security
of his Loyal Subjects in their Perſons, Eſtates, and Employments; none of
which is effected.</p>
                              <p>As for the Loyal Papiſts, (whoſe number and Quality are conſiderable)
there is no ſatisfaction given: For the Anſwer that the Parliament took no
Cognizance of them is the reaſon of the Demand; and to ſay, <hi>That the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
need not fear,</hi> affords but ſmall Security: And the Protection given
thoſe under Contribution, is what is extended to ſubmitting Rebels, and is
not ſufficient for Loyal People that deſerve more Countenance; and the rather,
becauſe the reſt of their Religion in <hi>Ireland</hi> have been Faulty.</p>
                              <p>That as to Civil Officers, There is no manner of Security, as to their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments;
and to Military Officers, not ſufficient; and the rather, becauſe
many of them have fought againſt the Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and done other
diſobliging Acts to them. That the power of granting a Penſion of 2000 <hi>l.
per An.</hi> cannot be applied to Officers or Clergy, but to Men of Eſtates that
are diſpoſſeſſed, as appears by the Limitation of its Continuance, <hi>viz. until
they can poſſeſs ſo much of their own Eſtates.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>That the Covenant hath been already preſſed and impoſed in all parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that are under the power of the Parliament; and therefore they muſt be
ſecure againſt that; and if there be no Ordinance of Parliament to impoſe it,
the Commiſſioners may the better undertake it ſhall not be impoſed.</p>
                              <p>That tho' his Lordſhip, if he were to continue the Government, would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Ordinances of Parliament that relate to Government of the Army, or
the like, yet he would not to Ordinances of Religion, againſt his Conſcience;
and doth not ſcruple now that the people ſhall be obliged to Ordinances of the
former ſort; and the Commiſſioners Declaration, <hi>That they intend no other,</hi>
will give Satisfaction in this point.</p>
                              <p>That there was time enough to get the King's Orders.—That the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of <hi>Oxford</hi> was forced by Extremity, and yet was not done without the
King's Direction. That Inferences muſt not be made againſt any thing that is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65997:379"/>
expreſſed: And beſides the firſt Article, <hi>To procure His Majeſties Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
the Seventh Article Mentions, That if in the mean time, <hi>till they can
get the King's Orders,</hi> they ſupply the Gariſons, it ſhall be well husbanded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
So that this Matter is fully and doubly expreſſed in thoſe Propoſals.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>And laſtly,</hi> There is no Satisfaction given about the Diſſolution of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which would be the Ruin of the Proteſtants of
that Kingdom.</p>
                              <p>But becauſe the Kingdom might not be deprived of the Supplies the
Commiſſioners brought, and that neither ſide may be prejudiced until
the King's Pleaſure may be known, and their Inſtructions from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

                              <p>But the Commiſſioners, thinking that the Exigencies of the City and
Army, and the danger to loſe both, would force the Lord-Lieutenant
to comply, refuſed theſe Propoſals, and repeated, <hi>That his Lordſhip

<hi>but</hi> Clanrickard <hi>replyed,</hi> That it is more plauſible to refuſe Obedience
to the King till he become Catholick, than until (being a Proteſtant) he refuſe

neceſſitated to raiſe the Siege, this Agreement would make their

Commiſſioners would make an everlaſting Fewd between them and
<hi>Ormond.</hi> And, 3. <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Forces, being in the Engliſh Gariſons, might
find an opportunity to maſter ſome of them.</p>
                              <p>Nevertheleſs it was neceſſary that <hi>Owen Roe</hi> ſhould decline the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

all that he could not keep.</p>

                              <p>But contrary to his expectation, General <hi>Preſton</hi> decamped, and on
the ſecond of <hi>December,</hi> from <hi>Naas,</hi> writes to his Excellency <hi>That the
neceſſities of his Army forced him to withdraw thither, where he ſtayed to
expect his Lordſhips farther Commands:</hi> And the ſame day <hi>Ormond</hi> replyed,
That he would certainly meet him at <hi>Caſtledermond</hi> that day ſevenight
with 600 Horſe and 600 Muſquetiers, and that he will cauſe Commiſſions
to be prepared, with blanks for the Names of <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Officers, to
whom he will give proof of his full confidence in them, and value of
their Merit and loyal Affections; and for <hi>Preſton</hi> himſelf, that he
ſhould have all the Power with the Lord Lieutenant that he could

                              <p>And thus Matters ſtood in a fair Correſpondence between his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,

Waterford, <hi>endeavoured to excuſe this Apoſtacy, and</hi> laid the fault upon

                                 <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                                 <hi>to this effect:</hi> That
ſince the Engagement, made by the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> doth not yield
ſufficient Security for the Free Exerciſe of Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<note n="*" place="margin">Appendix 35.</note>Annotations thereon doth appear; and ſince a Reſolution was taken, not
to receive any of his Forces into the Gariſon of <hi>Dublin,</hi> according to Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
unleſs theſe Objections may be ſatisfied by the Enlargement of farther
Grants that may ſatisfy the Council and Congregation, he thinks himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Oath of Aſſociation to obey the Council, Congregation, and General
Aſſembly. <hi>Whereupon the Lord Lieutenant, by his Letter of the 5th
of</hi> January, <hi>acquaints him,</hi> That however things have not ſorted to his
Expectation, or to what he underſtood to be <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Obligation; yet he was
far from believing, that <hi>Preſton</hi> had any deſign ſo unbecoming a Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as to make uſe of the Credit given by <hi>Ormond</hi> to his Invitation, to the
Lord Lieutenants Prejudice, or for the Improvement of <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Conditions
with another Party, which makes him confident, that a Printed Paper, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
<hi>Preſton</hi>'s <hi>Declaration,</hi> &amp;c. and dated but three days after the former
Letter of the 19th of <hi>December,</hi> being ſo contrary to the Expreſſions therein,
muſt be a <hi>Forgery;</hi> at alſo the Reports that ſome of <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Forces are
gathering together at <hi>Caſtledermond,</hi> to interrupt his Return, or deſtroy the
remainder of his Quarters, yet he deſires Satisfaction from <hi>Preſton</hi>'s own hand
in thoſe Particulars: <hi>And accordingly General</hi> Preston <hi>did, by his Letter
of the 15th of</hi> January, <hi>own his Declaration, for which (he writes)
he had good Reaſons, to be imparted at a more convenient time,
but diſowned that he had any hand in diſturbing his Excellency's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or interrupting his Return.</hi>

                                 <hi>But that the Reader may perceive, that this Perfidiouſneſs was not
unexpected, I muſt inſert a ſhort Paſſage in a Letter of the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
to Colonel</hi> John Humilton, <hi>dated at</hi> Lucan, <hi>before he knew of</hi>
Preſton'<hi>s Relapſe, and it was thus:</hi> That I may leave no means unattempted
to prevent the Ruin of His Majesty's Affairs, whilſt I have a hand in them,
I have undertaken an Expedition, whereunto I was invited by a conſiderable
Party of the Iriſh; but I confeſs, I go rather to leave them for ever unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable,
if they ſhould fail me, than that I have any aſſured Confidence of
Performance; ſuch are the Impreſſions their former Failures have left in
me.</p>
                              <p>But becauſe it may be thought hard, that the Confederates ſhould
be judged by the Sentiments of Proteſtants, it is therefore neceſſary
to ſhew, what Opinion ſuch of the Roman Catholicks as were loyal
had of their Proceedings, and the Reader may find it at large in the
Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>'s Letter, <hi>Appendix</hi> 37.</p>
                              <p>But <hi>Ormond,</hi> either becauſe he conſidered the Poverty of the City of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> or that being thus a ſecond time deceived by the Confederates,
he was aſhamed to return hither, did march his ſmall Army into <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meath,</hi>
being the Enemies Quarters, and there he kept a melancholy
<hi>Christmas;</hi> and though he uſed no Hoſtility, but paid for every thing,
ſo that the Country ſeemed pleaſed with them, yet the Captain

                              <p>
                                 <hi>I</hi> Shall beſeech you to be careful of one thing, which is, to take Order
that the Commands that ſhall be directed to me touching this People, (if

for in that, and in that only, I ſhall reſort to the liberty left to a

                              <p>However, whilſt <hi>Ormond</hi> continued at <hi>Trim,</hi> the Lord <hi>Muskry,</hi>
and ſome others, (that abhorred the breach of the Peace) gave
him hopes, That in the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> which was to meet the
10th of <hi>January,</hi> Matters would be better ordered, and deſired him
patiently to expect that, and propoſed a ſhort Ceſſation, which was
afterwards (at <hi>Dublin</hi>) agreed unto.</p>
                              <p>To this Aſſembly, the Lord Lieutenant ſent the Lord <hi>Taaf</hi> and

betrayed to Infamy,</hi> if they neglect this opportunity offered
to vindicate themſelves, and exhorting them to a ſpeedy and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Confirmation of the Peace; but the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> had determined
the Point the day before they came, and ſo the <hi>Letter</hi> was never
delivered.</p>

For this extraordinary Juncto, or General Aſſembly, which was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
governed by the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> did on the very firſt day of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
receive a Paper of Unreaſonable Propoſals from the Congregation
of their Clergy, <hi>viz. To have all manner of Juriſdictions, Privileges,
and Immunities, as amply as they had in the Time of</hi> Hen. VII. <hi>and to have
all the Church-Livings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>conferred upon them.</hi> And on the Fifteenth
day of <hi>January</hi> they wrote to the Lord Lieutenant to keep his Forces
within his own Quarters; and on the Second of <hi>February</hi> they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a frantick Mixture of a Declaration, containing Two very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
things,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>claration,</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix 36.</note> 
                                 <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, <hi>That the Commiſſioners had acted honeſtly,
and purſuant to their Inſtructions, in making the Peace;</hi> and, Secondly,
<hi>That the Nuncio and Clergy had done well in breaking it.</hi> And they far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declar'd, <hi>That they might not accept of that Peace, but did protest
againſt it, and declare the ſame invalid, and of no force, to all intents and
purpoſes:</hi> As alſo, <hi>That the Nation would not accept of any Peace not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a ſufficient and ſatisfactory Security for the Religion, Lives, Eſtates,
and Liberties of the Confederate Catholicks.</hi> And what they underſtood
to be <hi>ſufficient,</hi> appears by the Propoſitions publiſhed by the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
at <hi>Waterford,</hi> which they had cauſed the People to ſwear they
would inſiſt upon: And the Reaſon they gave for this Procedure was
as ſtrange as the Act, <hi>viz. That</hi> Glamorgan'<hi>s Articles gave them better
Conditions:</hi> Whereas thoſe Articles were diſavowed and rejected by
the King, and even by the Earl himſelf acknowledg'd not to be bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both becauſe of the Defezance, and the Failure in ſending Succors
according to Promiſe. And the Confederates likewiſe had admitted
that Agreement void, by embracing a ſubſequent Peace on other
Terms. Nevertheleſs, this Aſſembly was ſo violent againſt the Peace,
that ſome of them attempted to Disband General <hi>Preſton,</hi> becauſe he
was more moderate, and better inclin'd to it than they: And to that
end the Biſhop of <hi>Fornes</hi> brought in an Impeachment againſt him;
but <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Friends were ſo loud upon that Point, that the Biſhop
was fain to withdraw his Accuſation;<note place="margin">Ad gladios &amp; pugiles in ipſo Senatu ventum fuiſſet. <hi>Beling.</hi> 39.</note> or elſe they had gone to Cuffs
even in the very <hi>Aſſembly.</hi> Nevertheleſs, when they had talk'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
out of breath, they began to find the Neceſſity of putting a
better Gloſs upon what they had done; and therefore they reſolv'd
to propoſe Terms of Accommodation, that at leaſt they might have
it to ſay, <hi>that Peace was refus'd them:</hi> And ſo on the laſt of <hi>February</hi>
they ſent Dr. <hi>Fennell</hi> and another with ſufficient Credentials, to Treat
with the Lord Lieutenant, and to make Propoſals unto him; but it
was plain, that their Deſign was to amuſe the World, and to aſperſe
his Excellency with the Noiſe of this Treaty, and the Pretence that
they offered Reaſonable Conditions, and that therefore he was not
neceſſitated to ſurrender to the Parliament, but ſhould rather have
complied with them; for they not only refus'd to reduce thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
into Writing, but alſo denied to ſign the Subſtance or Extract
of them when written, altho' they could not deny, but that it was
truly taken as they had dictated.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>But it is fit that the World ſhould know the Unreaſonableneſs of
theſe very Propoſals, which were to this effect:</hi> 1. That each Party
ſhould continue <hi>Independent.</hi> 2. That they ſhould joyn in a War againſt
the Common Enemy, (<hi>meaning the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Proteſtants that adhered to
the Parliament</hi>) and that neither Party ſhould make Peace or Ceſſation, or
uſe Traffick or Commerce with them, without the others Conſent. 3. That
<hi>Dublin</hi> and other Gariſons might be ſecur'd (<hi>by their Soldiers</hi>) againſt the
Common Enemy. 4. That all Papiſts in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarters have free Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65997:382"/>
of their Religion; that is, (<hi>as they afterwards explain'd it</hi>) the
Churches and Church-livings, and Exemption from the Juriſdiction of the
Proteſtant Clergy, in all Places (except <hi>Dublin</hi>) where the greater number
of the Inhabitants are Catholicks. 5. That no body be permitted to live
within <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarters, but ſuch as will ſwear to this Accommodation.
<hi>And,</hi> 6. That if both Armies joyn in any Expedition, nevertheleſs they are
to be Commanded by their <hi>own reſpective Commanders,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>But theſe Propoſals being made known to the Privy-Council, they
did unanimouſly and with ſcorn reject them; and the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
did on the 22th of <hi>March,</hi> 1646. write to the <hi>Supreme Council,</hi>
That he could not comply with their Propoſitions in the manner they
were propos'd. And ſo the Aſſembly was on the Third of <hi>April</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd
to the Twentieth day of <hi>November</hi> following.</p>
                              <p>And now what could be more amazing, than to ſee a People, and
eſpecially the Nobility and Gentry of a whole Kingdom, many of
which had good Breeding and good Fortunes, give up the Conduct
of their Reaſon, as well as their Conſciences, to the wild Ambition
and Covetouſneſs of the Clergy? Men who ventur'd nothing by their
prepoſterous Attempts to ſet up their Religion; for in all Events they
were to find Welcome abroad, and to be reverenc'd even for being
vanquiſh'd: But for thoſe Gentlemen who had no certainty of Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
elſewhere, how imprudent was it towards their lawful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
King, whoſe Pardon they ſo much needed, to require from
Him ſuch Conditions in Matters of Religion, as by the Advantage it
gave to His other Enemies, in whoſe Hands he was, muſt take from
Him more than their Aſſiſtance could afford, and by this fooliſh Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
weaken and diminiſh that Power by which only they could be
ſaved? Nevertheleſs, they did in this manner trample upon the Peace,
not only in a Heat, but in Cold Blood, and thereby rendred all future
Expectations vain, and their own Condition irreparable.</p>
                              <p>But let us return to the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who was aſtoniſh'd at
this fooliſh Procedure of the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> He had already received Orders
from His Majeſty, <hi>That if he could not keep</hi> Dublin, <hi>he ſhould rather
ſurrender it to the Parliament, than to the</hi> Iriſh; and he very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Sentiments of the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland:</hi> For altho' ſome
of them were very fearful of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and many of them had
great Jealouſies and Suſpicions of each other, yet all agreed againſt
the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> and in their Abhorrence and Miſtruſt of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi>
ſo that the Privy Council repreſented to his Excellency, That they
had deſerved as well of the King as Subjects poſſibly could, either by
<hi>Doing</hi> or <hi>Suffering;</hi> and therefore they hoped he would not expoſe
them to the Mercy of their cruel and hereditary Enemies,<note place="margin">☞</note> who by
their late Perfidiouſneſs had made themſelves incapable of Truſt; and
therefore they deſired him again, to Treat with the Parliaments Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
who would at leaſt perform the Conditions they promiſe,
which could not be relied on from the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>And it is ſaid, That his Excellency did rather incline to this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
becauſe he knew that the Deſign of many in this</hi> Iriſh <hi>Rebellion
was intirely</hi> to alienate the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> from the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">P. W. Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, 583.</note>
and to extirpate not only the Proteſtants, but alſo all the <hi>Engliſh, tho'

unleſs they could advance one of the Old <hi>Iriſh</hi> Families to the Throne. <hi>And
accordingly Mr.</hi> Anthony Martin, <hi>in the laſt General Aſſembly, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to call in ſome Foreign Prince for Protection.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="187" facs="tcp:65997:382"/>
And ſo the Lord Lieutenant and Council being reduced to ſo great
ſtraits, that they had but Seventeen Barrels of Powder le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>t, and no
Magazins either of Stores or Victuals, nor any Money, either to buy
more, or to pay the Army, did agree to reſign the Kingdom to the
Parliament, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                              <p>1. It was obſerved,<note place="margin">☜</note> That no Exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion
was ſo much as tolerated, where the Confederates had the Command;
and that if all the Churches in His Majeſty's Quarters ſhould be given,
or ſuffered to be taken to the Uſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, it would
too much countenance the Reproaches of His Majeſty's Inclinations
to Popery, and might be dangerouſly applied by thoſe who had His
Majeſty's Life in their Power.</p>
                              <p>2. That it could not be for His Majeſty's Honor, to have thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and Servants who had ſtuck to His Cauſe, after all beſides was
loſt in His Three Kingdoms, to be at laſt ſubjected to the Tyranny of
thoſe who then ruled among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> whoſe Perſidy was ſo manifeſt,
and their Malice ſo great, as to give Reſt to the Parliament Forces,
and to unite all their Power againſt thoſe only who had carried Peace
to their very Doors.</p>
                              <p>Laſtly, It was known how many Agents the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had employed
abroad, and what Publick Miniſters had Reception with them; as from
the Pope, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> That if the Gariſons now
held were put into the Hands of the Two Houſes of Parliament, they
would revert by Treaty, or otherwiſe, whenever His Majeſty ſhould
in <hi>England</hi> recover His Rights; but if either given or left to theſe
Confederates, there was little hopes of Reſtitution, while any Foreign
Prince ſhould think his Affairs ſecured or advanced by conſuming the
Blood and Treaſure of <hi>England</hi> in this Diſpute.</p>
                              <p>And ſo on the Fifth of <hi>February</hi> they made an Act of Council,
which recites their ſad Condition, and impowers the Lord Lieutenant
to renew the Treaty with the Parliament, for the Surrender of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and quitting the Government. And accordingly, his Excellency did
the next day write to <hi>Wharton</hi> and <hi>Salway,</hi> two of the Parliament Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
<hi>That he was now ſatisfied in the Point he ſcrupled at,</hi> viz. <hi>the
King's Orders, and therefore was willing to ſurrender the Government on
the Terms formerly propos'd, and deſir'd that Succors might be ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Hereupon the Parliament did order,<note place="margin">3 March.</note> That if <hi>Ormond</hi> would give

ſuch a free Earneſt of your Excellencies Love to our Religion, Nation, and
both Houſes, do incite Us here to come unto you, with Hearts filled with
your Love, and Tongues declaring how much We are obliged to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,

of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> with Three thouſand of the Men deſign'd for <hi>England,</hi>
was gone to recover that place, he poſſed himſelf at <hi>Six-mile-bridge,</hi>
and made that his Camp and his Magazine, but in the beginning of <hi>April</hi>
the Gariſon ſallyed and killed Captain <hi>Magrah,</hi> and many of the
<hi>Thomond</hi> Men, aud beat their Party, and not only burned <hi>Six-mile-bridge,</hi>
but ſcowred the whole Country to within Three mile of
<hi>Limerick.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Hereupon <hi>Glamorgan</hi> appointed a Rendezvouz at <hi>Clonmel,</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make a Second Attempt, but whilſt he was contriving to impeach
and impriſon the Lord <hi>Muskery,</hi> that Lord by his Intereſt and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
was too hard for him, and obtained the Command of the
Army, which he preſently conducted to the Siege of <hi>Bunratty;</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
that place held out Six weeks after he came before it, and
at laſt ſurrendered upon honourable Articles.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Supream Council</hi> removed to <hi>Limerick,</hi> to Countenance this

Confederates, gathered 1000 Horſe; whereby <hi>Inſiquin</hi> being hindred
from farther Preying the Country, was oblig'd to return to his Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and in the mean time the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> took the Lord <hi>Muskrye</hi>'s

                                 <hi>Munſter,</hi> I do not any where find, ſaving that the Lord of <hi>Inſiquin</hi> took

and in <hi>March</hi> viſited <hi>Tallow, Liſmore, Formoy</hi> and <hi>Youghall,</hi> and had
<hi>Knockmone</hi> delivered unto him; but when he returned to <hi>Cork,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

Endeavours to diſplace him.</p>
                              <p>And in <hi>Ulſter</hi> I find nothing more done, than what hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
related of the Battel of <hi>Bemburb,</hi> ſaving that the Commiſſioners, in
the later end of <hi>October,</hi> whilſt <hi>Owen Roe</hi> was at the Siege of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and to divert him from it, ſent out Seven hundred Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
from <hi>Liſnegarvy,</hi> and they ravag'd over the Counties of <hi>Cavan,
Monaghan, Louth,</hi> and <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> and deſtroyed <hi>Owen Roe</hi>'s Quarters,
and burnt many of his Villages, and abundance of <hi>Corn,</hi> and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<hi>Carickmacroſs;</hi> and after a Fortnights ſtay abroad, they brought
home as many Cattle, and as much other Plunder, as they could
drive, or carry. As alſo, That the <hi>Lagan</hi> and <hi>Eniskilling</hi> Forces being
joyned, met <hi>Owen Roe</hi> near <hi>Clowniſh,</hi> and gave him a ſmall Defeat.</p>
                              <p>And as for <hi>Conaught,</hi> it ſeems that General <hi>Preſton</hi> took <hi>Roſcomon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Midſummer,</hi> and reduced moſt part of that <hi>Province;</hi> for on the
Tenth of <hi>December</hi> Mr. <hi>Anneſly,</hi> Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> Sir <hi>John Temple,</hi>

<hi>Sligo</hi> and five or ſix Caſtles, wherein the Parliament hath Six Hundred
Horſe and Fourteen Hundred Foot; but that in <hi>Munſter</hi> the Parliament

Foot and Three Hundred Horſe; and that all <hi>Ulſter</hi> is theirs, except <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemont,
Dunganon,</hi> and <hi>Montjoy,</hi> which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have, and <hi>Newry</hi> and

                              <p>But ſince we have related what the Confederates did at home, it is
fit that we ſhould alſo enquire what they did abroad; which we may

pretendeth at Court, That he ſuffers for adhering to my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> and
our King's Party; however at his Arrival here, <hi>Hartegan</hi> was not more
violent than he was againſt my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> and that Party.</p>
                              <p>MR. <hi>Jeofry Baron</hi> landed at <hi>Waterford</hi> on Friday the Eleventh of

                                 </gap>f his Negotiation, he anſwered, That for
the moſt part it conſiſted in the Letters he had brought with him, and made
ſome ſcruple to communicate them to any other than a ſworn Council, becauſe
the matter required Secrecy: At length a Committee was appointed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
the Letters; and Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon,</hi> the Chairman, reported from that
Committee, That it was requiſite the Letters ſhould be read in the Aſſembly,
which was done accordingly.</p>
                              <p>The firſt was a Letter of 30 <hi>January,</hi> from Dr. <hi>Tirrell,</hi> (one of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Agents) importing, That the Repture of the late Peace did at firſt ſeem to
both the Courts in <hi>France</hi> to trench far upon the publick Faith of the Kingdom;
but when ſome ſlight Objections were ſolidly refuted, and full Information gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
then the Rejection of the Peace was confirmed by the King and Queen of
<hi>France,</hi> and by Cardinal <hi>Mazarine;</hi> but when they heard of the Return of
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces from <hi>Dublin,</hi> they ſuſpected their Weakneſs and Diviſion,
wherefore he adviſes them to unite their Forces, and attack that City again,
and make themſelves Maſters of the Kingdom; and thereby they will regain
the good Will of the King and Queen of <hi>France:</hi> And that the Queen and
Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> are coming to <hi>Ireland;</hi> and adviſes not to agree upon ſlight
Terms; for when they come, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> will have their Wills.</p>
                              <p>The ſecond was a Letter from the King of <hi>France,</hi> of 26 <hi>September,</hi> to
this effect, That being well informed of the Inclinations the Kingdom hath to
him, he will take a particular Care of their Intereſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The third and fourth were from Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> containing general
Promiſes, and that the Settlement of His Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> would much
rejoyce the King of <hi>France.</hi>

                              <p>The Fifth was from Colonel <hi>Fitz-Williams,</hi> Aſſuring them, That if they
would provid a good Reception from the Queen and Prince in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
moſt of their Demands would be granted. That the Queen denies to have
any Power to treat with the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> but that ſhe will ſend for it. That

them the Parliamentarians can do the <hi>Iriſh</hi> no hurt. That the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
and <hi>Independents</hi> will certainly fall out. That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhould
not decline any of their Propoſals for Peace; for he is ſure they ſhall have
all.</p>

                              <p>Theſe Letters being read, Mr. <hi>Baron</hi> ſaid his Embaſſy was on two Points;
Firſt, To excuſe the not ſending Three Thouſand Men to the King of <hi>France,</hi>
according to Promiſe, which he had done to Content; and the ſecond was to
ſollicit Aids from the Queen, which at firſt ſhe promiſed ſufficient to bring
the War to the wiſhed Period? but at the ſecond Audience ſhe was quite off
from it, being ſo perſuaded by her Proteſtant Councillors: And that Cardinal
<hi>Mazarine</hi> ſent them Twelve Thouſand Livres, which is all he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
                              <p>The year 1647.<note place="margin">1647.</note> began with the<note n="*" place="margin">March 30.</note> Arrival of Colonel <hi>Caſtle</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was ſent by the Parliament to the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s
Aſſiſtance, and was followed by Colonel <hi>Hungerford</hi>'s<note n="*" place="margin">April 30.</note> Regiment, and
Colonel <hi>Long</hi>'s, and by the Commiſſioners themſelves, who landed the
7th of <hi>June,</hi> and brought with them 1400 Foot and 600 Horſe, and
immediately they proceeded to the Treaty, which was on the 18th of
<hi>June</hi> concluded on the Articles mentioned, <hi>Appendix</hi> 39. And the ſame
day the Marquis of <hi>Ormond (Extrema neceſſitate compulſus,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
page 47) ſurrendered <hi>Dublin, Tredagh,</hi> and his other Gariſons,
unto them, but kept the <hi>Regalia</hi> until the 25th of <hi>July,</hi> and then deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up them alſo and went to <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>This Action of the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s hath ſome Reſemblance to
that of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, in marrying his eldeſt Daughter to the King
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were both Actions of great Foreſight and Prudence;
and as the later hath united <hi>Scotland</hi> to the reſt of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſo the
former hath preſerved <hi>Ireland</hi> in obedience to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi>
and therefore the Confederates, eſpecially the Nuncio Party, (whoſe
Deſigns were diametrically oppoſite to that which happened) do hate
the Name of <hi>Ormond</hi> above all others, and have written<note n="*" place="margin">Deſerter of Loyal Friends by Biſhop of <hi>Fernes,</hi> and <hi>Vindiciae ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae</hi> by <hi>John Ponſe,</hi> and the bleeding <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia, &amp;c.</hi>
                                 </note> Volumes of
Scandals and unjuſt Reproaches againſt him, for preferring the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
before the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> whom they call his own Country-men.</p>
                              <p>But we muſt look back, and ſee what the <hi>Confederates</hi> did to prevent
this Agreement with the Parliament, and in truth they did but little of
themſelves, for their Talent was greater in breaking Articles of their
own making, then thoſe that were made by others: I cannot find they
did any thing more than ſend a Letter of the 28th of <hi>March,</hi> to Invite
the Lord of <hi>Dunſany</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas White</hi> to a Conjunction with them,
and with part of their Army beſiege the Caſtle of <hi>Carlow</hi> on the 18th
of <hi>April;</hi> of which laſt, <hi>Ormond</hi> immediately ſent notice both to the
Lord <hi>Liſle</hi> in <hi>Manſter,</hi> and to <hi>Monroe</hi> in <hi>Ulſter,</hi> in hopes that they would
make ſome Excurſions to ſave the place by <hi>Diverſion,</hi> which they could
not, and ſo it was ſurrendered upon Articles.</p>
                              <p>But there happened a lucky opportunity (if they would have embraced
it) of making a Peace with the King, notwithſtanding that ſome of
the Parliament Succors were arrived; for the Parliament Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
when they came over, brought Bills of Exchange that were not
authentick, and in the mean time <hi>Winter Grant</hi> (a Papiſt, and a ſubtile
Man) was ſent over to <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Queen to haſten a Peace, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and his Inſtructions in order to it were to be varied, uſed, or
rejected, as the Lord Lieutenant upon the place ſhould think fit, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65997:386"/>
to deliver or ſuppreſs the Letters he had to the Nuncio and to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
as <hi>Ormond</hi> ſhould adviſe, by whom he was to be governed in all
things, and he brought with him 14 Blanks to be filled up as the Lord
Lieutenant ſhould pleaſe, and he was to know <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Opinion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Prince ſhould come to <hi>Ireland</hi> or not?</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Hereupon</hi> Winter Grant <hi>on the 15th of</hi> April <hi>went to the</hi> Supreme
Council <hi>with Directions, to promiſe the Confederates, That if they
agree to a Ceſſation, the Lord Lieutenant will not receive any more of
the Parliament Forces in three weeks from the 18th Inſtant; but they
would not conſent to ſo ſhort a Truce, but on the 10th of</hi> May <hi>they
did write,</hi> That they muſt inſiſt on the Propoſitions of the Congregation at
<hi>Waterford,</hi> but are willing to make good the Propoſitions made by Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi>
and will readily aſſiſt to preſerve <hi>Dublin</hi> for the King againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>And it ſeems they had wrought upon</hi> Winter Grant, <hi>for he by his
Letter of the 13th of</hi> May, preſſes the Concluſion of the Peace, and offers,
that the Iriſh Armies ſhall drive back the Parliamentarians. <hi>But to theſe
Inſtances,</hi> Ormond <hi>returned</hi> this Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> on the 15th of <hi>May;</hi>
That the two firſt of Dr. <hi>Fennell</hi>'s<note n="*" place="margin">See them ante Page 185.</note> Propoſitions are fit between Neighbouring
Princes in a League Offenſive and Defenſive, but not between Subjects and their
King, and that there is no poſſibility of a Peace, whilſt they inſiſt on the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Congregation at <hi>Waterford;</hi> and that theſe feigned Offers are for
vile Ends, either to Calumniate if we dont, or Deceive us if we do, Accept
them. <hi>However, he wrote more moderately to the Confederates, but
they never vouchaſafed to ſend him a Reply.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And it ought to be noted, That the Lord Lieutenant carried himſelf
ſo well in this matter, that even the Queen and Prince did approve of
what he had done, and in evidence thereof, afterwards ſent him over
to the Government of <hi>Ireland, anno</hi> 1648. and Sir <hi>Robert Talbot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Darcy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Beling,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Dungan,</hi> did confeſs to the Lord
<hi>Digby, That</hi> Ormond <hi>could not avoid doing as he did;</hi> which I ſhould not
have mentioned,<note place="margin">Vindiciae ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae 48.</note> but that ſome of the Confederates in word and in
writing, with the greateſt Malice and Bitterneſs imaginable, without
conſidering the King's Directions in the Caſe, or the inſuperable Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of that Action, have accuſed the Marquis of Diſloyalty, in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
up the King's City and Sword to His Majeſty's Enemies, and for
ſaying,<note place="margin">Si alterutris ex perduclibus neceſſario tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda eſſent ſe Anglis potius quam hibernis conſignaturum Vindiciae ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae 63.</note> 
                                 <hi>That if he muſt ſurrender it to any of the Rebels, he would rather do
it to the Engliſh than the Iriſh.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But perhaps a curious Reader may be inquiſitive to know the Myſtery
of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s keeping the <hi>Regalia</hi> almoſt five weeks longer than he did
the City, and it was this: There were many Anti-Nunciotiſts amongſt
the Confederates, who were willing to leave the Kingdom, and be
tranſported into <hi>France</hi> under the Command of the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
and Monſieur <hi>Talon</hi> was every day expected with French Ships to that
purpoſe, but he did not come within the time; and after it was expired,
<hi>Ormond</hi> could not obtain licenſe for their Tranſportation from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
tho it ſeemed to be their Intereſt to get ſo eaſily rid of ſo many
Enemies.</p>
                              <p>But it is time to attend the new Governors, and ſee how they handle
the Iriſh, and manage their Affairs: One of the firſt things they did,
was, to reduce the eleven old broken Regiments to ſeven, under the Earl
of <hi>Kildare,</hi> the Lord <hi>Moor,</hi> and the Colonels <hi>Titchburn, Borlace, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
Bayly,</hi> and <hi>Flower,</hi> and then they made Colonel <hi>Michael Jones</hi>
Governor of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Commander in chief of the Province of
<hi>Leinster,</hi> and on the 20th of <hi>June</hi> they did by their Proclamation ſtrictly
prohibit the Exactions and Free Quarter of the Army; whereupon the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65997:386"/>
Soldiers grew ſo mutinous, that Mr. <hi>Anneſley</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert King</hi> were
obliged to quit the Kingdom for a time, for fear of Violence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by
another Proclamation of the ſame date, they prohibited the uſe of the
<hi>Common Prayer,</hi> which occaſioned an excellent Petition or Declarat on
from the Epiſcopal Clergy, to be found at large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                                 <hi>Burlace, Appendix</hi> 94.</p>
                              <p>And it is fit we ſhould alſo enquire, how the valiant Confederates, who
did inſult ſo ſawcily on the Neceſſities of an Impriſoned King, did
behave themſelves againſt the more powerful Parliament, and indeed
they began pretty well at firſt, though they paid dear for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
for General <hi>Jones</hi> having marched ſome Men out of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
was met by General <hi>Preſton</hi> within 12 miles of the City, and beaten
back again; whereupon <hi>Preston</hi> (whoſe Army was 10000 ſtrong) poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
himſelf of moſt of the Out-Gariſons, even to within 8 miles of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> and then went to beſiege <hi>Trim,</hi> wherein lay a Regiment of Foot
and ſome Horſe under Colonel <hi>Fenwick.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>To relieve this place by diverſion, <hi>Jones</hi> on the 17th of <hi>July</hi> marched
out of <hi>Dublin</hi> with 1000 Foot and 400 Horſe, and burned <hi>Caſtlemartin,</hi>
and took good Prey from <hi>Castlebawne;</hi> but the Iriſh fell upon his Rear
near <hi>Johnstown</hi> and killed Captain <hi>Meredith,</hi> a Gentleman of clear Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and great Hopes, and ſeveral others, and had deſtroyed them all,
if this Retreat had not been managed with excellent Conduct and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Courage.</p>
                              <p>And though ſome Men's Courage, like a Fever, proceeds rather
from Diſtemper than Conſtitution, and acts diſtractedly whilſt it is
in ferment, but is ſoon allayed and ſuppreſſed; yet true Valour is like
Fire, the more Oyl is caſt upon it the more it flames; and true Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is ſo far from being daunted by Adverſity, that it is rather there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſtimulated to new Encounters.</p>
                              <p>And thus it was with <hi>Jones,</hi> who diſdained theſe Baffles he had received
from the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and was reſolved to regain his Reputation, and retrieve
the Glory of his <hi>Nation,</hi> or dye; and accordingly on the firſt day of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> he drew out two Regiments of Horſe and 3800 Foot, half ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Soldiers that were ready to mutiny for want; he had alſo ſome
Artillery, and what elſe he thought requiſite to relieve <hi>Trim.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But <hi>Preston</hi> having notice of this March, raiſed the Siege, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to get between the Engliſh and <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſo to have ſurprized
that City, whilſt the other relieved <hi>Trim;</hi> but <hi>Jones</hi> (being reinforced
by Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn</hi> from <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Moor</hi> from <hi>Dundalk,</hi>
Colonel <hi>Conway,</hi> and ſome <hi>Scots</hi> and others, from <hi>Newry, Carling ford, &amp;c.</hi>
amounting in all to 700 Horſe and 1200 Foot,) followed <hi>Preston,</hi> who
(beſides what the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> of <hi>Costilogh</hi> and the two <hi>Nugents</hi> brought
him) had effectually 7300 Foot and 1047 Horſe, and overtook him at
<hi>Dungan Hill,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Battel of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Hill.</hi>
                                 </note> where it came to a fair Battel on the 8th of <hi>August,</hi> and
<hi>Jones,</hi> by plain Valour and downright Blows, obtained the greateſt and
moſt entire Victory that had been gained during the War, for there
were ſlain on the place 5470 Men, beſides many that were gleaned up
afterwards, amounting in all to 6000; and there were 5 Colonels and
4 Lieutenant Colonels, 6 Majors, 32 Captains, 23 Lieutenants, 27 En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
2 Cornets, 22 Sergeants, 2 Quartermaſters, 2 Gunners, the
Clerk of the Store, 13 Troopers, and 228 Common Soldiers, taken
Priſoners; the Cannon and Carriages, and 64 fair Oxen for the Train,
were alſo taken; and, which is moſt ſtrange, there were not above
20 Engliſh men ſlain in this fierce Encounter, which happened that
very day Twelve-month the Nuncio and Clergy at <hi>Waterford</hi> had
broken the Peace of 1646; and therefore Mr. <hi>Beling</hi> reckons this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65997:387"/>
Defeat as a Judgment on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> for their perfidious breach of that
Peace.</p>
                              <p>The reaſon of ſo great a Slaughter, was, becauſe the Iriſh Foot fled
to a Bog, and the Engliſh ſurrounded it, and ſo had the killing of them
all; and indeed, the extraordinary Valour of Major <hi>James Clotworthy</hi>
ought not to be forgotten, for he not only killed the Cannonier juſt as
he was ready to fire, but alſo tought ſo deſperately, that his Horſe
received 17 wounds and was killed, and himſelf had two Shot in
his Armour.</p>
                              <p>Upon this Defeat the Iriſh quitted and burnt <hi>Naas, Sigginstown, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanstown,
Caſtlewarding,</hi> and <hi>Moyglare,</hi> and had been forced to quit
more, but that Pay and Proviſion grew ſo ſcant, that the Army was
fain to return to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where 1500 <hi>l.</hi> was newly arrived; and not
long after greater Supplies were ſent over, together with 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
for a Preſent to General <hi>Jones</hi> for his extraordinary good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                              <p>But that which is prodigiouſly Strange, and almoſt Incredible, is,
That the Nuncio, the Clergy, and the old Iriſh, did rather rejoyce
than grieve at this Misfortune of <hi>Preſton</hi>'s, for his Army were <hi>old
Engliſh</hi> of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and but half-pac'd Nuncio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>iſts, ſo that they could
hardly be truſted: And now the Clergy were rid of them by this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
and <hi>Owen Roe</hi> (who was their Darling) became General of the
three Provinces; and under him Sir <hi>Thomas Eſmond</hi> commanded the
Foot, and Colonel <hi>Peirce Butler</hi> the Horſe, in <hi>Leinſter;</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Farrel,</hi> and <hi>Henry O Neal,</hi> in <hi>Conaught;</hi> and Major General <hi>O Neal,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Philem O Neal,</hi> in <hi>Ulſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                                 </hi> And though <hi>Preſton</hi> did pretend to
recruit his Forces, yet it was ſo faintly and ſlowly, that ſmall regard
was had of him.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Owen Roe</hi> being thus qualified, marched to viſit his Province of <hi>Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and <hi>Jones</hi> being recruited at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and afterwards joyned with
<hi>Monk</hi> at <hi>Trim,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">In <hi>October.</hi>
                                 </note> marched forward to face him; but the Iriſh General
was more cunning than to fight, and loſe all his Army at once, as <hi>Preſton</hi>

to the Ground: But on the third of <hi>May, Inſiquin</hi> drew out 1500 Horſe,
and as many Foot, and took <hi>Drumanna</hi> and <hi>Capoquin,</hi> and on the 10th

to beſiege <hi>Clonmell;</hi> but the want of Victuals and Carriages,
<hi>which has been fatal to moſt of the Martial Undertakings in</hi> Ireland, did alſo
force him to return to <hi>Cork,</hi> whereof the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
being advertized, they ordered him Thanks, and a Train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</p>
                              <p>But on the 29th of <hi>May</hi> he marched out again as far as <hi>Cappoquin,</hi>
and on the third of <hi>June</hi> Major <hi>Purdam</hi> with a detached Party took a
Prey near <hi>Carrick,</hi> and brought it to the Army; but Captain <hi>Power,</hi>
who went with a Party of Horſe to diſcover the Enemy, had not ſo
good fortune, for ſome of them got between him and home, and cut
off 60 of his Men, and took 12 Priſoners; and ſo great were the wants
of the Army, that the Soldiers died by Scores, and <hi>Inſiquin</hi> was again
obliged to return, without doing any great Exploits in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                              <p>Nevertheleſs being reinforced from <hi>England,</hi> he marched out again in
the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and met with great Succeſs, for he took <hi>Cahir</hi>
by Surrender, and the Rock of <hi>Caſhell</hi> by Storm, with great Slaughter
of the Enemy, whereof above 20 were Prieſts or Fryers; and from
thence he went to <hi>Carrick,</hi> where he was civilly treated by the Lady
<hi>Thurles,</hi> and he put that whole Country under Contribution, and would
have beſieged <hi>Clonmell,</hi> if the uſual want of Proviſions had not hindered
his deſign.</p>
                              <p>But <hi>Inſiquin</hi> having on the 28th of <hi>September</hi> received a very large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
of ſome thouſands of Men, under the Command of the Colonels,
<hi>Gray, Needham, Temple, &amp;c.</hi> did again take the Field with 4000 Foot and

Army under the Lord <hi>Taaff,</hi> conſiſting of 7464 Foot and 1076 Horſe;
beſides Officers, and gave them a total Defeat at <hi>Knockinoſs;</hi> there were
4000 Iriſh ſlain upon the place; and 6000 Arms, 38 Colours, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
Tent and Cabinet, and all their Baggage and Ammunion, were
taken; and upon notice of it, the Parliament voted 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to be ſent
to <hi>Munſter,</hi> and a Letter of Thanks, and 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for a Preſent, to be
ſent to the Lord of <hi>Inſiquin:</hi> However, all this did not hinder him from
ſending them (in <hi>January</hi> following) the Remonſtrance mentioned,
<hi>Appendix</hi> 39. and not long after he made a Ceſſation with the Iriſh, as we
ſhall ſee anon.</p>
                              <p>But the loſs of the Catholick Army in <hi>Munſter,</hi> about three Months
after the Defeat at <hi>Dungan Hill,</hi> did ſo mortifie the <hi>Confederates,</hi> and
their Repreſentatives in the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> which was then
Sitting at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> that they grew very deſirous of a Peace, if
they knew where or from whom to obtain it, for the King was then
Priſoner in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and there was no Acceſs to him, and
therefore it was reſolved to ſend Ambaſſadors to the Queen and Prince
then in <hi>France,</hi> to propoſe Conditions to them, whereof one was to be,
<hi>That they ſhould ſend a Roman Catholick Lord Lieutenant to</hi> Ireland, and
that if the Queen and Prince declined the Affair, that then they ſhould
ſeek <hi>the Protection of ſome other Prince;</hi> and it was alſo reſolved, to ſend
to the Pope, to inform his Holineſs of the miſerable State of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Accordingly the Marquis of <hi>Antrim,</hi> the Viſcount <hi>Muskry,</hi> and <hi>Geofry
Brown,</hi> were ſent to <hi>France;</hi> and, beſides their Errand to the Queen
and Prince, they had Inſtructions in reference to the Court of <hi>France</hi> to
be found here, <hi>Appendix</hi> 40.</p>
                              <p>And the Biſhop of <hi>Fernes</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Plunket</hi> were diſpatched to
<hi>Rome</hi> with Inſtructions mentioned likewiſe, <hi>Appendix</hi> 40.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="198" facs="tcp:65997:388"/>
There was alſo an Ambaſſador ſent to <hi>Spain</hi> with like Inſtructions as
to <hi>France, Mutatis mutandis,</hi> that no Stone might remain unturned that
might grind the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>In the mean time the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> by the aforeſaid loſs of their Two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
were left very naked and weak, and lay expos'd to the Efforts
of the next Summer; and therefore did project, if poſſible, either to
make a Ceſſation with <hi>Inſiquin</hi> or the <hi>Scots:</hi> And it ſucceeded beyond
their expectation, not only becauſe the <hi>Nuncio</hi> gave his expreſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to it, but becauſe <hi>Inſiquin</hi> began to be jealous that the Parliament,
or rather the prevailing <hi>Independent Faction,</hi> aim'd at turning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
into a Republick, wherein the Nobility would loſe their
Privileges and their Peerage. And this Notion was ſo well improved
by the Loyal Induſtry of Dean <hi>Boyle.</hi> now Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> that it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the aforeſaid Remonſtrance, and prepar'd <hi>Inſiquin</hi> to declare for
the King upon the firſt Opportunity. And therefore in <hi>January</hi> he ſent
them the aforeſaid Remonſtrance, and not long after impriſon'd ſome
of his reſiſting Officers that continued firm to the Parliament, and ſo
ſtood ready to declare for the King.</p>
                              <p>Moreover it was conſidered, that the Support of the King was a Branch
of <hi>The Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> which therefore <hi>Inſiquin</hi> thought to
be infring'd by the Votes of <hi>Non-Addreſſes</hi> to His Majeſty; and that
he might be the better inform'd of other Mens ſenſe of this Affair, he
ſent a Meſſenger into <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince it was impoſſible to correſpond
with the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party in <hi>England,</hi> and from the Eſtates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Scotland</hi> he had full Approbation of what he had done, and
of the Ceſſation he intended to make with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in order to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the King's Service, and anſwer the Ends of the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
Whereupon the Parliament voted him a Rebel and a Traytor, on the
Fourteenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1648. And ſo we will leave that Affair, till I
come to reſume it in order the next Year.</p>
                              <p>As for <hi>Connaught,</hi> it can afford but little Matter for an Hiſtorian this
Year, being intirely in the Hands of the Confederates, <hi>Sligo</hi> and
three or four Caſtles only excepted: Nor was there much done in <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
that I can find, moſt of their Forces being diverted at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Dungan-hill,</hi> as hath been already related. But it is mentioned
in <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs, pag.</hi> 254. That Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> gave the Rebels a
great Defeat, and killed 1000 of them; but where or how, I cannot find.</p>
                              <p>Finally, In this Year was publiſhed a moſt Treaſonable and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

the <hi>Scots,</hi> as they ſhould find moſt convenient; yet now, when he found

had ſhut the Door againſt farther Succors from <hi>England,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to play over his old Tricks again, and ſent a Letter to the <hi>Supreme
Council,</hi> adviſing them againſt the Ceſſation, 1. Becauſe <hi>Inſiquin</hi>'s Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
had given him the Poſſeſſion of many Popiſh Eſtates and Churches,
which muſt be left ſo by this Truce. 2. Becauſe <hi>Inſiquin</hi> was their
moſt inveterate Enemy, and was ſtain'd with the Blood of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
at <hi>Caſhell,</hi> and elſewhere. And, 3. Becauſe <hi>Inſiquin</hi> can have no
Supplies from <hi>England,</hi> and therefore muſt reſtore all their own to the
Catholicks if he be proſecuted, and therefore ſhould have no Ceſſation.</p>
                              <p>But the <hi>Council</hi> replied,<note place="margin">Beling 65.</note> They had ſo many Enemies in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
that they could not fall upon <hi>Inſiquin;</hi> and if they did, he had
Walled Towns and Forces enough to defend himſelf: That it would
be ſcandalous to proſecute him, that had as good as declared for
the King, and at the ſame time to neglect the Parliaments Forces,
that were His Majeſty's Enemies; and that if they did ſo, they could
expect no Fruit of their Embaſſie to the Queen and Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
<hi>Nuncio</hi> replied, and they rejoyned; but at length he came to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi>
and when, after many Expoſtulations, he found they were reſolved to
proceed to conclude the Ceſſation, on the Seventh of <hi>May</hi> he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
privately from <hi>Kilkenny</hi> to <hi>Owen Roe</hi>'s Camp at <hi>Killminch</hi> in the
<hi>Queen's County,</hi> and ſent a Letter to the <hi>Supreme Council,</hi> to inform
them of this Flight, and the Reaſons of it. Many Meſſages and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
paſt between them, and all imaginable Endeavors were uſed to
get him back and reconcile him, but in vain; for having notice that
they had publiſhed the Ceſſation the Twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> he, together
with the Biſhops of <hi>Clogher, Roſs, Cork,</hi> and <hi>Down,</hi> on the 27th of the
ſame Month, iſſued an Excommunication againſt all the Adherents to
this Ceſſation; from which, as being very erroneous both in Matter
and Form, the <hi>Supreme Council</hi> made an Appeal to the Pope, on the
31th of <hi>May;</hi> and on the Fourteenth of <hi>June</hi> they propos'd ſome
Queries about it to the Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> who gave them Anſwers to
their ſatisfaction, all which are to be found at large in the <hi>Appendix</hi>
of Inſtruments annexed to <hi>Peter Walſh</hi>'s Loyal Remonſtrance.</p>
                              <p>It is almoſt incredible what Execution a Popiſh Excommunication can

Defence, and did likewiſe renew their Oath of Aſſociation on the
20th of <hi>June,</hi> and the ſame day declared War againſt <hi>Owen Roe</hi> and
his Adherents.</p>
                              <p>In the mean time, the Nuncio the very next day after he had Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
the <hi>Supream Council</hi> ſent them word; that he deſign'd
to Indict a National Synod at <hi>Athlone;</hi> but they were ſo far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of that, that they ordered the Marquiſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> (who
ſided with them, ever ſince this laſt Ceſſation with <hi>Inſiquin;</hi> and
whereof he was a great Inſtrument) and General <hi>Preſton,</hi> to beſiege
<hi>Athlone,</hi> which they accordingly perform'd, and took it before <hi>Owen
Roe</hi> could march up to its relief.</p>
                              <p>Upon the taking of <hi>Athlone,</hi> the Nuncio went to <hi>Gallaway,</hi> which
Town had agreed to the Ceſſation, and therefore all Divine Offices
were interdicted, and the Churches were ſhut, and the very Enſigns
of Authority were forced from the Mayors own Houſe; but that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
occaſioned ſuch a Tumult, that if thoſe Badges of Office, had
not been immediately returned to the Mayor, by the ſame hand that
took them, it had certainly come to Blows and Blood in the very
Streets, and as it was, two or three Men were ſlain in the Scuffle;

                              <p>But what is yet more horrible and monſtrous is, that the Fryars
every where Preached <hi>unavoidable Damnation, to all thoſe that ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here

the utmoſt Degree of Diſtraction and Madneſs; and yet, as if this
were not enough, when thoſe, who had ſome Senſe and Moderation
yet left, made a Scruple to fight againſt their near Relations, and thoſe
of their own Religion for ſo ſmall a matter; the Nuncio for removing
thoſe Scruples, publiſhed the following Declaration.</p>
                              <p>IN the Name of God Amen, Whereas about Our laſt Deciſion, concerning
the Publication of the Ceſſation, it was objected by ſome; that altho'
for the avoiding of ſome Loſs of Temporal Goods, they could not with a ſafe
Conſcience publiſh that Ceſſation, yet it is doubted by them, whether the ſame

might follow upon the oppoſition made againſt it: We by theſe Preſents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that it is a Mortal ſin againſt God and his Church, and a breach of
the Oath of Aſſociation, either to procure, or ſuffer the Publication of that
Truce; and that Catholicks ought, and are bound to undergo the Loſs of all
their Temporal Goods, their Liberty, all that is dear to them, and even their
Life it ſelf, rather than publiſh or obey it: This alſo was the Senſe of theſe
Our Words in Our former Decree, <hi>Nullo modo licet, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed We
well know, that Men cannot loſe their Goods in this Diſſenſion, <hi>without
the Slaughter of ſome, or perhaps of many:</hi> In Witneſs whereof, We have
Signed theſe Preſents with Our own Hands, the 13th day <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1648.</p>

of their Negotiation to the Houſe; they made a full Repreſentation
to his Holineſs of the deſperate Condition of the Kingdom, that without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and good Supplies, which they expected from his Holineſs, there was no
hope of the Preſervation of the Catholick Religion or Nation. That his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was bound in Juſtice to do it, his Nuncio here having in a General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of the Confederates undertaken, That the Sum promiſed Sir <hi>Kenelm
Digby</hi> for the Wars of England, upon good Conditions for Catholicks, would
be applied to the Service of the Catholick Confederates of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but after
four Months attendance, their Anſwer was, (there being no Intelligence then
of our Diſtance or Diviſions with the Lord Nuncio or <hi>Owen O Neal</hi>) That
his Holineſs hath ſent by the Dean of <hi>Firmo</hi> a conſiderable Help unto us, and
that he had no account how that was diſpoſed of; That the Turks were in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
and threatened <hi>Italy;</hi> That there was great Scarcity of Corn in <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the adjoyning Territories, and that a great Sum of Money muſt be iſſued to
ſatisfy the Commoners, That his Predeceſſor Pope <hi>Urban</hi> had left the Treaſury
empty, and the See deeply charged with Debt; That the Cardinals and others,
who had Pious Intentions to advance our Holy Cauſe, were Poor, and hardly
able to maintain their own Ports, ſo that nothing could be expected from
them.</p>
                        <p>And for the Conditions the Agents expected from his Holineſs for Religion,
upon our Treaty with the Queen and Prince, he ſaid, that it was not proper for the
See Apoſtolick to grant any Articles to Hereticks, though it be true that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Princes in <hi>Germany</hi> and other Kingdoms do it. As for the Nuncio's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
That the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be Supplied by his Holineſs
in their Maintenance of the War, that he had no ſuch Commiſſion, though
it was true that his Holineſs would give Money for Conditions of Religion,
but none upon the Event of War. Our Agents heard not of our Diſunion and
Raptures in this Kingdom, until after their taking leave of his Holineſs, and
then when the ſame was known and publiſhed in <hi>Rome,</hi> they heard from ſome
eminent Perſons, That what his Holineſs was reſolved to give for our Support,
he knew not to what Party he would ſend it, we being fleſhed in Blood one againſt

to write to the Lord Lieutenant, <hi>not to proceed any farther in the Treaty
with the Iriſh;</hi> but that Letter was interpreted to come from one in
<hi>Dureſs,</hi> and being contrary to expreſs Orders given his Excellency,
<hi>Not to obey any Commands inconſiſtent with thoſe then received, unleſs they
were manifeſtly for His Majeſty's Advantage, until His Majeſty were at
liberty to declare his Sentiments freely:</hi> That Letter was not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded;
and ſo after twenty days ſpent in the Treaty at <hi>Carrick,</hi> the
Lord Lieutenant, about the middle of <hi>November,</hi> removed to his Caſtle

                  <p>But he depended upon a broken Reed; for beſides that, the Iriſh
had delayed the concluſion of the Peace too long to render it ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the King, and had exacted ſuch Conditions, as would rather
haſten than prevent His Majeſty's Ruine; the Lord Lieutenant was
exceedingly diſappointed in his Calculation, for <hi>Owen Roe</hi> did not at
all come in till it was too late, and moſt of the reſt were deficient in
their promiſed Proportions of Men or Money, ſo that he was forced to
borrow 800 <hi>l.</hi> upon his own Credit, to enable the Army to march.</p>
                  <p>But it muſt not be forgotten, that the Confederates ſtill lay upon

                  <p>But the Peace being concluded, the Iriſh became very troubleſom,
by their Importunities for Offices and Places of Truſt and Honour.
Sir <hi>Richard Blake,</hi> the very next week after the Peace, wrote to Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<hi>Lane</hi> to mind the Lord Lieutenant to make him a Baron, and
others were as careful of their own Advancement; but above all others,
the Inſolence of a Son of <hi>Hugh O Connour</hi> is remarkable, for he on the

him, That the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> had cauſed his Majeſty to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
King on the 16th of <hi>February,</hi> yet he alſo ſent him the bad
News of that Kirk's Declaration, of the 13th of <hi>February,</hi> againſt the
Peace his Excellency had made with the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> But the Lord-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was encouraged to ſtruggle with that Misfortune, by two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
that happened in his favour, <hi>viz.</hi> the Arrival of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi>
and the Departure of the <hi>Nuncio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince, being by the miſtake of his Pilot, put into <hi>Crook-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
did not come into <hi>Kinſale</hi> till the 10th of <hi>February,</hi> tho' his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> arrived above a Fortnight before; he brought
with him ſixteen Frigats, and his deſign was to make way for the
<hi>Prince of Wales;</hi> and he thought it a happy Omen, that the firſt News
he met with, was that of the Peace: Wherefore, upon Conference
with the Lord-Lieutenant at <hi>Corke,</hi> it was reſolved to ſend Capt. <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
to the Prince, to haſten him for <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was accordingly
done; and then the News of the King's Martyrdom arrving, Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi> proclaimed the new King at <hi>Kinſale,</hi> with all the Solemnity
that place was capable of, and put himſelf and all his Officers in
Mourning, and even the Enſigns, Jacks and Streamers of all the
Fleet were altered to a colour ſuitable to the black and diſmal Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt <hi>Prince Rupert</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Kinſale,</hi> his Frigats cruis'd abroad,
and brought in ſeveral conſiderable Prizes, and particularly three
Corn-Ships, which were of great conſequence, becauſe of the want
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65997:393"/>
of Proviſions in the Navy: his Highneſs did alſo raiſe ſome Forces
which he ſent to the Relief of <hi>Scilly,</hi> and he alſo ſent a Bill of 5000
Piſtols to the new King.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Parliament ſent their Sea-Generals <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Dean</hi>
to block up this Fleet in <hi>Kinſale</hi>-Harbour, which they did effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all the Summer, and took the <hi>Guinny</hi>-Frigot that was abroad; and
tho' the Prince did in perſon ſollicite <hi>Waterford, Cork,</hi> and other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
for Aſſiſtance, to ſit out ſome Fire-ſhips; yet at length it was
reſolved rather to let the Winter Storms remove the Enemy, than to
encounter them at ſo great diſadvantage, eſpecially ſince the Prince
could not be ſure of his Men, of whom ſo many deſerted daily, that
it was found neceſſary to hang up ten of thoſe Straglers for a terrour
to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Owen Roe</hi> ſent a Meſſage to his Highneſs, <hi>That
ſince he and</hi> Ormond <hi>had drawn and taſted of each others bloud, he would
never joyn with the Marqueſs; but if his Highneſs would take the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Kingdom, he and all his would readily ſubmit to One of the
Bloud Royal.</hi> But this was counted a Complement, which the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
knew the Prince could not accept of; however it occaſion'd,
that Capt. <hi>Leg</hi> was ſent to haſten the King into <hi>Ireland;</hi> but his Ship
being taken, he was for a long time impriſon'd at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and by a
Court-Martial condemn'd to die.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Prince was in great ſtraits for all Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and tho' he contracted his charge to the well Manning of four
Frigats only, beſides his Flag-Ships, yet there being no Supply from
abroad, Want over-took him even in this narrow Model and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement,
ſo that he was forc'd to rely on what his own perſonal
Intereſt, or Love to his Majeſty's Cauſe, could in ſo tottering a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture

                  <p>And it was at this time that the Generous Loyalty of a private

was meditating a Revolt to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> which it ſoon after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed)
this action was of dangerous conſequence to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that did it, yet he ſurvived that danger, and lived to be well
conſidered for this Service by the Act of Settlement, and as Marks
of his Majeſty's favour, to be made one of the Council of <hi>Munſter,</hi>

                  <p>But tho' the <hi>Nuntio</hi> was gone, yet he had left <hi>Own Roe</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
behind to ſupport his Faction, who together with the Marqueſs
of <hi>Antrim</hi> did oppoſe the Peace, <hi>becauſe the ſix eſcheated Counties in</hi> Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>were not reſtor'd to the old Iriſh:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Beling 165.</note> and with theſe ſided a Multitude
of Fryers, who railed againſt the late Peace, and the ſcandalous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
of the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and threatned inevitable Damnation to all
thoſe that ſhould take part with the Lord-Lieutenant; whereby the
Peace became of little uſe to the King, or advantage to his Affairs,
even whilſt the Biſhops and Secular Clergy adhered to it, which was
not long.</p>
                  <p>But on the 9th of <hi>March</hi> the King by his Letter from the <hi>Hague,</hi>
confirm'd the late Peace, and ordered a new Great Seal to be made,
and to be diſpoſed of to whom the Lord-Lieutenant ſhould think
fit; and appointed the Lord of <hi>Inſiquin</hi> to be Lord-Preſident of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi>
and the Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> to be Lord-Preſident of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi>
if the Lord-Lieutenant find it convenient. And thus ended

of the 28th of <hi>March,</hi> That <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> ſhould be General

accordingly he prepared dilligently for that Expedition: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
beſides his, there were four other diſtinct Intereſts and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in that Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>King's,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> the <hi>Supreme

                  <p>And we will begin with the <hi>King's,</hi> both becauſe it was his, and

<hi>Supreme Council</hi> being united unto it by vertue of the late Peace, and
many of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> under the Lord of <hi>Ards</hi> falling into it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;

and thus compoſed, part of this Army rendezvouz'd at
<hi>Caſhell</hi> on the 3d of <hi>May,</hi> from whence <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> was detach'd with a
Party which took <hi>Rheban Maryburgh</hi> and <hi>Althy</hi> from <hi>Owen Roe</hi>'s Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
with conſiderable ſlaughter; and that being done, it met at <hi>Clogh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenan</hi>
on the 26th of <hi>May,</hi> and marching forward, took <hi>Caſtle-Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,
Kildare, Caſtleſalagh,</hi> and <hi>Caſtlecarbry,</hi> and on the 14th of <hi>June</hi>
encamped at <hi>Naas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And having reſted two or three days, they marched to <hi>Finglaſs,</hi>
and encamped there on the 18th of <hi>June,</hi> and on the 19th a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Party drew nearer <hi>Dublin,</hi> and with ſome loſs skirmiſhed with
the Enemies Horſe, and then return'd to <hi>Finglaſs;</hi> and there <hi>Ormond</hi>
received and diſpos'd into convenient Quarters, a great number of
Papiſts whom Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> (to prevent a Famine) had turn'd out
of the City; and on the 20th the Lord-Lieutenant being informed,

he follow'd the blow to <hi>Tredagh;</hi> and being re-inforced with
two Regiments of Foot, and two Pieces of Artillery, he beſieged
that Town, whilſt it was under conſternation at the late Defeat;
Nevertheleſs, the Garriſon conſiſting of 600 Men, defended the place
with exceeding bravery, until their Powder was ſpent, and then they
did<note n="a" place="margin">30 June.</note> Surrender on Honourable Conditions; and Collonel <hi>Coot</hi>
with 150 Horſe, and 400 Foot marched to <hi>Dublin.</hi>

                  <p>But whilſt <hi>Inſiquin</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Tredagh,</hi> he had notice that Lieutenant-General
<hi>Farrell,</hi> with 500 Foot, and 300 Horſe, was gone to Convey
a conſiderable quantity of Arms and Ammunition, which Collonel
<hi>Monke</hi> had (upon Articles) given to <hi>Owen Roe,</hi> whereupon <hi>Inſiquin</hi>
ſent a detached Party, which met with, and routed this Convoy, and
killed 500 of the Men, and took all the Arms and Ammunition, and
what other Booty they had with them; And it was from ſome of
the Priſoners then taken, that <hi>Inſiquin</hi> was informed of the weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Dundalk;</hi> wherefore, being reſolved to proſecute his good
Fortune, he marched to beſiege it; and being aſſiſted by the Lord
of <hi>Ardes,</hi> he forced <hi>Monk</hi> in two days time, to Surrender the place,
whereunto he was neceſſitated by the Mutiny of the Garriſon,
which elſe would have given him up. Hereupon <hi>Monk</hi> went to
<hi>England,</hi> and was impriſoned for a ſhort time, as ſhall be hereafter
related; and <hi>Inſiquin</hi> took poſſeſſion of <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and a conſiderable
Magazine that was in it.</p>
                  <p>After this prodigious Succeſs, the leſſer Garriſons became an eaſy
Prey, <hi>Newry, Narrow-water, Greencaſtle,</hi> and <hi>Carlingford</hi> ſubmitted to
the Conqueror of courſe, and <hi>Trim</hi> itſelf did not hold out above
two days; and ſo <hi>Inſiquin,</hi> having no more to do, return'd trimphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Royal Camp at <hi>Finglaſs,</hi> with more Men than he firſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out.</p>
                  <p>And there we muſt leave him, till I give a brief Account of the
ſecond Army, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Presbyterian Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> which
was ſo powerful, under the Command of the Lord of <hi>Ardes,</hi> that it
ſeized upon <hi>Belfast</hi> and <hi>Carifergus,</hi> and moſt part of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> and ſome
places in <hi>Conaught:</hi> But they had entertain'd ſuch inconſiſtent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that it was impoſſible for any other Party to joyn with them;
and yet they were too weak to ſtand alone, ſo that their Ruine was
inevitable; nevertheleſs it was haſtned by their Diviſions, for when
their General, the Lord of <hi>Ardes,</hi> perceived, that by the Manifeſto
they publiſhed, they declared an Abhorrence of the Murder of the
late King, which rendered their Conjunction with the <hi>Parliamentari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
impoſſible; and that they publiſhed no leſs Averſion againſt the
<hi>Iriſh;</hi> ſo that they rejected any Correſpondence either with <hi>Owen
Roe</hi> or the <hi>Supreme Council;</hi> and as well for that reaſon, as becauſe
they would not own the new King, there was no hopes of their
Union with the <hi>Cavaleers,</hi> he ſaw the neceſſity of his doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without them, that might ſtrengthen their Party by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Alliance and Conjunction; and being offered by the Lord-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
a Commiſſion to be Chief Governour of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> he was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevailed upon, to ſubmit to the King's Authority, which he did
in the latter end of <hi>April;</hi> and being joyn'd with the <hi>Lagan</hi> Forces,
(which were weakned by the Surprize of Sir <hi>Robert Steward</hi> and
Collonel <hi>Mervin,</hi> at a Chriſtning, by Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> who ſent them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65997:394"/>
Priſoners to <hi>England</hi>) he went to beſiege <hi>London-Derry,</hi> where we
will likewiſe leave him, and give an Account of the third Army,
<hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Supreme Council's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Army was mix'd (I cannot ſay incorporated) with the King's
by the late Peace, and ſo continued until after the Defeat at <hi>Rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines;</hi>
but having a diſtinct Intereſt from the Proteſtant part of the
King's Army, and a National and Religious Averſion unto them, they
never did any ſervice together, where ever the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were the Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and in the end, moſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being ſeduced by the Clergy, did
deſert the King's Service, ſome privately, and others more openly; their
Towns became ungovernable, and their Clergy grew Mutinous, and
rejected the King's Authority in the Lord-Lieutenant; ſo that at
length their pretended Loyalty became the Scorn and Contempt
of their moſt inveterate Enemies, as ſhall be related in its proper
place.</p>
                  <p>And as for the fourth Army, which was under the Command of
<hi>Own Roe,</hi> it conſiſted of natural <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and fierce <hi>Nuntiotiſts;</hi> and this
General was ſo enraged at the <hi>Supreme Council,</hi> both becauſe they did
not comply with the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and becauſe they did not in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Peace, provide for <hi>the Reſtitution of the Eſcheated Lands in</hi> Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that he choſe rather to correſpond with the <hi>Parliament</hi> then
with them: And therefore he did on the 8th day of <hi>May</hi> enter into
Articles with Collonel <hi>Monk,</hi> not only for a Ceſſation for three
Months, but for mutual Aſſiſtance within that time; and that <hi>Monk</hi>
ſhould furniſh <hi>Owen Roe</hi> with Ammunition, if he wanted, and ſhould
ſuffer Ships with Arms, Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſhould be ſent to <hi>Owen Roe,</hi>
to Harbour in any of the <hi>Parliament</hi>'s Ports. And it was in vertue
of this League, that Lieutenant-General <hi>Farrell</hi> had the Ammunition
from <hi>Dundalk,</hi> which <hi>Inſiquin</hi> took from him, as hath been already
related.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Iriſh</hi> General did at the ſame time make ſome extravagant
Propoſals, which being granted, <hi>he and his Army would embrace the
Service and Intereſts of the Parliament of</hi> England: But tho' they were
never conſented to, yet during this League of three Months, he did
faithfully obſerve his Agreement, to the great prejudice of the King's
Army, and to the great advantage of the <hi>Parliament</hi>'s Forces, which
elſe would have been in an ill condition.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, he did on the 22th day of <hi>May,</hi> make a League with
Collonel <hi>Richard Coot,</hi> in the behalf of Sir <hi>Charles Coot;</hi> and purſuant
thereunto, and in conſideration of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, and 2000
Cows, and ſome Ammunition, he did oblige the Lord of <hi>Ards,</hi> and
the <hi>Lagan</hi> Forces, to raiſe the Siege of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> on the 8th day
of <hi>August.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, when the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were acquainted
with theſe Tranſactions, they Diſavowed what the one and the other
of theſe Commanders had done with <hi>Owen Roe:</hi> And tho' Sir <hi>Charles
Coot,</hi> being abſent, eſcaped with a ſevere Check only, yet <hi>Monk,</hi>
who was then in <hi>England,</hi> was Impriſon'd and Diſplac'd; and tho'
when he was brought to the Houſe, he gave good reaſons for what
he had done, and demonſtrated the Advantages that the <hi>Parliament</hi>
had acquired by it, yet the Houſe would by no means approve it,
but on the contrary, made the following Votes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolved,</hi> &amp;c. That this Houſe doth utterly Diſapprove of the Proceedings
of Collonel <hi>Monk,</hi> in the Treaty and Ceſſation made between him and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65997:395"/>
                     <hi>Owen Roe, O Neal;</hi> And that the innocent Blood which hath been ſhed
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is ſo freſh in the Memory of this Houſe, that this Houſe doth
Detest and Abhor the thoughts of cloſing with any Party of Popiſh Rebels
there, who have had their hands in ſhedding that Blood.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the Houſe being ſatisfied, that what the ſaid Collonel
<hi>Monk</hi> did therein, was in his apprehenſion neceſſary for the Preſervation of
the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>'s Interest, the Houſe is content, that the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſideration thereof, as to him, be laid aſide, and ſhall not at any time
hereafter be called in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we are come to the fifth Army, which was that of the
<hi>Parliament</hi>'s; and tho' at this time it was but ſmall, and ill provided,
and had no other Towns in the Kingdom, in their poſſeſſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>London Derry,</hi> and even both theſe were beſieg'd by
conſiderable Armies, yet within half a Year, it became ſo powerful
and victorious, that it recovered the the beſt part of the Kingdom, and
at length reduced it all.</p>
                  <p>And even in this weak condition, and before their Recruits came,
they did all that was poſſible; for before the Royal Army came near
<hi>Dublin,</hi> Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> ſent out a Party under Major <hi>Cadowgan,</hi> to
diſcover the Enemy, and to ſlacken their march; and he did excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Service not only in deſtroying the Country about <hi>Tecroghan,</hi> but
in cutting off a great many of his Enemies; and <hi>Jones</hi> himſelf
marched out as far as the <hi>Naas,</hi> on the 12th of <hi>June,</hi> but having
notice of the Approach of the <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> he returned to his proper
buſineſs of preſerving the City, which he performed exceeding
well.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Ormond</hi> was endeavouring to ſtraiten <hi>Dublin;</hi>
and the better to effect it, the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> of <hi>Coſtilogh,</hi> was ordered
to ſtay on the <hi>North</hi> ſide the City with 2000 Foot and 500 Horſe;
and the Lord-Lieutenant, with the reſt of the Army, marched over
the River to <hi>Rathmines,</hi> on the 25th of <hi>July;</hi> and the very ſame day
the Collonels <hi>Reynolds, Venables,</hi> and <hi>Hunks</hi> arrived with 600 Horſe
and 1500 Foot, and other Supplies of Money, and all other Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
into the City, from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Succours did not ſo much contribute to the Preſervation
of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as did a certain intelligence they brought with them, <hi>that</hi>
Cromwell <hi>and his Army intended to land in</hi> Munſter. Hereupon the
Lord of <hi>Inſiqum,</hi> with a great Party of the beſt Horſe, was detach'd,
to defend that Province, whereby the Army was weakned and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Misfortune it afterwards met with.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, moſt of the General Officers being of Opinion, that
<hi>Baggotrath</hi> might be Fortified and made Tenable, and being ſo,
would ſtraiten the City, ſo that their Horſe could have no Forrage,
and conſequently <hi>Dublin</hi> would in a little time be forced to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
they prevailed with the Lord-Lieutenant to ſuſpend his thoughts
of retiring to <hi>Drumnagh,</hi> and to give Orders for the Fortfying of
<hi>Baggotrath:</hi> Accordingly Major-General <hi>Purcell</hi> (who had been the
forwardeſt Man to this Advice) had the charge of the Undertaking;
and the Army was kept all night in Batallia to countenance the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize:
but when the Lord-Lieutenant (who had been on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
all night) came in the morning to view the Fortification, he
did not find it in that condition he expected; <hi>Purcell</hi> excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by the fault of his Guide: Hereupon the care of that Affair was
committed to another Officer, who by nine a Clock had pretty well
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65997:395"/>
effected his Deſign; and then no ſigns of any Sally appearing, the
Army (which was all this while in Batallia) was permitted to reſt
themſelves; and the Marqueſs retired to his Tent to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
and ſo did moſt of the General Officers, out of a vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that the Enemy would not Sally ſo late in the day.</p>
                  <p>But they found themſelves groſly miſtaken, and were quickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum'd
out of their Sleep; for about ten a Clock, on the 2d of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi>
a party iſſued out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and meeting with better ſucceſs
than they could have the vanity to hope for, they were ſeconded by
moſt part of the Garriſon, by ſingle Troops and Companies, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another; and having ſlain or routed ſome few that oppoſed, ſuch
a Pannick Fear ſeiz'd all the reſt, that a more eaſy or more compleat
Victory could hardly be gain'd: The Lord-Lieutenant in vain uſing
his utmoſt endeavours to Rally the Horſe; whereupon a conſiderable
part of the Foot (finding themſelves deſerted by the Cavalry) did in
a Body ſurrender themſelves: And tho' the Lord <hi>Taaf</hi> eſcaped to the
<hi>North</hi> ſide the River, and importuned the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> &amp;c. to attempt
the recovery of the Field with thoſe 2500 freſh Men; yet ſo great
was the Conſternation, that they could not be prevailed upon to try
their Fortune, nor hardly to provide for their own Safety without
Confuſion, tho' at length they did obſerve the Lord-Lieutenant's
Orders, of going half to <hi>Tredagh</hi> and half to <hi>Trim,</hi> to ſecure thoſe
Garriſons, whilſt his Excellency went to <hi>Kilkenny</hi> to Rally his ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
Troops.</p>
                  <p>In this Battle 4000 Men were killed, and 2517 were taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
whereof ſeveral Officers of note, and all the Artillery, and two
hundred draught Oxen, and indeed all the Baggage of an exceeding
rich Camp, became the Reward and Prize of the Conqueror.</p>
                  <p>This is that fatal Defeat at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſay was ſo
improvident and unfortunate, that nothing has hapned in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
more ſhameful: They did all that Malice could ſuggeſt to place
the fault of this Misfortune on the Lord-Lieutenant; but without
any manner of reaſon, for beſides the aſſurance we have from <hi>Peter
Walſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P. W.</hi> Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, 583-609.</note> that <hi>Edmond Reyly,</hi> Titular Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
this Army; and that the <hi>Nuntio</hi> Party at <hi>Rome</hi> rejoyced exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
at this Defeat: This one obſervation will determine where the
Fault lay, <hi>viz. That</hi> Ormond <hi>was always victorious at the head of an</hi>
Engliſh <hi>Army,</hi> and <hi>the</hi> Iriſh <hi>were always worſted, whoever was their
General,</hi> except only at the Battle of <hi>Bemburb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed, on the 3d of <hi>Auguſt, Ormond</hi> ſtop at <hi>Baliſanon,</hi>
and having found means to make the Garriſon believe <hi>that</hi> Dublin
<hi>was taken,</hi> that ſtrong Caſtle was preſently ſurrendered; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
General <hi>Jones</hi> was ſtop from proſecuting his Victory, which elſe
he would have done even to the Walls of <hi>Kilkenny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, that great Captain reſolved to puſh on his Fortune,
and whilſt the Conſternation laſted, to make the beſt uſe of it he
could; and accordingly he immediately advanced to <hi>Tredagh,</hi> but
the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> valiantly defended the place; and <hi>Ormond</hi> came to
<hi>Trim,</hi> with what Forces he could rally; ſo that <hi>Jones</hi> was obliged to
raiſe the Siege on the 8th of <hi>August,</hi> which was the very day <hi>Owen
Roe</hi> forced the Lord of <hi>Ards</hi> to draw off from <hi>London-Derry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on the 14th of <hi>August, Oliver Cromwell</hi> (the Parliament's Lord-Lieutenant)
landed at <hi>Dublin;</hi> he brought with him about 9000 Foot
and 4000 Horſe, and all Neceſſaries for his Army, and had a good
Fleet conſtantly to attend him: And having ſetled the Civil and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65997:396"/>
Military Affairs at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and muſtered and reſted his Army, he
committed that City to the Government of Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> and
on <hi>Friday</hi> the 30th of <hi>August,</hi> marched out with 10000 Men, and on
<hi>Munday</hi> the 2d of <hi>September,</hi> he came before <hi>Tredagh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Town being very conſiderable, and eſteemed pretty ſtrong,
was the chief care of the Lord-Lieutenant, who omitted nothing
that was poſſible to fit it for a Siege; the Garriſon he put in it, was
part of his own Regiment, under Sir <hi>Edm. Venry</hi> 400; Coll. <hi>Birn</hi>'s
Regiment 400; Coll. <hi>Warren</hi> 900; Coll. <hi>Wall</hi> 800; Lord of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meath</hi>
200; Sir <hi>James Dillon</hi> 200; and Horſe 200; amounting in all
to 2900 Foot, and 200 Horſe, beſides 500 Foot that he ſent in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Lieutenant-Collonel <hi>Griffin Cavenagh,</hi> together with 500 <hi>l.</hi> in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
whilſt <hi>Cromwell</hi> lay before the Town; And over theſe he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a Governour beyond exception, Sir <hi>Arthur Aſton,</hi> formerly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Reading,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Oxford,</hi> a Souldier of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and Experience.</p>
                  <p>It is needleſs to make a long ſtory of a ſhort Siege; and therefore
it will be enough to ſay, That altho' the Governor had aſſured the
Lord-Lieutenant, <hi>That he would find the Enemy play; and that the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
being ſelect Men, was ſo ſtrong that the Town could not be taken by
Aſſault; and therefore advis'd</hi> Ormond (then at <hi>Trim) to hazard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by precipitating to his Relief:</hi> Yet <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who beſieged the
Town but on one ſide, and without the formality of regular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
began his Battery on the 9th of <hi>September,</hi> and the very
next day at five in the evening ſtormed it; and altho' his Men were
twice beaten off, and Collonel <hi>Caſſels</hi> ſlain, yet he led them on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the third time, and carried the Town, and put moſt of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
to the Sword, and the reſt, being not above thirty, he ſent to
<hi>Barbadoe's.</hi> This terrible Execution ſo frightned the reſt of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,
that <hi>Dundalk</hi> immediately ſubmitted, and ſo did ſome other
Caſtles near <hi>Trim;</hi> and then <hi>Cromwell</hi> returned to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But one thing is very remarkable, and ought not to be omitted,
and that is, That tho' there were ſeveral Proteſtants in the Town,
yet were the Popiſh Souldiers ſo inſolent, and ſo unjuſt to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Companions, even in the midſt of their Adverſity, that on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
the 8th of <hi>September,</hi> they thruſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> out of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Church in <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and publiquely celebrated Maſs there, tho'
they had Monaſteries, and other convenient places beſides, for that
purpoſe. And ſuitable to this, is that which the Biſhop of <hi>Derry,</hi> in his
Letter of the 9th of <hi>October,</hi> affirmed to the Lord-Lieutenant, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the Earl of <hi>Roſcomon</hi> being then dead at <hi>Limerick,</hi> they were
fain to be very private in their Devotions, and doubted whether they
ſhould be permitted to uſe Funeral-Rites, even privately in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
But why do I inſtance ſuch Trifles, after the Earl of <hi>Orrery</hi> has
aſſured us, that an <hi>Iriſh</hi> General told the Lord-Lieutenant, at <hi>Kilkenny,
That if the King came there in perſon, he ſhould not be allowed a Church to
celebrate his Devotion in:</hi> To which his Excellency replied, <hi>That he hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee all of that mind, without a Church to ſay Maſs in</hi> Ireland.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the King, who from the <hi>Hague</hi> had written the
2d <hi>April,</hi> 1649, that he deſigned ſpeedily for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
been preparing for that Voyage, did now (by his Letters of
the 29th of <hi>August</hi>) aſſure the Lord-Lieutenant, That he is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by the Defeat at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> but ſtill deſigns for that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
if his Lordſhip thinks fit. And his Majeſty did alſo by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the 17th of <hi>July,</hi> from <hi>St. Germans,</hi> order 800 <hi>l. per an.</hi> out of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65997:396"/>
the forfeited Eſtates, to be ſetled on General <hi>Preſton,</hi> and to create
him Viſcount <hi>Taragh;</hi> and accordingly that General did paſs Patent
for the Eſtate of <hi>Francis</hi> Viſcount <hi>Mountnorris,</hi> Father of the late Earl
of <hi>Angleſey;</hi> and on the 2d day of <hi>July,</hi> 1650, he paſs'd Patent for
his Honour.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Cromwell</hi> having Caſhiered the ſeven old Regiments, form'd by
the Parliament Commiſſioners, <hi>Anno</hi> 1647, and ſetled Affairs in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
to his mind, left Collonel <hi>Hewſon</hi> Governor of that City, and
marched <hi>South</hi>-ward through the County of <hi>Wicklow;</hi> and having
taken <hi>Arklow, Fernes, Insſcorfy,</hi> and ſome other leſſer places, and a
good quantity of Proviſions, in a Monaſtery deſerted by the Fryers,
he came before <hi>Wexford</hi> on the firſt day of <hi>October,</hi> and immediately
Summon'd the Town.</p>
                  <p>The Governour, Collonel <hi>David Synot,</hi> did thereupon ſend out a
Meſſenger with Propoſals of Surrender, but indeed ſo high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
as manifeſted his deſign was but to gain time by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he did, until the Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> found means to put a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Foot into the place; and within three days after, the
Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> ſent in Sir <hi>Edmund Butler,</hi> and 1000 Men more
(all Papiſts, for the Town's Men would admit no other:) Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
it ſo happened, that within two hours after theſe laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruts
were come in, and whilſt more were wafting over the Ferry,
Captain <hi>James Stafford,</hi> a Papiſt, ſurrendered the Caſtle of <hi>Wexford</hi>
to <hi>Cromwell</hi> upon Articles; whereupon the Guns thereof were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
turn'd upon the Town; at which both Souldiers and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were ſo frightned, that they quitted the Walls, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to eſcape over the River: But the <hi>Cromveleſts</hi> perceiving their
Cowardize, preſently clapt Scaling-ladders to the Walls, and took
the Town by Storm, and put all they found in Arms to the Sword,
to the number of 2000 Men; and Sir <hi>Edmond Butler</hi> himſelf was
ſhot in the head as he was ſwiming over the River.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt attend the Lord-Lieutenant, and enquire what he did
towards the Defence of the Kingdom, and we ſhall find that he did
all that was poſſible for one in his circumſtances; his main depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
was upon the Conjunction of <hi>Owen Roe</hi>'s Forces, and the brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Lord of <hi>Inſiquin</hi>'s Horſe; and in expectation of ſome good
effects from theſe, he ſtaid at <hi>Trim,</hi> during the Siege of <hi>Tredagh,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
as ſoon as <hi>Owen Roe</hi> ſhould come up, to endeavour to raiſe
that Siege; but that General did not come in time, the Agreement
with him not being finiſhed until the 12th day of <hi>October,</hi> upon the
Tearms mentioned by <hi>P. W.</hi>'s <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> 597: and <hi>Inſiquin</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
being moſt of them <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> did not care to fight againſt
their Friends and Country-men, and therefore daily revolted to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
even by Scores and Squadrons, which drew that Lord back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to ſecure his Garriſons in <hi>Munſter;</hi> which about this time began
to Mutiny.</p>
                  <p>However, after <hi>Tredagh</hi> was taken, <hi>Ormond</hi> put a good Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
into <hi>Trim,</hi> and endeavoured to Rendezvouz his Forces at <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny;</hi>
he preſs'd <hi>Wexford</hi> to accept of a Garriſon, but they would
have none, except a few Companies of their own chuſing, under
Lieutenant-Collonel <hi>Synot,</hi> who was a Creture of their Biſhop of
<hi>Fernes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the Lord-Lieutenant omitted nothing within his
power, for their Defence; but as he heard of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s March that
way, he alſo went to <hi>Graig,</hi> and thence ordered his Forces to march
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65997:397"/>
forward to <hi>Roſs,</hi> whilſt himſelf went to <hi>Duncannon</hi> to view that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Fort, and the ſame night he came to the Army to <hi>Roſs,</hi>
and from thence ſent the Lord of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> to conduct a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into <hi>Wexford,</hi> which he accompliſhed, as hath been related:
but that Recruit not being enough, <hi>Ormond</hi> himſelf marched to the
Ferry on the <hi>North</hi> ſide of <hi>Wexford,</hi> and ſent in Sir <hi>Edmond Butler</hi>
with more Supplies, as hath been ſaid: And having notice that Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General
<hi>Jones</hi> lay about <hi>Iniſcorfy</hi> to intercept him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
he marched round through the Mountains of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> and
came to <hi>Leighlinbridge,</hi> where Lieutenant-Collonel <hi>William Butler</hi>
brought him the News of the loſs of <hi>Wexford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon his Excellency leaving the Horſe to refreſh themſelves
in the Counties of <hi>Carlow</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> ordered the Foot to march
to the Banks of the River over-againſt <hi>Roſs,</hi> and went himſelf with
his Life-guard to <hi>Duncannon,</hi> where he left them under Collonel <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Wogan,</hi> whom he made Co-ordinate with the former Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<hi>Roch,</hi> believing that <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s next attempt would be upon one
of theſe two places.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly <hi>Cromwell</hi> did march from <hi>Wexford</hi> to <hi>Roſs,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> ſent in Major-General <hi>Taaf</hi> and 1500
Men into the Town, in view of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, who by reaſon
of the River could give no oppoſition thereunto: But before this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
would take charge of the Town, he deſired an Order from
the Lord-Lieutenant, <hi>To Surrender the Place whenever he and his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
ſhould judge it could be no longer Defended.</hi> And it was granted
him: and although he was a Papiſt, and a principal Man amongſt
the Confederates, yet did the Popiſh Clergy afterwards make this
one of their Complaints, <hi>That</hi> Ormond <hi>gave the Governour Orders to
Surrender the Town.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is certain, that he could not have made a leſs conſiderable
Reſiſtance, if he had had ſuch Orders; for as ſoon as the Great
Guns began to play, the Governor began to Capitulate; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
amongſt other things, deſired Liberty of Conſcience for ſuch
as ſhould ſtay: He was anſwered by <hi>Cromwell, That he medled with
no Man's Conſcience; but if by Liberty of Conſcience, he meant a Liberty to
exerciſe the Maſs, he judg'd it best to uſe plain dealing, and to let him
know, that where the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>had power that would not
be allowed.</hi> And ſo the Governour finding he could get no better
Conditions, was content to march out with Bag and Baggage, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
with him 1500 Men over the River to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and the other
600 ſtaid behind, and took pay under <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this prodigious Succeſs without fighting, <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſent a
ſtrong Detachment to attempt <hi>Duncannon;</hi> but that place being well
provided, made a vigorous Defence, ſo that it was thought fit to
raiſe that Siege, and return to <hi>Roſs,</hi> where <hi>Cromwell</hi> was buſie build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Bridge of Boats over the <hi>Barrow,</hi> with deſign to march into
the County of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and he perform'd it to the Admiration of
the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who never had heard of ſuch a thing before; and ſoon
after it was finiſhed, Collonel <hi>Abbot</hi> with a Party of Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
took <hi>Eniſteig,</hi> a ſmall walled Corporation, which was deſerted
by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> upon his approach to the Gates; and the whole Army
marched thither, leaving <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſick at <hi>Roſs;</hi> and finding that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
was retired to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> they detach'd Collonel <hi>Reynolds</hi> with
twelve Troops of Horſe, and three of Dragoons, to attack <hi>Carrick,</hi>
which ſucceeded to their mind; for he divided his Detachment into
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65997:397"/>
two parts, and whilſt he amuſed the Garriſon with one party, the
other entred at another Gate, and took the Town, and in it a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Officers and Souldiers, and the reſt made their eſcape over the
River.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> being joyn'd with the
Lord of <hi>Inſiquin,</hi> who was again return'd from <hi>Munſter,</hi> was pretty
ſtrong in Horſe, but exceeding weak in Foot; However, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to fight the Enemy; but there was one good reaſon, and one
ill accident, that diverted that deſign; the reaſon is, that Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General
<hi>Farrell</hi> with ſome Regiments of <hi>Owen Roe</hi>'s Foot was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expected; and the accident was, that Sir <hi>Luke Fitz Girald</hi> ſent
them word, that a Party of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s ſick Men were marching
from <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>Wexford;</hi> whereupon it was reſolv'd by the Council
of War, and the Commiſſioners of Truſt, that <hi>Inſiquin</hi> ſhould march
with 1500 Horſe to attack them; and accordingly he overtook them
on <hi>Wexford-ſtrand,</hi> but was received ſo warmly, that his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe
ran away after the firſt Charge; and though the reſt ſtaid to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Aſſault, yet having loſt many Officers and Men, they alſo
thought fit to retreat to the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who was then at
<hi>Thomaſtown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if there were any opportunity of fighting <hi>Cromwell,</hi> ſince his
arrival, it was at this time when his Army was near <hi>Thomaſtown;</hi> but
even then no wiſe General would have atempted it; firſt, becauſe
there was no right underſtanding between the Proteſtants and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
in the Royal Army: Secondly, becauſe the Horſe were lately
baffled, and much haraſs'd: And thirdly, becauſe Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Farrell</hi> and his Foot were not yet come up: But there was a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
reaſon than all this, which was, That <hi>Ormond</hi> had intelligence,
that <hi>Cromwell</hi> deſigned for <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> and therefore he retired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſave the City, and to joyn <hi>Farrell</hi> who came to him there:
and then it was unanimouſly reſolv'd to fight the Enemy: And altho'
no more then ſeven days Victuals could be got together, yet the Lord-Lieutenant
with that ſlender Proviſion march'd out of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to
find out <hi>Cromwell;</hi> but that General had, upon notice of the taking
of <hi>Carrick,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">22 October.</note> march'd thither, and had paſſed over the <hi>Shure,</hi> to
the Siege of <hi>Waterford;</hi> whereupon it was reſolved that the Lords
of <hi>Inſiquin</hi> and <hi>Taaf</hi> ſhould ſtorm <hi>Carrick,</hi> and the Lord-Lieutenant
ſhould conduct Lieutenant-General <hi>Farrell,</hi> and 1500 <hi>Ulſter</hi>-men and put
them into the City of <hi>Waterford:</hi> And this latter was done, but the
former miſcarried for want of Spades, Pickaxes and other Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als;
ſo that above 1000 Men were<note n="b" place="margin">24 Octob.</note> ſlain under the Walls of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
by Collonel <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and the ſmall Party he had there in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
being but 150 Foot, ſix Troops of Horſe, and a Troop of
Dragoons.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> once more attempted the
Relief of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and brought ſome of his Forces on the <hi>North</hi>-ſide
of the <hi>Shure,</hi> oppoſite to the City; whereupon <hi>Cromwell</hi> (who
had<note n="c" place="margin">25 Octob.</note> taken <hi>Paſſage-Fort</hi>) finding that he had loſt more Men by
Sickneſs in this Winter's Siege than he could well ſpare, drew off his
Army towards <hi>Dungarvan.</hi> And though <hi>Ormond</hi> ferried over to <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,</hi>
and courted that City to ſend Boats to waft over his Men
to fall upon <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Rear; yet the Citizens (being afraid they
would make that place their Winter-quarters) refuſed to admit any
more then ſome few more of the <hi>Ulſter</hi>-men into that City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:65997:398"/>
And it is obſervable, that though <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Army was much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed,
and but very ſmall, perhaps not exceeding 5000 Foot, 2000
Horſe, and 500 Dragoons, when he came before <hi>Waterford,</hi> yet the
fame of this General had ſo frightned the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that the Mayor and
Governour of <hi>Waterford</hi> hearing of his approach, did on the 28th
of <hi>October</hi> ſend a Letter to the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> to conſult about
the Terms to be inſiſted on at the Rendition of the City: But <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
the next day by his Letter chid them for their forwardneſs to
Parly with the Enemy before any Battery was begun; and aſſured
them, that if they did their Duty, <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſhould be baffled before
that place; as indeed it happened, for he loſt a 1000 Men with Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
before it, and went away without it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And it was about this time in the Month of</hi> October, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<hi>arrived in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and brought with him</hi> the Garter <hi>to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of</hi> Ormond: <hi>And it was by him that</hi> Ormond <hi>gave the following
Account to his Majeſty,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">30 Octob <hi>from</hi> Clonmell.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot be preſerved without
Succours; that no People in the World are more eaſily drawn by Reward,
or forced by Fear, than the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> That he could not draw into the Field
above 5000 Foot, and 1300 Horſe, nor keep them long together for want
of Neceſſaries: That nevertheleſs, there is no want of Men, but of Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for them; that the Plague is in <hi>Conaught;</hi> that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
in his Army cannot agree: That no Trust can be put in <hi>Owen Roe</hi>'s
Army, longer than their own Interest obliges them. And therefore, if his
Majeſty comes, he ought to bring Ammunition and Money with him, and
land them at <hi>Galway. And ſoon after, from</hi> Waterford <hi>on the 15th
of</hi> November, <hi>his Lordſhip wrote again to his Majeſty,</hi> That the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
are ſo fickle, that for Trade's ſake they will correſpond with the Towns in
the Rebels poſſeſſion: That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy are mutinous, and by means of
the Lord of <hi>Antrim,</hi> will probably do ſome fooliſh and fatal thing.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Waterford, Cromwell</hi> marched to <hi>Dungarvan,</hi> which he took;
and there on the 18th of <hi>November</hi> died <hi>Michael Jones,</hi> Lieutenant-General
of the Army, a Man of clear Valour, and excellent as well
as fortunate Conduct; and not inferiour to any body in a ſincere
paſſion for the good of his Country.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Towns of the Country of <hi>Cork,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
and garriſon'd with <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men, could not endure the thoughts
of joyning with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt their own Country-men; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
how the Lord-Lieutenant was not only limited in his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by the Commiſſioners of Truſt, and was but partially and
precatiouſly obeyed by the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> They knew the <hi>Iriſh</hi> aim'd at their
Deſtruction in the end, and continued the War to that purpoſe:
Finally, they remembred the reaſons of ſurrendring <hi>Dublin</hi> to the
Parliament two Years before; and they thought they had the ſame
motive to ſubmit now; and therefore by the means of the Lord
<hi>Broghill,</hi> Collonel <hi>Countny,</hi> Sir <hi>Percy Smith,</hi> and the Collonels, <hi>Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend,
Jeffor'd,</hi> and <hi>Warden,</hi> they revolted all at once; and about
2500 Men were drawn out of thoſe Garriſons, and they met <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
at <hi>Whitechurch,</hi> not far from <hi>Dungarvan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Revolution diſſolved all confidence between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> and as well for that reaſon, as in other reſpects, proved advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> for otherwiſe he muſt have been forced to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
a long and dangerous March to <hi>Dublin,</hi> or to have embark'd
his Men on board the Fleet, that coaſted all along as he marched, to
attend him; but by this Revolt he got excellent Winter-quarters in
<hi>Cork, Bandon, Kinſale,</hi> and <hi>Youghall,</hi> which laſt place was made his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65997:398"/>
Head-quarters; and there we will leave him, and enquire into the
Motions of the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For although the Motions of that Lord could not be very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
as well becauſe of the Seaſon of the Year, and his want of
Money and all other Neceſſaries, as alſo becauſe his Men did daily
deſert him in ſuch numbers, as that of all the <hi>Conaught</hi> Horſe he had
but nine and thirty left with him: yet he ſo ſtruggled with all theſe
Difficulties, that he ſtill kept ſome Forces together hovering between
<hi>Clonmell</hi> and <hi>Waterford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it hapned one day that he ferried over to <hi>Waterford</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fifty Horſe, in hopes to perſwade that City to all that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for its own preſervation, and the common good; but when
he came there, he found that the Governor (Lieutenant-General <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi>)
and Collonel <hi>Wogan</hi> from <hi>Duncannon,</hi> had formed a deſign upon
<hi>Paſſage-Fort;</hi> and though <hi>Ormond</hi> much doubted the ſucceſs, yet it
was not fit for him at that time to diſſwade the Attempt: And ſo
<hi>Farrell</hi> marched out, but he was not long gone, before a Party of the
Enemies Horſe was diſcovered to march towards <hi>Paſſage;</hi> whereupon
<hi>Ormond</hi> deſired the Mayor to permit a Regiment or two of his
Horſe, which were on the other ſide of the River, to be wafted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and to march through the City; but all his Commands and
Intreaties were in vain; although the Citizens ſaw the danger
their Souldiers were in, and the neceſſity of the propoſed Relief:
However, the Marqueſs marched out with his fifty Horſe, ſuch as
they were, and met <hi>Farrell</hi>'s Foot flying towards <hi>Waterford,</hi> and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Zankey</hi>'s Horſe in purſuit of them: hereupon he drew up in a
place of advantage, and the Enemy (thinking he had a greater Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Horſe with him than in truth he had) leſſened their pace, till
by advanced Parties they ſhould diſcover the truth: but <hi>Ormond</hi> pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keer'd
ſo long with them, that the remainder of the Foot (being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one half) had time to eſcape, which elſe had been cut in pieces,
or taken Priſoners, as their Companions were.</p>
                  <p>This very Accident ſhewed the neceſſity of the retaking <hi>Paſſage-Fort,</hi>
which elſe would be a continual Nuſance to the City of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
and therefore the Lord-Lieutenant propos'd, that he would
tranſport his Forces over the River to accompliſh that Undertaking,
if the City would permit his Army to Quarter in Huts under their
Walls, where they ſhould be no ways burdenſom, but ſhould have
Pay and Proviſions from the Country.</p>
                  <p>But the Citizens were ſo far from conſenting to this, that it was
moved by one in the City-Council, <hi>That they ſhould ſeize on</hi> Ormond'<hi>s
perſon, and fall on thoſe that belonged to him as Enemies.</hi> So that it
was time for the Marqueſs to depart; and becauſe the principal
Towns like ſo many petty Republicks, ſtood ſo ſtifly upon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Priviledges, that they paid no farther Obedience to the Lord-Lieutenant
than they thought fit, and refuſed to receive his Army
into Garriſons, he was forced to diſperſe his Forces to provide
for themſelves as they could: <hi>Luke Taaf</hi> went to <hi>Conaught,</hi> and <hi>Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
into the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> into <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi>
only Major-General <hi>Hugh O Neil</hi> and 1600 <hi>Ulſter</hi>-men were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into <hi>Clonmell,</hi> and his Excellency return'd to <hi>Kilkenny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And it was from hence that by his Letter of the 24th of</hi> Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>he acquainted his Majeſty</hi> how his Authority was deſpiſed by thoſe
great Pretenders to Loyalty: <hi>to which his Majeſty anſwers by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the 2d of</hi> February, That he wonders at the Ingratitude of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65997:399"/>
in the apparent breach of their Recognition of him in the beginning of the
Articles of Peace, and their ſolemn Proteſtations to himſelf: And orders,
That if <hi>Ormond</hi> finds them incorrigible,<note place="margin">☞</note> he ſhould timely adviſe the King
of it, that (not believing himſelf bound to the Conditions of Peace, whilst
they are deſtructively infringed by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and made uſeleſs to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty)
he may uſe other means for his Reſtitution; and that <hi>Ormond</hi> ſhould
withdraw as ſoon as he thinks fit.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Popiſh Prelates and Clergy met <hi>proprio Motu</hi>
at <hi>Cluanmacnoiſe;</hi> and though it was expected that by the means of
the Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim,</hi> they would do ſomething or other that would
be very diſobliging and ſeditious: yet on the contrary, they made
moſt pathetical and pious Exhortations to Unity, and to lay aſide
all National and other Animoſities; and declared, it was in vain to
expect any tolerable Conditions for their Religion, Liberties, and
Eſtates from <hi>Cromwell;</hi> in a word, they ſaid ſo much, and ſo well,
that the Lord-Lieutenant was almoſt deceived into freſh hopes of their
Loyalty and Integrity.</p>
                  <p>But an Adder cannot be without a ſting, nor a Popiſh Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Congregation meet in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without doing ſomething diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging
to the Royal Authority, whilſt in Proteſtant hands, and even
this meek and pious Aſſembly could not diſſolve, until it had ſpit
ſome of its Venom in a Schedule of Grievances.</p>
                  <p>But it is yet more ſtrange,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P. W.</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, 83.</note> that ſome body had the confidence to
obtrude a ſpurious Paper of Greivances on the Commiſſioners of
Truſt, inſtead of the true one, and they gave it to the Lord-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
Whereupon he being highly incenſed, demanded of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
whether they own'd that Paper; and they denied it, and,
on the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> and not till then, produced the true one;
which was pragmatical enough, but not near ſo bad as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>But that the whole Kingdom might be ſatisfyed, that there were
no real Greivances, nor juſt cauſe of Complaint, <hi>ſince all the Miſchiefs
that had hapned were occaſion'd by the Obſtinacy of the Ungovernable Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations.
Ormond</hi> did permit the Commiſſioners of Truſt to iſſue
their Circular Letters, for Deputies from all parts of the Kingdom,
to repreſent their Grievances; and accordingly they came, in the
latter end of <hi>January;</hi> but being alarum'd at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> theſe Deputies
adjourned to <hi>Juny</hi> (I ſuppoſe <hi>Innis</hi>) in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> where
they made much noiſe, but never had the confidence to reduce their
clamour into writing; and the Lord-Lieutenant left the City under
the Government of the Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> and went himſelf to
<hi>Limerick,</hi> to which place, by his Letters of the 27th of <hi>February,</hi> he

<hi>in particular, would receive a Garriſon, and obey Orders, there was no
hopes of making any conſiderable Oppoſition to the Enemy; and deſired them
to deal freely, if they had any miſtrust of him, or diſlike of his Goverment,
ſince he was ready to do any thing for the Peoples preſervation, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with his Honour, and his Duty to the King: And ſince it was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that the Name without the Power of Lord-Lieutenant, could bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Ruine upon the Nation, and Diſhonour upon him, they ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
procure entire Obedience to his Authority, or propoſe how the Kingdom
might be preſerved by his quitting it.</hi> To all which they anſwer'd, with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65997:399"/>
many expreſſions of Reſpect and Affection, and gave his Excellency
a Paper of Advice, mention'd Appendix 45: and ſo we muſt leave
them for a while, and ſee what was done in the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Ulſter</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Scots,</hi> were fierce againſt
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> inſomuch that the Presbytery of <hi>Belfast</hi>
did on the 15th <hi>Feb.</hi> 1648, publiſh a Paper entituled, <hi>A neceſſary Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of the preſent Evils and eminent Dangers to Religion, Laws, and
Liberties, ariſing from the late and preſent Practiſes of the Sectarian Party
in</hi> England; <hi>together with an Exhortation to Duties relating to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
The deſign of which is to exhort the People from aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with <hi>Sectaries</hi> or <hi>Malignants:</hi> To which Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Parliament party, made an anſwer, wherein they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<hi>That if they decline the Parliament,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Burlace 207.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſhut the door against all
Succours and Supplies from</hi> England. <hi>And ſecondly, They make a Rent
and Diviſion amongst themſelves. And thirdly, Must joyn with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
or deſert the Kingdom. And laſtly, Must fight against an Army
that hath been the Inſtrument of the Liberty of</hi> England, <hi>and the Quiet of</hi>
Scotland. And it is certain, that for want of due regard to the
Dilemma, in the third Obſervation, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> party fell into
the Inconvenience mentioned in the ſecond: for the Lord of <hi>Ards,</hi>
Sir <hi>George Monroe,</hi> and others joyned with the Lord-Lieutenant, and
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in ſubmiſſion to the King, whilſt many of the Preachers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
ſo paſſionately againſt both <hi>Malignants</hi> and <hi>Sectaries,</hi> (as they
called the King's party, and the Parliament's) that Sir <hi>George Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe</hi>
was fain to ſend many Letters, and ſome Threatning Meſſages to
ſilence them.</p>
                  <p>But this Diviſion became the occaſion of their Ruine, for though
they had once all <hi>Ulſter,</hi> except <hi>London-Derry,</hi> which was alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged;
yet they were in very few Months ſubdued, for as ſoon as
that Siege was raiſed by <hi>Owen Roe,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> marched abroad
and took in <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Tredagh,</hi> had <hi>Belfast</hi> ſurrendered to him; and though Collonel <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor</hi>
did fall upon <hi>Venables</hi> in his Quarters on the Road to <hi>Belfast.</hi>
yet he was bravely repulſed by the Valour of Captain <hi>Meredith;</hi> and
then <hi>Venables</hi> marched to <hi>Carrifergus,</hi> which ſubmitted to him even
before his Foot came up, and being joyned with Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi>
they beat <hi>Monroe</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> on the Plains of <hi>Liſnegarvy,</hi> on the 6th
of <hi>December,</hi> and ſo the Parliament became Maſters of moſt part of
what the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> poſſeſt in <hi>Ulſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it muſt not be forgotten, that Lieutenant-Collonel <hi>Owen</hi> O
<hi>Conally</hi> (the firſt Diſcoverer of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion) marching with a
party of Horſe from <hi>Belfast</hi> to <hi>Antrim,</hi> was fallen upon by <hi>Monroe,</hi>
and totally routed, and himſelf ſlain.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Conaught,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Beling 196.</note> I find no other mention of any Action there,

                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Cromwell</hi> took advantage of the fair Weather,<note place="margin">☜</note>
and knowing that <hi>nothing could be ſo deſtructive to the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all Neceſſaries, as an early Campaign;</hi> he marcht out of his Winter-quarters
in the latter end of <hi>February</hi> with 3000 Men, and even that
ſmall Army was divided into two parties; with the one <hi>Cromwell</hi>
marched to <hi>Cahir,</hi> which he took, as he alſo did <hi>Kilfinin, Gowlenbridge,
Fethard, Caſhell, Clogheen,</hi> and <hi>Roghill,</hi> and ſat down before <hi>Callan;</hi>
and <hi>Ireton</hi> with the other part, being re-inforced by <hi>Reynolds</hi> and

                     <hi>Zanchy,</hi> took <hi>Ardkenon, Dundrum, Knocktopher, Ballynard,</hi> and other
Caſtles, and joyned <hi>Cromwell</hi> at <hi>Callan:</hi> Which laſt place, as alſo
<hi>Graige</hi> and <hi>Thomaſtown</hi> were eaſily ſubdued by their united Forces;
ſo that they marched to <hi>Gowran,</hi> to joyn Collonel <hi>Heyſon,</hi> who with
a Detachment from <hi>Dublin</hi> had taken <hi>Ballyſannon, Kildare,</hi> and <hi>Leigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
and met them at <hi>Gowran,</hi> which was, after too long Reſiſtance,
ſurrendered by Collonel <hi>Hammond,</hi> upon hard Conditions, ſo that
he and moſt of the Officers were ſhot to death. And then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
being very conſiderable and numerous, eſpecially in Horſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> from whence <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> and his Forces were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
by reaſon of the Plague, and the General Aſſembly was
fled to <hi>Athloane;</hi> ſo that there was but 600 Foot, and 50 Horſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sir <hi>Walter Butler</hi> and Major <hi>Walſh,</hi> left in the City, nevertheleſs,
they made a vigorous Defence, and bravely repulſed the firſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault;
and afterwards, having no hopes of Relief, ſurrendered upon
very honourable Conditions, on the 28th of <hi>March,</hi> 1650.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From thence</hi> Cromwell <hi>marched to beſiege</hi> Clonmell,<note place="margin">1650.</note> 
                     <hi>which he found
well provided of all things neceſſary for its Defence; ſo that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the hardeſt Task he undertook in</hi> Ireland. <hi>Moreover, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular
Biſhop of</hi> Roſs, <hi>had gathered about 5000 Men together, and
that Army was daily increaſing, with deſign to raiſe the Siege: But
it happened luckily, that the Lord of</hi> Broghill <hi>being at</hi> Caſtlelyons, <hi>had
ſecret intimations from his Brother-in-law, General</hi> Barry, That the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> had cast off the King's Authority, and had put all into the hands
of the Clergy; and that <hi>Ormond</hi> had diſcovered their deſign, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gave liberty to the Proteſtants of his Army to treat with <hi>Cromwell:</hi>
And that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> deſigned to make <hi>Kerry</hi> and <hi>Conaught</hi> the ſeats of the
War; and that 20000 Men would ſuddainly be in Arms under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Titular Biſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> (who always adviſed to kill the <hi>Engliſh</hi>)
unleſs that Cockatrice be deſtroyed in the Egg.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> poſted to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
2000 Horſe and Dragoons, and 1600 Foot, he marched with
incredible Celerity to <hi>Kilkrea,</hi> and thence to <hi>Carrigadroghid,</hi> which
he found garriſon'd with the Biſhop's Souldiers; however, he left
his Foot there, and marched with the Horſe to <hi>Maccroom:</hi> Upon his
approach the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fired the Caſtle, and retired to the reſt of their
Army, which to the number of 5000 were in the Part; but the
Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> loſt no time, but fell upon them briskly, whilſt they
were amazed at an Aſſault they little expected: In fine, he totally
routed the Army,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Battle of</hi> Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croom, 10 <hi>of</hi> May.</note> and took the Biſhop priſoner, to whom he profer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Life, if he would cauſe <hi>Carigdroghid</hi> to be ſurrendered; and the
Biſhop promis'd fair, but which he came to the Caſtle, inſtead of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Garriſon to ſurrender, he advis'd them to hold it out to
the laſt: whereupon he was immediately hanged; and ſoon after
<hi>Carigdroghid</hi> was taken by a very ſlight Stratagem; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got
two or three Teams of Oxen, and made them draw ſome great pieces
of Timber towards the Caſtle, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> thinking to be Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
preſently began to parly, and upon Articles gave up the
place.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt return to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> whom we left at the Siege of
<hi>Clonmell,</hi> where having made a breach, he cauſed it to be aſſaulted;
but (as himſelf expreſſed it) <hi>he had like to bring his Noble to Nine-pence;</hi>
for he loſt above 2000 of his beſt Men, and yet did not take
the Town at that time: but in a few days, the Governor <hi>Hugh O
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65997:400"/>
Neal,</hi> having ſpent his Powder, and finding that the Town would
be loſt, he withdrew all his Souldiers, ſecretly and by night, over
the Bridge to <hi>Waterford;</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> not knowing of it, gave the
Town's Men good Conditions for themſelves, upon which they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered.</p>
                  <p>It was at this Siege that <hi>Cromwell</hi> received poſſitive Orders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>England;</hi> and in obedience unto them, he embarqued at
<hi>Youghall</hi> on the 29th day of <hi>May,</hi> and left the Command of the
Army with his Son-in-law <hi>Ireton,</hi> who was before Major-General of
the Army, and Lord-Preſident of <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is time to return to the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> whom we left
at <hi>Limerick</hi> with the <hi>Popiſh Clergy,</hi> and the <hi>Commiſſioners of Trust;</hi>
where, notwithſtanding the reſpectful Anſwer, and promiſes of the
Clergy, already mentioned, the Citizens of <hi>Limerick</hi> were ſo far from
complying with his expectation, that they were deficient in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and outward Reſpect; they did not permit acceſs to him
without ſpecial orders of the Mayor, which was ſometimes with
difficulty obtained: And they impriſon'd the Lord <hi>Killmallock</hi> for
quartering ſome Horſe one night within their Liberties, by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's
order. And the Officer of the City-Guards, did neither
come to receive the Word from his Lordſhip, nor bring it to him:
Wherefore, not willing to expoſe the King's Authority to ſo many
Affronts, he went to <hi>Loghreagh,</hi> and the <hi>Popiſh Clergy</hi> adjourned thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alſo, and there he gave them the Anſwer to their <hi>Paper of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
mentioned Appendix 45; wherewith they ſeemed to be ſo
well ſatisfied, that on the 28th of <hi>March,</hi> they iſſued the following

                              <p>MAY it pleaſe Your Excellency to be informed, That We are
very ſenſible of the Jealouſies and Suſpicions conceived of
Vs, (as was intimated unto Vs) that we believe ariſing from
ſome diſaffected and miſunderſtanding Perſons, that ſpare not to
give ill Characters of Vs; as if theſe deplorable Times, wherein
Our Religion, King, and Country are come to the vertical Point of
their total Ruine and Deſtruction, it ſhould be imagined by any,
that we behave ourſelves like ſleeping Paſtors, in no ways contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our best Endeavours for the Preſervation of the People, which
ought to be more dear unto us than any worldly Thing that may be
thought of: Wherefore, as well for the just Vindication of our own
Reputation against ſuch undeſerved Aſperſions, as for future Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our Sincerity and Integrity, to endeavour always the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the People; and to manifest to Your Excellency, as the King's
Majeſty's Lieutenant, and Chief Governour of this Kingdom, That
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65997:401"/>
no Labour or Care of ours hath been, or ſhall be wanting, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
effectually to any Propoſals you will pleaſe to make known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, that may conduce to thoſe ends: We thought it therefore fit
to preſent this Declaration of our real Intentions, in the Name of
ourſelves and the rest of our Brethren, the Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of this Kingdom, whereby we avow, teſtify, declare, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
before GOD and the World, That ſince our General Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Clanmacnoiſe,</hi> or here, we have omitted nothing that did
occur unto us, tending to the advancement of his Majeſty's Interest,
and the Good of the Kingdom generally, but have there and then
ordered and decreed all to us appertaining, or which was in our
power, neceſſarily conducing to the publick Conſervation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,

our parting from thence, in purſuance of our unanimous Reſolution
taken in that place, we have accordingly declared to our reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Flocks our happy Agreement amongst ourſelves, and our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
deſire to labour with them to thoſe ends; and made uſe of
our best perſwaſions for the purchaſing of their Alacrity and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Concurrence to the Advantage of that Service. So that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing was wanting of due Correſpondence, ſought by your Ezcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
we conceive it cannot be attributed to any want of care or
diligence in us.</p>
                              <p>And for further intimation of our hearty deſires on all occaſions
to ſerve our King and Country, we declare, That we are not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
for want of good Succeſs in the Affairs of the Kingdom, but
rather animated to give further Onſets, and try all other poſſible
Ways; Wherefore we most humbly entreat your Excellency to give
us ſome <hi>particular Inſtructions,</hi> and to preſcribe ſome Remedies
for, and touching the Grievances preſented by us to your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for pacifying of Diſcontented Minds, and put us in a way how
to labour further in ſo good a Cauſe: And we do faithfully promife,
that no Induſtry or Care ſhall be wanting in us, to receive and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
your Conditions.</p>
                              <p>And in concluſion, We leave to all impartial judicious Perſons
ſad and ſerious Conſiderations, to think, how incredible it is, that
we ſhould fail to oppoſe, to the uttermost of our power, the fearful
and inceaſing Potency of a Rebellious and Malignant Murderer of
our late Soveraign King <hi>Charles;</hi> to which Enemy alſo nothing
ſeemeth more odious, than the Names of Kings and Biſhops; and
who aims at nothing ſo much as the Dethroning of our now Gracious
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the final Extirpation of our Natives,
in caſe (as God forbid) Events and Succeſſes would fall ſuitable
to his most wicked Deſigns. So far we thought neceſſary to declare

                  </q>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the ſpecious pretences and fair promiſes in
this Declaration, they verified <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s obſervation of them, <hi>That
they prefer'd their own Interest before the King's; and that their profeſſions
in favour of Proteſtants were hypocritical.</hi> For although they deſired
Inſtructions ſo earneſtly, as if they meant to obſerve them, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received Inſtruction <hi>to bring the City of</hi> Limerick <hi>to a better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
they did nothing effectually in it, though they did colourably
ſend Sir <hi>Richard Everard</hi> and Doctor <hi>Fennell</hi> to treat with that City;
and they carried with them Letters from the <hi>Commiſſioners of Trust,</hi>
to the Mayor, and from the Biſhops to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Caſhell,</hi> and
Biſhop of <hi>Limerick;</hi> which if ſincerely wrote, could not in reaſon
fail of producing ſome effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the cauſe of ſuſpecting their ſincerity, did not proceed barely
from the unſucceſsfulneſs of their Endeavours, but alſo from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the diſhoneſt manner of their proceedings with the Lords
of</hi> Ormond <hi>and</hi> Inſiquin, <hi>whilſt they were at</hi> Limerick; <hi>for whilſt ſome
of the Prelates and leading Men of that City came to his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
under ſhew of Friendſhip and Reſpect, and informed him,</hi> That
the Waywardneſs and Diſſatisfaction of the People proceeded from their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to <hi>Inſiquin,</hi> who had always proſecuted the War against them with
Rigour and Animoſity, and had defiled himſelf with the Blood of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
at <hi>Caſhel,</hi> and of whom they could have no Aſſurance, ſince his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Confidents betrayed the Towns of <hi>Munſter;</hi> but if his Excellency
would diſmiſs that Lord, and disband his Troops, that then the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as one Man, would be at his diſpoſal. <hi>Another party of Popiſh
Biſhops, and other leading Men, addreſſed themſelves to</hi> Inſiquin, <hi>and
aſſured him,</hi> That they expected no Succeſs under the Conduct of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
becauſe he was not of their Nation, and was ſo indulgent to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men, that he little regarded them or theirs: But if his
Lordſhip (who was of the most Ancient and Noble Extraction of <hi>Ireland</hi>)
had the Supreme Command, then all would be well. <hi>But theſe two Lords
compared Notes, and thereby diſcovered the bottom of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
which was</hi> to create a Quarrel between them, that ſo they might
the eaſier get rid of them both.</p>
                  <p>And indeed from that time forward <hi>Ormond</hi> had ſo ſmall hopes
of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that he employed the Biſhop of <hi>Derry</hi> to treat with ſome
forreign Prince, about tranſporting 5 or 6000 Men into their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
at uſual Rates, and he deſigned to go with them himſelf; and
having no means to ſupport <hi>Inſiquin</hi>'s Army, he did, at the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Commiſſioners of Truſt, who were as weary of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were of them, disband <hi>Inſiquin</hi>'s Forces, except
Collonel <hi>Buller</hi>'s Regiment, which was deſigned to be ſent to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65997:402"/>
King from <hi>Galway.</hi> And on the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> Dean <hi>Boyle</hi> (now Lord
Primate) was employed by <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Inſiquin,</hi> to treat with <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
Upon what Terms the Proteſtants of their Party might be received into
Protection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the mean time the King, by his Letter of the 11th of</hi> March,
<hi>from</hi> Beauvois, <hi>informs the Lord-Lieutenant,</hi> That one <hi>Rochfort,</hi>
from Lieutenant-General <hi>Farrell,</hi> and one <hi>Daly,</hi> diſguiſed under the Name
of <hi>Dominico de Roſario,</hi> were with his Majeſty, and repreſented <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
as backward in granting Graces and Favours to the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> But
the King adviſes him to perſevere, and if need be, rather to exceed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
about Civil Matters, than in Matters of Religion; and that if there
must be farther Conceſſions in Religion, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n they ſhould be made in
general Terms, with reference to a future Parliament, and gives him full
power to do as he ſees fit; and deſires to know, whether if he fail with the
<hi>Scots,</hi> he may conveniently come for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed this had been the proper time for his Majeſty to have
come thither; and the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> did invite him to do
ſo: and the Queen Mother on the 10th of <hi>March</hi> 1649, ſent the
Lord <hi>Byron</hi> on purpoſe to preſs him to the Voyage, and to get the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners conſent thereunto. And it ſeems the King did
intend it, for ſome of his Goods were ſent into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it was that hindred him, it is certain, that in his Letter of the
15th of <hi>October</hi> 1650, he lamented his misfortune in not coming to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> when <hi>Ormond</hi> invited him.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, the <hi>Ulſter</hi> Army by their Capitulations had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to chuſe their own General, and accordingly they did elect the
Titular Biſhop of <hi>Clogher;</hi> and the Lord-Lieutenant being acquainted
with it, ſent him a Commiſſion on the firſt of <hi>April;</hi> and the ſame
day the true Paper of Grievances, indited by the Biſhops at <hi>Cluan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macnoiſe,</hi>
and ſigned by their Secretary, the Biſhop of <hi>Clonfert,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mentioned) was given to his Excellency: Whereupon he
ſummoned a General Aſſembly to meet at <hi>Loghreagh</hi> on the 25th of
<hi>April;</hi> and then he gave them an Anſwer to thoſe Grievances, and
imparted to them his Majeſty's Letter of the 2d of <hi>February, To with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
himſelf when he ſhould think fit.</hi> Whereupon on the 30th of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi>
they Addreſs to him reſpectfully, as <hi>Appendix</hi> 46. And the next
day his Excellency, reſolving to rely no more on General Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſends them ſmart Obſervations upon that Addreſs, as <hi>Appendix</hi> 46.
Whereunto they make anſwer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Tuan,</hi> and Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon,</hi> with preſſing Letters to <hi>Limerick,</hi> to
receive a Garriſon, and obey his Excellency's Orders. Whereupon
<hi>Ormond</hi> was once again cajoll'd by their fair Pretences, and diſmis'd
the Frigat he had provided for his Tranſportation, and reſolved to
ſtay in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And though the Anſwer theſe Agents brought from the City of
<hi>Limerick,</hi> was imperfect, yet it was ſuch as gave hopes to the Lord-Lieutenant;
ſo that he drew near the City to be ready to embrace
the critical Opportunities of their good Humour: And accordingly
on the 12th of <hi>June</hi> he received from the Mayor the following

And ſo not doubting of their Compliance to ſuch reaſonable and
neceſſary Articles, his Excellency came to the place of Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz,
where the two Aldermen waited on him, and told his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
<hi>That the City had agreed to all his Propoſals, but that of admitting
his Guards.</hi> Whereupon his Lordſhip ſent back this Meſſage: <hi>That he
carried his Guards becauſe of the Dignity of his Place, and to prevent any
popular Tumults that might happen from looſe People, and not from any
Diſgust or Jealouſy of their Loyalty or Affection of the Magiſtrates of the
City: However, his Guards ſhould not exceed 50 Horſe and 100 Foot, all</hi>
Roman <hi>Catholicks, and ſuch as had been of their Confederacy.</hi> And ſo
believing they would not reject any thing that was ſo reaſonable,
he marched on towards the City; but when he came near the
Gates, the ſame Aldermen that invited him in, were ſent out, to let
his Excellency know, that one <hi>Wolf</hi> (a ſeditious Fryer) had raiſed
ſuch a Tumult in the Town, that it was not ſafe for him to come
in, until it ſhould be appeaſed: Whereupon he retired to <hi>Shanbuolly,</hi>
and from thence ſent the following Letter; to which he could never
get any ſatisfactory Anſwer: On the contrary, they broke open his
Trunks of <hi>Papers,</hi> which his Excellency had left in that City; and
ſeized upon the Stores of Corn he had laid up there for himſelf and
the Army. And though they afterwards refuſed to receive his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
even whilſt <hi>Ireton</hi> was before the City, yet they readily entertained
ſome Troops that had contrary to Orders deſerted the Army; and
they forced Contribution from thoſe that had punctually paid it before,
to the uſe of the Army, and according to Order. And when the
Lord-Lieutenant wrote to the Mayor for Redreſs, that Magiſtrate
did reply, <hi>That</hi> Hugh O Neal <hi>was Governour.</hi> And when he wrote
to <hi>O Neal,</hi> he did more truly anſwer, <hi>That he was but a Cipher, and
the power was in the Corporation.</hi> And ſo he could get no ſatisfactory
Anſwer from either of them.</p>

we returned the ſaid Meſſengers with anſwer, That we intended not the

Magiſtrates of that City to his Majeſty, or of their Affection to us; but for
the Dignity of the Place we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might by falſe and frivolous Suggeſtions, be too eaſily inſtigated: And to
take away all poſſibility of ſuſpition from the most jealous, that we could
have any other end to the prejudice of that City, the Guards we propoſed,
were but one hundred Foot, and fifty Horſe, and thoſe to conſist entirely of
thoſe of your own Religion, and ſuch as by having been conſtantly of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy,
are intereſted in all the benefits of the Articles of Peace. To this
we received no poſitive reply, but in an uncertain manner were told, by the

                  </p>
                  <p>It was on the 14th of <hi>April,</hi> that Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> being in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
ſent to Collonel <hi>Venables,</hi> then in <hi>Claneboy,</hi> to meet him at the

was countermanded, and was ordered to retake the Caſtle of
<hi>Toom;</hi> and <hi>Coot</hi> at the ſame time marched into the Barony of <hi>Loghin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolin</hi>
to countenance that Attempt; and to keep three <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Army came to <hi>Charlemont,</hi> ſo that they were in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Coot</hi> and <hi>Venables:</hi> Hereupon <hi>Coot;</hi> after ſeveral ineffectual
experiments to get the Biſhop from his ground, or to joyn with <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables,</hi>
was neceſſitated to paſs the River of <hi>Loghfoil;</hi> ſo that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ravaged over the whole Country, and though he was manfully
repulſed at <hi>Lemavaddy</hi> by Major <hi>Dudly Phillips,</hi> yet he took <hi>Dungeven</hi>
by Storm, after a gallant defence made by Lieutenant-Collonel <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resford,</hi>
and had <hi>Bally-caſtle</hi> pittifully ſurrendered to him: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
he was ſometimes diſturbed by Major <hi>King,</hi> who had three
Troops of Horſe, and three hundred Foot at <hi>Inniskilling,</hi> but that was
not ſo conſiderable as to hinder the Biſhop's reſolution of paſſing over
<hi>Clody-foard,</hi> to fall upon Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi>'s party, which he performed
with great dexterity and courage; but <hi>Coot,</hi> who was aware of this,
had provided another retreat at <hi>Breagdough</hi> behind the River that
runs into <hi>Loghſwilly,</hi> and though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtrove hard for that paſs, yet
it was in vain, for <hi>Coot</hi> maintained the paſs: and by this means <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables</hi>
had an opportunity to march from <hi>Colerain</hi> to <hi>Derry,</hi> and thence
might ferry over to the Camp: The Biſhop (who was a Man of great
parts) ſoon perceived his Error, and ſaw there was no way to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it, but either to fight or return over the River before <hi>Venables</hi>
could come up, and accordingly he put his Army in Battallia, and
faced the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but <hi>Coot</hi> (who had with him but his own Regiment
of Horſe, and four Troops of Coll. <hi>Richard Coot</hi>'s, and 300 Country
Horſe, under Coll. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> and about 2000 Foot) had no reaſon to
fight until <hi>Venables</hi> ſhould arrive; however, they continued pickeering
for many hours, and in the evening the Biſhop drew towards the paſs,
but being diſturbed by <hi>Coot</hi>'s Horſe, and having loſt ſixty Men, he
poſted himſelf at <hi>Litterkenny,</hi> having before ſent a party to take in
<hi>Caſtle-Doe,</hi> and to bring in Proviſions: Whereupon <hi>Coot,</hi> being re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced

                     </note> in ſhort, it came to a Battle at <hi>Skirfolas,</hi> two mile above <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terkenny,</hi>

iſſue was, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were totally routed; and then the Horſe did
great execution in the purſuit, which was continued farther than ever
was heard of before, <hi>viz.</hi> above thirty Miles, for at <hi>Omagh</hi> Major
<hi>King</hi> with his three Troops begun the purſuit afreſh, and gleaned up
what had eſcaped from the Battle: ſo that it was believed that 500
of all this Army did not eſcape; and even the Biſhop himſelf was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
taken by Major<note n="a" place="margin">After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Lord <hi>Kingſton.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>King,</hi> and by order of the Lord-Preſident was

                  <p>Nor is it amiſs to obſerve the Variety and Viciſſitude of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Affairs; for this very Biſhop, and thoſe Officers whoſe heads were
now placed on the Walls of <hi>Derry,</hi> were within leſs than a Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
confederate with Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and raiſed the Siege of that
City, and were jovially merry at his Table, in the quality of
Friends.</p>

Nor muſt it be omitted, that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſent his Agent
Collonel <hi>Oliver Synot</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he landed on the 29th of <hi>April,</hi>
1650, and made a great noiſe of his Maſter's affection to the King,
and his zeal to the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and pretended that he had
brought Money with him, and that he would lend 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for his
Majeſty's ſervice, on the Mortgage of any Town or Fort that was
conſiderable. Whereupon the Lord-Lieutenant appointed the Lords
<hi>Taaf,</hi> and <hi>Athenry,</hi> and <hi>Jeoffory Brown</hi> to treat with him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to Mortgage <hi>Galway</hi> for that Sum: But at length it was found
to be a juggle on <hi>Synot</hi>'s ſide, and that either he had no Money,
or no intention to part with it.</p>
                  <p>And the Secret of this Affair is, that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in a Negotiation at <hi>Rome,</hi> to Legitimate ſome Children that
he had by Madam <hi>de Cauſecroix,</hi> in the life-time of his firſt Wife
<hi>Nichol de Lorrain;</hi> and the eaſier to accompliſh his deſign, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
ſuch an extraordinary Zeal for Religion as would tranſport
his Arms into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the relief of the Catholicks there; but
when he had effected his buſineſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> his Devotion to the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Service abated; ſo that being ſeperately and at ſeveral times ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the King, and by the Agents of the Confederates, to the firſt
he anſwered, <hi>That the King had nothing left in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and therefore it
was in vain to treat.</hi> And to the others he anſwered, <hi>That he could
not treat with them any farther, without the approbation of their King.</hi>
And ſo with his uſual dexterity he extricated himſelf out of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Collonel <hi>Reynolds</hi> and Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones</hi> beat
back ſome Forces that were ſent to the Relief of <hi>Terroghan,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
a Conſult that was held in <hi>Weſtmeath</hi> between the Lord-Lieutenant,
the Lords of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> and <hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> and the Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Biſhop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> and they alſo in <hi>Trim, Ballyhuſe,</hi> and <hi>Fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus matters ſtill growing worſe and worſe, and the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians</hi>
daily getting ground, the <hi>Popiſh Clergy</hi> did, <hi>Proprio Motu,</hi>
aſſemble at <hi>Jameſtown,</hi> on the 6th of <hi>August,</hi> and on the ſame day
did give Commiſſion to the Biſhop of <hi>Fernes</hi> and <hi>Hugh Rochford</hi> to
Treat with forreign Princes, as <hi>Appendix</hi> 46; and afterwards did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things more extravagant. Nevertheleſs, to diſſemble the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                        <p>THis Nation (become of late the Fable and Reproach of the Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
is brought to a ſad Condition: Notwithſtanding the frequent and
laborious Meetings and Conſultations of the Prelates, we find Jealouſies
and Fears deep in the hearts of Men; Thorns hard to take out. We ſee
most Men contributing to the Enemy, and rendring their Perſons and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
uſeful to his Mallice, and deſtructive to Religion and the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest:
This kind of Men (if not timely prevented) will betray irremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably

the Souldier; nor is there an Army any way conſiderable in the
Kingdom to recover what is lost, or defend what we hold: So as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
ſpeaking, (if God will not be pleaſed for his Mercy's ſake, to take off
from us the heavy Judgments of his Anger) we are in a fair way for loſing

                     <body>
                        <p>
                           <q>AFter Our hearty Commendations: We received yours of the
24th of <hi>July,</hi> on the firſt of this Month, and do with
much Grief acknowledge, that this Nation is brought into a ſad
Condition, and that by ſuch means as (when it ſhall be known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and by Story delivered to Poſterity) will indeed be thought
a Fable: For it will ſeem incredible, that any Nation ſhould ſo
madly affect, and violently purſue the ways leading to their own
Deſtruction, as this People will appear to have done; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the certain Ruine they were running into was evidently and
frequently diſcovered unto thoſe, that in all times and upon all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occaſions have had power to perſwade or compel them to
whatever they thought fit: And it will be leſs credible, when it
ſhall be declared, (as with truth it will be) that the Temporal,
Spiritual, and Eternal Intereſt and Safety even of thoſe that had
this power, and that have been thus forewarned, did conſiſt in
making uſe of it to reclaim the People, and direct them into the
Ways of Preſervation. To be plain, it cannot be denied, but the
Diſobedience we have met with (which we at large declared unto
many of you, who with divers others of the Nobility and Gentry,
were aſſembled at <hi>Loghreogh,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> laſt) was the certain ready
way to the Deſtruction of this Nation; as by our Letter of the
firſt of <hi>May,</hi> to that Aſſembly, we made appear. Ancient and late
Experience hath made evident what power thoſe of your Function
have had, to draw the People of this Nation to what they thought
fit. Whether your Lordſhips have been convinced, that the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which we deſire ſhould be given to his Majeſty's Authority
in Us, purſuant to the Articles of Peace, was the way to preſerve
the Nation, we know not, or whether your Lordſhips have made
uſe of all the means at other times, and upon other occaſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
by you, to procure this neceſſary Obedience, we ſhall not
now determine: Sure we are, that ſince the ſaid Aſſembly, not
only <hi>Limerick</hi> hath perſiſted in the Diſobedience it was then in,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65997:405"/>
and aggravated the ſame by ſeveral Affronts ſince fixed upon the
King's Authority, but <hi>Galway</hi> hath been ſeduced into like Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
For want of due Compliance from thoſe places, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
from <hi>Limerick,</hi> it hath been impoſſible for us to raiſe or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
an Army againſt the Rebels: For to attempt it any where on
the other ſide of the <hi>Shannon</hi> but near <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and without the
abſolute Command of that City to ſecure it, could be no other than
the certain ruine of the Deſign in the very beginning of it; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
power being ſuch, as to diſſipate with eaſe the foundation that
ſhould be laid there. And to have done it on this ſide the <hi>Shannon</hi>
was impoſſible, ſince the Ground-work of the Army muſt be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſupported from thence; which whilſt it was in forming
would have exhauſted all the ſubſtance of theſe parts, and not have
effected the Work. For want of ſuch an Army, which (with
God's aſſiſtance) might certainly have been long ſince raiſed, if
<hi>Limerick</hi> had obeyed our Orders, the Rebels have without any
conſiderable reſiſtance from abroad, taken <hi>Clonmell, Tecroghan,</hi> and
<hi>Catherlagh,</hi> and reduced <hi>Waterford</hi> and <hi>Duncannon</hi> to great, and
(we fear) irrecoverable Diſtreſs. The loſs of theſe places, and the
want of any viſible power to protect them, hath doubleſsly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
many to contribute their Subſtance and perſonal Aſſiſtance
to the Rebels: from which, whether they might have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by Church-cenſures, we know not; but have not heard of
any ſuch, which iſſued againſt them. And laſtly, for want of
ſuch an Army, the Rebels have taken to themſelves the Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which might conſiderably have aſſiſted to ſupport an Army,
and preſerve the Kingdom. If therefore the end of your Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
at <hi>Jameſtown,</hi> be to acquit your Conſciences in the Eyes of
God, the amendment of all Errors, and the recovery of this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
People, as by the Letter giving us notice of your meeting is
profeſſed: We have endeavoured briefly to ſhew, That the Spring
of our paſt Loſſes, and approaching Ruine, ariſes from <hi>Diſobedience:</hi>
and it will not be hard to ſhew, that the Spring of thoſe Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences
ariſes from the Forgeries invented, the Calumnies ſpread
againſt Government, and the Incitements of the People to Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
by very many of the Clergy. That theſe Errors are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practiſed, and fit for amendment, is no more to be doubted,
than that without they be amended, the affliction of the People
will continue, and as it is to be feared, end in their utter Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
Which if prevented by what your Conſultation will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
the happy effect of your meeting will be acknowledged,
without queſtioning the Authority by which you meet, or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Propoſals from us: Which other than what we have formerly,
and now by this our Letter made, we hold not neceſſary. And ſo
we bid your Lordſhips Farewel.</q>

<hi>Commiſſioners of Trust,</hi> who were very much ſurprized at it, and

he travelled to <hi>Loghreagh;</hi> but they did not vouchſafe to come, or

                              <p>Whereunto we anſwer, That as the principal Motives inducing
Us through ſome Hazards, and many Difficulties, to come into
this Kingdom, were the Obedience we owe to his Majeſty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and our earneſt deſire to preſerve this Nation in their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to Him, (wherein we always have, and ever ſhall place
our Intereſt, and the Intereſt of ſuch Kindred and Allies as will be
guided by our Advice and Example) ſo we ſhall always readily
expoſe ourſelf to the like, or greater Hazards and Difficulties to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
out of the Kingdom, when We receive his Majeſty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for it, or ſhall be convinced that our Removal tends more
to His Service, and the Preſervation of the Nation, than our ſtay.
We confeſs, that obſerving the Deſtructive Diſobedience and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
of divers Perſons and Places, We were once of opinion,
that we might have done Our King and Country better Service
by withdrawing Ourſelf, than by continuing here, by how much
there would then have been leſs ground for Diviſion, when the
Nation ſhould be governed by one or more of their own Religion.
And ſure we were<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap> that the ſtronger the Reſiſtance were that ſhould
be made againſt the Rebels (under what Conduct whatſoever) the
better it would be for the King and for the Nation: And though
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65997:408"/>
We hold it not fit for Us, even in point of Honour, in flat terms
to propoſe Our Removal, which might have met with as great
Miſinterpretation, as other Actions and Propoſitions of Ours, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the good of the People, have done; yet in a Diſcourſe
had with many of the Prelates, firſt at <hi>Limerick,</hi> and afterwards
here, We did in a manner lead them to the Propoſition they have
now made. And We freely acknowledge, that if they, and the
Nobility and Gentry here met in <hi>April</hi> laſt, had not in Writing and
in Diſcourſe given Us aſſurance, that they not only deſired Our
ſtay, but would endeavour to procure ſuch Obedience to Us as
might enable us with Hope and Succeſs to have gone on in the
War, We ſhould have made uſe of the Liberty given Us, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
then laid upon Us by his Majeſty, to have freed Ourſelf
from the Vexation We have ſince endured, and the Diſhonour We
foreſaw We ſhould be ſubject unto, for want of that Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which (as we then told the ſaid Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) We ſhould be
able to do nothing conſiderable for the King or Nation. Thoſe
Aſſurances We have tranſmitted to his Majeſty, as alſo Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to attend the Effects of them. But thoſe Diſobediences
ſtill continuing, We have again acquainted Him with the ſtate of
His Affairs here, and do daily expect His pleaſure upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
We have made to Him; without which (unleſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by inevitable Neceſſity) We cannot anſwer Our Removal out
of the Kingdom: Which is Our firſt and Principal reaſon, why
We might not comply with the Advice given Us. Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, That We plainly obſerve, that though the Diviſion is great
in the Nation under Our Government, yet it will be greater upon
Our Removal. For which, in a free Conference, We ſhould have
given ſuch pregnant Evidence, as We hold not fit this way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
The Third is, That though ſince the Meeting here, where
we were aſſured of ſuch effectual Endeavours to procure Obedience
to the King's Authority placed in Us, the particular Diſobediences
We then inſtanced have continued, and been improved by many
other Affronts; yet it hath pleaſed God to raiſe His Majeſty Affairs
elſewhere to ſo hopeful a Condition, that may occaſion His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
ſending us ſuch Commands as we ſhould be ſorry ſhould not
find us upon the place: In the laſt place, it is moſt certain that no
Meditation of ours will prevail with his Majeſty for ſending Relief
and Supplies hither, as the Repreſentations We deſire to be enabled
to make of the Dutifulneſs and Obedience of the People, where
unto to diſpoſe them, We do again call upon You to make uſe of
all the means within Your power.</p>

                  <p>But all this Labour might have been ſaved, if his Excellency had
known what theſe Prelates had done; for on the very ſame day the
aforeſaid Meſſage was delivered to the Lord-Lieutenant, by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Dromore</hi> and Doctor <hi>Kelly, viz.</hi> the 12th of <hi>August,</hi> and
without expecting any anſwer to it, they iſſued the fatal and bloudy
Declaration and Excommunication at <hi>Jameſtown</hi> againſt the Lord-Lieutenant
and all his Adherents, recited at large <hi>Appendix</hi> 47;
wherein the Biſhop of <hi>Ferns</hi> ſays, they were Unanimous, and boaſts
that this Rejection of the Lord-Lieutenant (and conſequently of the

King's Authority placed in him) was done by the<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Nor is this Affront to be wondered at, being done with ſome

but they did it at the inſtigation of the Clergy, meerly to bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
on his Perſon and Authority, and for the ſame reaſon that
we hang fugitive Traytors in Effigie. And (which is yet more
ſtrange) when Mr. <hi>Beling</hi> to leſſen the Guilt of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> would pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
the matter by ſaying, they did not force the Lord-Lieutenant

the publication of it, for it was not promulged until the 15th day

performed, fearing on the one ſide the Diſperſion of the Army, and on the

unto that place, with their full force and number of fighting Men, and
thereupon would have us concur with them in ſuſpending the ſaid Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.

may be obeyed, and the Service not neglected, if People were
pleaſed to undertake the Service <hi>in the Clergy's Name,</hi> without relation to

of <hi>Fernes.</hi> However, this could not juſtifie their rejecting of the
King's Authority by excommunicating the Lord-Lieutenant at
<hi>Jameſtown,</hi> becauſe that happened on the 12th of <hi>August,</hi> which
was four days before the other.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the King was exceedingly concerned at this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and the ſcandal and prejudice it would bring to his <hi>Party</hi> in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> and therefore to obviate as much of the Inconvenience as
was poſſible, he haſtned over the Dean of <hi>Tuam</hi> (Dr. <hi>John King</hi>) with
a Verbal Meſſage to the Lord-Lieutenant, importing the neceſſity
of his making the aforeſaid Declaration, and with what great regret
he did it, eſpecially ſo precipitately, ſince it might have been done
gradually with Honour, <hi>the greatest part of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>having broken
that Peace;</hi> and that he depended more upon <hi>Ormond</hi> than upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man living, and deſired him to uſe his utmoſt dexterity at this
juncture: and accordingly his Excellency did immediately write to
the <hi>Commiſſioners of Trust,</hi> as followeth:</p>

                           <div type="letter">
                              <p>AFter Our hearty Commendations: Having lately received Aſſurance
that his Majeſty hath been induced to declare the Peace concluded in
this Kingdom, in the Year 1648, (by vertue of Authority from his late
Majeſty of ever glorious Memory, as alſo of his Majeſty now Reigning) to
be void, and that he is abſolutely freed therefrom; We have thought it neceſſary
for the Vindication of our own Honour, freely to declare unto you, as well
what hath paſſed from us to his Majeſty, that might give any colour for ſuch
a Declaration, as what our reſolution is thereupon.</p>
                              <p>It is very true, that from time to time we endeavoured to give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
a true account of his Affairs committed to our Charge in general, and
that therein we could not omit informing him of divers Affronts put upon
his Authority; by means whereof, and the Diſobediences of the remaining
Towns, (if perſiſted in) we were in diſpair of doing him any conſiderable
Service, or defending the Kingdom from the Rebels. But in our Diſpatches
we were careful that his Majeſty ſhould underſtand that the Nobility, and
greater part of the Gentry continued-faithful to his Majeſty, obedient to his
Authority, and worthy of his Favour and Protection.</p>
                              <p>Whether any of theſe Diſpatches have come to his Majeſty's hands, or if
they have, whether before or ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his making his Declaration against the
Peace, we know not; but we find that his Majeſty's Declaration is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65997:410"/>
grounded upon the Unlawfulneſs of concluding the Peace with this
Nation; and the breaches on the part of the Nation are mentioned, but in
general terms, and by the by; ſo that however the Affronts put upon his
Authority, <hi>have been many,</hi> and obſtinately perſiſted in to this day, and that
in ſuch places whereupon evidently depends the preſervation or loſs of the
whole Kingdom to the Rebels: Whereof we have ſeveral times given notice
unto you, and followed the Ways adviſed by you for reclaiming the ſaid
places, without any ſucceſs; yet conſidering the Declaration gained from his
Majeſty, is without hearing what could be ſaid by the Nation in their own
defence, and ſuch as involves it generally without exception in the guilt of
Rebellion; and that even thoſe have with greatest Inſolence invaded
the Royal Authority, and endeavoured to withdraw the People from their
Allegiance, do yet pretend that they will make their Complaint against
us to his Majeſty, thereby implying, that they will ſubmit to his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
We have thought fit to let you know, that notwithſtanding the ſaid
Declaration, by ſome undue means obtained from his Majeſty, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by all means it ſhall pleaſe God to offer unto us, and through all Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
in behalf of this Nation, to inſist upon, and aſſert the lawfulneſs of
the Concluſion of the Peace by vertue of the aforeſaid Authorities, and
that the ſaid Peace is ſtill valid, of force, and binding to his Majeſty and
all his Subjects: and herein we are reſolved, by the help of God, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist
until that we, and ſuch as ſhall in that behalf be entruſted and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
by the Nation, ſhall have free and ſafe acceſs to his Majeſty, and
untill upon mature and unreſtrained Conſideration of what may on all ſides
be ſaid, he have declared his Royal Pleaſure upon the aforeſaid Affronts put
upon his Authority; provided always, that in the mean time and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</p>
                              <p>

forbidden to obey us as Lord-Lieutenant, be by them Revoked, and ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
as ſhall be agreed on by us, and you the Commiſſioners authorized by
us, in purſuance of the Articles of Peace given by them, that they nor any
of them ſhall not attempt the like for the future, and that they ſhall continue

they are Parties.</p>

Excommunications, and other Proceedings of the ſaid Biſhops, is
an unwarranted Uſurpation upon his Majeſty's just Authority, and in them
a Violation of the Peace; and that in caſe they ſhall not give the Aſſurance
before expreſſed, or having given it ſhall not obſerve the ſame, that you will
endeavour to bring the Offenders to condign puniſhment, purſuant unto, and
as is preſcribed by the Laws of the Kingdom, as Diſturbers of the Peace of
the Kingdom, and Obſtructers of the means of preſerving the ſame.</p>

                                 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That a like Declaration be made by all that derive Authority

for the defence of the Kingdom.</p>

therefrom; taking for the principal grounds for ſuch his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Unlawfulneſs of the Act. And howbeit we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a very feeling ſence of the Grief the Nation (with juſt cauſe)
may entertain of the prejudice thereby brought upon them, and

that notwithſtanding that Declaration, by ſome undue means ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

no Subject could be juſtly warranted by that Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to deny Obedience to his Majeſty's Authority in your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency;
yet being of opinion, that a publick Declaration of this
kind, in this Conjuncture of Affairs, ought properly, and would
with more countenance and authority move from an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> than
from us, and that by ſuch a publick Declaration now from us, we
ſhould wholly obſtruct the way to prevail with the Prelates, to
withdraw thoſe Cenſures, or Act what is deſired by the former

to that end; where we obſerve,
his Excellency informed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of certain Diſobediences and
Affronts put upon the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and conſequently ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
Matter to his Majeſty of
making his Declaration againſt
the Peace.</p>

                                 <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have peruſed the
King's Declaration diſavowing
of the late Peace, and are of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
for ought to us appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That the King hath thereby
withdrawn his Commiſſion and
Authority from the Lord-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant:
This is clearly proved
out of a Branch of the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
taking away and nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all Commiſſions granted by
him. In that Declaration the
King will have no Friends but
the Friends of the Covenant:
Hence it is evidently inferred,
That his Majeſty's Authority is
taken away from the Lord-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
unleſs he be a Friend to
the Covenant, (as we conceive
he is not;) but if he be, he is
not our Friend, nor to be truſted
by us, in having Authority over
us. In the ſame Declaration,
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, as bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
are caſt from the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the King's Laws and Royal
Favours: It may not therefore be
preſumed, That he would have
his Authority kept over ſuch a
Nation to govern them. We
do joyn with you in that you
repreſent, to wit, There is no
Safety to be expected from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters
or Independents, for
the Catholick Religion, or this
Nation: If that of the Peace be
proved the only Safety, we are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65997:413"/>
for it. However, we conceive
the benefit thereof is due to us,
having made no breach of our
part.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Something of our ſenſe
concerning what way may tend
beſt to the Nation's preſervation,
we will ſay beneath, and do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our clear intentions before
God, to joyn with you and all
Men, in what will be found the
beſt and fafeſt way to ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are of Opinion,
and did ever think all our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
ſhould be employed to
keep the King's Authority over
us: But when his Majeſty throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
away the Nation from his
protection as Rebels, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Authority, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
underſtand this Myſtery of
preſerving the ſame with us, and
over us, or how it may be done.
Whereas you ſay, That many of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65997:413"/>
thoſe conſiderable, will inſtantly
make their Conditions with the
Enemy, if the King's Authority
be taken away by himſelf, (as
by his Declaration it is) and not
driven away by the Subject: In
ſuch caſe, when the People may
not hold it, likely they will not
agreewith the Parliament for not
having it. We are of Opinion,
the beſt remedy (the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
being taken away, as was
ſaid) of meeting this Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Peoples cloſing with
the Parliament, is returning to
the Confederacy; as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Nation, in caſe of
breach of Peace on his Majeſty's
part. This will keep a Union
amonſt us, if Men will not be
precipitantly guilty of breach of
their Oath of Aſſociation; which
Oath by two ſolemn Orders of
two ſeveral Aſſemblies, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
binding, if any breach of
the Articles ſhould happen of
his Majeſty's part. The King's
Authority, and the Lord-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's
Commiſſion being recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Declaration aboveſaid,
we are of Opinion, the Lord-Lieutenant
hath no ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to leave. If we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Lives and Fortunes to the
hazard of fighting for making
good that Peace, ſeeing the
danger and prejudice is alike to
defend that, or get a better Peace,
Why ſhould we bound ourſelves
within the limits of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
to diſavowed?</p>
                              <p>Upon conſideration of the
whole matter, we may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with ſafety of Conſcience to
the <hi>Proviſo's</hi> of revoking our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
and Excommunication
demanded by his Excellency, or
granting any Aſſurance to him,
or the Commiſſioners of Truſt,
for not attempting the like in the
future; and that for many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
eſpecially for,</p>
                              <p>I. That the King's Authority
is not in the Lord-Lieutenant,
nor Power in us to confer a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65997:414"/>
new Authority on him; being
alſo deſtructive to the Nation to
continue it in him, and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
if in another. And that was
our ſence when we declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King's Authority in
his perſon.</p>
                              <p>II. We much fear we ſhould
loſe the few Churches remaining
under his Government, as we
loſt under him all the Churches
of the City of <hi>Waterford</hi> and
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and the Towns of <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Roſs, Clonmell, Caſhell, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thard,
Kilmallock,</hi> &amp;c. in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
with the <hi>Maccabees</hi> Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims,
<hi>Maximus vero &amp; primus pro
ſanctitate timor erat templi.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>III. His Excellency having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
at <hi>Cork,</hi> that he will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
during his Life the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, according to the
Example of the beſt Reformed
Churches, which may be the
ſame in ſubſtance with the Oath
of Covenant, for ought we
know; we may not expect from
him Defence of the Catholick
Religion.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65997:414"/>
IV. The Scandal over all the
World to make choiſe of one of
a different Religion, eſpecially in
<hi>Rome</hi> where his Holineſs in his
Agreement or Articles with the
Queen of <hi>England,</hi> had a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Governour granted, tho'
not performed: And we do fear
the Scourges of War and Plague
that have fallen ſo heavy upon
us, and ſome Evidences of God's
Anger againſt us, for putting
God's Cauſe and Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch a hand: whereas that
Truſt might have been managed
in a Catholick Hand under the
King's Authority.</p>
                              <p>V. That we ſhall find no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
or Countenance from any
Catholick Prince of the Church
or Laity, he governing, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and Diſgrace.</p>
                              <p>VI. That the Souldiers, by the
ill Succeſs of his Conduct, have
not the heart to Fight under him,
and ſo we ſhall be loſt if we
come to fighting.</p>
                              <p>VII. We find the People gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in great fear to be loſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65997:415"/>
his Government; and are of
Opinion, That the greater part
of the People will agree with the
Parliament, if the Authority were
continued in him, deſpairing of
Defence under him.</p>
                              <p>VIII. That we declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, having the King's
Authority, out of no Spleen or
Malice againſt his perſon (ſo ſave
us God) but for the fear we had,
upon good deliberation, of the
utter Ruine and Deſtruction of
the Nation under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that now finding no
reaſons or ways of Preſervation
by him, we may not with reaſon
be induced to alter our Opinion,
eſpecially the King's Authority
being not in him.</p>
                              <p>IX. That thoſe two conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Corporations remaining, are
at great diſtance with his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
for giving Commiſſions
to take away their Goods, and
other reaſons; and are thought
to be reſolved not to ſubmit to
him;<note place="margin">☞</note> though they reſolve to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
(as in their intentions and
actions they conceive they are)
Faithful to the Crown, and to
the King's Authority Obedient,
if placed in another perſon.</p>

                              <p>WE had reaſon to hope, that
if the Offer we made ſhould
not meet with the ſucceſs we deſired,
yet that ſo affectionate a Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Love to the Nation,
(tranſporting us to an Overture of
Reconciliation with thoſe that had
ſo much injured us) would not have
given ground for repeating old, and
caſting new Aſperſions upon us:
But for Anſwer to this Paragraph,
we refer to our Letter, and to our
Anſwer to the eleventh Article of
their Declaration, <hi>Appendix</hi> 48.</p>
                              <p>Here they readily declare their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
concerning his Majeſtys having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
our Commiſſion, and take pains
to prove it by an unavoidable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,
or that at least, we are not
their Friend, nor to be truſted by
them: And by another ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they endeavour to prove his
Majeſty would not have his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
at all kept over this Nation.
When by this means they have, as
they think, ſhewed it impoſſible, that
the Peace can be continued, which
they know it cannot without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the King's Authority,
then they ſay, If the Peace be proved
the only Safety, they are for it; and
that, however, they conceive the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
thereof is due to them, having
made no breach on their part. If
they would make it their buſineſs to
ſeek for Arguments to keep the King's
Authority over them, they might
perhaps find many, and theſe as
convincing as thoſe they have found
to diſpute it out of the Kingdom;
as the Concluſion and Ratification of
the Peace here by vertue of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
precedent to the Declaration
ſeeming to Annul it:<note place="margin">☞</note> The certainty
that he was in a free Condition
when he gave the ſaid Authority,
and Ratified the Peace concluded by
it; and the queſtion that may be
made, whether he was ſo when he
declared against it. And laſtly,
That by the Articles of Peace, he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65997:413"/>
is obliged to continue his Authority
here; from which Obligation no
Declaration, at least importuned
from him by his Subjects of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
can free him, or take from
this Nation (who have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on <hi>Scotland</hi>) the benefit of
the Agreement made by his Majeſty
with them. Upon theſe grounds it
was, that (until his Majeſty had
been fully informed in all that had
paſſed here, and declared his free
ſence upon it) we offered to juſtifie
the Lawfulneſs of concluding the
Peace, and the continuing Validity
of it to thoſe that had not forfeited
their Interest in it, if we might
have had the Concurrence of theſe
Biſhops, and Obedience in the Places,
by the ſtrength and means whereof it
might have been juſtified. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this was an Offer not meriting the
Scorn and Bitterneſs wherewith it
was rejected. If they that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this Paper have made no breach
of the Peace on their part, we have
lost much labour in the fore-paſſed
Diſcourſe: But we believe we have
proved they have made many,<note place="margin">rindx;</note> and
thoſe the highest it was poſſible to
make. And ſurely they must be
very partial on their own ſide, if
they think the benefit of a thing they
reject is due to them.</p>
                              <p>This is only a Profeſſion which
requires no Anſwer from us.</p>
                              <p>To this we anſwer, That if they
were always of Opinion all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
ſhould be employed to keep
the King's Authority over them,
their Declaration and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a ſtrange way of manifeſting
that Opinion; which Declaration
and Excommunication bears date
before his Majeſty's Declaration,
wherein they ſay he throweth away
the Nation as Rebels: So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Majeſty hath done in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65997:413"/>
his Authority, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
their endeavour to drive it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
was first in Time. In their
Advice of returning to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,
appears the ſcope of their
Dilemma's and Arguments against
the continuance of the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over them; which that th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap>
may be ſure to be rid of, they ſay
we have no Authority to leave.
Their Reaſons why in Conſcience they
cannot conſent to the Revocation of
their Declaration and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
follow.</p>
                              <p>The King's Authority was in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                                    <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                                 </gap>
when the Declaration and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
was framed by them,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65997:414"/>
they acknowledged. And that it is
ſtill in us (notwithſtanding his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
ſaid Declaration) we are able
to make good, if we could find it of
advantage to his Service, or the
Safety of his good Subjects. But
that they confeſs, it is not in them to
confer a new Authority upon us, is
one of the few Truths they have ſet
down: yet why they may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to give, as well as take away
Authority, and why they may not
to us, as well as to others, we know
not? They further ſay, it is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the Nation if continued in
us, and preſervative if in another:
And this they ſay was their ſence
when they declared against the
King's Authority in our perſon. We
would gladly know what we have
done to change their ſcope, ſince the
time that by their many profeſſions
(formerly recited) they ſeemed to be
of another Opinion: if it be for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little or nothing, we believe we
have made it appear, they are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
guilty of our being out of
Action. That it will be preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the Nation, to have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to Govern it in another, we

                                 <hi>Caſhell</hi> was
lately deſerted by ſome of thoſe Men
eſteemed Obedient Children of Holy
Church, ſo the ſame Men could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be perſwaded nor forced into
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> when they bad Orders
for it; and by that means both
Places were lost.</p>
                              <p>What we declared at <hi>Cork</hi> in
this particular, was before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of the Treaty of Peace, and
publiſhed in Print, and then well
known to many of theſe Biſhops:
So that they ought then to be aware
how they had concluded a Peace
with one that had made ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
rather than now, after
almost two Years, to make it a
ground of breaking the Peace. What
our Opinion is of the Covenant, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65997:414"/>
the best Reformed Churches, we
hold not ourſelf obliged to declare:
Reſolved we were to defend the
Peace concluded by us in all the parts
of it: which we have faithfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to do, and ſhould ſtill
have endeavoured it, if we had not
been interrupted, affronted, and
wholly diſabled therein by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement
of thoſe very Biſhops, their
Brethren and Inſtruments.</p>
                              <p>Now at length they are come
plainly to ſhew the true ground of
their Exception to us, which they
have endeavoured all the while to
diguiſe under the perſonal Scandals
they have endeavoured to cast upon
us.<note place="margin">☜</note> They are afraid of Scandal at
<hi>Rome.</hi> for making Choice, as they
call it, (as if they might chooſe their
Governours) of one of a different
Religion: If this be allowed them,
why they may not next pretend to
the ſame fear of Scandal for having
a King of a different Religion,<note place="margin">☜</note> and
to the Power of chooſing one of their
own Religion, we know not. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Agreement made between
the Queen of <hi>England</hi> and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
for a Governour for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
we have never heard of any
ſuch; and we are most confident,
that in the Agreement, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in the want of Performance,
her Majeſty is falſly aſperſed by the
Framers of this Paper.</p>
                              <p>We believe that no Prince or
State that could not be induced to
Succour or Countenance this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being under Obedience to their
Natural King, will Succour or
Countenance it, if it ſuffer itſelf to
be ſeduced into Rebellion upon the
Motives ſuggeſted by theſe Men and
their Brethren; which were to give
exil Example to their own Subjects,
and hazard the Quiet of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
or States.</p>
                              <p>To theſe we have anſwered elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65997:415"/>
We cannot ſufficiently wonder, that
Men having no Spleen or Malice to
our perſon, have yet been ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
by their deſire to have a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
to their mind, as to aſperſe
us with ſo many Untruths as they
have been detected of in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
Or why (if their Charity be
ſuch as they ſpeak of) they chooſe not
rather to deal freely with us in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
when we ſo often provoked
them to it, than to joyn with others
to keep us here against our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as if it were on purpoſe) to
ſend us away irrecoverably blaſted
in Honour and Reputation, by their
publick Declaration.</p>
                              <p>As to the Commiſſions here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to be given by us against
<hi>Limerick,</hi> the many Provocations,
Diſobediences, affronts, and Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
of Dues (by the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners)
applotted on them, required
much more at our hands than we
did: Which you will find by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
Diſcourſe; though therein we
are neceſſitated to re-aſſume in part
what we formerly ſaid of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor
of that City:</p>
                              <p>That we having for a long time
obſerved the great Diſadvantage his
Majeſty's Service, in the Conduct of the War; hath been ſubject unto, for
want of Garriſoning the Army in the principal Cities and Towns of this
Kingdom, whereby the Army could not but be undiſciplined and unfit for
Action, the Country (where we have been forced to Quarter them at large)
burthened, and deſtroyed, and the ſaid Cities and Towns (on the Defence
whereof depended the Preſervation of the Kingdom, with the Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Fortunes of all his Majeſty's good Subjects therein) in apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of being lost upon the approach of an Enemy, as by ſad Experience
hath been verified in the loſs of ſome Places of importance, for the want
of the ſeaſonable admitting into them of fitting Governours, and Garriſon
Souldiers; We did on the 14th of <hi>January</hi> last, propoſe unto the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
authorized by us, in purſuance of the Articles of Peace, that then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<hi>Limerick</hi> and other Places ſhould be ſtrongly Garriſon'd and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified:
and in purſuance of the ſaid Articles, we offered unto them the
Names of three Perſons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, that out of them
they might chooſe one for the Command of <hi>Limerick.</hi> But the Plague in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> together with the neceſſity of diſſolving the Meeting
then there, and for other important reaſons, the Election of a Governour of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65997:415"/>
the ſaid City of <hi>Limerick</hi> was deferred, to the end that at our coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we might, in the manner preſcribed by the Articles of Peace, make
Choice of ſuch a Perſon and Garriſon as might be at once fit for ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
a Charge, and beyond all poſſiblity of being lyable to just Exception
from that Corporation.</p>
                              <p>We leave it to the Commiſſioners and others that then attended us, to
witneſs what pains we there took to ſatisfie thoſe of that City in the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of their ſpeedy receiving a Governour and Garriſon, in relation to all
the Intereſts that can be of value with any People: What our Patience was
in paſſing by many Diſreſpects and Marks of an Unworthy Diſtrust put
upon us there, as particularly the Officer commanding the City Guards, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came to us for Orders, nor imparted any to us; that no Officer of the
Army, nor any other Perſon could without ſpecial leave, (and that hardly
obtained from the Mayor) be admitted to come to us, to receive our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Directions for reſiſting the Rebels, than by this means prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and other places; and that the Lord Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Kilmalloc,</hi> a Peer of the Realm, and an Officer of the Army, was
(we being upon the place) reſtrained of his Liberty,<note place="margin">☜</note> for no other reaſon than
for Quartering, by our Orders, for one night, ſome few Horſe under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the Liberties of the City.</p>
                              <p>When through ſuch their Deportment, we deſpaired of perſwading them
to the ways leading to their proper Safety, and alſo judged it far beneath
the Honour of our Maſter, to remain any longer in a Place where ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
were put upon his Authority intruſted with us, we determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from thence to <hi>Logreogh,</hi> appointing the ſaid Commiſſioners, and as
many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Biſhops as were within any convenient
diſtance, to meet us there on the 9th of <hi>March;</hi> Where, being met, we
declared unto them the neceſſity of Garriſoning that City; and gave them
ſome notice of our reſentment of our Uſage there, yet ſparingly, in hope that
by their means they might be brought to conſent to what was ſo neceſſary
for their own Preſervation, and in time to a better underſtanding of their
Duty to his Majeſty's Authority.</p>
                              <p>Whereupon the ſaid Commiſſioners, by two of their Number, directed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
preſſing and rational Letters to that Corporation, to the effect propoſed by
us; offering them their Choice of five Perſons for the Martial Government
of that City, all of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, of conſiderable Interest
in the Kingdom, and of unblemiſhed Reputation. And the Biſhops do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That they accompanied thoſe Letters, with others from themſelves,
perſwading, that Obedience ſhould be given to what was required by us,
with the Advice and Conſent of the ſaid Commiſſioners. To all which
they returned Anſwers to theſe employed to them; wherein in direct Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Articles of Peace (whereunto they were obliged, and which
was proclaimed in that City) they preſumed to propoſe the raiſing of new
Forces of their own; chooſing what Men to receive, how and whence they
ſhould be ſupported, by whom their means ſhould be raiſed and collected,
into whoſe hands it ſhould be put; and in ſhort, wholly omitting to declare
any thing concerning a Governour; aſſumed to themſelves all the Power in
that City, that by his Majeſty is placed in us, and by the Articles of Peace
in the Commiſſioners.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Propoſitions coming to us before our meeting with the Commiſſioners
at <hi>Athlone,</hi> we directed our Letter of the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> to thoſe employed
to them, with direction to impart it to the Corporation: In theſe our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
we manifeſted our diſlike to ſuch parts of their Preſumption as tended
to a dangerous Diſtinction and Dividing of the Nation, and to the Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of his Majeſty's Power, even as the ſame is for a time in ſome
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65997:416"/>
things limited by the Articles of Peace, and added to their Choice of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard.</hi> But in their Propoſitions
(which might be underſtood to proceed only from a fear of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened
for the want of the punctual Payment of the Men that ſhould be
admitted) we gave them aſſurance of Satisfaction as far as in us lay.
And the Commiſſioners being at <hi>Athlone,</hi> and made acquainted with their
Anſwers, did again propoſe unto them ſome things nearer to their own
ſence: But all their Forbearings, Condeſcentions, and mild Perſwaſions,
have produced in them no other effect than an obſtinate and peremptory Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
in their Diſobedience, with an Aggravation of it, by their rejecting
ſix Perſons free from all just exception, and preſuming to offer three of their
own naming to our Election.</p>
                              <p>After this followed the breaking open our Trunks of Papers there; the
forcing of the Stores of Corn laid up for his Majeſty's Army, and therein
ſome Corn belonging to ourſelf, and diſpoſing of all to ſuch uſes as they
thought fit. All which we paſſed by until that <hi>Murtagh O Bryen</hi> going
unto that City with his Regiment, and being there received and continued
contrary to our Orders, to multiply his Affronts unto us, (which rendred
him the more acceptable to that City) came forth with the ſaid Men into
the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> and drive away the Cattle of divers of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Country, who had formerly paid their Contribution unto ſuch
as were appointed to receive it. Upon whoſe Sufferance and Complaint
thereof, we ſent our Order unto the Mayor of <hi>Limerick,</hi> to ſend to us the
ſaid <hi>Murtagh O Bryen,</hi> in the condition of a Priſoner, by a party of Horſe
and Foot, that we ſent thither to receive him. To the Commander of
which Party, we gave order to ſeize upon the Cattle of the ſaid City; and
in caſe Obedience would not be given to our ſaid Warrant, to drive them
away: The Officer did accordingly ſeize upon the ſaid Cattle; but could get
no other anſwer, than that the Mayor would ſend us his anſwer; which
came not to us at least in a week after, neither did it then ſhew any thing
of Obedience, the ſubſtance of it being, That the Government of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was committed to Major-General <hi>Hugh O Neil,</hi> and therefore that he
would not intermeddle therein. Whereas they made the Governour a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
and ſuffered him to act nothing but what they pleaſed; who return'd
us that anſwer unto our Command unto him to ſend us the ſaid <hi>Murtagh
O Neil</hi> Priſoner. And whether the least of the ſaid Offences deſerved not
worſe Uſage than <hi>Limerick</hi> had from us, at least if all did not, let any
indifferent or moderate Men judge. What ground we had for giving the
like Commiſſions against <hi>Galway,</hi> will preſently be ſpoken of: That the
purpoſe of thoſe Corporations was not to ſubmit unto us, is doubtleſs well
known to, and infuſed into them by thoſe Biſhops, and their Inſtruments,
whom we admit not as competent Judges of the Faithful Actions of thoſe
Places to the Crown.</p>
                              <p>X. That no forreign Nation

Part of this is anſwered in our
Anſwer to the fifth Article of their
Declaration. As to the ground of
ſeizing the <hi>Hollander,</hi> here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
it was amongst others for
theſe Reaſons:</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Firſt,</hi> For that the Corporation
of <hi>Galway</hi> this last Summer, did
unwarrantably aſſume to itſelf the
Power of Judicature in Maritine
Affairs, and that the Mayor, for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65997:416"/>
that time being, (with what Aſſiſtance we know not) adjudged, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
diſpoſed of a Ship and her Lading as Prize, notwithſtanding our
Inhibition to him at that time, and our requiring him to ſhew upon what
pretence he aſſumed ſuch Power, there being upon the place proper Judges
deriving Authority from His Majeſty, to give Judgment in ſuch Caſes; and
notwithſtanding, that even in the time of Confederacy, the like Power was
never aſſumed by them, but all Prizes were adjudged by Commiſſion from
the Supream Council of the Confederate Catholicks.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Secondly,</hi> That notwithſtanding we, ſome time the laſt Summer, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt made tender of Farming the Cuſtoms to the ſaid Corporation, and
they refuſing it, Farmed the ſame to certain Perſons, who were, at a day
long ſince, in part of Payment of the Cuſtoms, to have delivered us a good
proportion of Ammunition, wherewith to defend this His Majeſty's Kingdom
and People againſt the Rebels; yet the ſaid Corporation pretending there was
Money due of the Loan-Money, promiſed by them in the beginning of the
Year before, (which they can never make good, as appears by their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs
to come to Accompt) gave, or ſuffered violent interruption to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the ſaid Farmers, in receiving the benefit of their ſaid Bargain; and
notwithſtanding their Application<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Mayor, and our Letters in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
there was no Redreſs given them, nor Puniſhment inflicted on the
Diſturbers. Whereby we have wanted the Ammunition contracted for, and
loſt many Opportunities of Service againſt the Rebels; and many Places
were taken by them, for want of the ſaid Ammunition, and the remaining
part of the Kingdom in apparent hazard of becoming a Prey to the ſaid
Rebels.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the ſaid Corporation (when it appeared neceſſary to us,
to the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> their Governour, and to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
Authorized in purſuance of the Articles of Peace, that for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
thereof a Garriſon and Governour ſhould be placed in the ſaid Town)
refuſed, and do ſtill refuſe to receive any ſuch Garriſon, or Governour, as by
the Articles of Peace they were,<note place="margin">☜</note> and are to receive. Which is a breach of
the ſaid Peace, and Diſobedience of a high and criminal nature.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That in the Month of <hi>September</hi> laſt, there was Publiſhed,
and Declared in the Town of <hi>Galway,</hi> a Falſe, Scandalous, and Traiterous
Excommunication and Declaration, againſt any that ſhou'd Obey or Adhere
unto His Majeſty's Government and Authority in us, who are onely
therewith truſted as Lord-Lieutenant of this His Majeſty's Kingdom, and
another Power and Government without, and againſt. His Majeſty's ſaid
Government,<note place="margin">☜</note> ſet up and practiſed: And that the Mayor and Aldermen,
with a multitude of others of the ſaid Corporation were preſent, countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and abetting the ſaid Traiterous Excommunication and Declaration;
and do yet countenance and abett the ſame, by entertaining, relieving, and
cheriſhing the Contrivers and Publiſhers thereof: Which by the Laws in force
in this Land is High-Treaſon.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That in the ſaid Month of <hi>September</hi> laſt, or in the Month
of <hi>October,</hi> the Captain of the Guards of that Town, commonly called the
Captain of the Young Men,<note place="margin">☜</note> did make Search for us in the ſaid Town, as
after a Criminal Perſon or Fugitive, thereby endeavouring to bring Scorn
and Contempt upon us, and His Majeſty's Authority placed in us.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There were divers Sums of Money put aboard the Ship called
<hi>The Seven Stars,</hi> to be Tranſported out of the Kingdom without Licenſe;
there were Fells, and divers other Commodities unentred in the Cuſtom-Houſe,
for which Goods no Cuſtom was paid to His Majeſty, which were
ſufficient grounds to cauſe the ſaid Ship and Goods to be ſeized on, the Goods
belonging to Merchants of <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Galway,</hi> as was acknowledged in
Letters from the Mayors of both Corporations, deſiring reſtitution.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65997:417"/>
For as much of this as concerns us,
we have anſwered in our Anſwer to
the Declaration of the Biſhops; and
ſhall onely add, That we are neither
by the Articles of Peace to accompt for
Monies ſpent, nor to bring any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
to accompt, but that Power is
in the Commiſſioners by the 28th Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Peace. Here again they
take upon them to declare the Senſe of
the People, without Authority from
them.</p>
                              <p>We acknowledge our ſelf no fit
Perſon in any Event of War, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the Enemy for the People
committed by His Majeſty to Our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
without Licenſe from His
Majeſty.</p>
                              <p>Touching the ways adviſed by
them for preſervation of the Nation,
it is alſo referred by us unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the Aſſembly, we being
diſabled by the Practices before ſet
down, to act any thing towards it,
in the way of Oppoſition to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
But where they ſay they never
intended to hinder Aſſemblies, or give
Law to the People, it is plain that
they declared the People were not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to obey our Orders, who onely
even by the Articles of Peace, bad
Power to call an Aſſembly. And if
to give and take away Governours
at their pleaſure from the People, as
theſe Men have done, be not to give
Law to them, it is yet the higheſt
Prerogative exerciſed by the Kings
and States of the World. And if
they can no otherwiſe, than by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
this Power endeavour to defend
the Altars, and Souls truſted to them,
the World hath long wanted the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
given by them; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and Primitive Biſhops and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Church, have been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Example and Precept.</p>
                              <p>To this we willingly ſubmit.</p>
                              <p>For we never intended to hinder Aſſemblies, or to give Law to the
People. All we endeavoured was to defend the Altars, and Souls
entruſted to us. As we are of Opinion the Souldiers will follow the
Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and the People obey him, ſo will we contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
our beſt Endeavours to that effect. We further give aſſurance
hereby, That if a Free and Lawful Aſſembly, upon due Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65997:417"/>
of their own State and Condition, ſhall find it the beſt way for
their ſafety and preſervation, to make Agreement with the Enemy,
as we intend never by the Grace of God, to grant away from us, by
an affirmative Aſſent, our Churches and Altars (if forc'd from us, we
are blameleſs): So will we not hinder the People from compounding
with the Enemy, for the ſafety of their Lives and Eſtates, when no
way of Defence is appearing; though upon ſuch Agreement we ſee,
that we alone ſhall probably be the Loſers of Sees, Eſtates, Churches,
Altars, Immunities, and Liberties. But in ſuch Contracts with the
Enemy, if any ſhall happen (which God avert) we ſhall pray and
conjure the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that that of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of them to future Ages: <hi>Erat enim pro Uxoribus &amp; Filiis item<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que

which, on the Sixteenth of <hi>November,</hi> he wrote an Exhortation to
Unity and Obedience; but finding, as he ſuſpected, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the Clergy over them, would keep them from doing any
thing to the purpoſe, he prepared for his Voyage, and ſent his Goods
and Servants on Ship-board, and on the Second of <hi>December,</hi> from
<hi>Kilcolgan,</hi> wrote them a long and excellent Letter in his own

thus:</p>

our Expreſſions, than ſuits with the Reſpects you have
to theſe Prelates, and other Clergymen, you would then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
conſider the provocation they have given us. And that as
to compaſs their ends, they have not forborn <hi>falſely to charge us</hi>
with the higheſt Crimes imaginable, and with the greateſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and Failings, that can render a Man of our Condition and
Profeſſion contemptible; ſo it was in our own Defence neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for us to ſhew, that this Judgment was not given of us, by
a grave Congregation of Adviſed, Temperate, and Loyal Perſons,
but by Factious, Raſh, Violent, and Diſloyal Men, aſſembled
without Authority, tranſported with Spleen, Arrogance, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,

taking advantage of the ill ſucceſs themſelves are guilty of,
to declare things contrary to Truth, and contrary to the Sence
and Deſire of many learned and pious Men of their own Profeſſion,
that are born down and awed by their Tyranny; the Truth and
Juſtification of which Judgment is diſavowed by ſome who are

                  <p>
                     <q>To conclude, We profeſs to the World, that we have a high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to, and Eſteem of the Character of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> even where
we diſſent from the Doctrine taught by thoſe that bear it: But if
they ſhall lay aſide the Ingenuity, the Moderation, the Charity
becoming their Function, nay, the Humanity and Civility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming

have of their own free accords, for removing of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
that any might apprehend of their Proceedings, declared and
proteſted, That by their Excommunication and Declaration at
<hi>Jameſtown</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> last, they had no other Aim, than the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Catholick Religion and People, and did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to make any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation on his Majeſty's Authority, or on the
Liberties of the People; confeſſing it belongs not to their Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſo to do, upon conſideration of which their Declaration and
Proteſtation, and their Profeſſions to that purpoſe in this Aſſembly,
and of his Excellency's Letter dated the 16th of <hi>November</hi> last,
recommending unto us, as the chief ends for which this Aſſembly
was called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the removing of all Diviſions, as the best way for our
Preſervation, We the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Gentry
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65997:418"/>
met in this Aſſembly, conceiving that there is no better Foundation
and Ground for our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, than the holding to, and obeying his
Majeſty's Authority, to which we owe and ought to pay all dutiful
Obedience, do hereby declare and protest, That our Allegiance to
his Majeſty is ſo inherent in us, that we cannot be withdrawn from
the ſame; nor is there any power or authority in the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
or Temporal, Gentry or People, Clergy or Laity of the Kingdom,
that can alter, change, or take away his Majeſty's Authority, we
holding that to be the chief Flower of the Crown, and the Support
of the Peoples Liberty, which we hereby protest, declare, and avow,
and alſo do eſteem the ſame eſſentially inviolably and juſtly due from
us, and the chiefest Mean, under GOD, to uphold our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and
Preſervation; And do unanimouſly beſeech his Excellency, in his
great Affections to the Advancement of his Majeſty's Service, and
his hearty deſires to this Nation's preſervation, to which he hath
relation of highest Concernments, in Blood, Alliance, and Interest,
to leave that Authority with us in ſome perſon faithful to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and acceptable to the Nation: To which perſon, when made
known unto us, we will not only afford all due Obedience, but will
alſo offer and propoſe the best Ways and Means that God will
pleaſe to direct us to, for preſervation of his Majeſty's Rights and
Peoples Intereſts and Liberties, and for begetting ready Obedience
in all places and perſons to his Majeſty's Authority. And we do
farther declare, That albeit <hi>Drogheda</hi> and all other places
which were upon concluſion of the Peace in <hi>January</hi> 1648, in the
Enemies power in this Kingdom (the Cities of <hi>London Derry</hi> and
<hi>Dublin</hi> only excepted) were in his Excellency's time of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Conduct, through many hazards in his perſon, and loſs
in his Fortune, reduced to his Majeſty's Obedience, God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to bring us to the State and Condition we are at preſent, yet
we are fully ſatisfied, that his Excellency had faithful Intentions,
and hearty Affections, to advance his Majeſty' Intereſts and Service
in this Kingdom.</p>

provided that their Declaration might be ſo far explained, as
to give the Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> full ſatisfaction, that the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
they made, touching the Obedience they owed and reſolved to
pay unto his Majeſty's Authority, was meant, <hi>The Authority placed
in his Lordſhip, or any other Governour, deriving or holding his Authority
from his Majeſty; and that they eſteem it not in the Power of any Perſon,
Congregation, or Aſſembly whatſoever, to diſcharge or ſet the People free
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65997:419"/>
from obeying his Lordſhip, or any other ſuch Governour, during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the ſaid Authority in him:</hi> without which, he ſaid, he could
not (in Duty to his Majeſty) leave his Authority, ſubject to be toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to and fro, at the uncertain Fancies of any Man or Men, and
without any probability of ſaving the Nation; which could be no
otherwiſe effected, than by an abſolute chearful Obedience of the
People, unto the Authority placed over them. And ſo having given
charge to the Lord <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> not to accept the Government upon
other Terms; and having refuſed a Paſs from <hi>Ireton,</hi> which a great
Man yet living, ſollicitous of Excellency's ſafety, had obtained; and
being accompanied with the Lord <hi>Inſiquin,</hi> and the Colonels <hi>Vaughan,

But the Marqueſs abſolutely refuſed to do it, except they ſatisfied the
<hi>Proviſo</hi> mentioned in the Lord-Lieutenant's Letter to them; and
that he ſaw ſuch an Union amongſt them, as might free the King's
Authority from the Affronts it had been expoſed unto. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they petitioned him again to aſſume that Authority, without
which the Nation, as they ſaid, would be expoſed to Ruine; and
they promiſed entire Obedience thereunto; and for farther mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of the Sincerity of their Intentions, they made the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

                     <hi>But now that the Confederates have gotten a Governour to their

(within very few Days, and before any new Misfortune happened)
be propoſed in the Aſſembly,</hi> That they might ſend to Treat with the
Enemy for the Surrender of all that was left: <hi>However, the major part

                     <note place="margin">☜</note> To reſort to their first Confederacy, and ſo
proceed in their Preſervation, without any reſpect to the King's Authority.
<hi>And this diſloyal Motion found ſo many Abettors, eſpecially of the
Clergy, that thoſe who were zealous in oppoſing it, were fain
to reproach the Aſſembly by telling them,</hi> That they now manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it was not their prejudice to the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> nor their
zeal to Religion, that had tranſported them, but their diſlike of the King's
Authority, and their reſolution to withdraw themſelves from it: That they
themſelves would conſtantly ſubmit to it, and defend it with their utmost
hazard, as long as they ſhould be able; and when they ſhould be reduced
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65997:420"/>
to extremity, (that Treating with the Enemy could no longer be deferred)
they would (in that Treaty) make no proviſion for them, but be contented
that they ſhould be excluded from any benefit thereof, who were ſo forward
to exclude the King's Authority.<note place="margin">☞</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that pretended Obedience and profeſſed
Loyalty, were nevertheleſs daily undermining the Government in
favour of the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and by<note n="b" place="margin">P. W. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance</hi> 583.</note> 
                     <hi>mixing Truth and Lies indifferently,</hi>

and foment Jealouſies, hoping to get rid of the Lord-Lieutenant, and
to get the Kingdom in their own power, to diſpoſe of it to the Pope,
or ſome other Forreign Prince, as hath already been ſhewn. So
there were others that did actually correſpond with the <hi>Cromweliſts,</hi>
and poorly truckled to the prevailing Party; for fear of whom they
pretended, at firſt, to have rais'd their Rebellion; inſomuch, that
in a Letter of the Seventh of <hi>May,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> complains
of the Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Defection, and ſays, <hi>That the</hi> Iriſh <hi>are
ſo falſe, that No-body is to be truſted, for either the Husband or the Wife are

than he, in his Letter of <hi>June</hi> 26. to the King, acquaints His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<hi>That His Affairs are confounded by the ever-Diſloyal Party of the</hi> Iriſh
<hi>Clergy, to whom Lying is as natural as Rebellion.</hi> But that which is
more wonderful, is, that the Popiſh Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

Four</hi> (meaning the King, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and the
Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond):</hi> And indeed the <hi>Iriſh</hi> began this Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
very early, for in <hi>September</hi> 1649. Coll. <hi>Dungan</hi> writes to the
Lord-Lieutenant, <hi>That</hi> Kelly, (<hi>the Lord of</hi> Antrim'<hi>s Prieſt) was in</hi>
Dublin <hi>with</hi> Cromwell.</p>
                  <p>And to manifeſt that it was not the Popiſh Clergy alone, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
Diſloyal Sentiments, but that even ſome of their Nobility
and greateſt Men, and ſuch as had received both Honour and Eſtate
from the King, did ungratefully plunge themſelves into the ſame
Crimes, I will add the ſubſtance of a Letter from <hi>Thomas Talbot</hi> to
the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> which I have faithfully extracted from the
Original, dated <hi>October</hi> 22. 1650; wherein he writes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That General</hi> Preſton <hi>being at the Lord</hi> Glanmalira'<hi>s, diſcourſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Clergy's Excommunication of all that ſhould obey his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's

Deſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the General, and Sir <hi>James Preſton,</hi> (his Son) after long and
private Diſcourſe with the Biſhop of <hi>Dromore,</hi> imployed Father
<hi>Taylor</hi> to <hi>Ireton,</hi> with many Inſtructions ſigned by <hi>Preſton,</hi> but writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                     <hi>That Sir</hi> James Preſton <hi>at</hi> Banchur <hi>expreſſed much bitterneſs againſt
the King, ſaying,</hi> That he took the Covenant, and Signed a Declaration
againſt the late Peace with the <hi>Iriſh; and wiſhed,</hi> The Devil would take
all thoſe that would Serve His Majeſty, after doing ſo baſe a thing; <hi>and,
that for his part, he would Treat with</hi> Ireton, <hi>and was ſure the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

                  <p>
                     <hi>That the ſaid Sir</hi> James, <hi>after long Diſcourſe with</hi> Terence Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghlan,,
<hi>told Mr.</hi> Talbot, <hi>That</hi> Coughlan thought it Folly not to ſubmit,
and take Conditions; and that he would procure an Aſſembly in <hi>Leinſter,</hi>
to prepare Matters for a Treaty with the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That in the preſence of Lieutenant-Collonel</hi> Cuſack, O Shagneſs'<hi>s
Son:</hi> Florence Mac Carthy, Phillip Roch, <hi>and</hi> John Roch, <hi>at ſeveral
times he ſpoke to the ſame effect; and added,</hi> That he would rather
joyn with the <hi>Turk,</hi> againſt the King, than Serve him, who would ſign
to ſuch a Declaration, and do ſo unworthy a thing againſt the <hi>Iriſh: And
being told, That perhaps the King was forced to it; he replied,</hi> That
is all one, for they who forced him to that, would force him to do more
diſadvantagious Things to this Nation; and therefore the Nation play'd the
Fool, if they did not timely provide for themſelves: <hi>and being demanded</hi>
How could they better themſelves; <hi>he anſwer'd,</hi> That if he cou'd get no
other, he wou'd call in the <hi>Turk: And upon farther Diſcourſe about
the Excommunication Mr.</hi> Mac Carthy, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Roch, <hi>ſaid, That
Lay-men ſhould not judge of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures; and</hi> Talbot
<hi>replying, That every Chriſtian might ſafely obey the Word of
God, in ſubmitting to the King; and alſo uttering ſome words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Biſhop's Excommunication, and thoſe that ſhould obey it,
they told him in</hi> Spaniſh, That they never heard any Man ſpeak ſo much
aginſt the Good of this Nation and Religion as he did.</p>
                  <p>That Sir <hi>James Preſton</hi> correſponds with the Biſhops at <hi>Galway,</hi> and
wrote to them, <hi>That the King has taken the Covenant, and declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Peace;</hi> and ſends them Copies of the Orders and Letters he
receives from the Lord-Lieutenant.</p>
                  <p>That he bragg'd, That he had Credit with <hi>Ireton,</hi> and ſhould have
liberty to tranſport three or four thouſand Men, and often ſaid, That
no Men in the Kingdom were more for an Agreement with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
than his Father and himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So far that Letter.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Thomas Dungan</hi> did alſo certifie, That he heard very Seditious
Diſcourſe from the ſaid Sir <hi>James Preſton;</hi> and particularly, That he
blamed his Excellency <hi>for ſending his Father Orders to ſurrender</hi> Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;
whereas I my ſelf have ſeen General <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Original Letter,

<hi>Anno</hi> 1651, offer to ſubmit to the Parliament, but were refus'd by
<hi>Ireton,</hi> and oppos'd by <hi>Clanrickard.</hi> I have offered all that I think fit
to ſay upon this Subject at this time; except an Account of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Antrim;</hi> which take as follows:</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim,</hi> by his Prieſt <hi>Kelly,</hi> had been intrigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſince his firſt Landing; but from the taking of
<hi>Roſs,</hi> the Correſpondence between them became the more intimate
and effectual: So that on the Ninth of <hi>May</hi> his officious Deſires to
ſerve that Party, prevail'd with him to importune a Conference with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65997:421"/>
Commiſſary General <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with that Biſhop, and Col. <hi>Owen,</hi> the ſubſtance of which
Conference copied from an Original Certificate, under the Hands
of the Commiſſioners, is recited Appendix 49; and the deſign of it
plainly is to aſperſe the Memory of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to juſtifie and encourage his Enemies; and that it was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by <hi>Ireton,</hi> will be manifeſt from the Favours and Kindneſs he
thereupon ſhewed to that Lord.</p>
                  <p>For not long after this Conference, <hi>Antrim</hi> had a Paſs for his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>England,</hi> and an Order from <hi>Ireton,</hi> to go among his Tenants
and levy what Money he could for his Journey; by Vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he raiſed 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and ſo came to <hi>Cheſter, Wedneſday 3. December,</hi>
1650. and ſent two Servants before to <hi>London,</hi> to notifie his coming,
and to ſend a Coach for him to <hi>Barnard</hi> on <hi>Munday</hi> following; he
carried with him a Letter from <hi>Ireton</hi> to <hi>the Council of State,</hi> import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That, He, the Marqueſs of</hi> Antrim, <hi>had done the Parliament Army
ſingular Service ſince the firſt day they came before</hi> Roſs; and ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him to their Favour, to compound for his Eſtate; and the
rather, for that it did not appear, <hi>that he had a hand in the beginning of
the Rebellion;</hi> and adds, that he had Nine Months time given him
to make his compoſition, for two Months of which he was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
from all Suits.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Munday, Decemb.</hi> 9. he came to <hi>Barnard,</hi> and not meeting the
Coach, he poſted to <hi>London,</hi> and came through by-ways to the Earl
of <hi>Newport</hi>'s, where he met with Advertiſement from the Servants
that he ſent before him, <hi>That he was like to find but cold Entertainment
from the Parliament, and that therefore he ſhould immediately return to</hi>
Barnard <hi>till further Notice:</hi> And he did endeavour it, but being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted,
he took up his Lodging at <hi>High-gate;</hi> but before Morning
the Houſe was beſet with the Conſtable and his Aſſiſtants, and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim</hi>
was ſecured; whereof the Parliament being inform'd, they
gave Thanks to the Conſtable for his Diligence, and ordered <hi>Antrim</hi>
to return to <hi>Ireland</hi> within two days; which he accordingly did,
and took ſhipping at <hi>Neſſon, December</hi> 30. without being admitted to
the preſence of the Parliament; and undoubtedly they would have
committed him to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and have us'd him worſe; if it were
not for the regard they had to <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Honour.</p>
                  <p>But it is time to return to the Parliament Forces, which deſpis'd
all oppoſition, and met with incredible Succeſs, <hi>Tecroghan, Hariſtown,
Naas, Ballymore, Ballymallock, Rabridge, Tullo, Athy, Maryburgh,</hi> and
<hi>Caſtle-Dermond,</hi> were without much trouble ſurrendered to <hi>Reynolds</hi>
and <hi>Hewſon;</hi> as was alſo <hi>Carlow</hi> to Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller,</hi> on the 19th
of <hi>August.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Waterford</hi> and <hi>Duncannon</hi> were likewiſe blocked up ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>June,</hi> ſo that General <hi>Preſton,</hi> Governour of <hi>Waterford,</hi>
who was on the Second of <hi>July</hi> created Viſcount <hi>Taragh,</hi> did on
the ſame day ſend a Letter to the Lord-Lieutenant, moſt earneſtly
importuning him for greater Supplies then his Excellency could ſend,
or for leave to ſurrender the City, ſince his Wants were ſo great with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it, that it was impoſſible to keep it; however <hi>Ireton</hi> did not Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the City until the 25th of <hi>July;</hi> and then the Popiſh Clergy
who had been ſuch great Incendiaries, and ſuch violent and obſtinate
Promoters of the War, when they found themſelves in danger, were
the moſt forward of all others to Capitulate, and accordingly after a
Treaty drawn out in length, General <hi>Preſton</hi> did ſurrender <hi>Waterford</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:65997:421"/>
on the 10th day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which was ſoon followed by the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Duncannon,</hi> on the 14th.</p>
                  <p>Nor had Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> and Colonel <hi>Venables</hi> leſs ſucceſs in <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
for they took the ſtrong Fort of <hi>Charlemont</hi> on the day of
and as for the Caſtles and Garriſons of <hi>Inniskilling, Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
Cloghouter, Caſtlejordan, Carlingford, Monaghan,</hi> &amp;c. they made no
conſiderable Reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>Munſter</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Ingolsby</hi> went with a party to block up
<hi>Limerick,</hi> in <hi>July,</hi> and had the good fortune to rout 4000 <hi>Iriſh</hi> that came
to relieve it, whereof 900 were ſlain, and many taken Priſoners;
and Colonel <hi>Phair</hi> in <hi>August</hi> not only diſturbed the Lord <hi>Inſiquin</hi>'s
Levies in <hi>Kerry,</hi> but alſo took in the Caſtle of <hi>Kilmurry,</hi> and was very
troubleſome to the Lords <hi>Roch</hi> and <hi>Muskry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ireton</hi> having refreſhed his Army at <hi>Waterford,</hi> marched through
<hi>Wicklow,</hi> and having taken a prey of 1600 Cows, he ſent Sir <hi>Har
dreſs Waller</hi> with half of them to re-inforce the Blockade of <hi>Limerick;</hi>
and <hi>Waller</hi> in his march did take the ſtrong Caſtles of <hi>Balliglaughan,
Ballycubane,</hi> and <hi>Garygaglan</hi> and on the 9th of <hi>September</hi> ſummoned
<hi>Limerick;</hi> but it was in vain, for the ſame <hi>Hugh O Neil,</hi> that made
the brave Reſiſtance at <hi>Clonmell,</hi> was now Governour of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ireton</hi> himſelf marched on to Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and being joyned
they went to <hi>Athlone,</hi> but the Bridge being broke, and the Town
on <hi>Leinſter</hi> ſide burnt, <hi>Ireton</hi> left <hi>Coot</hi> there, and having in his way
taken two Caſtles in <hi>Mac Coghlan</hi>'s Country, together with <hi>Bir,</hi>
which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had deſerted and burnt, he came before <hi>Limerick;</hi> but
finding the Year too far ſpent, and that <hi>Limerick</hi> could not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
unleſs it were attacked on both ſides the River; he endeavoured
to get <hi>Killaloo</hi> paſs; and ſo having taken <hi>Nenagh, Caſtletown,</hi> and <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maneer,</hi>
he went into Winter-quarters to <hi>Kilkenny</hi> on the 10th of
<hi>November.</hi> In the mean time part of the Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>'s
Forces had retaken <hi>Bir</hi> and the other two Caſtles in <hi>Mac Coghlan</hi>'s
Country, and pretended to relieve <hi>Athlone</hi> if it ſhould be diſtreſſed:
Whereupon Colonel <hi>Axtell,</hi> Govenour of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> being joyned with
the <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Typerary</hi> Forces at <hi>Roſcrea,</hi> encountered them near
<hi>Meleak-Iſland</hi> on the 25th day of <hi>October,</hi> and gave them a ſore
Defeat, killing 1500 Men, and taking 200 Horſe and all their
Baggage.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> not having finiſhed his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
at <hi>Rome,</hi> which I formerly mentioned, continued his Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
of Zeal for Religion, and of concern for the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<hi>Iriſh;</hi> whereupon the Lord <hi>Taaf</hi> (whom <hi>Ormond</hi> had ſent to
the King to get forreign Supplies, if poſſible) finding that the King
was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo that he could not get acceſs to him, made ſuch
importunate Application to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that he procured
the Abbot of <hi>Saint Catharines</hi> with ſome ſmall Supplies to be ſent to
the Clergy and Catholick Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Ireland, (Ormond</hi>
being then in <hi>France;</hi>) This Agent or Ambaſſador landed in the
latter end of <hi>February</hi> 1650, at <hi>Galway,</hi> and as ſoon as he underſtood
that <hi>Clanrickard</hi> was left Lord-Deputy, he gave his Excellency no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his Arrival, and afterwards ſhewed him his Credentials, and
aſſured his Excellency, that the Duke his Maſter had ſo entire an
affection to the King of <hi>England</hi> (the prefervation of whoſe Intereſt
in that Kingdom, was the chief motive to him to offer his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance)
that if he had known any perſon had been intruſted there
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65997:422"/>
with his Majeſty's Authority, he would have Addreſſed himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him and no other; and that he finding his Lordſhip inveſted
with that power, did (what he knew his Maſter expected at his
hands) apply himſelf unto him; with, and by whoſe Directions,
he would alone ſteer himſelf through that Negotiation: He told
him the Duke had already disburſed 6000 Piſtols for the ſupplying
them with thoſe things he heard they ſtood moſt in need of, which
were brought over by a Religious Perſon who came with him, and
that he was ready to be informed of what they would deſire from his
Highneſs, that might enable them to reſiſt their Enemy, and that he
would conſent to any thing that was reaſonable for him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon a Committee of the Commiſſioners of Truſt, and ſome
Prelates was appointed to Treat with him; but as the Abbot varied
from his firſt Propoſals, ſo the Popiſh Clergy did change and very
from the Lord-Deputy's Inſtructions, and turned out ſome of the
Committee who would not comply with them, and put in others in
their room: and though the Lord-Deputy prohibited their further
progreſs in the Treaty upon ſuch dishonourable Terms as the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
now propos'd, yet they would go on to conclude it, and thought
they had excuſed their preſumption well enough by ſaying, <hi>That the
Abbot would not conſent to any other; and that it was better to ſubmit to
hard Conditions, than to break of the Treaty.</hi> Whereupon the Lord.
Deputy was ſo diſguſted that he left the Town, and refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Viſit from this Ambaſſador that had ſo manifeſtly prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from his firſt pretences.</p>
                  <p>By this ſtifneſs in the Lord Deputy, the concluded Treaty va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
into ſmoak; but the Abbot (knowing his Maſter's deſign)
would not totally break off the Correſpondence, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
began to talk more mildly, and as if the Duke would do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
kind things, if Agents were ſent unto him. Which being made
known to the Lord-Deputy, he appointed Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunket</hi> and
<hi>Jeffery Brown,</hi> for that Embaſie, and gave them ſuch Inſtructions as
he thought fit.</p>
                  <p>But the Prelates did not like, that a matter of this importance
ſhould be managed without them; and therefore under pretence of
ſolliciting the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mecklin,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Leige,</hi> and other
Eccleſiaſticks for Aſſiſtance, they<note n="*" place="margin">Epiſcopi &amp; clerus &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti alii precipui nobiles ac Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratus ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um quae Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licis reſtabant. <hi>Vindiciae E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſae 21.

which he did with that Confidence and Raſhneſs that was peculiar
to him, and ſpoiled whatever he meddled with, and particularly
the Negotiation in hand.</p>

with his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> become profitable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and acceptable in the Eyes of God, that you would immediately,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65997:422"/>
with humble hearts, make a Submiſſion unto his Holineſs in the Name of
the <hi>Nation,</hi> and beg the Apoſtolical Benediction, that the Light of Wiſdom,
the Spirit of Fortitude, Victories, Grace, Succeſs, and thoſe Bleſſings of God
we one time enjoyed, may return again to us; The neceſſity of doing this
is the greater, that the<note n="*" place="margin">Clanrickard.</note> Perſon from whom you come with Authority, is for
ſeveral cauſes Excommunicated, <hi>A Jure &amp; Homine,</hi> and is at <hi>Rome</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a great Contemner of the Authority and Dignity of Church-men,
and Perſecutor of my Lord <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and ſome Biſhops and other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
ſome of his own Letter come fair for the proof hereof; you may be
pleaſed to call to mind that he (though much and often moved thereunto)
never joyned with the Confederate Catholiques, until he found the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of bearing down the Pope's <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and had the Lord of <hi>Inſiquin</hi>
(who not long before dyed his hands in the blood of Prieſts and innocent
Souls, in the Church or Rock of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> in <hi>Caſhel</hi>) to cloſe with him
in Society of Army; the Nation hath now no cauſe to joy in that Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of thoſe two Stars. Do you think God will proſper a Contract ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Authority of ſuch a Man (if ſome other way be not found of
reconciling him to us.) That therefore what is prophane may be holy, and what
is rotten ſound, ſay in the Name of the Nation, with the Prodigal Child,
<hi>Surgam &amp; ibo ad Patrem &amp; dicam ei, pater peccavi in Coelum &amp;
coram te;</hi> And even immediately go to his Holineſs's <hi>Inter Nuntio</hi> in this
City, to make this happy Submiſſion, <hi>Quia neſcit tarda Molimina Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Sancti gratia:</hi> This being done, go on chearfully with your Contract
with this most Catholique Prince, who did he rightly know the buſineſs
(without ſuch Submiſſion) would never enter upon a Bargain, to preſerve
or rather reſtore Holy Religion in a Kingdom with Agents bringing their
Authority from a <hi>withered accurſed Hand;</hi> and God will ſend his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

                                 <item>IX. The Duke is not to interpoſe in Adminiſtration of Judicial or

with you, and his long Navigation by the Northern Sea,
having brought much delay as well to his Return, as to the diſpoſal

good People, the Fidelity of whom hath hitherto appeared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reproach, in a time when, it ſeems, they had no other recourſe

the great and urgent neceſſity of my own, I chooſe to prefer your Good before

to the uttermoſt, will remain conſtant in your Intent to Defend Religion and
Country, to a high great hope of your Fortitude. Bear in mind, that the
Succeſs of the Enemies is hitherto permitted by the Providence of God, to

to you and the <hi>Limericians:</hi> As they have performed their part moſt nobly,
I doubt not, but when the Occaſion of promoting the Cauſe is offered, you

In the mean time, leaſt the delay of ſupply, which proceeded of the

my Mind, while with all Care and Diligence to provide and ſend them Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,

                              <p>I Had the Honour on the 12th of this Inſtant to receive a Letter
from your Highneſs, dated the 10th of <hi>September,</hi> wherein you
are pleaſed to expreſs your great Zeal for the Advancement of the
Catholick Religion in this Kingdom, your great Affection to the
King my Maſter, and your good Opinion of this Nation, and your
compaſſion for their Sufferings, and your great readineſs to afford
them Aid and Aſſiſtance, even equal with your own neareſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments;
and that your Highneſs received ſo great ſatisfaction
from the Queen, and Duke of <hi>York,</hi> as did much ſtrengthen thoſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65997:425"/>
Reſolutions, ſo as they might ſooner appear, but for the ſtay made
here of Monſieur St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> and his long Northern Voyage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his return, and referred what concern'd the Agreement, to the
relation of thoſe Commiſſioners I had imployed to your Highneſs,
to treat upon that ſubject of Aſſiſtance and Relief for this Kingdom.
I with much alacrity congratulate your Highneſs's pious Intentions, for
the preſervation of the Catholick Religion, your Great and Princely
Care to recover His Majeſty's Rights and Intereſts, from his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and the high Obligation you put upon this
Nation, by your tender regard of them, and deſire to redeem them
from the great Miſeries and Afflictions they have endured, and the
imminent Dangers they are in: And it ſhall be a principal part of my
Ambition, to be an uſeful Inſtrument to ſerve your Highneſs in ſo
Famous and Glorious an Enterprize. And that I may be the more
capable to contribute ſomewhat to ſo Religious and Juſt Ends;
Firſt in diſcharge of my Conſcience towards God, my Duty to the
King my Maſter, and to diſabuſe your Highneſs, and give a clear
and perfect Information, ſo far as comes to my Knowledge, I am
obliged to repreſent unto your Highneſs, that by the Title of the
Agreement, and Articles therein contained, made by thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
imployed to your Highneſs,<note place="margin">☞</note> and but lately come into
my hands, they have violated the Truſt repoſed in them, by having
caſt off, and declined the Commiſſion and Inſtructions they had
from me, in the King my Maſter's behalf, and all other Powers,
that cou'd by any other means be derived from him, and pretend
to make an Agreement with your Highneſs, in the Name of the
Kingdom and People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for which they had not, nor could
have any warrantable Authority; and have abuſed your Highneſs,
by a counterfeit ſhew of a private Inſtrument, fraudulently procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and ſigned (as I am informed) by ſome inconſiderable and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
Perſons, ill-affected to His Majeſty's Authority, without any
knowledge or conſent of the generality of the Nation, or Perſons
of greateſt Quality or Intereſt therein, and who under a ſeeming
zeal and pretence of Service to your Highneſs, labour more to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their private Ambition, then the advantage of Religion or the
Nation, or the proſperous Succeſs of your Highneſs's generous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings;
and to manifeſt the clearneſs of mine own Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and make ſuch deceitful Practices more apparent, I ſend your
Highneſs herewith an Authentick Copy of my Inſtructions, which
accompanied their Commiſſion, when I imployed them to your
Highneſs, as a ſufficient evidence to convince them. And having
thus fully manifeſted their breach of Publick Truſt, I am obliged in
the King my Maſter's Name, to proteſt againſt their unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proceedings, and to declare all the Agreements and Acts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
concluded by thoſe Commiſſioners, to be void and illegal,
being not derived from, or conſonant to His Majeſty's Authority,
being in Duty bound thus far to vindicate the King my Maſter's
Honour and Authority, and to preſerve his juſt and undoubted
Rights from ſuch deceitful and rebellious Practices; as likewiſe, with
an humble and reſpective Care, to prevent thoſe prejudices that
might befal your Highneſs, in being deluded by counterfeit ſhews,
in doing you greater Honour, where it is apparent that any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
laid upon ſuch falſe and ill-grounded Principles, as have
been ſmoothly digeſted and fixed upon that Nation, as their deſire
and requeſt, muſt overthrow all thoſe Heroick and Prince like

Acts, your Highneſs hath propoſed to your ſelf, for God's Glory

of his diſtreſſed Kingdom, which would at length fall into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
Broils and Diviſions, if not forcibly driven into deſperation;
I ſhall now with a hopeful and cheerful importunity upon a clear
ſcore, free from thoſe Deceits, propoſe to your Highneſs, that for
advancement of all thoſe great Ends you aim at, and in the King
my Maſter's behalf, and in the Name of all the Loyal Catholick
Subjects in this Nation, and for the preſervation of thoſe important
cautionary Places, that are Security for your Highneſs's paſt and
preſent Disburſements, you will be pleaſed to quicken and haſten
thoſe Aids and Aſſiſtances, you intended for the Relief of <hi>Ireland;</hi>
and I have with my whole Power, and through the greateſt Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
ſtriven to defend them for you, and to preſerve all other
Ports, that may be at all times, of Advantage and Safe-guard to your
Fleets and Men of War, having yet many good Harbours left;
and alſo engage in the King my Maſter's Name, for whatſoever
may prove to your Satisfaction, that is any way conſiſtent with
his Honour and Authority, and have made my Applications to the
Queen's Majeſty, and my Lord-Lieutenant (the King being in
<hi>Scotland</hi>) further to agree confirm and ſecure whatſoever may be of
advantage to your Highneſs; and if the laſt Galliot had but
brought 10000 <hi>l.</hi> for this inſtant time,<note place="margin">☜</note> it would have contributed
more to the Recovery of this Kingdom, than far greater Sums
delayed, by enabling our Forces to meet together, for the Relief
of <hi>Limerick,</hi> which cannot but be in great diſtreſs after ſo long a
Siege, and which, if loſt, (although I ſhall endeavour to prevent
it) will coſt much Treaſure to be regained. And if your Highneſs
will be pleaſed to go on chearfully, freely, and ſeaſonably, with this
great Work, I make no queſtion but God will give ſo great a bleſſing
thereto, as that myſelf, and all the Loyal Subjects of this Kingdom,
may ſoon and juſtly proclaim, and leave recorded to Poſterity, that

or diverted from this generous Enterprize, by the Malice
or Invectives of any ill-affected, it is a neceſſary Duty in me, to
repreſent unto your Highneſs, that the Biſhop of <hi>Ferns</hi> (who as I

and fomenting all theſe Diviſions and Differences that have
rent aſunder this Kingdom, the Introduction to our preſent Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and weak Condition: And that your Highneſs may clearly

ſlipt by them over the <hi>Curlew</hi> Mountains, and came to <hi>Athlone,</hi>
which he quickly took, as he did alſo <hi>Portumna</hi> ſoon after; ſo that
they had two good Paſſes over the <hi>Shenin;</hi> and in the mean time
<hi>Ireton</hi> with the main Body of the Army forced <hi>Killalow</hi>-paſs, and
then marched down to <hi>Limerick,</hi> and there he entrenched his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and laid a formal and regular Siege to that City.</p>
                  <p>And it is ſtrange that a Town that was ſo obſtinate and wilful
that it refuſed to receive the Lord-Deputy (<hi>Clanrickard</hi>) and good
part of his Forces into their Walls for their Defence, as it did the
Lord-Lieutenant heretofore, was nevertheleſs ſo puſillanimous and
cowardly to talk of ſurrendring as ſoon as the Enemy appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it; ſo that almoſt every day Letters were intercepted, import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That if they were not ſpeedily relieved, the Commonalty would force
them to Capitulate.</hi> And at laſt they did give it up at a time of Year
that of itſelf would have raiſed the Siege, if they had had patience;
and they alſo did it upon the hardeſt Conditions of any City in the
Kingdom; however, we muſt do that right to the Governour and
moſt part of the Garriſon, to own, that they were no way guilty of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65997:426"/>
that Baſeneſs, but bravely rejected the favourable Offers that were
made to them by the Enemy at the beginning of the Siege.</p>
                  <p>About the firſt of <hi>July Ireton</hi> took the Caſtle on the <hi>Weare</hi> which
the Warders deſerted, and betook themſelves to the River; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were continually ſhot at by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they came on ſhore
in two parties, the one to the <hi>West</hi> ſide where Colonels <hi>Tuthil</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
was, a Captain whereof promiſed them Quarter; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
they were by <hi>Tuthil</hi>'s order ſtript and knockt in the head;
whereat <hi>Ireton</hi> was ſo enraged, that he cauſed <hi>Tuthil</hi> to be tried by
a Council of War; and though he excuſed it by his Opinion, <hi>That
an Inferiour Officer had no power to give Quarter, whilst his Superiour
was upon the place.</hi> Yet both he and his Enſign were Caſhier'd:
And when <hi>Ireton</hi> underſtood that the other party of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that
landed on the <hi>East</hi> ſide in Colonel <hi>Ingolsby</hi>'s Quarters, had been
kindly uſed, and not ſo much as ſtript, he diſmiſt them <hi>Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Exchange or Ranſom, and ſent them into the City with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Meſſage, expreſſing his Deteſtation of breach of Faith, and
offering what farther Satisfaction they deſired; but they were very
well pleaſed with the Juſtice he had ſo generouſly done them, and ſo
that matter ended. But <hi>Ireton</hi> preſt on the Siege with great dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and vigour, and the Governour as valiantly defended the
City; ſo that when <hi>Ireton</hi> had taken the Bridge, that Conqueſt was
made unuſeful to him by breaking down two Arches at the other
end; whereupon <hi>Ireton</hi> endeavoured to poſſeſs the Iſland, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
eleven Boats and a float to that purpoſe; but it did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
according to his deſign, for the Float proved too ſhort, ſo that
all the Men but ſeven that landed out of the firſt five Boats, were
ſlain or drowned before any of their Companions could come to
aſſiſt them.</p>
                  <p>However, <hi>Ireton</hi> reſolved to take the Town, and was in hopes
that want of Victuals might force it to ſurrender in time; but the
danger was, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> might relieve it before he could reduce it
to Extremity; and therefore to prevent that, he form'd an Army
Volant under the Lord of <hi>Broghill,</hi> out of his, <hi>Ingolsby</hi>'s, <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s,
and <hi>Henry Cromwell</hi>'s Regiments of Horſe, and twenty ſix Companies
of Foot; and though that Lord deſired to have none but Horſe
and Dragoons for Expedition ſake, yet <hi>Ireton</hi> obliged him to take
Foot alſo, becauſe of the Woods and Faſtneſſes the Enemy might
lurk in.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe Reputation ought highly to be conſidered at all
times, but more eſpecially in the beginning of Military Actions, the
Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> did proceed with all the Briskneſs and Expedition that
a brave and a vigilant Captain was capable of, and in few days
came ſo near the Enemy, that they could perceive each other Fires,
they being three Mile on the <hi>South,</hi> and he three Mile on the <hi>North</hi>
ſide of the <hi>Black-water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army were double his number of Horſe, and thrice as
many Foot as the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> nevertheleſs <hi>Broghill</hi> paſſed the River
early in the morning, and met with ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentlemen that were
under Protection, and told him they came thither out of Curioſity,
becauſe of a Prophecy amongſt them, <hi>That the last Battle in</hi> Ireland
<hi>ſhould be at</hi> Knocknaclaſhy; and they ſuppoſed if ever it would
happen, it would be now, ſince both Armies were ſo near. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> asked them, Who was to have the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65997:427"/>
by their Prophecy; they ſhook their heads and ſaid, <hi>The
Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon that Lord marched to <hi>Knocknaclaſhy,</hi> and the Enemy
retiring, he marched back again over it towards the place where he
intended to Quarter: And then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fell upon his Rear; ſo that
the Battle did at laſt happen in that very place the <hi>Iriſh-men</hi> ſpoke of
in the morning.</p>
                  <p>It was very ſtrange that it ſhould ſo fall out, that the Budge-Barrels
of both Armies were accidentally burnt at the beginning of the
Fight; but it ſeems that this did not diſcourage either Party, but
that they fought ſtoutly, Horſe-head to Horſe-head, hacking and
hewing with their Swords when they had ſpent their Shot: In fine,
the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> in the right Wing routed the left Wing of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
whilſt Major <hi>Wallis</hi> in the left Wing valiantly made good his
ground, but a freſh party of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had like to put the Victory in
diſpute, till <hi>Broghill</hi> bid his Men cry, <hi>They run, they run;</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt Rank of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> lookt back, and thoſe behind ſeeing
their faces, thought they were running indeed, and ſo all that party
fled.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> once again bid fair to recover the day, by
means of a ſtand of Pikes which ſtood ſo firm, that it was a long
time before they could be broken, but at laſt they were forced in
their Angles, and the whole Army was routed, and very many of
them killed, by reaſon of a fierce and vigorous Purſuit which laſted
till night.</p>
                  <p>There are many things obſervable of this Battle, beſides what is
already mentioned, 1. That it was the laſt Battle that was fought in
that War, according to the <hi>Iriſh-mens</hi> Prophecy. 2. It was as fair a
day both before and after the Fight, as ever was known, but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the time of the Conflict there was as great a Storm of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Lightning, and Rain, as had hapned in many Years before.
3. That amongſt the Baggage were taken a Peck full of Charms;
ſome of which had it thus written upon them, <hi>This is the print of our
Lady's Foot, and whoever wears it, and ſays twenty</hi> Ave Maries, <hi>ſhall be
free from Gun-ſhot:</hi> And the like Charms were to free them from
Pike or Sword, as the party deſired it. And laſtly, that a bold
Horſe of the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi>'s being 'twice wounded in this Battle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
afterwards ſo cowardly, that he was fit for nothing but the
Coach.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis time to return to <hi>Ireton,</hi> who ſignified his Joy at this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
by three Vollies of Shot throughout his Camp: Nevertheleſs,
he found no likelihood of taking the City, but on the contrary,
received many brisk Sallies from them, in one of which they ſlew
three hundred of his Men; ſo that probably he had gone without
it for that Year, if the Town's Men who had been always muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
had not continued in the ſame humour ſtill, and preſſed for a
Parly: Whereupon the Clergy threatned to Excommunicate them
if they offered to Treat with the Enemy, which in effect was
they ſaid, <hi>To give up the Prelates to be ſlaughtered:</hi> And they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
fix a perpetual Interdict upon the Church-doors and other
publique places; but alaſs thoſe Fulminations had been too looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and impertinently uſed, to retain any vertue now in time of
need: So that without any regard to them, Colonel <hi>Fennell</hi> ſeized
on St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gate, and the Mayor ſupplied him with Powder, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65997:427"/>
countenanced him in the reſolution <hi>to give up that Post to the Enemy,
unleſs the Garriſon would conſent to Capitulate:</hi> In fine, they did on the
29th day of <hi>October</hi> ſurrender that ſtrong and important City upon
ſevere Articles, wherein the Governour, the Biſhop of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and
twelve more were excepted by Name, as to Life, and ſome of them,
particularly the Biſhop of <hi>Emly</hi> and Alderman <hi>Dominick Fanning,</hi>
were executed: it was computed, that they loſt 5000 People in the
City during the Siege, moſtly by the Plague and other Sickneſs:
nevertheleſs, after the ſurrender, there marched out 1300 Souldiers,
and there ſtill remained in the City 4000 <hi>Iriſh-men</hi> able to bear
Arms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Limerick</hi> being thus taken, and Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> being made
Governour of the City, <hi>Ireton</hi> on the Fourth of <hi>November</hi> march'd
towards <hi>Galway,</hi> and being joyn'd with Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> they took
<hi>Clare,</hi> from whence <hi>Ireton</hi> ſent a Meſſage to the Town of <hi>Galway,</hi>
offering them good Conditions if they ſubmit without putting him
to farther trouble, and ſeverely threatning them if they refuſed the
proffered Articles, and it is probable theſe Comminations might
have made impreſſions upon them if <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Death, which hapned
at <hi>Limerick</hi> on the Twenty-ſixth of <hi>November,</hi> had not given them
reſpite.</p>
                  <p>But it muſt not be forgotten, that during the Siege of <hi>Limerick</hi> Sir
<hi>Charles Coot</hi> encountered a Party of <hi>Fitz-Patrick</hi>'s and O <hi>Dwir</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that had retaken <hi>Meleke</hi> Iſland, and tho' they behav'd themſelves
ſo well, that they bafled his Foot two or three times, yet by the
bravery of his Horſe he worſted them at laſt, and killed and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
300 of them, and made the ſame Number accept of Quarter for
Life.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ireton</hi> being dead, the Parliament Commiſſioners at <hi>Dublin</hi>
appointed Lieutenant-General <hi>Ludlow</hi> Commander in Chief of the
Army, until further Order ſhould be taken in <hi>England</hi> in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And in the mean time Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> blockt up <hi>Galway</hi> at a
diſtance, and when <hi>Ludlow</hi> came to him, they drew ſo near, that
the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> which ſat there, did, in <hi>February,</hi> importune the Lord
Deputy to permit them to Treat with the Enemy about Conditions
for the Settlement of the Nation; proteſting, That they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon advantagious and profitable Terms, but the Lord-Deputy
knowing it was more proper for him, than for them to Treat for the
Nation, did on the Fourteenth of <hi>February</hi> write to the Commander
in Chief of the Parliament's Forces upon that ſubject; but he had no
grateful Reply, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being reſolv'd <hi>not to admit any Treaty for
the Nation in general,</hi> but thoſe that would Capitulate, ſhould do it
onely for themſelves, or the Towns and Places they reſpectively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
unto.</p>
                  <p>The Year 1652, began with the Surrender of <hi>Galway</hi> to Sir <hi>Charles
Coot,</hi> which happened on the Twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> before any Storm or
Aſſault was attempted, and without conſulting the Lord-Deputy tho'
he was within half a days Journey of the place, but indeed they had
better Conditions than they could have had, if the Parliaments Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
had been made acquainted with the matter; and perhaps
there was reaſon for it, becauſe the Town was exceeding ſtrong,
and the loſs thereof carried with it the Fate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Rebellion; for what little Conteſts happened
from henceforward, do hardly deſerve the Name of <hi>A Tory War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65997:428"/>
                     <hi>Roſcomon</hi> and <hi>James-Town</hi> were Surrendered to Col. <hi>Reynolds</hi> on
the 27th of <hi>April,</hi> and in <hi>Munſter</hi> there was not a Garriſon left them,
but <hi>Roſs</hi> in the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> which being a Caſtle in an Iſland
was thought impregnable; but <hi>Ludlow</hi> cauſed a ſmall Ship to be
made, and had it carried over the Mountains, and ſet a float in the
Lough, at the ſight of which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſo aſtoniſh'd, that they
yielded up the place on the 27th of <hi>June;</hi> and <hi>Inchylough</hi> was alſo
ſurrendered to Col. <hi>Zanky</hi> on the firſt of <hi>August;</hi> and about the
ſame time the Lords of <hi>Weſtmeath</hi> and <hi>Muskry, O Connor Roe,</hi> Sir
<hi>William Dungan,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Talbot,</hi> and others, ſubmitted upon theſe
Conditions,<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                     <hi>That they ſhould abide a Tryal for the Murders committed in
the beginning of the Rebellion, and thoſe that onely aſſiſted in the War were
to forfeit two Thirds of their Eſtates, and be Baniſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And tho' the Lord-Deputy did on the 16th of <hi>May</hi> take <hi>Balliſhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and the Caſtle of <hi>Donegal,</hi> yet both thoſe places, together with
<hi>Sligo,</hi> and <hi>Ballymote,</hi> were ſoon regain'd by <hi>Coot</hi> and <hi>Venables,</hi> and
the Lord-Deputy forc'd to ſhelter himſelf in the Iſle of <hi>Carrick,</hi> and
having no part to friend, nor any Party he could truſt, he alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon very honourable Conditions, <hi>Of not having any Oath
impoſed upon him, and of having liberty to tranſport 3000 Men into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of any Prince in Amity with</hi> England: And ſo on the 16th of
<hi>March</hi> he was tranſported to <hi>England,</hi> in a Parliament Ship, and not
long after died in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time Col. <hi>Charles Fleetwood,</hi> who had married <hi>Ireton</hi>'s
Widdow, was made Commander in chief of the Forces in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
he landed in the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> and found the Military Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Kingdom in a manner finiſh'd; ſo that what remain'd
to manage were the Civil Affairs, which were committed to him,
and the reſt of the Commiſſioners of Parliament: And they began
their Adminiſtration of thoſe Matters by Erecting a High Court of
Juſtice, to try thoſe that were accus'd of the barbarous Murders
committed in this Rebellion. The firſt Court of this ſort that was
held in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was upon the 4th of <hi>October,</hi> at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<hi>Donelan</hi> Preſident, and Commiſſary-General <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<hi>Cook</hi> Aſſiſtants; and it ſat in the ſame place where the Supream
Council us'd to ſit, <hi>Anno</hi> 1642. Afterwards the like Court was held
at <hi>Dublin,</hi> before the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Lowther,</hi> and others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
there Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal</hi> was tryed, condemned, and executed; and
it is obſervable, that being urged both at his Tryal, and Execution
to diſcover the Commiſſion he had from the King, for the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of 1641, and that he ſhould be pardoned both for Life and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate;
he confeſs'd in both places, That he had no ſuch Commiſſion;
but that he took the Seal from a Patent he found at <hi>Charlemont,</hi> and
fixed it to a Commiſſion he had cauſed to be written in the King's
Name, and that <hi>Michael Harriſon</hi> (then preſent in Court, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the ſame) was the perſon that ſticht the Cord or Label of the
Seal, with Silk of the ſame colour.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Commiſſions iſſued in the Name of <hi>the Commiſſioners of the
Commonwealth of</hi> England, <hi>for the Affairs in</hi> Ireland; and that for
<hi>Conaught</hi> bore date the 17th day of <hi>December</hi> 1652, and was ſigned
by <hi>Fleetwood, Ludlow,</hi> and <hi>Jones,</hi> and was directed to Sir <hi>Charles Coot,
Peter Stubbers, Humphry Hurd, Francis Gore, John Desborough, Thomas
Davis, Robert Ormsby, Robert Clerk, Charles Holeroft, John Eyre, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Staples,</hi> and others; but I mention theſe becauſe they ſat upon the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65997:428"/>
Tryal of the Lord of <hi>Mayo,</hi> which began the 30th of <hi>December,</hi> and
ended the 12th of <hi>January,</hi> at which time he was condemned by
the Vote of ſeven of the Commiſſioners, <hi>Gore, Davis, Clerk,</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi>
diſſenting; and accordingly he was ſhot to Death on the 15th.
But his Caſe being variouſly reported, it will be convenient to give
a faithful account of it as it appeared upon the Tryal, which was
thus:</p>
                  <p>Upon the Surrender of <hi>Caſtlebar</hi> which was beſieged by the
old Lord of <hi>Mayo,</hi> and the Priſoner (then Sir <hi>Tib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t Burk</hi>) it
was agreed by Articles, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould march away with
their Arms, and be ſafely convoyed to <hi>Galway;</hi> and though they
were deprived of their Arms contrary to the Articles, yet the Lord
of <hi>Mayo</hi> and his Son (the Priſoner) with their Followers, conveyed
them ſafely to <hi>Ballynecarrow,</hi> and the next day to <hi>Ballinroab,</hi> and the
third day to <hi>The Neal,</hi> where they left Sir <hi>Henry Bingham,</hi> on pretence
of his being ſick, but as was ſuſpected, to preſerve him from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
Maſſacre, the fourth day they came to <hi>Kinlagh,</hi> and the next
day to <hi>Shrule</hi> (which it ſeems was two Mile out of the Road to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>)
there they lodged that night, and the next morning on the
13th of <hi>February</hi> 1641, an Ambuſh was laid on the other ſide of the
Bridge, which as ſoon as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got over the Bridge, fell upon
them, and by the help of the Convoy, murdered about fourſcore of
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Proteſtant Biſhop of <hi>Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     </hi> and a few others only
eſcaping.</p>
                  <p>This matter of fact was thus proved, Four Witneſſes ſwore that
the Priſoner was preſent at this Maſſacre, and did not oppoſe it, and
that the Convoy were the Murtherers, and that the Lord <hi>Mayo</hi>'s Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterers,
Servants and Followers were of that number; and it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the Lord <hi>Mayo</hi> (the Father) engaged by Capitulation to
Convey the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſafe to <hi>Galway,</hi> and that they were diſarmed by
his Command, and ſome of them were Plundered and Stript by the
way by the Convoy; and could get no redreſs from the Priſoner or
his Father; that the Convoy pricked forward the <hi>Engliſh</hi> over the
Bridge towards the Murderers; and the old Lord <hi>Mayo</hi> went to a
little Hill hard by to look on; that the Priſoner was ſeen to come
over the Bridge from the Murtherers after ſeveral <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> had
been killed, and had been actually amongſt them with his Sword
drawn; that the Father refuſed to Convoy them any farther than
<hi>Shrule;</hi> and that the Priſoner was the firſt Man that entered <hi>Caſtlebar</hi>
after the Capitulation. And the ſubſtance of the Priſoner's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
was, That he had no Command of the Party, but with two
Servants only came to attend his Father; that on the Outcry, he
went over the Bridge, and drew his Sword with deſign to preſerve
the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but being ſhot at by one of the Murderers, he got a
Horſe, having lent his own to the Biſhop of <hi>Killalla</hi> to make his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
and rode away before the Murther was commited, and if he
had not fled, he had been killed himſelf; and that he was kind to
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and preſerved many of them both before and after; and
that the Proteſtant Biſhop of <hi>Killalla</hi> had declared, That he believed
this Action was done in ſpight to the Priſoner, and by Letter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged
his Civility to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, the like High Courts of Juſtice were held at <hi>Cork,
Waterford,</hi> &amp;c. but ſo many of the Murtherers had been deſtroyed
by the Sword and the Peſtilence, that not above two hundred ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by the hands of the common Executioner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65997:429"/>
In the mean time, on the 12th of <hi>August,</hi> they paſſed in <hi>England</hi>
an Act for the ſettling of <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
the Proteſtant Biſhop of <hi>Derry,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Roſcomon,</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Inſiquin,</hi> were by name excepted from Pardon for Life or Eſtate, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with many others therein named, that were guilty of the
firſt Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we are come to the Year 1653, wherein I cannot find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that looks like War, and yet it was the 26th day of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
before it was declared, <hi>That the Rebels were ſubdued, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
appeaſed and ended.</hi> Whereupon they immediately proceeded
to the Diſtribution of Lands to the Souldiers for their Arrears, and

LETTER
To the AUTHOR of the
Hiſtory of Ireland,
CONTAINING
A Brief Account of the Tranſactions in that
Kingdom, ſince 1653.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Do very well approve of your reſolution to cloſe the Second Part
of your Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the end of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion;
for, beſides that it is impoſſible for you, at this diſtance from the
Records and Council-Books in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to give ſo full and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
an Account of that Kingdom, from 1653 forwards, as you
have given of the time before, it is certain that the Intrigues of the
<hi>Acts of Settlement,</hi> and <hi>Court of Claims,</hi> the Tranſactions in the late
Reign, and the preſent ſtupendious Revolution, will afford matter
more than enough for another Volume; nor indeed can your Hiſtory
be ſo compleat as I expect it will be, if it were cloſed with any thing
leſs than the Glorious Iſſue of the preſent War.</p>
                  <p>However, I do not offer this to excuſe my ſelf from communicating
to you ſuch Obſervations as I have made: On the contrary, I have
herewith ſent you what I have already collected; and will, as often
as you deſire, impart to you whatever ſhall fall under my Notice or
Obſervation, that is pertinent to your purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Interval between the end of the War, and <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Death,
affords but little matter for an Hiſtorian; for it was a time of profound
Peace, and ſpent in ſetting out of Lands, ſetling of Titles, in Building
and Improvements, and in tranſplanting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> into <hi>Connaught,</hi> and
impoſing the <hi>Engagement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Government was managed by Commiſſioners of Parliament,
viz. <hi>Charles Fleetwood,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Army; <hi>Edmond
Ludlow,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Horſe; <hi>Miles Corbet, John Jones,</hi>
and <hi>John Weaver,</hi> Eſquires; but the Army was under the ſole Conduct
of <hi>Fleetwood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>November</hi> 1653. the Commiſſioners of Delinquency ſate at<hi>Athlone,</hi>
to determine the Qualifications of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> for Tranſplantation into
<hi>Connaught,</hi> and they continued eight Months, but did not diſpatch Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
as was expected, and therefore Judg <hi>Cook</hi> was fain to ſupply
their Defect; and ſome of the other Commiſſioners removed to <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reogh,</hi>
to ſet out Lands to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> purſuant to <hi>Cook</hi>'s Decrees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65997:430"/>
But in <hi>Anno 1654. Fleetwood</hi> was made Lord Deputy, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
until <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1655. and then <hi>Henry Cromwell</hi> was made Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in Chief of the Army, and in the Civil Government <hi>Matthew
Thomlinſon, Miles Corbet,</hi> and <hi>Robert Goodwin,</hi> were in Commiſſion
with him; and to them Mr. <hi>Steel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the Chancellor, was afterwards
added.</p>
                  <p>And it was in the year 1655. that the Civil Authority (which had
been diſcontinued in <hi>Cork</hi> ſince the year 1644.) was revived, and
Sir <hi>William <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Maurice Roch, Chriſtopher Oliver, John Morly, John
Hodder,</hi> and other ancient Freemen of the City, met, and elected
<hi>John Hodder</hi> Mayor, and <hi>William Hodder</hi> and <hi>Philip Matthews</hi> She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs.</p>
                  <p>And in the ſame year the City and County of <hi>Londonderry</hi> were reſtored
to <hi>the Society of the Governour and Aſſiſtants of</hi> London, <hi>of the new Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in</hi> Ulſter <hi>within the Realm of</hi> Ireland; this County being the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
Eſtate of <hi>O Cahan,</hi> and other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Septs, was by King <hi>James</hi>
granted to this <hi>Society,</hi> under certain Covenants of Improvement;
whereupon they laid out vaſt Sums of Money in the Management of
that Plantation, by building <hi>Derry, Colerain,</hi> and twelve Mannor-houſes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. they were proſecuted in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of breach of Articles, and their Eſtates ſequeſtred; and <hi>Anno</hi> 1637.
Sir <hi>Thomas Fotherly</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Whitfield</hi> were Commiſſioned by the
King to make new Leaſes thereof: And tho there did paſs a Vote of
Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. to null the Decree of the <hi>Star-Chamber;</hi> yet,
by reaſon of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion following ſo ſoon after, they were not
reſtored until this year; but <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. King <hi>Charles</hi> II. gave a new
Charter to this Society, under which it flouriſhed till of late.</p>
                  <p>But, to proceed: After <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Death, the new Protector made his
Brother <hi>Henry Cromwell</hi> Lord Lieutenant, and ſo he continued until
the 7th of <hi>May</hi> 1659. and then the Parliament ſent over <hi>Ludlow, Jones,
Thomlinſon, Corbet,</hi> and <hi>Berry,</hi> to Govern that Kingdom; but <hi>Ludlow</hi>
returned in <hi>September,</hi> ſo that he was not in <hi>Ireland</hi> when the following
Revolution happened.</p>
                  <p>For the People being weary of ſo many Alterations and Changes,
and deſpiſing the Unſteadineſs of the Government, were generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the King's Reſtauration: And this humour being fomented,
and diſcreetly managed, centred in what they deſired: The Lords of
<hi>Montgomery</hi> and <hi>Broghall,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> Captain <hi>Robert Fitz-Gerald;</hi>
Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> Sir <hi>Oliver Saint-George,</hi> Sir <hi>Awdly Mervin,</hi> Collonel
<hi>Mark Trevor,</hi> Collonel <hi>Warren,</hi> and ſeveral others, were concerned in
this Affair;<note place="margin">January 1659.</note> They ſurpriz'd the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> in it; and
they ſeized on <hi>Corbet</hi> and <hi>Thomlinſon</hi> at a Conventicle in St. <hi>Warbert-ſtreet;</hi>
and they forced or perſuaded Major-General Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi>
to comply, and ſo they declared for a Free Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The Government being thus in the hands of the Army, was mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by a Committee, or Council of Officers, who, upon the Petition
of the <note n="a" place="margin">Alderman <hi>Dee.</hi>
                     </note>Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>Dublin,</hi> did (as they had before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd)
ſummon a <hi>Convention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this time the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> were come to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
and they projected to ſuſpend the Convention until they had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell'd
the Army to their mind, and got rid of Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller:</hi> But
he ſuſpecting their Deſign, ſeized upon the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin;</hi> ſo that
they were fain to beſiege him, and in five days forced him to ſurrender;
and then they ſent Him, <hi>Jones, Thomlinſon,</hi> and <hi>Corbet,</hi> Priſoners to
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65997:430"/>
But the Victorious Confederates were like to Claſh amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
one Party being for Articling with the King for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Eſtates of Adventurers and Soldiers; and the other Party
being for His Majeſties Reſtoration without any previous Condition;
but at length they agreed in this latter Sentiment, and the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
met on the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> Sir <hi>James Barry</hi> being their Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                  <p>Their firſt Act was to order a Faſt and Humiliation for their Sins,
amongſt which the Murder of the King was Enumerated, and all their
Actions were ſuitable to this beginning; ſo that they ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with <hi>England, which ſhould be moſt forward in Reſtoring the
King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> The Council of Officers publiſhed their
Memorable Declaration, for a full and free Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the
Re-admiſſion of the Secluded Members in the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And purſuant to it, the Convention publiſhed a Declaration on the
12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, and afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> the 14<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>May,</hi> they accepted of His Majeſties Declaration of the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi>
from <hi>Breda,</hi> and cheerfully concurr'd to His Reſtoration.</p>
                  <p>And as ſoon as this was done, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, who had fat ſtill all
this while, and contributed nothing to this great Revolution, thought
to reap all the Benefit of other Mens Merits; inſomuch; that ſeveral
of them took Poſſeſſion of their former Eſtates; and this Grievance was
ſo general, that the Convention was neceſſitated on the 20<hi>th</hi> day of
<hi>May,</hi> 1660. to iſſue a Declaration for preſerving the Peace, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Poſſeſſions; and on the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> His Majeſty in <hi>England</hi> iſſued
a Proclamation to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>This Convention gave His Majeſty 20000<hi>l.</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi> 4000<hi>l.</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> 2000<hi>l.</hi> and then leaving a ſtanding Committee
to Govern the Nation, Adjourn'd till the firſt day of <hi>November</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>On the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> His Majeſty be Letter approv'd of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi>
and ſo on the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>January</hi> it met again; Sir <hi>William Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>
being Chairman, and ſo continued until its Diſſolution in <hi>May,</hi>
1661.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Government was in the Hands of Sir <hi>Charles
Coot,</hi> and Major <hi>William Bury,</hi> who were ſided Commiſſioners of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,

day of <hi>December,</hi> 1660. as the Earl of <hi>Orrery</hi> alſo was on the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
following: Their Inſtructions were very ſhort, and to this effect.
1. To read their Commiſſion, and Swear thoſe Named for Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors.
2. To appoint Sheriffs and Juſtices of Peace, by Advice of the
Council, and to Open the Courts of Juſtice. 3. To promote Peace and

Laſtly, To cauſe the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to be

                  <p>And on the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1660. Dr. <hi>Michael Boyle,</hi> now Lord
Primate of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Eleven others, were Conſecrated Biſhops
in St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> with great Ceremony and Formality,
which I the rather mention, becauſe ſo numerous an Ordination of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in one Day, hath rarely, if ever been heard of, either before or
ſince.</p>
                  <p>On the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> a Parliament was Summoned, and Dr. <hi>Bramhall,</hi>
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> was Speaker of the Houſe of Lords, as Sir
<hi>Audley Mervin</hi> was of the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                  <p>This Parliament, as a Teſtimony of their Gratitude and Affection
to the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> did preſent his Grace with a Gift of 30000<hi>l.</hi>
and when the Lords-Juſtices, and Council, underſtood that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
on the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1661. had appointed the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>
to be Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they ordered all publick Expreſſions
of Joy to be made in <hi>Dublin,</hi> upon that happy Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>January</hi> the 14<hi>th,</hi> 1661. the Lord Chancellor, and Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi>
were Sworn Lords Juſtices on the Death of the Earl of <hi>Montrath,</hi> which
happened the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> And on the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1662, they
Publiſhed an Indulgence to Diſſenters, and continued in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
until the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1662. at which time <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
was ſworn Lord Lieutenant.</p>
                  <p>But the Seſſion of Parliament begun the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and on the
15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the Bill of Settlement paſſed into an Act in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> by which Act, and the reſt of the Statutes paſſed
that Parliament, the King received more profit than all his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
ever got out of that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This Bill had been expoſed to the View and Scrutiny of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
and their Council for ſix Months together; and altho they do ſo very
confidently Clamour, <hi>that they were never heard;</hi> yet all that they could
ſay, was heard, and debated, even with Favour to them; they had Agents
there, to whom they allowed three Pence <hi>per</hi> Acre for that purpoſe,
and every word in the Bill was Expung'd, to which they had any
juſt Exceptionl; and at length the matter was determined by the King
and Council, and the following Order was made.</p>

                  <p>In the Year 1663. <hi>Alexander Jepſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> Collonel <hi>Abbot,</hi>
Major <hi>Warren,</hi> and ſeveral others, had formed a Plot to ſeize on
the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> on the 21<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May;</hi> but the Lord Lieutenant
had notice of it from the Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi> and others, and ſo it was

on the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>May;</hi> and on the ſame day, the Lord Lieutenant, and
Council, gave an account of it to the Secretary of State, and his

ſo from time to time, until the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1665. and then they
Sat, and by publick Declaration, manifeſted their Abhorrence of that
Plot.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, all the People, both Proteſtants and Papiſts, were diſarmed
throughout the Kingdom, ſome few only excepted, in whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
could confide.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, becauſe ſeveral Diſſenters refuſed to joyn in the late

And on the 31<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1663. the Lord-Lieutenant and Council,
upon receipt of His Majeſty's Letter in favour of the Lord of <hi>Antrim,</hi>
did, by their Letter of that date, ſignifie to His Majeſty, <hi>That the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs

manner, it will infringe the</hi> Act of Settlement, <hi>which is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Security, and will hinder Repriſals for ſuch as by Declaration the King
is obliged to provide for.</hi> And in <hi>April</hi> following, His Excellency went
for <hi>England,</hi> and left his Son, the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> Lord Deputy.</p>
                  <p>And about this time the <hi>Iriſh</hi> taking advantage of the mad Plot of

                     <note place="margin">1664.</note> &amp;c. aſpers'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with diſloyalty, and cry'd up themſelves for

<hi>Knight</hi> and Lieut. <hi>Salisbury</hi> of words which amounted to Treaſon in Judge
<hi>Stockden</hi>'s Opinion; but, upon ſtrict Examination of the matter, the
Witneſſes were found to faulter, and afterwards confeſſed they were
Suborn'd, and begg'd Pardon.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> the Lord Lieutenant returned to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>

He landed at <hi>Waterford,</hi> and brought over with him the new Bill

he raiſed a Proteſtant Militia in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and diſtributed 20000 Arms

                     <hi>that is, as</hi> P. W. <hi>explains it,</hi> upon their doing publick Penance
for having returned but only ſo nigh their Obedience to their King, as a bare
Ceſſation of Arms, in order to preſerve His Majeſty's Intereſt, when their own
could not ſubſiſt without it, did amount unto.</p>
                  <p>On the 16th of <hi>December</hi> the Lord-Lieutenant did acquaint the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
with the great Preparations in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> for War both
by Sea and Land, ſo that there was great danger of an Invaſion;
whereupon the Commons voted Thanks to His Grace for the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,
and that they would ſtand by His Majeſty with their Lives
and Eſtates, and would be aſſiſtant to His Grace againſt all the King's
Enemies; and, to help bear the Expence of the War, gave eight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Subſidies; and on the 30th of <hi>March</hi> they gave four more.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it was time to prepare for Defence;<note place="margin">P. W. Remonſt. 570.</note> for <hi>P. W.</hi> aſſures us,
the <hi>Iriſh were tampering with France</hi> to back their Inſurrection by an

<hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> to the number of 200, ſeized on the King's Money in the

with the Earl of <hi>Donegall,</hi> the Governour, and refuſed to obey
him, but choſe Corporal <hi>Dillon</hi> to be their Chief, and Mann'd the
Walls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 25th. The Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> with four Companies of Guards,
went by Sea in the <hi>Dartmouth</hi> Frigat to <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> and arrived there
the <hi>Sunday</hi> after. The Mutineers deſired time till afternoon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
(deſigning in the mean time to get Proviſions into the Caſtle);
but <hi>Arran</hi> admitting no delay, charged one way, as Sir <hi>William Flower</hi>
did another, and forced the Mutineers into the Caſtle, with the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Dillon,</hi> and two of his Companions, and the loſs of two of the
Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>'s Soldiers; and the next day in the afternoon the Lord-Lieutenant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65997:433"/>
arrived with the Horſe-Guards, and then they ſurrendred
at Mercy: And this being a time when there was open War with <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> and an Invaſion expected from <hi>France,</hi> the Mutineers were
try'd by Martial Law, and ten of them condemned to die, and the
reſt to be tranſported: but, upon their ſubmiſſion, theſe laſt were all
pardon'd.</p>
                  <p>On the 11th of <hi>June</hi> the Popiſh Clergy met in a ſort of Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or National Synod, in <hi>Dublin,</hi> by connivance of the Lord-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
purſuant to His Majeſty's Order; and it was expected from them,
that they would have asked Pardon for the Rebellion in 1641. and
have given the King new aſſurance of their Allegiance, by taking an
Oath to that purpoſe, framed by their own Procurator <hi>Peter Welſh,</hi>
and called,<note place="margin">P. W. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>The Loyal Formulary,</hi> or <hi>The Iriſh Remonſtrance:</hi> But they
were ſo far from doing ſo, that one of their Biſhops ſaid, <hi>They knew no
Crime they were guilty of, and therefore needed no Pardon;</hi> and they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuſed to take the aforeſaid Oath, but prevailed with many that
had ſubſcribed that Remonſtrance, to withdraw their Subſcriptions,
and to renounce that Oath. But this matter, as it is the greateſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of what ſort of Allegiance the Popiſh Clergy of <hi>Ireland</hi>
would pay to a Proteſtant King, ſo it is well worthy of a Treatiſe by it
ſelf, ſomething more conciſe than that prolix (elſe incomparable) Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
which <hi>P. W.</hi> has afforded it.</p>
                  <p>But the Secret of this Affair was deeper than <hi>P. W.</hi> imagined; for
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were then ready for a Rebellion, and every day expected an
Invaſion from <hi>France</hi> in their favour, and therefore were loth to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
themſelves of Aſſiſtance abroad, or Complices at home, by taking
an Oath of Allegiance at that time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And accordingly, on the 19th of</hi> June 1666. <hi>the Lord-Lieutenant
wrote thus to the Secretary of State:</hi> There is hardly an hour in a day,
wherein I have not hot alarums of Conſpiracies ready to he executed by the <hi>Iriſh;</hi>
and ſuch concurrent Intelligence from ſeveral places and perſons concerning it, that
I now really believe they are put into a diſpoſition of rebelling by ſome employed
out of <hi>France:</hi> I will, according to Inſtructions, keep the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy to the
letter of the <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> or to a ſenſe equivalent.</p>
                  <p>Moſt part of this Summer was ſpent in ordering the Militia; and on
the 7th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Parliament was diſſolved, having enacted as in
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Statute-Book, and the Lord-Lieutenant made a progreſs into
<hi>Munſter;</hi> and after his return, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 27th of <hi>September, Edmond
Riley,</hi> Titular Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> was by the Lord-Lieutenant and
Council ſent Priſoner into <hi>England.</hi> And at the ſame time the ſecond
Court of Claims ſate in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and were buſie diſpoſing of Lands and

                  </p>
                  <p>And on the 1ſt of <hi>October</hi> the Lord-Lieutenant and Council conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of a way to ſend 15000 Bullocks for the relief of the City of <hi>London,</hi>
then lately burnt. And in <hi>March</hi> the notable Tory, Collonel <hi>Coſtilo,</hi>
was killed; and a Proclamation iſſued to appoint Granaries for Wheat
and Oatmeal in ſeveral parts of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The year 1667. was troubleſom enough in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Kingdom
being frequently alarum'd with Reports of a <hi>French</hi> Invaſion; ſo that
the Militia was raiſed in all parts of the Kingdom, and thoſe of <hi>Leinſter,</hi>
the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> excepted, did rendeſvouz on the <hi>Curragh</hi> of <hi>Kildare,</hi>
and thither the Lord-Lieutenant came to view them on the 13th of
<hi>July.</hi> And in the ſame month a conſiderable Squadron of Ships ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing

                  <p>Theſe were the publick Inſtructions; but the Adminiſtration of the
Government, ſeem'd to have another Foundation, for now the Myſtery of
Iniquity began to appear, and the Papiſts were publickly countenanc'd
and indulg'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> many of them got into the Commiſſion of the
Peace, and it was attempted alſo to bring them into the Army; but
Matters not running ſo ſmoothly, as the Lord Lieutenant expected, he
returned to <hi>England</hi> for new Inſtructions, and left the Government
in the Hands of the Lord Chancellor, and Sir <hi>Arthur Forbus,</hi> Lords
Juſtices, who were Sworn on the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and continued in that
Office until his Excellency's return, which was on the 23<hi>d</hi> day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
1671.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, on the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1670. Collonel <hi>Richard
Talbot,</hi> Petitioned His Majeſty in the behalf of <hi>His moſt diſtreſſed Subjects
of</hi> Ireland, <hi>who were outed of their Eſtates by the late <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers;</hi> which
Petition was referr'd to a Committe of the Council to Examine and
Report, and a State of their Caſe was given to the Committee in
Writing.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon, on the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> the Kings Solicitor attended
the Committe at the Council-Chamber, His Majeſty being preſent, and
there the Petition, and <hi>Talbot</hi>'s Commiſſion from the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> the State
of their Caſe, and the Paper of Inſtances, were read.</p>
                  <p>On the 1<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the King being preſent, Sir <hi>George Lane</hi> was
call'd in, and the firſt Inſtance being the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Hore,</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt him; but Sir <hi>George</hi> baffled the Petitioners in that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and having prov'd an Agreement with Mr. <hi>Hore, which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was pleaſed to ſay, He remembred:</hi> That Affair was clear'd to the
ſatisfaction of the King, and the Committee, much contrary to the
Expectation of the Petitioners, who perhaps had prevail'd with the
King to be there, <hi>that he might be an Ear-witneſs of the Wrong that was
done them.</hi> But the King being weary of ſuch Debates, did on the 4<hi>th</hi>
of <hi>February</hi> in Council, appoint the Lords <hi>Buckingham, Angleſy, Hollis,</hi>
and <hi>Aſhley,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Trevor,</hi> or any three of them, to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65997:435"/>
to Peruſe and Reviſe all the Papers and Writings, concerning
the Settlement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> from the firſt to the laſt, and to take an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
of the State thereof in Writing.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly, on the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1671. they made their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
at large, which was the Foundation of a Commiſſion, dated the
1<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1671. under the great Seal to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the Dukes
of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angleſy,</hi> Lords <hi>Aſhley</hi> and
<hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>John Trevor,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Chichly,</hi> to Inſpect the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all Proceedings from firſt to laſt, in Order
thereunto.</p>
                  <p>And this was followed by another Commiſſion of the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
1672. to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> the Lord Treaſurer
<hi>Clifford,</hi> and others (amongſt whom the Dukes of <hi>Ormond</hi> was one)
to inſpect the Affairs of <hi>Ireland, viz.</hi> the Acts of Settlement and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation,
and the Execution of them, and the diſpoſing of Forfeited

                  </p>
                  <p>But how ſpecious ſoever the Pretences were for theſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the ſecret Deſign was to unravel the <hi>Settlement,</hi> and to humble
the Duke of <hi>Ormond; upon whom they always, fell, when the Popiſh Intereſt
prevailed:</hi> for otherwiſe the pretended Grievances, if they had been
really true, were <hi>few</hi> and <hi>ſmall;</hi> and it were much better for the
publick, <hi>That even greater Irregularities than were complain'd of, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unremedied, than that the great and common Security of the Nation ſhould
be ſhaken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of this Opinion was the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> who always,
concern'd themſelves effectually for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, and the Proteſtant
Religion in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and accordingly, on the 9th day of <hi>March</hi> 1673,
they Addreſs'd to His Majeſty as followeth. And this Addreſs occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
that the aforeſaid Commiſſion of Inſpection was Superſeded on the

many new and extraordinary Powers, not only to the Prejudice

                              <p>But in the beginning of the year 1675. <hi>Peter Fox,</hi> and five more,
pretending to be Paſſengers in a very rich Ship in <hi>Holland,</hi> called the St.
<hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> bound for <hi>France,</hi> did Murder the Maſter, and three

and forty Merchant-men, arrived at <hi>Kingſale</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1673.
where they found a ſecure Sanctuary, until they had Convoy ſent them
from <hi>England;</hi> and this perhaps might be one motive to the Duke of
<hi>Ormond,</hi> the next time he took <hi>the Sword,</hi> to conſider the Importance of
that Place, which is the beſt Chamber for Shipping in His Majeſty's
Dominions: There it was that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> landed in the year 1601.
and there Sir <hi>Jeremy Smith</hi> and his Fleet ſound a ſafe retreat <hi>Anno</hi> 1667.
and therefore His Grace founded that Royal Structure of the New
Fort of <hi>Rincorran,</hi> which he viſited in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678. and named <hi>Charles
Fort;</hi> and it ſeems that King <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> had no leſs value
for this important Place, ſince they choſe to land there, in <hi>March</hi>
1688.</p>
                              <p>In <hi>September</hi> the News of the Popiſh Plot arrived in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">1678.</note> and
thereupon <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> Titular Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> was apprehended,

not to depart from thence without licenſe.</hi> And on the 16th of <hi>October</hi> there

                                 <hi>And the ſame day iſſued another Proclamation, for a reward of</hi> 10 l.
<hi>for every Commiſſion'd Officer,</hi> 5 l. <hi>for every Trooper, and</hi> 4 s. <hi>for
every Foot-Soldier,</hi> that can be diſcovered to have gone to Maſs ſince he took
the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance. <hi>And here it will be but Juſtice to
the memory of the Duke of</hi> Ormond, <hi>to obſerve,</hi> That it was a conſtant
Rule with him, ever ſince his coming to the Government in the year 1662. to
order the Muſter-Maſter to check the Pay of every Officer and Soldier that did
not produce a Certificate of taking the Sacrament twice a year.</p>
                              <p>On the 2d of <hi>December</hi> Circular Letters were ſent to the Juſtices of
Peace, to make a ſtrict ſearch after the Titular Biſhops and Regular
Clergy that did not tranſport themſelves, according to the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the 16th of <hi>October;</hi> and on the 12th of <hi>December</hi> a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
iſſued, to quicken the Juſtices of Peace in ſearching for
Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <p>On the 13th of <hi>December</hi> iſſued a Proclamation, taking notice of a
Letter ſcattered in the Streets of <hi>Dublin,</hi> intimating a Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Life of the Lord-Lieutenant, and promiſing Protection, and
Reward of 200<hi>l.</hi> to the Diſcoverer; and at length one <hi>Jepſon,</hi> a young
man newly perverted, and two Prieſts his Abettors, were taken, and
impriſon'd for the Fact.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>In the mean time, the Lord-Lieutenant took great care to revive the
Militia, and to Diſcipline, Arm, and Array them. And on the</hi> 26<hi>th of</hi>
March 1679. <hi>there iſſued a Proclamation</hi> to ſeize the neareſt Relations of
Tories, and to impriſon them until ſuch Tories are killed or taken; and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Popiſh Prieſts of every Pariſh reſpectively, and tranſport them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Seas, unleſs within fourteen days after any Robbery or Murther commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Criminals be taken, killed, or diſcovered. <hi>And on the ſame day a
Reward of</hi> 10 l. for taking a Jeſuit, or Titular-Biſhop, <hi>was promiſed by
Proclamation.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And not long afterwards the Lord-Lieutenant and Council, by
their Letter, ordered <hi>the Popiſh Inhabitants to be removed</hi> from <hi>Galloway,
Limerick, Waterford, Clonmell, Kilkenny,</hi> and <hi>Droghedagh,</hi> except ſome
few Trading Merchants, Artificers, and others, neceſſary for the ſaid
Towns and Gariſons: and by vertue thereof, many were expelled;
but by the ſtupidity of the Proteſtants, and at their requeſt, and
upon their Security, the Papiſts were readmitted into thoſe Towns.</p>
                              <p>Some time before this, there was a great blow given to Popery, by
the Converſion of Dr. <hi>Andrew Sall,</hi> a Learned and a Pious Man: He had
been a Jeſuit of the Fourth Vow, and in great eſteem amongſt that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65997:437"/>
Party: He was afterwards made one of the King's Chaplains, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
a good Proteſtant till his death.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>On the</hi> 3<hi>d of</hi> April 1680. <hi>the Earl of</hi> Angleſey <hi>wrote to the Lord-Lieutenant,</hi>
That <hi>Hetherington</hi> is ſent over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to make good his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
if he can; and that it is His Majeſty's abſolute and unalterable pleaſure
(adviſed by all the Council) to have every individual of the Popiſh Clergy ſeized
and impriſoned, till they petition to be ſent over Seas, and promiſe never to return
or practice againſt the State; for there is no other way to cure their Madneſs
And that there are thoſe in <hi>England</hi> that will undertake to apprehend them all.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>To which His Excellency on the</hi> 17<hi>th of</hi> April <hi>returned this Anſwer,</hi>
That above a year ago two Proclamations did iſſue againſt the Popiſh Clergy,
with promiſe of Rewards to thoſe that ſhould apprehend them; and that if any
in <hi>England</hi> will undertake it, they ſhall have the promiſed Reward, and his
Thanks beſides: And that to tell him of the inſolent Deportment and ſignal
Perfidy of the Popiſh Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is to preach to him that there is pain
in the Gout; and proteſts, That he would rather be rid of Them, than of that
Diſeaſe. <hi>And, for his farther ſenſe of them, refers to a Letter of his,
printed near the end of</hi> P. W.'<hi>s</hi> Remonſtrance.</p>
                              <p>In <hi>May</hi> 1682. His Excellency went to <hi>England,</hi> leaving his Son, the
Ear of <hi>Arran,</hi> Lord Deputy until his return, which happened in <hi>Auguſt</hi>
1684.</p>
                              <p>On the 14th of <hi>March</hi> 1683. iſſued a Commiſſion of <hi>Grace</hi> to the Chief
Governour, Chancellor, High-Treaſurer, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
the three Chief Judges, Maſter of the Rolls, Secretary of State, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Juſtice of the Kings-Bench, and the two Barons of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
to grant His Majeſty's Title to thoſe that were in poſſeſſion, and
to grant Mannors and other Privileges for a reaſonable Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
by vertue hereof, a Court, called <hi>the Court of Grace,</hi> ſate at the <hi>King's-Inns,</hi>
which at length diſſolved by the death of the King, which happened on
the 6th day of <hi>February</hi> 1684.</p>
                              <p>As ſoon as the News of the King's death arrived at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Ormond</hi> ſummoned the Council, and the next day they proclaimed
King <hi>James</hi> II. great Solemnity; but with ſuch diſmal Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and ſo much Concern, as if they had that day foreſeen
(as many did) the Infelicity and Misfortune of the following
Reign.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> are generally a People that bear Adverſity better than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity:
In Tribulation they have ſhewn ſome Fortitude and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but they never met with the Smiles of Fortune, without Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
and Extacy; and upon this extraordinary occaſion, they
grew ſo extravagant and wild, that I dare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhort Reign of King</hi> James, <hi>did commit more Inſolencies on the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>than
Theſe did on Them in 500 years before.</hi> The Inſtances of this ſort are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numberable,
and the Circumſtances almoſt incredible.</p>
                              <p>It would be too tedious to enumerate the particular Batteries, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
Affronts, and Murthers; and therefore I will confine my ſelf to
Generals: and of that ſort was, The deſertion of their Cabbins by the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> for ſeveral months together, under pretence of a fear of being
murdered by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and this was done throughout the Kingdom,
and in many Pariſhes where there were few or no <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be afraid
of; and the deſign of all this was <hi>to get the</hi> Engliſh <hi>diſarm'd,</hi> and to
uſher in a practice which was as general, <hi>viz. Of impeaching the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>for aſſembling together in the night-time.</hi> And although the Perjuries in
this Affair were ſo notorious, that the very Promoters of this Deſign
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65997:437"/>
were aſham'd of it, yet near 3000 were indicted of this Offence, and
for Treaſonable Words, and the like, in one Vacation, and eſpecially
in the County of <hi>Tipperary;</hi> and if the Courage and Integrity of
Sir <hi>John Mead</hi> had not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>topped their Career there, the Conſequence of
this Trick had been fatal to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of that County; and, as it was,
it did them a great deal of harm.</p>
                              <p>And in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> Major <hi>Lawleſs,</hi> a waſpiſh and inveterate
Fellow, was the grand Proſecutor; but he having more Malice than
Wit, managed the matter with ſuch raſhneſs and unbecoming vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
as expos'd him to the Cenſure even of his own Party. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a thouſand other ſeverities he did to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he cauſed Sir <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel
Moore, Edward Rigs</hi> 
                                 <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and thirty-three Proteſtants more, to be
indicted and tried for High-Treaſon, although he had nothing at all
to ſay againſt the firſt, but <hi>that he was a Proteſtant;</hi> nor any more to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
againſt the ſecond, but that he ſhould ſay, <hi>That he had a good Eſtate
in</hi> England; <hi>and if he could not live quietly in</hi> Ireland, <hi>he would go thither.</hi>
However, he was ſo furious in this matter, and ſo inhumane, that he
kept one <hi>Henry Rice</hi> in cloſe Priſon ſix weeks in a Dungeon, and kept
him waking a very long time, in hopes that Severity and Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
might induce him to accuſe the reſt of his Acquaintance; and
when he found they were all acquitted, even by a Jury whereof the
Foreman was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> he was enrag'd and troubl'd to the laſt degree,
and died within a week afterwards.</p>
                              <p>But on the laſt of <hi>March</hi> 1685. the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi>
leaving the Sword with the Lord Primate and the Earl of <hi>Granard,</hi> who
were nominally Lords Juſtices; but the Power was in effect in the
Earl of <hi>Tyrconnell,</hi> who was Lieutenant-General of the Army; and by
his means the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Militia were not only deprived of their Arms,
and by Proclamation ordered to ſend them into the Stores, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
in the Army began alſo to be turned out, under the pretence of being
<hi>Oliverians,</hi> or the Iſſue of ſuch.</p>
                              <p>But,<note place="margin">1678.</note> not long after, the Proteſtants were revived by the arrival of
the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> Lord Lieutenant, and Sir <hi>Charles Porter,</hi> Lord
Chancellor; for tho the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did every-where give out, That they were
both Papiſts, yet they ſoon became ſenſible of their error, and, to their
great trouble, found that thoſe Lords wanted no other Qualifications,
but that of <hi>Power,</hi> to make the Proteſtant Religion and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt
flouriſh in <hi>Ireland:</hi> In ſhort, they did all that wiſe and honeſt Men could
do, and were too great a Bleſſing for that unfortunate Countrey to
enjoy long; and therefore they were removed in <hi>February</hi> 1686. to
make room for the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnell,</hi> who was then ſworn Lord
Deputy.</p>
                              <p>For tho this Lord, being Lieutenant-General, did, even in the Lord
<hi>Clarendon</hi>'s time, ſo model the Army, that moſt part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
were disbanded; yet he met with ſo many rubs in That and Other of
his Deſigns, that he deſpaired to accompliſh his Project, or to ſatisfie
his Ambition, unleſs he were Supreme in the Government.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> having thus gotten the Sword of State into his hands, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turned the Edge of it upon the poor Proteſtants, who were amaz'd to
ſee him act ſo openly in ſuch a Deſpotical and Arbitrary manner; for
ſome of his Agents not only disbanded moſt part of the remaining <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
but inſulted on their Miſery, by doing it reproachfully; and
added to their affliction, by turning them out far from their Friends
and their Habitations, and took away the Cloaths of ſome, and the
Horſes and Arms of others, without giving them any proportionable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65997:438"/>
recompence: And he alſo changed the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soldiers ſo often, that tho
the Army did not conſiſt of more than ſeven or eight thouſand Men,
yet five times that number (by theſe frequent Changes) were taught
the uſe of their Arms; and by this means, he had a conſiderable Militia
ready upon all occaſions.</p>
                              <p>Moreover he iſſued <hi>Quo Waranto</hi>'s againſt all the Charters at once;
and altho that procedure did manifeſt to the World, that it was not
the Fault of any one, or more Corporations, that was endeavour'd
to be puniſh'd or reform'd; but that it was a fixed deſign <hi>to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Corporations, and conſequently to Model the Parliament, and the
Laws, to the Intereſt and Humour of the Papiſts;</hi> yet being Maſters of
ſtanding Armies, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> they thought themſelves
ſure of their <hi>Game,</hi> and that it would be the more Generous and
Brave, if they acted publickly, and as it were in defiance.</p>
                              <p>And therefore they diſſembled the Matter no longer, but appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two Popiſh Judges in every Court, that they might be ſure of
a Majority upon all Occaſions; they alſo appointed Popiſh High-Sheriffs
throughout the Kingdom, and they put ſo many Papiſts
into the Commiſſion of Peace, the Privy-Council, and all Places
of Authority, that they were able to Rule all, where-ever they
came.</p>
                              <p>And as ſoon as the Charters were Condemn'd, there were new
Ones granted for the moſt part to ſuch inconſiderable and beggarly
Fellows, as were unable to pay for them; ſo that many were left
with the Attorney General in Pawn for his Fees; however, in all
theſe Charters, they put in near one third <hi>Engliſh,</hi> moſt of which were
Quakers, or other Diſſenters, but at the ſame time took care to limit
the Power, (and eſpecially, that of chuſing Parliament Men) ſo that
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (if unanimous) ſhould not be able to give them any Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                              <p>But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being the principal Traders, and the moſt Wealthy
Men in <hi>Ireland;</hi> It muſt neceſſarily follow, that the removal of their
Plate, and other Effects into <hi>England,</hi> and the general Decay of
Trade that enſued, upon the Apprehenſions they had of theſe Violent
and Irregular Proceedings, did diminiſh the Publick Revenue to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of rendring it unable to ſupport the Neceſſary Expences of the
Government; this indeed was a ſenſible Stroak, and would have
changed all their Meaſures, if any thing leſs had been in the Bottom,
than a fixt Reſolution, <hi>to ſubvert the Eſtabliſhed Religion, and to introduce
Popery, and to make</hi> Ireland <hi>a ſecure Retreat for thoſe, whoſe deſigns might
perhaps miſcarry in</hi> England.</p>
                              <p>However theſe rapid Motions of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> made ſuch a noiſe in
<hi>England,</hi> as occaſion'd that Lord to be ſent for over, to meet the
King at <hi>Cheſter;</hi> the poor Proteſtants flattered themſelves with hopes
of ſome intervals of Moderation from this Interview; but they ſoon
found the fatal Effects of this Conference, not only in the Continuation,
but in the encreaſe of their Grievances.</p>
                              <p>And thus the <hi>Iriſh</hi> having to their Advantage in Number, gained
alſo the whole Power, Military and Civil, into their Hands, thought
themſelves in a Condition, not only to ſecure <hi>Ireland,</hi> but alſo to ſend
over conſiderable Aſſiſtance to carry on THE CAUSE in <hi>England;</hi>
and accordingly, <hi>Tyrconel</hi> did ſend thither about 3000 of his choiceſt
Men.</p>
                              <p>This was the ſingle Action that conduced moſt to the Preſervation
of theſe Kingdoms; all other things were but ſubſervient thereunto,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65997:438"/>
or at moſt but concurrent with it; for whilſt other Grievances did
but diſoblige a certain Number, or a Party; the bringing in of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
alarm'd <hi>every Body,</hi> and eſpecially the Army; ſo that his Preſent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
Landing not long after, met with ſuch eaſy and ſpeedy Succeſs, as
amazed the preſent, and will be the Wonder of future Ages.</p>
                              <p>Moreover, to compleat the aforeſaid Number of 3000 Men, <hi>Tyrconel</hi>
did very improvidently withdraw the Gariſon of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> without
ſending another in its ſtead, as not ſuſpecting the ſudden Revolution,
which afterwards happened, nor thinking that <hi>Derry</hi> would dare to
refuſe a Gariſon, whenever he ſhould think fit to ſend them one.</p>
                              <p>But it was not long before he ſaw his Error; and having Recruited
his Forces, he ſent a new-rais'd Regiment, under the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi>
to poſſeſs themſelves of the City of <hi>Derry.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>This Regiment Quartering in and about <hi>Newton,</hi> on the 6th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
Collonel <hi>George Philips</hi> ſent one <hi>James Boyle</hi> to give notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to <hi>Londonderry,</hi> and to adviſe them to ſhut their Gates, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they did ſo, and refuſed Entrance to this Regiment on the 7<hi>th</hi>
of <hi>December.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>On the 9<hi>th,</hi> Collonel <hi>Philips</hi> put himſelf into <hi>Derry,</hi> and on the 10<hi>th,</hi>
was by the People choſen Governour thereof; and on the 11<hi>th,</hi> the
City, ſent away Councellor <hi>Cairns,</hi> as their Agent into <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But Alarms every day encreaſing of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> deſigns to Maſſacre them,
the Country ſtocked into <hi>Derry;</hi> and on the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> the
Governor drew up a Declaration, to which they all conſented.</p>
                              <p>In the mean time, <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> knowing the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s Intereſt in
that Country, ſent him down to try if he could be admitted to Gariſon
the Town; and upon Capitulations and Articles, concluded the 21<hi>ſt</hi>
of <hi>December,</hi> he was permitted to put in five Companies of Proteſtants

                              <p>I ſhould have mention'd, that there was a currant Report ſpread
abroad, and generally believed, <hi>That the</hi> Iriſh <hi>deſigned a Maſſacre on the</hi>
9<hi>th of December;</hi> this was the true reaſon of ſhutting <hi>Derry</hi>-gates, and
of making an Aſſociation in the Counties of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Antrim.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>There were but two Regiments, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s, and Sir
<hi>Thomas Newcomen</hi>'s in thoſe two Counties, ſo that it had been eaſy to
have Surprized them, and the deſign was laid to that purpoſe; but
ſome of the Conſpirators were too Cautious, and ſo it miſcarried.</p>
                              <p>In the mean time, the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was openly raiſing ſome Men,
and ſecretly Liſting more; and having notice of his Maſter's Diſaſter in
<hi>England,</hi> reſolved to do his Endeavour to preſerve <hi>Ireland</hi> for him;
but he ſo cunningly diſſembled his deſign, that he perſwaded the Lord
<hi>Mountjoy</hi> to be Colleague to the Lord Chief Baron <hi>Rice,</hi> in a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Embaſſy to King <hi>James, to beg his leave to ſurrender the Kingdom, ſince
it was impoſſible to keep it.</hi> And it is ſaid, he promis'd ſolemnly to the
Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> that he would raiſe no more Forces, nor innovate any
thing in his Abſence.</p>
                              <p>But <hi>Rice</hi> had other Inſtructions; ſo that the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> was not

thoſe that had the Courage to keep their Houſes, fare any better, for
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being now grown Lawleſs, ſet no Bounds to their Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
but in great Numbers, with a Piper before them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Robbed the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> of all their Stock at Noon-day, and before their Faces; it was to
no purpoſe to complain, for tho the Injur'd Party might get good Words,

                  <p>THAT the Commiſſioners had by Directions char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

<hi>they wondered</hi> ſo great a Proportion ſhould
be carried to the Fort, where no Artillery was yet planted, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Quantities formerly iſſued being not yet ſpent nor any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
being in hand, they fearing the Commſſioners purpoſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault

known, renewing their Suit <hi>to have the Custody of the Fort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Corporation.</hi> That they did all they could to cauſe the

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65997:440"/>
ſuch Grief and Loſs to the poor Town, as they hoped his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
would be a means to his Majeſty for altering the ſame; That
they had received Rebuke from his Lordſhip concerning certain. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies,
but could not call to mind any particular wherein they
had offended the State, except that be an Offence, after many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes
and Wrongs done them, to keep Watch and Ward to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

                  <head>Appendix II. The Examination of Owen O Conally, the
Deſcoverer of the Iriſh Rebellion.</head>
                  <p>WHo being duly Sworn and Examined ſaith, That he being at
<hi>Monimore</hi> in the County of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> on <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt
he received a Letter from Colonel <hi>Hugh Oge Mac Mahon,</hi>
deſiring him to come to <hi>Connaught,</hi> in the County of
<hi>Monaghan,</hi> and to be with him on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> or <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt;
whereupon he this Examinant came to <hi>Connaught</hi> on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> night
laſt, and finding the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> come to <hi>Dublin,</hi> followed him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
he came hither about Six of the Clock this Evening, and
forthwith went to the Lodging of the ſaid <hi>Hugh,</hi> to the Houſe near
the Boot in <hi>Oxmantown,</hi> and there he found the ſaid <hi>Hugh,</hi> and
came with the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> into the Town near the Pillory, to the
Lodging of the Lord <hi>Mac-Guire,</hi> where they found not the Lord
within, and there they drank a Cup of Beer, and then went back
again to the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi>'s Lodging. He ſaith, that at the Lord
<hi>Mac-Guire</hi>'s Lodging, the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> told him, that there were and
would be this Night great Numbers of Noblemen and Gentlemen
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, from all parts of the Kingdom, in this Town,
who with himſelf had determined <hi>to take the Caſtle of</hi> Dublin, <hi>and to
poſſeſs themſelves of all his Majeſties Ammunition there,</hi> to Morrow
Morning, being <hi>Saturday;</hi> and that they intended firſt to Batter the
Chimneys of the ſaid Town, and if the Citizens would not yield,
then to Batter down the Houſes, and ſo <hi>to cut off all the Proteſtants</hi>
that would not joyn with them. He further ſaith, That he the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65997:440"/>
ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> told him, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had prepared men in all parts of
the Kingdom, to deſtroy all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabiting there to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Morning by Ten of the Clock; and that in all the Sea-Ports
and other Towns in the Kingdom, <hi>all the Proteſtants ſhould be killed
that night,</hi> and that all the Poſts that could be, could not prevent
it. And farther ſaith, That he moved the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> to forbear exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
of that buſineſs, and to diſcover it to the State, for ſaving
of his own Eſtate; who ſaid he could not help it, but ſaid, that
they did owe their Allegiance to the King, and would pay him all
his Rights: But that they did this for the Tyrannical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that was over them, and to imitate <hi>Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who had got a
Priviledge by that courſe. And he further ſaith, that when he was
with the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> in his Lodging, the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> ſwore that he
ſhould not go out of his Lodging that Night, but told him he ſhould
go with him the next Morning to the Caſtle; and ſaid, if this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were diſcovered, ſomebody ſhould die for it. Whereupon this
Examinant fained ſome neceſſity for his Eaſement, went down out
of the Chamber, and left his Sword in Pawn, and the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi>
ſent his Man down with him; and when this Examinant came
down into the Yard, and finding an opportunity, he this Examinant
leaped over a Wall and Two Pales, and ſo came to the Lord
Juſtice <hi>Parſons.</hi>

Coſtilough, from the Rebels of the County
of Longford in Ireland, which he preſented
to the State in their behalf, <date>Nov. 10. 1641.</date>
                  </head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Our very Good Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>OUr Allyance unto your Lordſhips Anceſtors and your ſelf,
and the tryal of your and their performance of Truſt unto
their Friends in their greateſt Adverſity, encourageth us,
and engageth your Honour to our fruition of your future Favours;
the fixion of our confidence in you, before any of the Peers and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Counſellors of the Kingdom, doubleth this obligation. Your
Lordſhip may therefore be pleaſed to acquaint the Lords, Juſtices,
and Councel (to be imparted unto his Sacred Majeſty,) with our
Grievances and the cauſes thereof; the Reading of which we moſt
humbly pray, and the Manner of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Papiſts in the Neighbouring Counties are ſeverely Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and their Miſeries might ſerve as Beacons unto us to look
unto our own, when our Neighbours Houſes are on Fire: And we
and other Papiſts, are and ever will be as Loyal Subjects as any in
the Kings Dominions; for manifeſtation whereof, we ſend herein
incloſed an Oath, ſolemnly taken by us, which as it receiv'd inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
impreſſion in our Hearts, ſhall be Sign'd with our Hand, and
Seal'd with our Blood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is an Incapacity in the Papiſts, of Honour, and
the Immunities of true Subjects, the Royal marks of Diſtributive
Juſtice, and a disfavour in the Commutative, which raiſed Strangers
and Foreigners above thoſe whoſe Valour and Vertue was Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
when the old Families of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the major part
of us the meer <hi>Iriſh</hi> did Swim in Blood, to ſerve the Crown of
<hi>England;</hi> and when Offices ſhould call Men of Worth, Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Worth and Merit obtain them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Statute of 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of force in this Kingdom againſt
us, and they of our Religion, doth not a little diſanimate us and
the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The avoidance of Grants of our Lands and Liberties,
by Quirks and Quiddities of the Law, without reflecting upon the
Kings Royal and real intention for confirming our Eſtates, his
Broad Seal being the Pawn betwixt his Majeſty and his People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65997:441"/>
Fifthly, The Reſtraint of Purchaſe in the meer <hi>Iriſh,</hi> of Lands
in the Eſcheated Counties, and the taint and blemiſh of them and
their Poſterities, doth more diſcontent them, than that Plantation
Rule; for they are brought to that Exigent of Poverty in theſe late
times, that they muſt be Sellers and not Buyers of Land.</p>
                  <p>And we conceive and humbly offer to your Lordſhips conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(<hi>principiis obſta,</hi>) that in the beginning of this Commotion,
your Lordſhip (as it is Hereditary for you) will be a Phyſitian to
cure this Diſeaſe in us, and by our examples, it will doubtleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the like auſpicious ſucceſs in all other parts of the Kingdom;
for we are of opinion it is one Sickneſs, and one Pharmach will
ſuffice, <hi>Sublata cauſa tollitur effectus;</hi> and it will be recorded, that
you will do Service unto God, King and Country, and for ſalving
every the aforeſaid Sores, your Lordſhip is to be an humble Suitor
in our behalf, and of the reſt of the Papiſts that out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his Majeſties Clemency, there may be an Act of Oblivion
and general Pardon <hi>without Reſtitution, or account of Goods taken</hi> in
the time of this Commotion, a Liberty of our Religion, a Repeal
of all Statutes formerly made to the contrary, and not by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
but Parliamentary way, a Charter-free Denizen in ample
manner for meer <hi>Iriſh;</hi> all which in ſucceeding Ages, will prove an
Union to all his Majeſties Dominions inſtead of Diviſion, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in Deſolation, and a Happineſs in perpetuity for an imminent
Calamity. And this being granted, there will be all things, <hi>Quae
ſunt Caeſaris Caeſari,</hi> and <hi>quae ſunt Dei Deo;</hi> and it was by the Poet
written, (though he be prophane in other matters, yet in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically,)
<hi>Diviſum Imperium cum</hi> Jove, Caeſar <hi>habet:</hi> All which for
this preſent, we leave to your Honourable care; and we will as we
ever did, and do remain,</p>

                  <p>WE your Majeſties Juſtices, on the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> laſt,
Receiv'd your Majeſties Letter of the 11<hi>th.</hi> of the

which Letters we then immediately communicated to the Council,
as we always do, in all matters of Importance concerning your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Affairs here.</p>
                  <p>By thoſe Letters, your Majeſty declared, that you had ſent a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to our very good Lord, the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> and
others, Authorizing them to receive in Writing, what the Petitioners
Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> mentioned in thoſe Letters, would ſay or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
and to return the ſame to your Majeſty: And by the ſame Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
your Majeſty Commanded us your Juſtices, to give thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
our beſt aſſiſtance and furtherance, as there ſhall be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
wherein (as in all things elſe we have always done, and ſhall
ever do) we ſhall moſt readily obey your Majeſties Royal Commands,
with all humble Duty and Submiſſion, having nothing more in our
Care and Endeavours in theſe perplexed times, than to advance your
Service, and to preſerve your Soveraign Rights and Intereſts here,
where ſo dangerous Attempts have of late been made againſt them,
by ſo <hi>Aniverſal</hi> a Conſpiracy of the Papiſts of this Kingdom,</p>
                  <p>We do with much Joy of heart Comfort our ſelves, to ſee your
Majeſties gracious inclination, to hear your Subjects whatſoever
they be in themſelves; and as therein we behold your goodneſs, ſo
we, to whoſe Care and Circumſpection your Majeſty hath committed
the great Truſt of this your Kingdom, cannot but eſteem it a great
breach of Duty and Faith in us, to be ſilent in ſuch things as may
give light in this important buſineſs, and which cannot come to your
Majeſties knowledge but by your Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Petitioners do affirm, That they had recourſe to Arms for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of your Royal Rights and Prerogatives; which if it were
true, we ſhould be ſubject to the full Tax of Treachery, if we ſhould
not with all Zeal and hearty Affection have joined with them; And
if that had been the true ground of their entring into quarrel with us,
it ſhould coſt little Mony or Blood to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile

                  <p>They well know, that before this Rebellion, in the Parliament held
here, and formerly we oppoſed them ſeveral times, where we found
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65997:442"/>
them <hi>vehemently labour to abridge thoſe Prerogatives</hi> and antient
Rights of the Crown here, and to derogate from your Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

                  <p>But we muſt upon full obſervation of their Courſes and Actions ſince
the Firſt breaking out of this unnatural Rebellion unfeignedly affirm,
That they do but take up this for an excuſe of their moſt odious
breach of Faith and Duty to your Moſt Sacred Majeſty, their inward
intent being, as ſince hath appeared, to deprive your Majeſty of all
thoſe Prerogatives they ſpake of, and even of your Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
reſolving alſo to deſtroy and extirpate out of this Iſland, as
well the true Proteſtant Religion, as alſo your Majeſties moſt Loyal
Brittiſh Subjects, whom they hate chiefly, becauſe they Religiouſly
love your Majeſty and your Children, and in that love were ſuch lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of them in all their late ſeeming Acts of Bounty and Duty
towards your Majeſty, as without ſhameful bewraying their evil
hearts, they could not ſhun the ſame; whereat they often ſhewed
<hi>much reluctancy,</hi> as appeared in reducing the ſubſidies and other

away the means for arrival of <hi>Engliſh</hi> here, other than by main force;
to which intent they Aſſembled in great numbers near this City within
two or three Miles round about it; having then alſo ſtrongly Beſieg'd
your Majeſties Port Town of <hi>Droghe da</hi> as a ſtep to the gaining of
this City, preſuming all this while that no ſuccour ſhould come out

care of the remanant of your poor People left yet undeſtroyed, in
ſending Forces hither) we were enabled by your Majeſties Forces
to beat off thoſe Multitudes, and to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> then
as well the Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> as the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> all Papiſts and now Rebels which
drew themſelves farther off; and finding that they had not ſo ready
a way to rent the Kingdom out of your Majeſties hands, as they at
firſt ſuppoſed, they then found it neceſſary to fall to new Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
how yet to bring their wicked ends and contrivances to full
effect, making the Seats of their Aſſembly at the City of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi>
there with full advice of their Titular Clergy and Popiſh Lawyers,
<hi>Without any Authority derived from your Majeſty,</hi> they call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which being Aſſembled, they turned into a National Aſſembly
utterly ſtrange to the Laws of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to your
Majeſties Royal Prerogative, which they falſely pretend to maintain;
there they Enacted, That no other Temporal Government or Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
ſhall be Aſſumed, Kept or Exerciſed in this Kingdom, ſave
what ſhall be approved by the General Aſſembly, or Supream Council.</p>
                  <p>There they ſet up a new Form of Government, utterly oppoſite
to the Laws of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and your Royal Authority; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
a Council for Governing in each County, a Council in each

Council of the Confederate Catholicks,</hi> to be held at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> or
elſewhere they appoint.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Councils are to be the ordinary Judicatories, to hear and
determine all Cauſes, as well touching Life and Member as amply as
your Majeſties Judges of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and Goal-delivery could
do; and accordingly they give Judgment of Death, by Votes againſt
your <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects, whom otherwiſe alſo they Hang and Execute
by Warrants of their Commanders and others, without Proceſs or
other proceedings; as alſo to Hear and Determin all Cauſes for Goods,
Chattels and Intereſts, and to eſtabliſh Rents and Poſſeſſions as
if a right of Conqueſt were already veſted in them; And they Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
that all Perſons of all profeſſions and degrees ſhall obey their
Orders; there they eſtabliſh the Romiſh Clergy in all the Poſſeſſions
of the Church throughout the Kingdom, and appoint an Oath of
Aſſociation to be taken in all the Pariſhes of the Realm; there they
form Armies and Commanders of all ſorts to reſiſt your Majeſties
Forces, and if they may, to perfect their intended Conqueſt of this
your Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>They appoint Sheriffs, Coroners, Conſtables, and other Officers
in each County, to execute their Orders; they in ſome parts have
cauſed their Captains, Officers and others, to take Oath before their
Titular Clergy, that they ſhall not ſuffer any <hi>Engliſh</hi> or Proteſtant
to live in this Kingdom, or bear any Office, no not ſo much as a
petty Conſtable; they by their Popiſh Clergy ſollicited with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
and travel, powerful Aids from Foreign parts to Aſſiſt them
in this Conqueſt, whereby they ſeem to diſclaim all dependance on
your Majeſty, either for Favour or Juſtice. They did ſet up the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours publickly at <hi>Wexford</hi> amongſt the Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> (but
Papiſts,) and Captain <hi>Aſhly,</hi> as we are credibly informed, did teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that they had done the like at <hi>Gallaway:</hi> They by the crafty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
of the Popiſh Clergy, and the contracted hatred of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
againſt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and Proteſtants, had got into their Poſſeſſion
the moſt part of the Sea Ports, out of which they have murdered
or expulſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants, which Ports they uſe as Inlets
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65997:443"/>
to all their foreign Supplies, having alſo deviſed to have Admirals
and other Officers at Sea, to the End to become Maſters of theſe
Seas, to your Majeſties diſheriſon and prejudice.</p>
                  <p>Whether theſe Expreſſions and Actions being but a few gathered
out of many which we know of them, either conſidered in the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> or your better educated <hi>Old Engliſh,</hi> or both, be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Streams iſſuing from a Fountain of real Intention, to preſerve
and maintain your Royal Rights and Prerogative, we ſubmit to any
equal Judgment.</p>
                  <p>In their Petition they ſay, that their Adverſaries have miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
their Addreſſes to your Majeſty; your Majeſty may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to remember that we certified thither, that their Petition came
not hither till the Seventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, which we ſoon after ſent
thither, they having ſpent all the preceding Winter, and the then
ſucceeding Summer in their Courſes of Rebellion, whilſt they had
hopes all that time by force to carry the Cauſe, never in all that
time making Application in that Nature either to your Majeſties
Army, or your Majeſties Miniſters, that we could hear of, until they
found your Majeſties Forces ſo to ſpread and prevail againſt them,
as put them in great fear; then they betook themſelves to the way
of Petition, having formerly moſt contemptibly deſpiſed and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
your Majeſties Proclamation under your own Royal Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Privy ſignet, commanding them to lay down Arms; then
preſuming <hi>by the Old Iriſh ſhift</hi> of feigned Profeſſion of Subjection,
to abuſe your Majeſties boundleſs Mercy as their Anceſtors had done
the Royal Clemency of many of your famous Predeceſſors in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ages, to the continual Diſquiet, fruitleſs Expence, and as it fell
out, diſhonour of themſelves and their Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> whereof
Records and Hiſtories are full: And as to their Addreſſes by <hi>Read,</hi>
then a Rebel with them, it is moſt fraudulently alledged; for although
it be true that in <hi>December,</hi> 1641. a few of the Rebelli ous Noblemen
and Gentry of the Pale framed a Petition, and delivered it to <hi>Read,</hi>
ſeeming to intend to ſend him away with it to your Majeſty, yet
he tarried with them unſent until <hi>March</hi> after; at which Time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Siege of <hi>Drogheda</hi> raiſed, and that he could no longer live in
thoſe parts, he rendered himſelf to the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> in
the Field, not coming as a Meſſenger from them in any ſuch kind,
and in his Examination he declares, that after he had received that
Petition, he demanded of them ſeveral Times when he ſhould be
ſent away, to which they only anſwered, there would be time enough
for that, they then making account to carry all before them by ſtrength
of Arms. And as to their Charge againſt their Adverſaries, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they mean us, we do unanimouſly and in all Truth deny our
ſelves to be their Adverſaries, farther than they are ſo to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
your Crown and Royal Eſtate, as they are, of which their
preſent Condition, we are ſo well aſſured, as we cannot without baſe
Diſloyalty ſhew our ſelves to them in that behalf other than Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries;
and it cannot be juſtified or made appear, that ever we or
any of us have had Contentions with, or heart burning againſt any of
them in reſpect of any our private Intereſt or Intercourſe, but
have always treated them before this Rebellion as our Friends, and
your Majeſties Loyal Subjects as we then took them to be. And
where they aſperſe thoſe Adverſaries with the Crime of Bloud,
committed on their Wives and Children; We cannot deny but that
in the Courſe of the War forced by them upon us for our own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65997:444"/>
Defence, and for the Preſervation of this your State and
Kingdom, ſome of their Blood hath been ſhed by your Majeſties
Army in Fights with them, which we wiſh they had drawn upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
but if they look back upon their own Beginning, and proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in this horrid Rebellion, they ſhall find themſelves heavily loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with the crying Guilt of the innocent Blood, they moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
in time of open and ſetled Peace without any Provocation or
Offence given, falling with armed Force upon the unarmed and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Britiſh and Proteſtants; Murthering, hanging, drawing, bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alive, and ſtarving them Men, Women and Children of all Ages
and Conditions, to the Number of 154000. before the End of <hi>March</hi>
laſt, as is teſtified, was acknowledged by their Prieſts appointed to
collect their Numbers, beſides many thouſand others ſince that Time
ſo uſed in all Parts of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they profeſs they took up Arms to exalt and eſtabliſh
the Romiſh Catholick Religion throughout this Kingdom, and they
have taken a Publick and Univerſal Oath to maintain and defend the
publick Exerciſe thereof; but in this particular, as in that of Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
we crave leave to affirm that we well know, and their Actions
and Infidelity do abundantly demonſtrate that many of them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the <hi>Iriſh, have little ſenſe or inward Touch of Religon,</hi> other
than what is preſſed upon them by their Traiterous Clergy for their
Pride and Avarice, and the ſottiſh Superſtition of their Women; and
that thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> aſſumed this only, as another Cover for their bloody
and moſt unchriſtian Execution of their antient and never ceaſing
hatred to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh Nation;</hi> which doth
now, and hath heretofore in all Ages undeniably appeared in their
many furious Inſults and Murthers upon their Perſons, and Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of the Poſſeſſions of the Engliſh ever ſince their firſt Entrance
into this Kingdom: Even in the ſeveral Ages when no difference was
between the two Nations in matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>In the Conjuncture of Affairs here in theſe Times, we may not in
Duty to your Royal Throne, and in the Truſt of your Affairs laid
upon us, forbear to let your Majeſty know what divers Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſeem to be entertained in the mind of this People. On the one
ſide the Papiſts here with us, and the Papiſt Rebels do with great
Boldneſs and Alacrity give out <hi>that they ſhall have preſent Peace;</hi> in
that Peace they preſume ſhall be wound up all the bloody Maſſacres
and fearful Deſtruction committed on the Perſons and Eſtates of the
Britiſh and Proteſtants, having now extirpated or baniſhed them,
which was part of their Work intended, and demoliſhed their coſtly
Houſes and Buildings throughout the whole Kingdom, except the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<hi>and but the Perſons only,</hi> of a few which we have in Oarriſons and
Forts, their intent being to become ſole Maſters of the Kingdom; and
they farther adjudge, that they have gained ſo ſtrong a Bar of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
againſt any coming of <hi>New Engliſh</hi> hither, or their inhabiting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, as if thoſe Rebels (in the Strength and Numbers they now
ſtand) may gain Liberty and Freedom of Eſtates and Security of
their Perſons, they ſhall hold themſelves for ever freed from the
Cohabitation of Engliſh, or the Subjection to any Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which (whatſoever in their frantick Apprehenſions they now
imagine,) would ſoon make them a ſlaviſh, diſtracted, miſerable People,
as did well appear in the late former Age; before which by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Aſſaults on the Engliſh in ſeveral Kings Reigns, and their ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to expel them, they almoſt got all into their own hands; in which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65997:444"/>
Times the few old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies were driven almoſt Night and
Day with their Swords in their hands, to peſerve their Lives and
ſmall Livelyhood.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the little Remnant of Proteſtants are ſtrucken
into ſuch Aſtoniſhment, at theſe Preſumptions of the other party,
and the foreſight of their own Deſtruction, if your Majeſties Armies
be ſuddenly laid down, as they began to deſpair of Safety ever to
be had here, and are therefore ready to forſake the Kingdom, and
then the Kingdom being left wholly to Iriſh, and ſo bloody mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Papiſts as the Rebels now are, it will be very queſtionable how
your Majeſty and your Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> can have ſafety by them,
they having boaſted that after this Conqueſt they will invade <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and it will be as queſtionable how <hi>England</hi> can make a New
Conqueſt without more Charge and Danger than this Kingdom is
worth, this Kingdom now being in far other caſe for Towns, Forts,
Ordinances, and Places of Strength, and Men trained to Wars, than
in the Times of any former Conqueſt of this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> do fear, that if Peace ſhould now be treated of here,
it would give a ſtop of farther Supplies of Men, Munition, Arms or
Victuals to be ſent hither, which the Rebels have long threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, and ſo the Stores being kept weak here, the Rebels would
not doubt ſpeedily to bring the Proteſtants into their mercileſs Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and fall upon them to the full Execution of their former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments.</p>
                  <p>They conſider alſo (beſides what they know of former Ages,)
that ſeeing the Papiſts and <hi>Iriſh</hi> before the Rebellion, could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
to ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> dwell by them, and under them, when there
was full amity and agreement between them, all manner of Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Affinity, Conſanguinity, Marriage, Friendly Society and
Commerce; no Oppreſſion, Injury or Offence offered to any of
them; Rents of their Land, and all other Profits of the Kingdom,
raiſed far higher than in any former Age, by the Husbandry and
Induſtry of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Now after ſo great encouragement on
both ſides, and ſo great rancour and malice raiſed between them by
the acts of Cruelty and Violence on all Parties, the Britiſh and
Proteſtants ſtand moſt aſſured to be devoured by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> if they
ſhall ſtand in ſtrength and numb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> they now do, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
ſhall offer to diſperſe and inhab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> among them in the way of Peace.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if Arms could now be ſafely laid down on both ſides,
and if then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould adventure to diſperſe themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, though no other violence ſhould be offered them, they
would be deſtroyed by very <hi>Stealths and Robberies,</hi> their Remedy
being only by Tryal of Juries, all <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who by Poſitions of Law
lately broach'd by Popiſh Lawyers upon their Queries a little before
this Rebellion, are not as formerly to be queſtioned for falſe
Verdicts.</p>
                  <p>They conſider likewiſe, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> now combin'd in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
are a Slothful People, naturally inclin'd to Spoil, Ravage,
Stealth and Oppreſſion, bred in no Trades, Manufactures, or other
civil Induſtry to live by in Peace, wherein they never did, nor can
endure long to continue, naturally loving a Savage and Unbridled
courſe of Life; though in theſe laſt Thirty Years, God bleſſed your
moſt Renowned Father, and your Royal Majeſty with a more ſetled
Peace here, than had been ſeen in <hi>Ireland</hi> for above Two Hundred
Years before; whereby it is evident, that if they were ſuffered to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65997:445"/>
live alone here, they would not, nor ever could raiſe any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Revenue to their Prince, their Nature being to live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in Blood and Contention one with another, as they always
were before the late Peace and ſetled <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government among
them.</p>
                  <p>And it is obſervable; that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> now ſee, that the more
Civility or Civil Education theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels obtained by the care
and pious inſpection of the late <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governors (which they did
to recover and reclaim them) the more dangerous Enemies they
now found them; and the more the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did Enrich, Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and Favour thoſe Rebels, the more Scornful, Ungrateful, and
Mortal Enemies they have ſhewn themſelves unto thoſe their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.</p>
                  <p>They conſider farther, and now find by dear experience, that the
Towns and Corporations all conſiſting of Papiſts, though for the
moſt part old <hi>Engliſh,</hi> except Three of Four Towns lately Planted,
which are Proteſtants, are apt upon every Inferrection againſt the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> to run with the Country; and hereby they will be able
on the ſudden to overwhelm them in leſſer Numbers, either in Town
or Country, ſo as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can expect no refuge.</p>
                  <p>They conſider farther, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being Maſters of the Body
of that Kingdom, Arm'd in great numbers for War, and full of
Malice, and now far too Hauglity and Inſolent to ſubmit to ſuch
terms of Peace as may be ſafe for <hi>England,</hi> or honourable for ſo Juſt
and Pious a King as your Majeſty; and that if the Blood of Peace
ſo unmeaſurably ſhed by the Rebels, who have now Enrich'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by the Spoils of the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> ſhould be wiped out in a fained
Submiſſion, it would embolden them and their Poſtevity hereafter
upon all occaſions to attempt the like again for their Advantage,
making the <hi>Engliſh</hi> but Slaves to gather Subſtance to ſatiate their
cruel Malice and Luſt, whenſoever they find themſelves in caſe to
Surprize them as they have done in ſeveral Ages.</p>
                  <p>They remember that in the beſt of former times, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did ſo
exceed in number, as that the Governors never could or durſt fully
execute the Laws for true Reformation, for fear of Diſturbance,
having ſome hope always by civil and fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>as that in reaſonable time</hi> Engliſh <hi>Colonies might overtop them,</hi> and
and ſo perhaps frame the reſide Into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manners, and Civil
courſe of Life, by Trades or other good Induſtry, to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in a quiet Life, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do plainly foreſee it can never be
ſafe for them to cohabit with them, ſecure for <hi>England</hi> to enjoy
them, or likely that themſelves (ſeparate from the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>) can
ever digeſt into a People good to themſelves, or profitable to their
King and Country.</p>
                  <p>We hope it will not be conceived out of what we have here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that we are Enemies to Peace; nay we do from our hearts
deſire Peace, and do pray the Eternal God of Peace, to grant it to
your Majeſty in all your Dominions, as the greateſt Bleſſing on
Earth that can be beſtowed on the Sons of Men, and we ſhall
in due time, with all our Power, Skill and Induſtry (under the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Conduct and Direction of your Majeſty,) endeavour to fix it
here; but we humbly crave leave to affirm, that the ſettlement of
it in this Kingdom, will be of a different conſideration from the reſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65997:445"/>
of your Dominions, if we obſerve the preſent State of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
the temperature and natural inclination of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
former deportment to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in all Ages, their antient
and unchang'd Reſolution to expulſe them by Force or Fraud, and
their obdurate wilfulneſs to ſet up and maintain Popery here, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
permitting the Proteſtant Religion; and although by a preſent
Peace, if the Rebels would conſent to it, we for our parts might hope
to gain a breathing time, and perhaps for ſome years a little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
out of our poor Eſtates here; yet we are not ſo vile as to value
any thing that ſhall concern our own particular, when it may not
conſiſt with the due care which we ought, and ever ſhall have of
your Majeſties Honour and Safety, and the future ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of your Poſterity and this your Kingdom: And howſoever it
be true, that all the peril and damage we undergo, and all the
Arms we deſire to have uſed and borne here, is but by Gods Bleſſing,
to bring on a ſafe and laſting Peace, yet we can no way apprehend,
that it can be ſo done, <hi>till the Sword have abated theſe Rebels in
Number and Power,</hi> yet not to the utter extirpation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is far from our thoughts, (though ſome to render us
the more odious, report ſo of us,) but to the Levelling of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
ſo as they may fully know it is not their ſtrength and Obſtinacy,
but your own gracious Mercy and Indulgence that can make you ſhew
your Princely love to Peace, and which ſhall alſo put theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
into ſuch a Caſe, as not ſo eaſily as now to <hi>relapſe</hi> into their
ever affected Commotions and Proſecution of their continued pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

                  <p>We confeſs we are at this time in a very terrible want of means
to ſupport a War, as we often and lately to the full declared thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whence only we muſt expect reinforcement; and we foreſee, that
unleſs Supplies of Mony, Munition, Arms, Cloaths and other Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments
of War be ſpeedily ſent us, we have little hope to eſcape
utter deſtruction, and loſs of the Kingdom; yet ſeeing the cauſe of
God, and the perpetual ſafety of your Majeſty, your Proſperity and
your Dominions under Gods Providence is the matter and ground
of our ſo deep engagement, and having had hitherto ſuch experience
of God's mighty Suſtentation, we cannot deſpair of his goodneſs,
in granting us even ſome expected aid. And being now at a very
low ebb through theſe wants, yet having a wonderful comfort in
the alacrity and conſtant courage of our Men of War, amidſt their
exrteam Sufferings, we dare ſay in the confidence of Faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and Servants to your Majeſty, that if thoſe Supplies can in any
time come unto us, we ſhall be able by Gods guidance to overcome
and avenge the wickedneſs of theſe Unjuſt and Diſloyal attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your Sacred Majeſty and your good People, and ſo find a way
to that Peace which may befit the greatneſs and Wiſdom of your
Majeſty to grant, and which we heartily long for, being at this
time preſſed with as much calamity as Men can bear, yet not able
in our Judgments to perceive, that a preſent Peace can free us and the
Proteſtants here from a certain, though perhaps a <hi>Lingering Ruine,</hi> and
the dangerous conſequences thereof. And we in like manner affirm,
that nothing under God, could have brought us to this, hard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or ſubjected your Majeſties affairs here, to the hazard they
now ſtand in, but the unexpected <hi>failing of Priviſions</hi> timely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65997:446"/>
unto us, without which, we always ſignified thither, that
this Kingdom could not be ſuſtained out of any ſubſiſtance here.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, moſt Dread Sovereign, are of ſo great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
conſideration towards ſecuring the future Peace and Safety of
your Sacred Majeſty, your Royal Poſterity, your Kingdoms and good
Subjects, as we could not without breach of Faith and Loyalty to
your Majeſty, forbear thus truly and plainly to repreſent them;
and howſoever the Rebels are pleaſed unjuſtly to traduce and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate
us and our proceedings without any cauſe given on our
parts, other then our Faithfulneſs to you our moſt Dear and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Lord and Maſter, (which Reproaches from them we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for your ſake to bear, as we are ready to Sacrifice our Lives
for you.) Yet we humbly beſeech your Majeſty, to give us leave with
the freedom of Faithful Servants, to affirm to your Majeſty in the
preſence of God (to whom, and to your Majeſty we are accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for uprightneſs in all our Councils and Actions,) that we fall
upon no Expreſſions herein out of any hatred to the Perſons of them
or any of them, or out of any ſiniſter ends of advantage to our
ſelves, but only out of neceſſary duty to God and to your Majeſty,
for whom we hope God hath reſerved the high honour of that
great work of full ſettlement and reformation of this your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to which none of your Royal Anceſtors could attain; although
your Royal Father King <hi>James</hi> of Bleſſed memory, made a fair en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
towards it, by a ſweet and peaceable way, which glorious
beginning of his, the Rebels have quite overturned and defac'd.</p>
                  <p>And now having clearly and in zealous duty laid open our hearts
to your Royal Majeſty, we in all humility ſubmit and intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

                  <head>Appendix V. An Abridgement of the Iriſh Remonſtrance of
Grievances.</head>
                  <p>THAT they being neceſſitated to take Arms for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their Religion, the Maintenance of His Majeſties
Rights and Prerogatives, the natural and juſt Defence of
their own Lives and Eſtates, and the Liberties of their Country, have
often attempted to preſent their humble Complaints to His
Majeſty, but were prevented therein by the Power and Vigilancy of
the Lords Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Malignant party</hi>
now in Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> the better to accompliſh the Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Religion and Nation, have hindred their Acceſs to the
Kings Juſtice, which might have prevented much miſchief, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
notice now of a Commiſſion to hear their Propoſals, in which
are theſe words (<hi>albeit we do extreamly deteſt the odious Rebellion,
which the Recuſants of</hi> Ireland <hi>have without Ground or Colour raiſed
againſt us our Crown and Dignity</hi>) they conceive them to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the miſrepreſentation of their Enemies, and do proteſt
they have been therein traduced to the King, for that they never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
any Rebellious thought againſt His Majeſty, his Crown or
Dignity, but are his faithful Loyal Subjects, and deſire to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo, and as ſuch they preſent the enſuing Grievances, and Cauſes of
the then preſent Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Catholicks, whom neither Reward nor Perſecution
could tempt from their Religion theſe 1300 Years, are by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> made incapable of Places of Honour or Truſt, their
Nobles are become contemptible, their Gentry debar'd from Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the Univerſities or Publick Schools, and their younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for want of imployment, are forced to live in Ignorance and
Contempt at home, or to their great diſcomfort and impoveriſhing
of the Country, to ſeek Education and Fortune abroad; Misfortunes
made incident to the Catholicks only (their Number, Quality and
Loyalty conſidered) of all the Nations in Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>2. That Men of mean Condition and Quality for the moſt part,
were placed in all Offices of Truſt and Honour, who being to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a Fortune, built it on the Ruines of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
themſelves, ſcandalized the Papiſts, and rendered them ſuſpected
and odious in <hi>England;</hi> whereby aroſe the Oppoſition to the Graces
promiſed or intended to the Natives, by His Majeſty or his Father; and
the falſe Inquiſitions on feigned Titles againſt many Hundred years
Poſſeſſion, and no Travers or Petition of Right admitted thereunto,
nor any Bar to it, except Letters Patents, which when produced were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65997:447"/>
alſo declared void, ſo that 150 of them were avoided in one Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
ſo little regard was had to the great Seal, which is the
publick Faith of the Kingdom: And the Jurors were forced even by
infamous Puniſhments, to find ſuch Inquiſitions againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Graces granted by the King and his Father, were
rendered unprofitable and fruitleſs to the Natives, by the immortal
Hatred of Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> and the impeached Judges, and their
Adherents; ſo that the publick Faith involved in thoſe Grants was
violated.</p>
                  <p>4. That by the many wilful and erronious Decrees in the Court
of Wards, the Heirs of Catholicks were cruelly dealt with, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
in their Eſtates, and bred in Diſſolution and Ignorance, their
Parents debts unſatisfied, their Brothers and Siſters unprovided for,
Meſne Tenures unregarded, Conveyances for valuable conſideration
avoided againſt Law, and the whole Kingdom filled with Swarms
of Eſcheators, Feodaries, Purſivants, <hi>&amp;e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. That the Catholicks have without Reluctancy, or repining,
contributed to all the Subſidies, Loans, and extraordinary Grants
made to His Majeſty, amounting to <hi>Well near One Million of Pounds</hi>
over and above his Revenue, and thereunto were the moſt forward,
and thereof bore nine parts of Ten; yet their Adverſaries by the
Opportunity of their continual Addreſſes to His Majeſty, to increaſe
their Reputation in getting in of thoſe Moneys, and their Authority
in diſtribution thereof to His Majeſties great Diſſervice, aſſumed to
themſelves to be procurers thereof, and repreſented the Catholicks
as obiſtnate and refractory.</p>
                  <p>6. That the Army raiſed here with great charge was disbanded by
the preſſing importunity of the <hi>Malignant Party</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe
<hi>they ſaid it was Popiſh, and therefore not to be truſted;</hi> and although
that <hi>Malignant Party</hi> did invade his Majeſties Prerogative, and
Sir <hi>William Parſons</hi> and Sir <hi>Adam Loftus</hi> did declare, <hi>that an Army
of Ten Thouſand</hi> Scots <hi>would come to</hi> Ireland <hi>to force the Catholicks to
change their Religion,</hi> and that <hi>Ireland</hi> would never do well without a
Rebellion <hi>to extirpate the Remainder of the Natives;</hi> and though Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were laid at the Aſſizes, <hi>that within a Year no Catholick ſhould be
left in</hi> Ireland, and though they ſaw the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament unjuſtly
incroach'd upon by the Acts and Orders of the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in ſending for, and impeaching one of the Members then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and that it was declared in Print by their order, <hi>that</hi> Ireland
<hi>if nam'd, is bound by an Engliſh Statute,</hi> which is againſt Law and
Cuſtom for Four Hundred Years paſt; and though they had notice
of the Proteſtation made by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament againſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
and their <hi>Intention</hi> to make Laws for the extirpation of that
Religion in the Three Kingdoms, and had notice of the cruel
and bloody Execution of Prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> meerly for being
Prieſts, and that his Majeſty had not power enough left to ſave
one condemned Prieſt, and that the Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> being
the Parliaments own Fleſh and Blood, muſt either ſuffer or depart
the Land; and much more muſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> being not ſo nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to them, <hi>if they ſhould once get Juriſdiction in</hi> Ireland, yet all
this did not prevail with the Remonſtrants to take <hi>Defenſive,</hi> much
leſs <hi>Offenſive</hi> Arms, they ſtill expecting that His Majeſty in a ſhort
time might be able to yeild them Redreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65997:447"/>
7. That the Lords Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by untrue Informations, and other
malicious Contrivances, did endeavour to hinder His Majeſty from
granting Graces to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Committee of Parliament; but not
prevailing in that, they endeavoured to delay and ſtop them, and by
miſconſtruction and miſrepreſentations of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to poſſeſs His Majeſty with an ill Opinion thereof, and
<hi>That it had not Juriſdiction in Capital Cauſes;</hi> thereby aiming at the
Impunity of thoſe Impeached, and the Deſtruction of the Parliament,
to which that power is eſſential; and that the Lords Juſtices and
their Adherents, with the height of Malice, envying their Union,
endeavour'd to ſow Diſſention in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament, and to raiſe
diſtinction of <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and thereby made a <hi>Faction,</hi> which
(to prevent the Graces paſſing into Acts) Tumultuouſly cryed to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorn
the Houſe; but being over-voted, the Lords Juſtices ſaid, that
if they did not Adjorn the <hi>Saturday,</hi> themſelves would Prorogue or
Adjorn the Parliament on <hi>Monday,</hi> by which means, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Proxies from Lords that have no Eſtate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (which
is deſtructive to the Liberty and freedom of Parliament here) the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was Adjorn'd on the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and tho' the Graces
were brought over ſoon after, and the Committee deſired the Lords
Juſtices would give notice of them to the People, to prevent miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
or deſpair, and an inſtrument was provided accordingly,
yet the Lord Juſtices, <hi>willing to add Fuel to the Fire of the Subjects diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,</hi>
did forbear to make ſuch-Publication.</p>
                  <p>8. That many Petitions containing matters Deſtructive to the
Lives, Eſtates and Religion of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and directed to the
Houſe of Commons in <hi>England,</hi> were promoted at publick Aſſizes to
get hands unto them, by Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Clotworthy,</hi> and <hi>Arthur Hill</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and others of the <hi>Malignant Party,</hi>
which were the more dreadful becauſe of the ſaid <hi>Clotworthy</hi>'s power
in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and his Barbarous and Inhuman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
in that Houſe againſt <hi>Catholicks;</hi> and ſoon after an Order
made by that Parliament, <hi>Not to bow at the name of Jeſus,</hi> came to the
knowledge of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as alſo, that the Malignant Party there
did contrive and Plot to extingiſh the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Religion and Nation:
Hence ſome of them conſidered the deplorable condition they were in,
by a Statute of 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> found amongſt the Records, but never exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
in the Queens time, nor diſcovered till moſt of the Members of
that Parliament were dead, which if executed, no <hi>Catholick</hi> could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
his Life, Liberty or Eſtate, and yet nothing hindred, but the
Kings Prerogative, which the <hi>Malignants</hi> endeavoured to deſtroy;
and then the Plot of Deſtruction by an Army out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>Malignant</hi> Party in <hi>England</hi> muſt be executed; the fear of
theſe twofold Deſtructions, and their ardent deſire to aſſert the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
<hi>Neceſſitated</hi> ſome <hi>Catholicks</hi> to take Arms in maintainance
of <hi>Religion,</hi> His Majeſties Rights, their own Lives, Liberties and
Eſtates; and immediately thereupon took a ſolemn Oath, and ſent
ſeveral Declarations to the Government, and offered to ſubmit to the
Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but the Offers were ſlighted, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Prorogued, and a Declaration Iſſued on 23 <hi>October,</hi> Accuſing all
<hi>Catholicks</hi> of Diſloyalty; but upon Application of <hi>Catholicks</hi> of
Quality, that the Prorogation was againſt Law, and that a Seſſion
of Parliament was the only means to compoſe matters, the Lords
Juſtices knowing that but few would appear, yielded to a ſhort
Seſſion, but limited it ſo, that no Act of Grace, or any thing for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65997:448"/>
the Peoples ſatisfaction might paſs; that the few that met, tho' diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd,
and not permitted a Servant, and awed with Muskets preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Breaſts, yet deſired leave to ſit a ſhort time to expect their
fellows and to quiet the Inſurrection, and that the Graces might be
Enacted; but this was denied, and inſtead of it a Declaration was
propounded, <hi>that theſe DISCONTENTED Gentlemen took Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in
Rebellious manner,</hi> which was much reſented <hi>by the beſt affected in both
Houſes;</hi> but being informed <hi>that the Muſqueteers had Order to ſhoot ſome
of them at their going out,</hi> they through terror gave way to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
                  <p>9. However the greater part of the Catholicks, and all Cities and
Corporations, and whole Provinces ſtood quiet, and yet the Lords
Juſtices knowing that many powerful Members of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſtood in oppoſition to his Majeſty, they ſent their Addreſſes
to that Parliament, ſtuffed with Calumnies, and propos'd to ſend over
Forces to Conquer the Kingdom; and they alſo Arm'd the <hi>Malignants</hi>
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the Catholicks even in <hi>Dublin</hi> and other Cities, were
not only denyed Arms for their Mony, but alſo Diſarm'd; and when
the Parliament had ordered a Pardon to all that ſhould ſubmit by a
day limited, Sir <hi>William Parſons</hi> contriv'd it ſo, that it was publiſh'd
only in two Counties, and a ſhort day prefix'd, and Freeholders were
therein excepted, whereby it was manifeſt, <hi>the Eſtates of Catholicks
were firſt aimed at, and then their Lives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> was ſent into <hi>Wicklow,</hi> where he deſtroy'd
Man, Woman and Child, that had neither Will nor Power to do
hurt; and others at <hi>Santry</hi> near <hi>Dublin,</hi> Murdered innocent Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ſome whereof were <hi>Proteſtants</hi> miſtaken for <hi>Catholicks,</hi> meerly
to force <hi>Fingal</hi> to Arms: And tho' Complaint was made, yet no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
could be had, and therefore <hi>the fear of being Murdered</hi> oblig'd
the Catholicks to quit their Houſes, and to ſtand together in their own
defence, unprovided of Arms as they were; hereupon a Proclamation
iſſued 13 <hi>December,</hi> not publiſhed till the 15<hi>th.</hi> requiring <hi>George King</hi>
and others to come in, and promiſing them Protection, and another
to ſummon the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> to meet at Council the 17<hi>th.</hi> But to
prevent the effect of theſe Proclamations, the ſame 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi>
Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> was ſent to burn <hi>Clantarf,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kings</hi> Houſe, and uſe
all acts of Hoſtility, which he performed, and this breach of Faith
diſcourag'd the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> from appearing at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
forc'd them to defend themſelves; however they ſent his Majeſties
ſworn Servant, Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Read,</hi> to repreſent their Caſe to his
Majeſty; but he was not only ſtopped, but alſo Racked at <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. That the Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> by direction of the Lords
Juſtices (that Province being quiet) put to death Men Women and
Children, without diſtinction, and miſtruſted and threatned the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Nobles and Gentry, and Arm'd inferior fellows; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Conaught</hi> was uſed in like manner, ſo that in theſe Provinces
the <hi>Catholicks</hi> were forc'd on their defence, ſtill waiting his Majeſties
Pleaſure and ready to obey his Commands, whilſt the Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> were buſie by Addreſſes to the <hi>Malignant Party</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
to deprive the <hi>Iriſh</hi> of all hopes of his Majeſties Juſtice and Mercy,
and to plant a perpetual enmity between the Enemy and them.</p>
                  <p>11. That whereas <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince the Reign of <hi>Hen:</hi> 2. hath had its
own Parliament with equal Power, Priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and only dependant on the Crown, in all which time there is no
Preſident, that a Statute made in <hi>England</hi> had any force in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:65997:448"/>
until Enacted there: Now by falſe ſuggeſtions, an Act of Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
17 <hi>Car.</hi> hath paſt in <hi>England,</hi> whereby the Iriſh <hi>unſummon'd</hi> and
<hi>unhear'd</hi> are declared Rebels, and two Millions and a half of Acres of
their Land diſpos'd of, which Act <hi>tho' forc'd on his Majeſty,</hi> and in it
ſelf unjuſt and void, yet continues of evil conſequence and extream
prejudice to his Majeſty, and totally deſtructive to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation;
for tho' the ſcope ſeems to aim at Rebels only, yet the words include
<hi>all the Iriſh,</hi> and takes away many of his Majeſties Tenures, and much
of his Revenue, and therefore they proteſt againſt it as an Act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Preſident and againſt the Kings Prerogative, and the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Laws of the Kingdom; and by colour whereof the Proteſtant
Army diſavow his Majeſties Authority, and depend on the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>12. That ſtrangers in <hi>Dublin</hi> being baniſh'd thence by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were by direction of the Lords Juſtices, pillaged as ſoon as they
got without the Town, and what they left in the Town was confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and their deſire to return under Protection was denyed; that
Catholicks quiet and under <hi>Protection</hi> were by the Lords Juſtices Order,
ſooner deſtroy'd plundered or killed than thoſe in <hi>Action,</hi> and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
daily violated, and others that came to <hi>Dublin</hi> for retreat and
ſhelter were Impriſoned and Tryed for their Lives; and <hi>Dublin,
Cork, Youghall, Kinſale,</hi> and <hi>Tredagh,</hi> that opened their Gates to his
Majeſties Forces, are worſe us'd than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo that
it will be made appear that more murthers, breaches of publick Faith
and Quarter, more deſtruction and deſolation, and more cruelty not
fit to be nam'd, were committed in leſs than Eighteen Months by the
direction and advice of the Lords Juſtices and their Party of the
Council, than can be parallel'd to have been done by any Chriſtian
people.</p>
                  <p>13. That the Lords Juſtices have againſt the fundamental Laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
ſeveral Seſſions of Parliament, tho' Nine parts of Ten of the
genuine Members are abſent, it being inconſiſtent with their ſafety,
to come under the Power of the Lords Juſtices, and in their room
are Clerks, Soldiers, and Serving-men introduc'd into the Houſe of
Commons, not at all Elected or not Legally Choſen, and not having
Eſtates, however they have made Orders, and releaſ'd Traytors
Impeach'd in full Parliament, and paſſed, <hi>or might have paſſed</hi> ſome

Remonſtrance of the inhumane and bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels

                  </head>
                  <p>THAT the Remonſtrants were not neceſſitated to take up
Arms for their <hi>Religion,</hi> for they were not troubled, or
ſo much as queſtioned about it for a long time before the
Rebellion, nor for His Majeſties Prerogative; for there were no
Opponents of it in <hi>Ireland,</hi> except the Remonſtrants, who have
uſurped all the King's Prerogatives, as well as the Subjects Eſtates,
and have printed an Order of their general Aſſembly, <hi>to exclude all
Temporal Government and Juriſdiction, but what is approved or inſtituted
by that Aſſembly or the ſupream Council;</hi> nor for their Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Eſtates, becauſe they had the Protection of the Law and
His Majeſties Government; and not one Inſtance can be produced,
that a Papiſt, <hi>quatenus</hi> a Papiſt, ever ſuffered unpuniſhed Violence
from a Proteſtant either in Perſon or Eſtate, except in open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:
And as to the juſt Liberties of Subjects, (wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
are as much concerned as the Remonſtrants;) they were
never ſo fully and freely enjoyed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as at the Time of the
Inſurrection; ſo that there was no Neceſſity to murther and rob
the Proteſtants for the Preſervation of the Confederates.</p>
                  <p>Nor have any of their Addreſſes ſince the Rebellion, been ſlighted
or ſuppreſſed. Their firſt was from <hi>Cavan</hi> of the Sixth of <hi>November,</hi> and
received a mild and favourable Anſwer, and was forthwith certified
to the Lord Lieutenant. The ſecond was from ſeven Lords of the
Pale then in Rebellion, who refuſed upon ſafe Conduct to come to
the <hi>State,</hi> but deſired Commiſſioners might be appointed to confer
with them; and though ſuch a Condeſcention was thought diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
ſince it was the others duty to come to the <hi>Government,</hi> yet
both the Requeſt and Anſwer were tranſmitted to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant.
Their third Addreſs was from the united Lords, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of the Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> when His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Army had raiſed the Siege of <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and were Maſters of the
Field; however, even this was ſent to the Lord Lieutenant, and His
Majeſties Directions were prayed therein, and the like was done
by a Paper of Grievances ſent by the Lord <hi>Mountgarret,</hi> to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65997:449"/>
                     <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Ormand</hi> at the ſame time; and in <hi>August</hi> 1642. the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants
ſent to the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> a Petition directed to His
Majeſty, which accordingly the Lords Juſtices tranſmitted to him.</p>
                  <p>That the Lords Juſtices did endeavour to ſtop the ſpreading of
the Rebellion, and to reduce the Rebels to Obedience by fair means,
<hi>Viz.</hi> by their Proclamations of 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> and 1<hi>ſt.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi>
promiſing Mercy to all that ſhould deſiſt from force, by imploying
a Committee of Parliament to treat with them; <hi>but they ſcornfully
rejected the Meſſage, and contemptuouſly tore the Committees Letter, and
the Order of Parliament;</hi> and by imploying Doctor <hi>Cale,</hi> and ſome of
their own Clergy to treat with them, whom they likewiſe abuſed,
and by authorizing the Lord <hi>Moor,</hi> and afterwards Sir <hi>Richard
Barnwall,</hi> and <hi>Patrick Barnwall</hi> to perſwade them to Submiſſion, and
by giving Commiſſions to the Lord <hi>Gormanſtown,</hi> and other of the
Remonſtrants; but whilſt they found Succeſs, they were deaf to all
Perſwaſions; and now that they are baffled, <hi>they forge Cauſes of
Complaint;</hi> ſo that His Majeſty is not miſinformed, nor the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants
unjuſtly traduced, nor miſrepreſented to the King.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt Article they ſay, that it is too general, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
untrue, that <hi>Popery</hi> is a <hi>New Religion</hi> midwived into the World
by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which ended 1563, and therefore could
not be profeſſed by the Remonſtrants, nor their Anceſtors for 1300
Years; that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were at firſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> hath

until about the middle of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign: But however
that be, this is certain, that the Papiſts were ſo far from being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,
that all Laws againſt them were ſuſpended, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
a Connivance little differing from a Toleration; ſo that even
their Eccleſiaſtical Heirarchy publickly executed their Functions, and
the Clergy ſwarmed to that Degree, that <hi>Paul Harris</hi> wrote to
Pope <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> 8ht, <hi>That it was as difficult to number the Friers in</hi> Dublin,
<hi>as to reckon the Frogs in the ſecond Plague of</hi> Egypt.</p>
                  <p>That notwithſtanding the Statute of 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> there have been ten
chief Judges ſucceſſively, and all the inferior Judges of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Birth
and Education; that the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Judge that came over after that
Statute, was Sir <hi>Robert Gardiner, 29 Eliz.</hi> That ſeveral <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts,
had commands in the Queen's Army, and were Governors of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
as the Earl of <hi>Thomond, Clanrickard,</hi> &amp;c. And even
now at the Time of the Inſurrection, Papiſts were admitted to be
High Sheriffs of Counties, Juſtices of Peace, Magiſtrates of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
Marſhals upon Occaſion, Councellors at Law, Doctors of
Phyſick, Clerks; Attornies and Sollicitors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that none go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
but for their Improvement, as the Gentry of all Countries
do, or to Seminaries to become Clergymen. And theſe Popiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
have had their ſhare of His Majeſties Favour, in diſpenſing of
Honour; ſeveral of them having been made Lords, Baronets and
Knights, and ſuch as were capable of it by Conformity and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
were preferred in the Church, and even thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for it, and were Papiſts, were nevertheleſs upon an external
and partial Conformity only, continued in their Spiritual Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65997:450"/>
by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> notwithſtanding the Statute of 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Nobility had all the reſpect and priviledge which good
manners and the Law gives to their Quality; and by the induſtry
and improvements of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tenants, lived more Regularly,
Plentifully and Gentilely than any of their Anceſtors ever did or
could; and that the Popiſh Youth were never denied admittance
into any Free-School, nor into the Univerſity, nor any Queſtion
made about their Religion; only when they come to be Graduates,
they muſt then conform to the Laws of the Land, and the Statutes
of the Colledge; and the Anſwerers think; that the Remonſtrants
have ſmall reaſon to complain, whilſt they enjoy thoſe Liberties and
Favours which are denied <hi>to the Popiſh Natives of</hi> England, who
though leſs in number, are much ſuperior to the Remonſtrants in
<hi>Quality, Loyalty and Riches.</hi> But if the Laws of the Land do exclude
Recuſants from Offices of Truſt and Honour, they ought to have
patience till his Majeſty ſhall think fit to conſent to a Repeal of
them; nay if their Oppreſſions were without Law, their proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
were by Supplication and Petition to the King, and not by
Murther, Rebellion and Depredation.</p>
                  <p>To the Second, they ſay it is an aſperſion on the King, for the
ill choice of his Officers, and is ſo undutiful, <hi>that no Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
will appear in it;</hi> it was deviſed by the Popiſh Clergy, and the
Jeſuited Lawyers, who are the Firebrands of theſe horrible Flames
which have almoſt conſumed the Kingdom; and it is notoriouſly
falſe, for the chief Government hath been placed either in Men of
Nobility or great Eſtate, or in Men of great Merit, and in a high
Station, none of which ever built their Fortune on the Ruine of the
Kings Subjects, but ſome of them have been undone <hi>by the unjuſt cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>who never endure long any</hi> Engliſh <hi>Governor that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
their legal obedience to the Crown.</hi> So that of One and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
chief Governours ſucceſſively, Thirty Privy Councellors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Twelve
chief Judges, and ſeveral inferior Judges ſent out of <hi>England</hi> ſince
the Statute of 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> not one of them left any Eſtate there, nor
were enriched by that Service; and even the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> paid
great Sums of Mony for what he bought there, whereas ſuch of
the Natives of that Kingdom as were Judges have left great and
viſible eſtates; whereby it will appear <hi>who built moſt upon the Ruines
of the Natives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Natives</hi> became ſuſpected and odious in <hi>England,</hi> not by
any ſcandals caſt upon them, but <hi>by their degeneracy and frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,</hi>
whereby <hi>Ireland</hi> whilſt managed by them, was always in

whereas ſince the management of it by <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the dependancy of
the People is placed in the Crown, Legal Properties are ſecured, the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> pernicious Cuſtoms aboliſhed, Civility introduced, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65997:450"/>
nor <hi>in hatching Rebellions.</hi> That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſo far from
malicious differences with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that they endeavoured to unite
with them, and had done ſo, if the <hi>Popiſh Clergy</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their happy condition, had not ſowed diſcord between them;
the former, by publiſhing <hi>that the Protestants were Hereticks, that it
was meritorious to deſtroy them, and that they would have immediate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to Heaven that ſhould dye in that action;</hi> and that the Pope was
of that opinion, as appear'd by his Bull, (<hi>Appendix</hi> 15,) which the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> publiſhed even after the Ceſſation; and the <hi>Lawyers, by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grievances, which either were of no Importance, or were redreſſed as
fast as the Government poſſibly could, and by declaring that men killed in
Rebellion, could not forfeit their Lands, and by reflecting on the illegal
Juriſdiction aſſumed by the Council Board,</hi> which nevertheleſs thoſe
Lawyers promoted and encouraged for the advantage of their own
Practice, and to heap up matters of Complaint: And after all, there
are leſs Grievances in <hi>Ireland</hi> than in moſt other Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and ſo their own Parliament declared, <hi>Anno</hi> 1634.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Graces,</hi> moſt of them have been performed to them;
only one Warrant of Aſſiſtance was granted to the Biſhop of <hi>Down,</hi>
which was ſoon called in, and the enrolling the Surrenders of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi>
and the grant of thoſe Lands and Tenures were ſtopt for
a time, and the limitation of his Majeſties Title to Sixty Years was
not ſetled, but Bills for theſe and ſome other of the Graces were
ſent to <hi>England,</hi> and returned back approved, and would have paſt
the next Seſſion, if the Rebels had had patience. And whereas it
was one of the Graces, <hi>that all diſtinctions between</hi> Britiſh <hi>and</hi> Iriſh
<hi>ſhould be aboliſhed,</hi> which was deſired by the Proteſtants, and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
old Statutes againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were Repealed to that Purpoſe;
yet it is manifeſt, the Remonſtrants deſired no ſuch thing, for <hi>they
have done their utmoſt to extirpate the Proteſtants, and have thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
an everlaſting difference between both Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to Traverſes to Inquiſitions, they were admitted according
to Law in particular Inquiſitions, but in general Inquiſitions found
for Plantations, becauſe the chief Governour and Council, and the
Kings Council and other chief Officers were preſent, and the Jurors
were always the Prime Men of each Territory, and the Offices
publickly found (moſtly by conſent) and all Parties fully heard,
and the Parties had neither Title nor evidence to countenance a
Traverſe, nor could an indifferent Tryal eaſily be had, in theſe
Caſes, and for theſe Reaſons, Traverſes were not admitted to
theſe <hi>Grand Offices</hi> but upon cauſe ſhewn; nor was any Jury Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for not finding theſe Inquiſitions, except one in the County of
<hi>Galway,</hi> which was willful and obſtinate againſt full evidence as
their own Lawyers afterwards confeſs'd.</p>
                  <p>That the allegation that an Hundred and Fifty Patents were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
in a Morning, is a notorious untruth; what was done, was
promoted by <hi>James Cuſack,</hi> one of the Kings Council and Clerk of
the Commiſſion for defective Titles, now a Remonſtrant, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
thus: A Committee of ſome Judges and Kings Council were
appointed to conſider the Patents produc'd, and the Patentees
Council were heard, and if they confeſſed the Patent void, it was
ſo declar'd; if they conteſted, it was referred to a Tryal at Law,
which being done to avoid needleſs trouble and charge, was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and not a grievance, and was done to Proteſtants as well as
Papiſts, and had been ſo, formerly; and in imitation of it,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65997:451"/>
the Remonſtrants ſent Queries to the Judges, not long before the
Inſurrection; and if they had half ſo much regard to the great Seal
and the publick Faith as the Proteſtants have, they would never
have entred into this Unnatural and horrid Rebellion; eſpecially
ſince this Grievance (if it was one) was by his Majeſties orders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
before the War broke out.</p>
                  <p>In the Third Article, the Remonſtrants (unwittingly) confeſs the
goodneſs of his Majeſty and his Father, and how gracious both thoſe
Kings have been to them, which ſhould have obliged them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of duty and obedience; but inſtead of that, they return Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and without cauſe, againſt the Kings beſt Officers, and ſuch
as have done more good to the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> than the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants
either offered, or could do. But their deſperate hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Proteſtants in general,<note place="margin">☞</note> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governors and Officers in
particular, is the cauſe of all this; but if thoſe Officers would
have joyned with the Remonſtrants in ſetting up Pope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
his Majeſties Prerogative, then they ſhould have had the
good word of the Remonſtrants: In the mena time, they can be
charged with no particulars, except that of deteſting the Cruelty
and Perſidy of the Rebels; and if the Miniſters of State had been
faulty, what is that to the <hi>Innocent common People?</hi> certainly the
Robbery and Murther of them proceeded from a National Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
which is no new thing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but was often cruelly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
even in and before the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third.</p>
                  <p>To the Fourth Article that it is untrue, and the Remonſtrants
would have inſtanced particular caſes if there were any to be
found; for the Decrees of the Court of Wards have been Regular
and Juſt, and the execution moderate; above Two Hundred Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
have been granted to Friends in truſt for the Heirs, to pay
Debts, ſupport Younger Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and none were granted to
Strangers, but by his Majeſties immediate Warrant, except in ſome
few Caſes where the Party neglected, or was obſtinate; and in all
caſes care hath been taken of the Evidences, Marriage and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Wards. And as for the Swarms of Officers complained of,
there are but Five Eſcheators, and Eight Feodaries, and Two Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivants
in the whole Kingdom, and all of them Men of Judgment,
Moderation and Integrity; ſo that the Remonſtrants have not cauſe
to complain of theſe things, but their real grievances are, <hi>that the
Wards are bred Proteſtants, and the Taniſt hindred from intruding into
the Eſtate, and the great Lords deprived of their Dependancies, and his
Majeſties Revenue duly Collected, and their Licentious Appetites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Fifth Article they ſay that all that was given made his Majeſty
never the Richer, for it was ſpent again upon themſelves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying
the publick charge of the Kingdom, and particularly in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the new Army <hi>which was moſtly Papiſts;</hi> however the Catholicks
were ſo far from being the moſt forward in granting the Tax, that
it was firſt moved by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and mainly oppoſed by the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as his Majeſty may remember,
and they paid it with Luctation and Clamour, and never reſted till
in lieu of it they obtained <hi>more Graces from his Majeſty than their
contribution was worth.</hi> And the Subſidies were not only Firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the <hi>Protestants,</hi> but would never have been conſented to by
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> if they had not found the number of the Proteſtant
Members ſufficient to out-vote them; and therefore when ſeveral of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65997:451"/>
the Proteſtants were abſent with the new Army near <hi>Carrigfergus,</hi>
and upon ſeveral pretences excluded, and Popiſh Members choſen
in their Room, ſo that the Popiſh Party was moſt numerous: Then
the Subſidies which before were One and Forty Thouſand Pound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
were by them reduced to Twelve Thouſand Two Hundred
Pound apiece, whereby the forwardneſs they boaſt of ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be untrue.</p>
                  <p>And as to Proportion, the <hi>Protestants</hi> (beſides what the Clergy
contributed) paid above a Third part of the whole; and how it
was diſpoſed of, appears by the Accounts of the Officers, and very
much contrary to what the Remonſtrants have ſcandalouſly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted:
And if they were as well devoted to the Crown as the
Proteſtants are, his Majeſty would ſoon reap conſiderable profit
out of ſo fruitful and Flouriſhing a Kingdom, to be diſpoſed of as
he ſhould think fit.</p>
                  <p>To the 6<hi>th,</hi> that there was an abſolute neceſſity of Disbanding
the new Army, there being neither Victuals nor Mony left for them,
and the charge being too great upon the Kingdom, as the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants
declared in Parliament, when they were moved to contribute
towards it: however the Lords Juſtices did not Disband them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Majeſties Warrant for it, and they had alſo the Kings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
when it was done. And now the Reaſon is manifeſt why
ſome of the Remonſtrants (who were engaged in the Conſpiracy,)
were ſo loath to have that Army disbanded, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they ſaw
themſelves diſappointed of ſuch a help and thoſe Arms, with a more
full hand to execute their Bloody Deſign upon the Proteſtants,
wherein many of that Army concurred; and for the ſame reaſon
they oppoſed the Tranſportation of any of thoſe Forces to <hi>Spain,</hi>
and the Prieſts diſſwaded the Soldiers from going, elſe certainly
they would not be backward to rid the Country of thoſe looſe
Idle Men, nor to aſſiſt a Catholick Prince <hi>of whom ſoon after they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored
Aid againſt his, Majeſty.</hi> But they had another uſe of thoſe
Soldiers in proſpect, and which is ſince executed on the Proteſtants
to the full, and their fiction that one of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
had threatned to blow them up; (whereupon a Committee
was appointed to ſearch under the Parliament Houſe for Powder) was
only a Trick to diſcover the Stores, for when they found none
there, they continued their importunity, to ſee where the Magazine
was, and were diſcontented at the denial.</p>
                  <p>As for the Chimera of bringing Ten Thouſand <hi>Scots</hi> to force the
Papiſts to change Religion, and the Speech <hi>that</hi> Ireland <hi>would never
be well without a Rebellion, to the end the Natives might be Extirpated;</hi>
it is no wonder the Remonſtrants whoſe thoughts were full of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpations,
which they have too fully effected, ſhould think the like
deſigned by others, but that it is incredible that the Perſons named,
whoſe Eſtates are in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Families are ſetled there, ſhould
diſturb that <hi>Peace</hi> they have ſo long endeavoured to Eſtabliſh, or
ſhould deſire a Rebellion, which would be <hi>doubtfull in Succeſs,</hi> but <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in Deſolation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in like manner ridiculous is the Story of Wagers, the truth
of which is, that at the Sheriffs Table at <hi>Wexford</hi> Aſſizes, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
propoſed to a Papiſt, <hi>that he would give him Five Pounds,
and the other ſhould give him Fifty Pounds for it, if he did not come to
Church within a Twelve Month,</hi> whereat the Papiſt not underſtanding
the Joke, ſeemed ſurprized, and proteſted he would not come to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65997:452"/>
Church within that time; why then ſays a Third Perſon you will
loſe the Fifty Pound, for it is to be paid if you dont; whereat the
Jeſt was underſtood, and it became matter of laughter there, though
it be one of the Grievances here, pickt up to ſtuff this Remonſtrance,
and one of the Grounds to juſtifie their bloody Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>The Poſition <hi>that Ireland if named is obliged by an Engliſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
affects the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as much as the <hi>Papists</hi> of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
however it ought to be decided by <hi>Arguments,</hi> and not by
<hi>Arms;</hi> Nor ſhould the Reſolution of that Point be written in the
Blood of ſo many murthered Innocents; but how the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants
ſhould before their Rebellion have notice of any Intention or
Proteſtation of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to introduce a Law for
extirpation of Popery, is very unaccountable; becauſe the Vote that
did paſs <hi>was ſubſequent to the Inſurrections of the Iriſh,</hi> and in Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of their inhuman Cruelties; Nor in truth were the <hi>Iriſh</hi> afraid
of any Hardſhips from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who lived amongſt them, even
with ſuch kindneſs and confidence, as hath proved fatal to the whole
party.</p>
                  <p>And though now they pretend that the Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are violated by ſending for a Sitting Member to anſwer an
Impeachment in <hi>England;</hi> yet when that Point was debated in the
Caſe of Sir <hi>George Ratcliff,</hi> who craved the Aid and Protection of
the Houſe; then one of theſe Remonſtrants could adviſe the Houſe
<hi>to take no notice of it,</hi> leſt any variance ſhould ariſe between the
two Parliaments; but when the Proteſtant was ſent over, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they inſtructed their Committee, to ſollice and ſettle that Point
for the future.</p>
                  <p>To the ſeventh, the readineſs in His Majeſty to hear their Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
(which they confeſs) ſhould have obliged them to Loyalty and
Obedience to him, and at leaſt Neighbourlike Demeanour to his
Subjects, and not to ſcandalize His Majeſty through his Miniſters
by falſe Accuſations againſt them; for the Lords Juſtices did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hinder the going of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Committee to <hi>England,</hi> nor ſend
any after them to croſs or impede their Deſign, nor in any Caſe
miſinform His Majeſty: But on the contrary, when they received a
Commiſſion dated the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1640, to continue, ptorogue
or determine the Parliament as they thought fit; they believing that
the Parliament deſigned the general good of the Kingdom, not
only continued it, but alſo gave it all the Countenance they could;
So that a Noble Peer moved in the Lord's Houſe, That it might be
recorded to remain to Poſterity, <hi>That the Lords Juſtices had always
ohearfully received their Requeſts and Meſſages, and wers ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with them;</hi> and ſince the Remonſtrants by His Majeſties Order
had view of all the Private Letters; if they could have found any
ſuch miſinformation as they complained of, they would have inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it to His Majeſty, and not give him <hi>Suppoſitions</hi> for <hi>Gertainties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to the Power of Judicature of the Houſe of Lords in Caſes
Capital, His Majeſty wrote to know whether there were any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
of it, and the Lords Juſtices (having conſulted the Upper
Houſe) returned a true Anſwer, <hi>that none were to be found;</hi> nor
do the Remonſtrants regard that Power; but at that Juncture (their
party being prevalent,) they thought they had an Opportunity to get
rid of ſome of His Majeſties <hi>Engliſh Judges and Officers,</hi> whom they
cannot endure to bear rule over them, though they ſaw the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
proſpered above any former Times, under their Labour and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65997:452"/>
Travel. And it is untrue, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did envy the good
Union of both Houſes; on the contrary, they laboured to cheriſh
and confirm it; but if any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> oppoſed the Remonſtrants up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any point, (how reaſonable ſoever) they preſently clamour,
<hi>that it is done out of Malice againſt them and the Nation,</hi> which is an
unjuſt Obloquy; and though the <hi>Pupiſts</hi> made daily Cabals, yet the
Proteſtant Members never had but one private Meeting, and that
without the Lords Juſtices knowledge, and at that Meeting there
were ſome <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the Deſign of it was, to prevent an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
intended by ſome of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> againſt thoſe that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Grand Inquiſition of the Kings Title to <hi>Conaugth;</hi>
the Plantation of which Province with <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Natives abhorred,
as that which would have fruſtrated all their Evil Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Seſſion of the 11<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1641, it continued very
long, <hi>viz.</hi> to the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> and was unprofitably ſpent in
Proteſtations, Declarations, Votes upon Queries, the Stay of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
from going over Seas, and private Petitions; and it is untrue
that there was any Certainty of the Committees being at the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide
at the Time of Adjornment; ſo on the 14<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the
Lords Juſtices ſent to both Houſes to conſider of a Time of Adjorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe the Harveſt was approaching and the Houſe was thin,
and on the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the Commons deſired the Adjornment might
be delayed till the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>August;</hi> and on the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the
Lords licenſed the Judges to go their Circuits, and the ſame Day
the Commons deſired the Adjornment might be from the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi>
to the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> to which the Lords agreed; and on the
5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> a Committee of both Houſes attended the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
with notice thereof, and they conſented thereunto by Order
to be entred in the Houſes as by their conſent. On the 6<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> there arrived the Earl of <hi>Roſcomon,</hi> with a Letter from the
Committee, importing that they were buſie about their Diſpatch
at <hi>London;</hi> whereupon the Lords ſent to the Commons, that they
continued their Opinion for the Adjornment, and accordingly they
did adjourn the next Day; ſo that there is no Ground for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
on the Lords Juſtices, that they threatned to prorogue them,
or purpoſed to prevent the paſſing the Graces (not then arrived)
into Acts. <hi>But thoſe Remonſtrants having broken Faith with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and all his faithful Subjects, do take liberty to aſperſe his Governors,
and well affected Officers, whom they deſire for ill Ends to make odious
to the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They cloſe this Article with an Untruth; for the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
did immediatly after the Arrival of the Committee, write to
all the Ports of the Kingdom, with Briefs of the Graces concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matters of Cuſtoms, commanding the Officers to obey thoſe
Directions; they alſo publiſhed Proclamations for tranſporting
Wool, and what Cuſtoms were payable for the ſame. They ſent
Warrants for free Entries of Tobacco, and what Cuſtoms were
payable for it; they gave Order for a Bill to be drawn, for a Repeal
of the preamble of the Act of Subſidies; they alſo deſired Sir <hi>James
Mongomery,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> to give notice to the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> of the Graces intended to them; and they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſent over the Bill for a General pardon, and moſt of the reſt of
the Graces were to be executed in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and reſpected the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Courts there, for which the Approaching Term was the
proper Seaſon: But the Remonſtrants had not patience to expect
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65997:453"/>
that, <hi>but reſolved to be their own Carvers, and diſpoſe of the King's
Revenue, and the Proteſtants Eſtates, as they thought fit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Eighth Article, the prodigious Tale of the Petition is
untrue; <hi>And but that theſe Remonſtrants care not what Detractions, how
untrue and improbable ſoever, they print or publiſh againſt thoſe they hate,</hi>
they would not have averred this Story without producing a Copy
of a Petition ſigned by ſo many Thouſands; but the Truth is, the
four Perſous named had no hand in any Petition; but there was indeed
a Petition which reflected more upon the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> than the <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Clergy; but as ſoon as the Lords Juſtices had notice of it, they got
the Original into the Clerk of the Councils Office, where it ſtill
lies.</p>
                  <p>What Sir <hi>John Clotworthy</hi> did or ſaid in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>
was not known to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor is it material;
nor do they believe that any thing was then moved, plotted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
againſt the Remonſtrants, or that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
any deſtructive Courſe againſt them, till after the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
begun; though the Remonſtrants <hi>by confounding Times,</hi> would uſe
it as a Cover for their inhuman Perpetrations.</p>
                  <p>As for the Statute of 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Remonſtrants find fault with it,
becauſe by repealing by Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Act of Repeal, it revives the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Statutes made by <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th,</hi> againſt Papal Incroachments and
Uſurpations; without which, the Papiſts being diſſolved from their
dependence on the King's Auchority in matters Eccleſiaſtical, would
tranſfer <hi>that half of his Sovereignty</hi> to the Pope, who might diſcharge
their Allegiance in civil Cauſes, as he hath often done here and
elſewhere; for as to the Penal part, that Statute mitigates the
Crime <hi>of Advancing foreign Juriſdiction,</hi> which being Treaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is by that Act not made Treaſon, till the third Offence after
two Convictions; and as to that part of the Statute about Officers,
and ſuers of Livery, to take the Oath of Supremacy; they have
found ſo many Inſtances of His Majeſties indulgence to them in
that particular, that it is ingratitude in them to complain.</p>
                  <p>And if they mean the ſecond Chapter of <hi>ſecundo Eliz.</hi> it is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that what Noiſe ſoever that Statute hath made, yet <hi>it hath done
very little Execution;</hi> but the Complaint, <hi>as if thoſe Statutes were
forged, or had lain dormant till moſt of the Members of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were dead,</hi> is of all other the moſt ſhameleſs; for thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
were publiſhed in print with the reſt, <hi>Anno</hi> 16<hi>Eliz.</hi> and
were ſoon after (too ſparingly indeed) put in Execution, as appears
by the Records; but 'tis true, the ſecond Chapter could not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
<hi>becauſe the Papiſts univerſally came to Church,</hi> till of later Days,
and the Name of <hi>Recuſant</hi> was not then known: But afterwards,
when <hi>Popery</hi> became more bold and dangerous, that Act was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
put in Execution, but without danger to any Man's Life or
Eſtate, for the Penalty was but Nine Pence a Sunday, and the Laws
in <hi>England</hi> againſt Popery are very much more ſevere; and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſlender Ground, and the vile Fiction of ſending 10000 <hi>Scots,</hi>
(which was never thought of till long after the Rebellion broke
out) do theſe Remonſtrants pretend to juſtify their Inſurrection,
which nevertheleſs themſelves (in their Declaration in Parliament,
the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1641.) have confeſſed to be traiterous and
rebellions, and at the ſame time pretended an Abhorrence of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
Murthers and Outrages of the Rebels, which now they
palliate, <hi>as a forced taking up of Arms in their own own Defence, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65997:453"/>
Gentlemen:</hi> Neither was that Declaration forced from them,
but paſſed in due courſe and order, and at their own requeſt,
tho' ſome of them would have couch'd it in ſofter terms, for fear the
Rebels might recriminate, but they were outvoted, without either
violence or threatnings, as is moſt falſly ſuggeſted.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it true that the <hi>Northern</hi> Rebels ever ſent any Addreſs to
the <hi>State,</hi> except the preſumptuous Propoſition from thoſe of <hi>Cavan,</hi>
which was favourably received, as hath been already related; but it
is wiſely done of the Remonſtrants to paſs ſlightly over the Maſſacre
in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> ſince it is not poſſible to juſtifie that barbarous Cruelty.</p>
                  <p>In the Proclamation of the 23 of <hi>October,</hi> there is no mention of the
Proroguing the Parliament; and becauſe ſome of the <hi>Pale</hi> did quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
at the words <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> as if themſelves were included therein,
the Lords Juſtices iſſued a Second Proclamation to ſatisfie them in that
Point; and tho' there was a neceſſity of Proroguing the Parliament,
to avoid concourſe to <hi>Dublin</hi> in that dangerous time, yet it was not
done without the Kings ſpecial Warrant for it, who deſign'd that
the Lord Lieutenant ſhould be preſent at the <hi>Seſſion;</hi> and tho' the
Kings Order was to Prorogue it to the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> yet
to comply with the Importunity of ſome of the Remonſtrants, <hi>who
were then thought Faithful to the Government,</hi> the Members were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to meet the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and Adjorn'd to the 16<hi>th.</hi> and
then Sat two days, and ſhortned the Prorogation to the 11<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary;</hi>
and tho' in that ſhort <hi>Seſſion,</hi> and that troubleſome time, it
was impoſſible to paſs any of the Graces into Acts, yet the Lords
Juſtices did then acquaint the Houſes, <hi>That His Majeſty would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from any of his former favours promiſed to them, for ſetling their
Eſtates to ſuch as ſhould remain faithful and Loyal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That as to Armed men, it was no other than hath been in all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
there before and ſince, <hi>viz.</hi> the Garriſon of the Caſtle of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> (in which the Parliament ſits) always makes a Guard for
the Chief Governor and Members of Parliament, but neither uſed
Threats, committed Violence, or preſented their Muſquets, as is
unſincerly and untruly ſuggeſted; nor could the Remonſtrants appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
any danger from this mark of reſpect ſhewn them by the Guard,
if their own inward Guilt had not begat Jealouſies in them, of what
others never thought of; for if the Lords Juſtices would have ſeiz'd
the Perſons of ſome of the Remonſtrants upon juſt Suſpitions and
violent Preſumptions, what hindred them? certainly nothing, <hi>but a
hopes by mildneſs and good uſage, to ſettle and fix their ſtaggering Loyalty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is ſtrange that the Remonſtrants pretend that any part of
the Kingdom was quiet, when it appears by <hi>Mac Mahon</hi>'s Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>that the Conſpiracy was univerſal,</hi> and that the great Towns and
Cities would revolt, <hi>as ſoon after they did,</hi> except where the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Inhabitants, or his Majeſties Soldiers were too ſtrong for them;
and Collonel <hi>Plunket</hi> aver'd, <hi>That all the Catholick Lords had contracted
under their hands to joyn in this Inſurrection,</hi> which indefinite expreſſion
muſt be underſtood to intend <hi>all thoſe that did afterwards unite with the
Rebels,</hi> which were indeed all but a very few; and he wrote to the
Lord <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Melifont,</hi> that he had been a means to incite <hi>the Lords
and Gentlemen of the Pale</hi> to appear in the <hi>bleſſed Cauſe</hi> then in hand,
and would uſe his endeavours night and day, <hi>ad majorem Dei gloriam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is to be obſerv'd, that the Collonels <hi>John Barry, Taaf, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
Barry,</hi> and <hi>Porter,</hi> (who had Warrants to tranſport four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and were therein Aſſiſted by the Lords Juſtices) did upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65997:454"/>
pretences defer it till the 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> and ſoon after <hi>Garret
Barret</hi> and his whole Regiment, and moſt of the reſt of the Soldiers
went into Rebellion; and if we add the general diſcourſe amongſt
the Rebels in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> on the 23<hi>d.</hi> and 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> exfreſſing to
the plunder'd <hi>Engliſh</hi> an aſſurance that <hi>Dublin</hi> was taken, and the like
mutterings in <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Conaught,</hi> and the antecedent Threats of a
general Rebellion, and their Conſultations at <hi>Multifernam</hi> mentioned
in Doctor <hi>Jones</hi> his Examination, it will be manifeſt <hi>that the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was general and premeditated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Remonſtrants ſuggeſt that the Lords Juſtices applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſuch powerful Members of Parliament as oppoſed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
which is like the reſt, for at that time the King was in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and there was no difference between his Majeſty and the Parliament,
except in relation to the Earl of <hi>Strafford, whom the Remonſtrants moſt
violently proſecuted;</hi> beſides, the Lords Juſtices did not ſent to the
Parliament at firſt, but on the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> ſent one Expreſs to the
King, and another to the Lord Lieutenant according to his Majeſties
former Orders; and ſeeing themſelves by the generality of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
neceſſitated to invoke all Powers that could Aſſiſt them, they
did on the 5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and not before, write to the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and to the Speakers of both Houſes, and they ſent Duplicates of
thoſe diſpatches to his Majeſty the very ſame day.</p>
                  <p>And tho' it was the higheſt reaſon that could be, that the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
ſhould firſt Arm the Proteſtant Subjects whom they might confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
for the defence of their own Lives and the Government, yet they
did alſo iſſue Arms to ſuch <hi>Papiſts</hi> as they had any hope of, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
1700 Arms to thoſe of the <hi>Pale,</hi> ſome of which were recovered
again, but moſt of them were perfidiouſly made uſe of againſt the
<hi>State;</hi> neither were the Catholick Inhabitants of <hi>Dublin</hi> Diſarm'd,
until thoſe of the <hi>Pale</hi> had declared themſelves in Rebellion, and then
their Alliance and Correſpondence with the others made that Action
neceſſary; Arms were likewiſe ſent to <hi>Wexford, Waterford,</hi> and <hi>Trim,</hi>
and Letters of Encouragement to thoſe places, and to <hi>Gallway.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Order of Parliament to Pardon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> was publiſh'd in Print
the 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and diſperſed into all parts of the Kingdom,
but without any more effect, than the Lords Juſtices Proclamation of
Pardon of the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> met with, and the Lords Juſtices Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Firſt of <hi>November</hi> to Pardon thoſe of the Counties of
<hi>Louth, Weſtmeath, Meath,</hi> and <hi>Longford,</hi> except Freeholders and
Murderers, was drawn by Mr. <hi>Nicholas Plunket</hi> and other Members of
Parliament, and thereupon ſome few ſubmitted, but never reſtor'd
what they had plunder'd from the Proteſtants, <hi>but ſoon after Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
into Rebellion again;</hi> neither did they ſhew any more reſpect to
<hi>his Majesties own Proclamation</hi> under his Royal Signet; nor indeed had
they any inclination to ſubmit, until they were baffled before <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda,</hi>
and his Majeſties Army was Maſter of the Field; why then ſhould
the Lords Juſtices, who every day expected the Lord Lieutenant, and
had no Order to Pardon Murthers, proſtitute his Majeſties mercy to
thoſe obſtinate Rebels that did deſpiſe and affront it? However, as
they were far from aiming at the Rebels Eſtates, ſo they gave them
demonſtration of their Moderation and Indulgence, even to a fault,
in their favours to the Earl of <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> Sir <hi>Morgan Cavenagh,</hi>
Sir <hi>Luke Fitz Girald,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Harpoole,</hi> and <hi>O Farrell</hi> Sheriff of the
County of <hi>Longford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65997:454"/>
But with what Face can they complain of Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi>'s March
to <hi>Wicklow,</hi> to relieve that Caſtle Beſieged by the Rebels, ſince that
was not till the 27<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> before which time <hi>all the County
was in open Rebellion,</hi> and all the <hi>Engliſb</hi> plunder'd, and all the Caſtles
and Towns ſurpriz'd, two only excepted? neither did he execute
but one Woman, who had ſome of the plunder'd goods about her,
and thirteen Men notoriouſly Guilty; and what elſe were ſlain, were
killed in Battle; and it is a wonder the Gentry of the <hi>Pale</hi> can ſo
far forget their <hi>Birth,</hi> as to expreſs a concern for thoſe antient Tories
and old Enemies of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> whoſe Incurſions into the <hi>Pale</hi> were in
a great meaſure prevented by this March; certainly there would be no
concern in this Caſe, if it were not for the <hi>Confederacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to the Affair of <hi>Santry,</hi> which the Remonſtrants would In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate
was ſufficient to raiſe a whole County in Six hours, <hi>that in ſix
Weeks before could not raiſe Sixty men to ſerve the King,</hi> or prevent the
murder of <hi>Derrick Hubbert,</hi> and other Proteſtants; it was nakedly
thus: A Lieutenant without any Orders, on the 5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi>
went out with Forty men, upon information that ſome of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
of <hi>Hubbert</hi> were at <hi>Santry,</hi> and finding there Four ſtrangers
with Arms newly come thither, he ſlew them and went in farther
ſearch of the reſt he expected to find thereabouts; and he ſtill affirms
that theſe Four were Rebels, tho' others ſay that one of them was a
<hi>Proteſtant;</hi> but at worſt it was but an unlucky miſtake, and no cauſe of
a general Rebellion, eſpecially ſince the Lords Juſtices, on the 13<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>December,</hi> ſent them a true account of the matter. Moreover, <hi>Luke
Netervills</hi> Summons, and his Liſting and Arraying of Soldiers, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this accident at <hi>Santry;</hi> and it was impoſſible for Twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of them to meet in the poſture they did on the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi>
at <hi>Swords,</hi> if there had not been proviſion made beforehand for it;
however on the 9<hi>th.</hi> the Lords Juſtices ſent them a civil Meſſage to
depart, and Protection for Seven of them to come to them to <hi>Dublin;</hi>
but they kept the Meſſenger that night, and ſent a Mutinous Letter
next morning, demanding ſecurity of their Lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being
granted, they deſpiſed, and continued in that Seditious manner
Robbing and Spoiling the Proteſtants until the 10<hi>th.</hi> deſtroying the
Country, and threatning even <hi>Dublin</hi> it ſelf; and in order to ſtraiten
the City, they ſent Parties to <hi>Clantarf, Finglaſs,</hi> and <hi>Santry;</hi> at
<hi>Clantarf</hi> they Robbed and Spoiled two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Barques, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to burn all the Veſſels in the Harbour, and the owner of the
Town <hi>George King</hi> was in the Rebels Camp at <hi>Swords,</hi> ſo that it was
of abſolute neceſſity to diſlodge them thence, and accordingly the 15<hi>th</hi>
of <hi>December,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> did defeat the Rebels and recovered ſome
of the plundered Goods and burned the Village, and on the 22<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>December,</hi> the Rebels were likewiſe beaten from <hi>Finglaſs</hi> and <hi>Santry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Lords Juſtices by their diſpatch to the Parliament, did
ſuggeſt their Fears, that the Maſſacre was deſign'd againſt the <hi>old
Engliſh,</hi> and that therefore the <hi>old Engliſh,</hi> and even <hi>Iriſh</hi> that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Loyal, ſhould be encouraged to raiſe Men in defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by promiſes of Honourable Reward; and by their Letter of the
2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> they did Invite the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to
conſult of the beſt means to ſtop the Rebellion: So far were they
from putting any neceſſity upon thoſe of the <hi>Pale</hi> to be Rebels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and what anſwer thoſe Lords gave, and what was done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
is mentioned at large in this Hiſtory.</p>

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65997:455"/>
That Sir <hi>James Dillon</hi> who gathered near Two Thouſand Men
under pretence of carrying them to <hi>Spain,</hi> and had at his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
received Fifty Arms from the <hi>Government</hi> for his defence,
not only refuſed to ſuppreſs the Rebels of the County of <hi>Longford,</hi>
but alſo joyned with them himſelf, <hi>and made uſe of his Majeſties Arms
againſt thoſe that lent them to him: Dundalk</hi> and a Foot Company in it
Surrendered upon the Firſt Summons, and <hi>Drogheda</hi> had done the
like if the Lord <hi>Moor had</hi> not prevented it; and on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
the Lord of <hi>Louth</hi> delivered up <hi>his Commiſſion to Govern that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and ſoon after went into Rebellion. The County of <hi>Wicklow</hi>
broke out the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> as <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Caterlagh</hi> did on
the 21<hi>th;</hi> and the Country of <hi>Louth</hi> on the 24<hi>th,</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> about
the ſame time; ſo that they were all engaged before any thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
either at <hi>Clantarf</hi> or at <hi>Santry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Read,</hi> it is true, Three Lords and
Four Gentlemen, did joyn in a Petition in the beginning of <hi>January,</hi>
and did pretend to ſend <hi>Read</hi> with it to the King; but though he
preſſed to be diſpatched, yet they delayed it Three Months, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſucceſs of the Siege of <hi>Tredagh;</hi> which proving unfortunate
to them, <hi>Read</hi> was taken Priſoner, and was (not without preſident)
Racked for the diſcovery of things ſo highly conducing to the ſafety
of a Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>To the Tenth, the Lords Juſtices did never give any ſuch direction
to the Lord Preſident of <hi>Munster,</hi> as is untruly ſuggeſted; much
leſs would they do it whilſt the Province was quiet, the Peace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they ſought by all means to provide for. Neither would he have
obeyed any ſuch unrighteous and half Command, himſelf being a
Native of that Kingdom, and allyed to the <hi>Old Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
and in all things lovingly affected to the People as long as they
could be contained in their duty; neither was he provided with
Neceſſaries to begin a War, nor would ever have entred into it,
if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had not been the Aggreſſors.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, he conſtantly gave the Lords Juſtices no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Quiet condition of his Province, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Loyal Diſpoſition of the Lord of <hi>Muskry,</hi> who by
reiterated Oaths had ſworn to continue therein; ſo that the
Lords Juſtices ſent particular Letters of Thanks and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<hi>to that Lord,</hi> to whom the Preſident likewiſe gave ſome
Arms; and there were Commiſſions of Government and Martial
Law ſent to the Natives of that <hi>Province</hi> as well as to thoſe of the
<hi>Pale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Leinſter</hi> Rebels invaded the County of <hi>Waterford</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>December,</hi> and though when the Preſident Routed them, he
found many of his Provincials amongſt them; yet he let them go,
as ſuppoſing they came to look after their Cattle. But by the end
of that Month, <hi>the whole Province was in open Rebellion;</hi> and yet it
was not until <hi>February</hi> that the Lords Juſtices ſent their <hi>poſitive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
to <hi>proſecute</hi> thoſe wilful Rebels with Fire and Sword; and in the
latter end of <hi>February,</hi> the Preſident publiſhed his Majeſties Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
under his own Hand and Signet, but without effect, for the
Rebels ſaid <hi>that it was Counterfeit,</hi> and rejected it. But Arguments
are vain when the thing itſelf manifeſts the truth, and if ever in
any caſe, certainly 'tis in this, that <hi>Res ipſa loquitur,</hi> and that the
Preſident was not the Aggreſſor; for he had neither Men, Mony,
Ammunition or Arms, or any other Proviſion of War fit to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65997:455"/>
conteſt with ſo numerous an Enemy, that were fledged with the
Spoils and Riches of <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and it is undeniable that the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
began to plunder even in great Numbers, and Armed in a War like
manner, and at Noon day; but perhaps the Remonſtrants think, that
is not a Commencement of War.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>Conaught</hi> the caſe was far different from <hi>Munſter,</hi> though
the Remonſtrants (<hi>not caring whether right or wrong</hi>) have mingled both
Provinces in the ſame accuſation; for the Preſident of <hi>Conaught</hi> was
then at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> when he went
to <hi>Athlone,</hi> he found many of his Provincials (whereof ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
in open Rebellion, who had committed many Murders, and
more Robberies, he preſently endeavoured a Treaty with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
that had not yet declared, preſuming on his Alliance to ſome of
them, and his former private Friendſhip with them, but all in vain;
ſo that his Caſe was miſerable, being ſurrounded with Multitudes
of Rebels, who took the Town, and kept him Beſieged in the Caſtle
of <hi>Athlone</hi> all that Winter: His whole force in the Province was
but a Troop and a half of Horſe, moſt <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and Six half Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Foot, whereof One was Surprized, and another ſent to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin;</hi>
ſo that he was in no condition to reſcue the Diſtreſled <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
and much leſs to make any offenſive War on the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or by any
cruelty to force them into Rebellion, as they have moſt untruly
ſuggeſted. The Lords Juſtices did alſo ſend Commiſſions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to the Lords of <hi>Clanrickard, Mayo</hi> and <hi>Coſtilo,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
of Martial Law to ſome of the beſt of the <hi>Natives,</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Clanrickard</hi> did aſſure the <hi>Iriſh</hi> of his Majeſties condeſcention to
the Graces; and yet all this could not prevent nor ſuppreſs their
Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>To the Eleventh, Whether the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> have equal
Power and Priviledges with the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Statute can bind <hi>Ireland,</hi> is fitter to be diſputed by
Arguments than Arms; but it is falſe that the Act of Adventurers
in <hi>England</hi> was grounded or occaſioned by any miſinformations from
<hi>Ireland.</hi> Nor doth it extend to other Eſtates than thoſe of the moſt
Deteſtable and Sanguinolent Traitors that ever were heard of,
and therefore the Loyal Remonſtrants ſhould not be concerned; but
admitting the Act unjuſt, yet it was <hi>ſubſequent</hi> to the Rebellion, and
ſo could not be a <hi>cauſe</hi> of it: Nor can we believe it was <hi>forced</hi> upon
his Majeſty, it being for his own advantage, and for the benefit of
his Beloved and ever Loving People; and if his Majeſty ſhould loſe
by it at preſent, yet he loſes to Loyal and obedient Subjects,
who will in time reprize him, as well by ſaving charge and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
Danger and Rebellion, as by ſtraining themſelves at any
time for his Majeſties Honour and Profit. And ſince there is no
Authority nor Command Civil or Military in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but what is
derived from his Majeſties Authority, and acts in obedience to it,
'tis ſtrange that the Remonſtrants ſhould cloſe this Article, with a
loud and known untruth to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>To the Twelfth, That the Proclamations enjoyning Strangers to
leave the City were iſſued not only upon ſound Reaſons and good
cauſe ſince approved of by his Majeſty, but alſo were publiſhed <hi>at
the request of the Popiſh Inhabitants of</hi> Dublin; however no Perſon of
Quality or Credit was affronted thereby, but were civilly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ſtay. And the Third Proclamation, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the 11<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>November,</hi> was deſigned to ſend the Gentry home, to keep the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65997:456"/>
quiet, unleſs they had cauſe of ſtay in the City; however not ſo
much as one Gentleman was either threatned or puniſhed for diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
thereunto: But many (and even ſome Citizens that had liberty
to ſtay in <hi>Dublin</hi>) went voluntarily, and did joyn with the Rebels;
and now they cover their Treaſon with a pretence <hi>that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to go:</hi> And it is not true that any of the Rebels offered to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
until after the relief of <hi>Tredagh,</hi> when his Majeſties Army was
Maſter of the Field; nor that any of the Cizens were pillaged, or
their Goods ſeized until after the Remonſtrants were in open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:
Nor then with the conſent of the <hi>Government,</hi> who did
what it could to prevent and puniſh Pillaging, as by their ſeveral
Proclamations may appear. And as the Lords Juſtices did nothing
without the Council, ſo neither did they countenance any diſorder;
nevertheleſs they are not accountable for all the Irregular acts of an
ill paid Army, eſpecially againſt Rebels that had given ſuch barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
provocations.</p>
                  <p>That the Lords Juſtices did give Commiſſion to two Papiſts that
deſired it, to treat with the Rebels; but that indulgence (as the
reſt) was abuſed to baſe ends, and produced nothing of the effect
propos'd, and that no Houſes were willingly burnt, unleſs they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to Perſons in open Rebellion; and for Protections the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
granted very few, having found by Experience, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections
always turn'd to his Majeſties diſadvantage,</hi> becauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
underhand relieve the Rebels, and when they find a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
do themſelves <hi>relapſe.</hi> However thoſe few Protections that
were granted, were punctually obſerved, and the publick Faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
violated by the Lords Juſtices connivance or conſent; and when
it was diſcovered, that the Protected did Murther ſtragling Soldiers,
and carry Powder <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Rebels, their Paſſes were revoked and
ſuperſeded by publick Proclamation, and timely notice given them,
and no man ſuffered <hi>quatenus</hi> a <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> unleſs he
were alſo a <hi>Rebel,</hi> as they generally were. Nor ought the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants
to complain even of the unjuſtifiable inſolence of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<hi>ſince all inconveniences conſequential to the Rebellion, and occaſioned
by it, are juſtly chargeable on thoſe that begun it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to ſuch Slaughters as have happened amongſt the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
in the courſe of a juſt War, and in defence and neceſſary
Preſervation of an innocent People, they are no Murthers, but the
juſt Chaſtiſements of a Religious Prince on unnatural Rebels, and
do not amount to the Tenth part of the number they Murdered in
cold Blood, and without Provocation.</p>
                  <p>To the Thirteenth, It is ſtrange that thoſe who are ſo angry at
the Sitting of the Parliament and the Courts of Juſtice, and have
overturn'd all Laws, and plucked them up by the Roots, ſhould yet
keep ſuch a ſtir about <hi>Fundamental Laws,</hi> or that they ſhould think
themſelves <hi>genuine Members</hi> of Parliament, which is a Court of Peace
and Order, who have rent aſunder all Bonds of Peace, Order and
Humane Society; can they imagine, that becauſe they will Rebel,
we muſt have no Courts of Juſtice? will nothing ſatisfy them, but
an univerſal concurrence in <hi>Confuſion?</hi> and is it becauſe they are guilty
of ſo many crimes themſelves, that they take liberty to ſpeak evil of
all others? If this be the <hi>Liberty</hi> they Fight for, certainly they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe
a very bad cauſe; however it is better than <hi>Liberty of extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
the Proteſtants,</hi> which is what they really aimed at.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65997:456"/>
But they have no reaſon to complain of the Proteſtant Members
of Parliaments, either of his Majeſties or his Fathers time; they
have Repealed many Acts that were prejudicial to the <hi>Natives,</hi>
but never made any that were ſo. Are not the Perſons they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
to have been Indicted in the King's Bench, guilty of the Crimes
they are accuſed of? Have not thoſe Soldiers that were Jurors, Free-hold
in the proper Counties, and are they not capable to be Jurors
according to Law? Theſe Remonſtrants cannot deny theſe things,
and that their Rebellion forced theſe Gentlemen to be Soldiers; and
yet they complain, as if it were unjuſt and a grievance.</p>
                  <p>But the allegation that any body under Protection or the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith was tryed for his Life is not true, nor can they inſtance
one; and their Proteſtation againſt the Proceedings of Parliament
is frivilous and vain: And their deſire to have a New, (which they
call a Free) Parliament, whereunto they may be choſe, hath infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
inconveniences in it; for then theſe Criminals will be acquitted,
and manage the moſt weighty affairs, and either exclude or outvote
the Loyal Proteſtant Subjects, which have ſtuck by the Crown in
this time of danger. But the truth is, that the Rebels have Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and Baniſhed ſo many of the Proteſtant Free-holders and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of Corporations, that there can be very few, if any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in a new Parliament at this time; whereby it would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that what Proteſtants are left undevoured by the Sword,<note place="margin">☜</note> ſhould
be deſtroyed by colour of Juſtice, purſuant to their Oath of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy.
And as to the place, <hi>Dublin</hi> wants no other convenience
but that of giving opportunity to Awe or Surprize the Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and the Members of Parliament; and as to the Perſon, that
Nation doth not yield a Perſon of more honour and fortune than
the preſent Lord Lieutenant, the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond.</hi> And as to
<hi>Poynings</hi> Act, the Repeal or Suſpenſion of it is deſired to deprive the
King of the Advice of his Privy Councils of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
if it were done, perhaps they would without his Majeſties Knowledge
transfer the <hi>Spiritual half of his Sovereignty</hi> to the Pope, and attaint
his Proteſtant Subjects, and eſtabliſh their <hi>Supream Council,</hi> and alter
the very form of Government; but to be ſure they would acquit
themſelves, and deprive his Majeſty of all the Forfeitures belonging
to him by their attainders; and therefore it is unfit at this time by
ſuſpending that Act to make ſuch criminous Parties their own Judges.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Theſe Remonſtrants who ſo loudly clamour againſt others,
have nevertheleſs violated their own Publick Faith,<note place="margin">☜</note> in breach of
their Articles of the Ceſſation, by taking and detaining ſeveral Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Eſtates they were to reſtore by that agreement; and by not
paying any part of 30800 <hi>l.</hi> payable by thoſe Articles at the time
ſtipulated, and in not paying above half of it yet, to the Ruine of
the Army that wanted it, and depended upon it.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Henry Jones,</hi> Doctor in Divinity, in obedience to His Majeſties
Commiſſion, requiring an Account of the Loſſes of his Loyal
Subjects, wherein they ſuffered by the preſent Rebellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
Requiring alſo a Declaration of what traiterous Words, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
or Actions were done, ſaid or plotted by the Actors or Abetters
in that Rebellion; do make and give in this following Report of the
Premiſes, to the beſt of my knowledge. As for the preſent Rebellion,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65997:458"/>
howſoever the breaking out of this Fire into a Flame, began firſt
on the 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> yet was it ſmoking, as may well be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for many years before; God having given us many and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Grounds for the Diſcovery of it, had they been duly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or fully proſecuted to a diſcovery; of which kind we find theſe
following four particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. The firſt, that about three or four years ſince, amongſt many
Books brought into <hi>Limeriek</hi> from foreign yarts, and ſeized upon by
the Reverend Biſhop of that See, as probibited, being thereunto
authorized by the <hi>State,</hi> One had a written Addition to the firſt part
which was printed; the Manuſcript containing a Diſcourſe of the
Fryers of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Order, ſometimes ſeated in the Town of
<hi>Armagh</hi> in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> but by reaſon of the Times at that preſent reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(as that writing imported) in the City of <hi>Limerick</hi> in <hi>Munſter;</hi>
that while it flouriſhed at <hi>Armagh,</hi> it was protected and largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for by the then Earl of <hi>Tyrone;</hi> Since whoſe expulſion out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that Convent was alſo decayed, and driven to thoſe diſtreſſes
it did for the preſent undergo; but <hi>that within three years</hi> (this is
as I remember, the time limitied) <hi>Ireland ſhould find that he had a Son
inheriting his Fathers Vertues, who ſhould reſtore that Kingdom to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Liberty, and that Convent to its firſt Luſtre,</hi> or words to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
This was related unto me by that zealous and learned Prelate,
Doctor <hi>Webb,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Limerick,</hi> who ſaw and read the ſaid
paſſage; purpoſing as his Lordſhip told me, to ſend that Book to
the Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> to be taken into further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>2. Hereunto was added a ſecond paſſage, about the ſame time at
<hi>Limeriek</hi> aforeſaid; where a Popiſh Prieſt gave out, <hi>that within
three years, there ſhould not be a Proteſtant in</hi> Ireland, or words to
that purpose, with ſome other material Circumſtances, which I do
not now remember; yet all ſo concurring with the former, or the
firſt to this (for which preceeded I know not, both being about
one time) that it was thought fitting to be conſidered of, the
ſaid Prieſt being ſent unto the Lords Juſtices at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>3. The third did agree with the two former, and fell out about
the ſame time in the Country of <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi>
where <hi>Walter Nugent</hi> of <hi>Rathaſpeck,</hi> in the ſaid County, Eldeſt
Son the <hi>Walter Nugent</hi> Eſquire (a Man of great Fortunes) upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proteſtant, who was the Pariſh Clark of <hi>Rathaſpeck</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
with his Religion; and both ſpeaking Latin, the ſaid <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
uttered theſe words; <hi>Infratres Annos veniet tempus &amp; potentia
in Hibernia quando tu longe</hi> (likely meaning <hi>diu) pendebis in cruce
propter Diabolicam veſtram Religionem.</hi> The party to which this was
ſpoken, (feared the power of the man) and durſt not ſpeak of it, only
in private; yet being called upon, and examined juridically upon
Oath, he depoſed theſe words. And being demanded whether the
words were <hi>in Hiberniam,</hi> or <hi>Hibernia;</hi> the firſt importing an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
the other an Inſurrection at home; he depoſed the latter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
time given him to conſider of it. Theſe Examination were
ſent to Sir <hi>George Ratcliff; Newgent</hi> was ſent for, and committed to
the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and remained in long durance, but after was
diſmiſſed.</p>
                  <p>4. Hereunto was added the fourth, about the ſame time near the
<hi>Nass,</hi> about Twelve Miles from <hi>Dublin;</hi> where a Popiſh Preiſt newly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65997:459"/>
arrived out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> did make his Addreſs to the then Lord-Deputy,
and informed his Lordſhip of an intercourſe of Letters
between the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> with others in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and the Popiſh
Primate of <hi>Armagh, (Rely</hi>) concerning an Invaſion within a ſhort
time intended upon <hi>Ireland;</hi> the ſaid Prieſt offering, (ſo his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
might be ſecured) to direct ſuch as ſhould be thereunto appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to the place where the ſaid Letters were in the Cuſtody of the
ſaid <hi>Rely: Rely</hi> was thereupon ſent for, together with the Popiſh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car
General of <hi>Armagh;</hi> as I remember it, both were committed to
the ſaid Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> but ſoon after releaſed, and the informer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
with ten pounds, and a Suit of Cloaths or ſome ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>5. Hereunto may be further added another, not ſo plain as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
that about the ſame time the Lord Baron of <hi>Dunſany</hi> did ride
in diſguiſe throughout all the parts of <hi>Munster,</hi> pretending to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisie
his curioſity in the knowledge of Places and Perſons, he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcovered until his return at the <hi>Birr,</hi> where having offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be bound for one of his Company, he writ himſelf in his own
ſtile; being loath to leave under his Hand a teſtimony of his diſguiſed
Perſon and aſſumed Name.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto may be added a Motion made by the Recuſant Party in
the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for hindring the ſending away of certain
Colonels with their Forces raiſed in the Kingdom, and pretended to
be for Service of Foreign parts; many wondring it ſhould proceed
from them, but therein, conſidering theſe their former Practices
their intentions may be diſcovered to be far different from what others
conceived thereof, who aſſented thereunto; the imploying ſo many
Thouſands abroad, being a great weakening of the Forces they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for this their ſoon after following Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>To deſcend now from the Antecedents of this Treaſon, to the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in thereupon; and laſtly to the conſequents, and what thereby
hath been intended, ſuppoſing it to ſucceed, and that it attained the
deſired effect, which by them was not doubted of. And firſt for the
entrance thereinto; howſoever that the ground-work were long ſince
laid, yet would they not have it ſo to ſeem: But new occaſion muſt
be found, as the ſole Cauſe of their breaking Out; this being intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the ſatisfying the minds of ſuch of their own, as have not
hitherto been acquainted with the depth and myſtery of this iniquity,
that they might not ſtand amazed at the ſuddenneſs of the undertaking,
or ſtand off from joyning with them in the worſt part of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
it being an apparent Rebellion. The fitteſt means for this, muſt
have been by caſting aſperſions on the preſent Government, which
if long tolerated would prove extreamly dangerous, not only to their
Religion but their Lives and Poſterity. For effecting hereof, reports
were caſt out, that in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> the cutting off of
all the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> of what degree ſoever was concluded upon;
the Execution of that reſolution being committed to the Counſel in
<hi>Ireland.</hi> The Lords Juſtices (ſaid they) had laid down a day for this
work, being the 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> then next following, and now laſt
paſt or thereabouts; for the better, more ſecure and more ſecret
managing of this pretended Plot, ſuch of the Popiſh Nobility and
Gentry of both Houſes as appeared in Parliament at <hi>Dublin</hi> ſhould be
ſecured; And for the drawing together of the reſt amongſt other
pretences, this alledged to be one, That his Majeſties Rents were
purpoſely omitted and not called upon in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term, with that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65997:459"/>
earneſtneſs as formerly, and that ſuch as made default ſhould be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to appear in <hi>Michadmas</hi> Term at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and there ſurpriſed;
ſuch of them as were in the Country (wanting the Heads) being eaſily
cut off. They ſay that this pretended Plot was I know not how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to them; ſo that for the ſafety of their Lives and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they were inforced to ſtand upon their Guard, and to Counter-work
that day of the 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> laid for their Deſtruction,
by their declaring themſelves in Arms on the 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> a Month
before. The ſerious part of this diſcourſe was related to me by a
Fryar intimate in their Counſel, and by a Prieſt, a Popiſh Vicar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
thereby to give me ſatisfaction and to juſtifie their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
whoſe Names I do for the preſent forbear, In reſpect of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Service.</p>
                  <p>By others alſo it was informed, that this Plot was mainly intended
in that Seſſion of Parliament next after the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the manner concluded upon In the Popiſh private meetings,
which were then obſerved to be frequent, and by ſome ſuſpected
might prove dangerous, and that for diſcovery of what proviſion of
Arms and Ammunition our ſtore of <hi>Dublin</hi> afforded (it being by
ſome ſuſpected that moſt was ſent before to <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi>) one of the
Popiſh Faction in the Houſe of Commons, put one of the Proteſtant
Members to move,<note place="margin">☜</note> that ſome of the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> men had caſt
out ſome threatning Words againſt the Parliament in revenge of his
Lord, which could not be conceived to end in leſs than a Blowing up
of the whole Houſes of Parliament, the Store lying under them;
whereupon a Committee of both Houſes, many of them prime Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
were appointed to make ſearch in all the corners of the Store;
amongſt theſe the Lord <hi>Mac Guire</hi> was one who was obſerved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ocaſion to be liberal in diſpoſing of Mony to ſome of the Officers
of the Store, in a way more than was ordinary with him.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Seſſions of Parliament being Prorogued, and the time
drawing nigh for putting their deſign in Execution, there was a great
meeting appointed of the Heads of the Romiſh Clergy and other
Laymen of their Faction, ſaid to be at the Abby of <hi>Mullifarnam</hi> in
the County of <hi>Westmeath,</hi> where is a Convent of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
openly and peaceably poſſeſſed for many years laſt paſt; the day
of their meeting being alſo on their Saint <hi>Francis</hi> day, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>October</hi> laſt, but the time and place I cannot conſidently
affirm; yet howſoever the ſeveral opinions and diſcuſſions are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
like as I have received it from the ſaid Fryar, a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi>
and preſent there, being a Grardian of that Order; where among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things there debated, the queſtion was <hi>what courſe ſhould be
taken with the Engliſh</hi> and all others that were found in the whole
Kingdom to be Proteſtants?</p>
                  <p>The Council was therein divided.</p>
                  <p>1. Some were for their Baniſhment without attempting on their
lives, for this was given the Inſtance of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> expelling
out of <hi>Granado</hi> and other parts of his Dominions, the <hi>Moors</hi> to the
number of many Hundred thouſands, all of them beirg diſmiſſed with
their Lives, Wives and Children, with ſome part of their Goods (if
not the moſt part;) that this his way of proceeding redounded much
to the Honour of <hi>Spain;</hi> whereas the ſlaughter of many Innocents
wouls have laid an everlaſting blemiſh of Cruelty on that State; that
the like uſage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their Neighbors, and to whom many there
preſent owed (if no more) yet their education, would gain much
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65997:460"/>
to the cauſe both in <hi>England</hi> and other parts: That their Goods and
Eſtates Seized upon, would be ſufficient without medling with their
Perſons; that if the contrary courſe were taken, and their Blood
ſpilt, beſides the Curſe it would draw from Heaven upon their cauſe,
it might withal incenſe and provoke the Neighbor Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and that juſtly, to take a more ſevere revenge on them and theirs
even to extirpation if it had the upper hand.</p>
                  <p>2. On the other ſide was urged a contrary proceeding, to the utter
cutting off all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants; where to the Inſtances of the
diſmiſſed <hi>Moors</hi> it was anſwered, that that was ſole act of the
King and Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> contrary to the Advice of their Council,
which howſoever it might gain that Prince a name of Mercy, yet
therein the event ſhewed him to be moſt unmerciful, not only to his
own, but to all Chriſtendom beſides. That this was evident in the
great and exceſſive charge that <hi>Spain</hi> hath been ſince that time put
unto by theſe <hi>Moors</hi> and their Poſterity to this day. All Chriſtendom
alſo hath and doth ſtill groan under the miſeries it doth ſuffer by the
Piracies of <hi>Argiers, Sally</hi> and the like Dens of Thieves. That all this
might have been prevented in one hour <hi>by a general Maſſacre;</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that it was no leſs dangerous to expel the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> That theſe
Robbed and Baniſhed men might again return with Swords in their
hands, who by their hard uſage in ſpoiling might be exaſperated,
and by the hope of recovering their former Eſtates, would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
far more than ſtrangers that were ſent againſt them, being
neither in their Perſons injured nor grieved in their Eſtates; that
therefore <hi>a general Maſſacre</hi> was the ſafeſt and readieſt way for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kingdom of any ſuch fears.</p>
                  <p>3. In which diverſity of Opinions, howſoever the firſt prevailed
with ſome, for which the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> (ſaith this Fryer, one of their
Guardians) did ſtand, yet others inclined to the Second; ſome again
leaned to a Middle way, neither to diſmiſs nor kill.</p>
                  <p>And according to this do we find the event and courſe of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
In ſome places they are generally put to the Sword, or to
other Miſerable ends; ſome reſtrain their Perſons in durance, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be in their hands to diſpatch them at their pleaſures; in the
mena time they being reſerved eitheir for profit by their Ranſom, or
for exchange of Priſoners, or gaining their own Pardons by the lives
of their Priſoners, if Time would ſerve, or by their death (if the
worſt did happen) to ſatisfie their fury. The Third ſort at the firſt,
altogether diſmiſſed their Priſoners, but firſt having ſpoiled them of
their Goods, and after of their Raiment, expoſed the miſerable
wretches to Cold and Famine, whereby many have periſhed by deaths,
worſe than Sword or Halter.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of their Councils and the effects of them. Now for their
intentions, all being reduced (which God forbid) into their Power;
and thereof they do as by ſome Law, give ſuch peremptory conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that it may well be wondred the thoughts of men profeſſing
themſelves wiſe, ſhould be ſo vain; and herein I do ſtill follow mine
Informer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Their Loyalty to his Majeſty ſhall be ſtill reſerved. Thus
ſay they of the modeſt ſort; but both his Revenues and Government
muſt be reduced to certain bounds; His Rents none other than the
antient Reſervations before the Plantation, and the Cuſtoms ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as to them ſhall be thought fitting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65997:460"/>
Secondly, For the Government; ſuch as would be eſteemed Loyal,
would have it committed to the hands of two Lords Juſtices, one of
the antient <hi>Iriſh</hi> race, the other of the antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Inhabitants in
the Kingdom; <hi>Provided that they be of the Romiſh profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That a Parliament be forthwith called, conſiſting of
whom they ſhall think fit to be admitted, wherein their own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men ſhall be aſſiſtants.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Poinings</hi> Act muſt be Repealed,<note place="margin">☜</note> and <hi>Ireland</hi> declared <hi>to be
a Kingdom Independent on England;</hi> and without any reference unto it
in any caſe whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, All Acts prejudical to the Romiſh Reiligion ſhall be aboliſhed,
and it to be Enacted, <hi>That there be none other Profeſſion in the Kingdom
but the Romiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That only the antient Nobility of the Kingdom ſhall ſtand,
and of them, <hi>Such as ſhall refuſe to conform to the Romiſh Religion to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,</hi>
and others put in their room; howſoever the preſent Earl of
<hi>Kildare</hi> muſt be put out, and another put in his place.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, All Plantation Lands to be recalled, and <hi>the anuient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
to be Reinveſted in their formere Eſtates,</hi> with the limitations in
their Covenant expreſſed; That they had not formerly Sold their
Intereſts on valuable conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, That the reſpective Counties of the Kingdom be Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
and certain Bounds or Baronies aſſigned to the chief Septs and
others of the Nobility, who are to be anſwerable for the Government
thereof; and that a ſtanding Army may be ſtill in being; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Governors being to keep a certain Number of men to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at all <hi>Riſings out</hi> (as they term it:) They alſo being to build and
maintain certain Fortreſſes, in places moſt convenient within their
Precincts; and that theſe Governors be of abſolute Power, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible
to the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, For maintaining a correſpondence with other Nations, and
for ſecuring the Coaſts; That alſo they may be rendred conſiderable
unto others, a Navy of a certain number of Ships is to be maintained:
That to this end, five Houſes are to be appointed, one in each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
accounting <hi>Meath</hi> for one of them: That to theſe Houſes ſhall
be allotted an Annual Penſion of certain Thouſands of Pounds to be
made up of part of the Lands appropriate to Abbies; and a further
contribution to be raiſed in the reſpective Provinces to that end:
That theſe Houſes are to be aſſigned to a certain Order of Knights,
anſwerable to that of <hi>Malta,</hi> who are to be Seamen: And to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this Fleet, that all prizes are to be appointed, ſome part for a
Common Bank, the reſt to be divided; to which purpoſe the felling
of Woods ſerviceable for this uſe, is to be forbidden. The Houſe
for this purpoſe to be Aſſigned to the Provice of <hi>Leinſter</hi> is <hi>Kilmain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
or rather <hi>Howth,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Howth</hi> to be otherwiſe accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
provided that he joyn with them; that place being eſteemed
moſt convenient in reſpect of Situation.</p>
                  <p>For effecting of all which, they caſt up the Accounts of the whole
Forces of this Kingdom;<note place="margin">☜</note> that it is able to make up readily <hi>Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand able men,</hi> wanting only Commanders, and ſome expert
Soldiers for the preſent with Arms and Ammunition; of all which,
they expect a ſpeedy ſupply out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> their own Regiments
there Exerciſed, being to be ſent over, and ſome Ships from <hi>Spain</hi>
allotted for Service: That this Kingdom being ſetled, <hi>There are Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand men to be ſent into England</hi> to joyn with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65997:461"/>
Forces; and the Service in <hi>England</hi> performed, jointly to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Scotland,</hi> for reducing both Kingdoms to the obedience of the Pope,
which being finiſhed, they have engaged themſelves to the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> for aſſiſting him againſt the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for drawing their followers to ſome Head, and for giving the
fairer Gloſs to their foul Rebellion, it is to be admired what ſtrange
and unlikely rumours of their own deviſing they caſt abroad; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that many Sail of <hi>Spaniards</hi> are Landed, now at one Port, then
at another; that <hi>Drogheda</hi> was taken at ſuch a day and hour, with
all the circumſtances at large, and Letters to that purpoſe dated from
<hi>Drogheda</hi> by the Rebels that that beſieged it: That <hi>Dublin</hi> was taken;
and being infinitely Ambitious of gaining the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> to their
Part, for the greater countenance to their Cauſe, giving out that he
was their own, which was ſo long believed by the ſaid followers, until
that Noble Earl giving daily thoſe Honorable Teſtimonies to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and they finding it to their coſt, tho' with the hazard of his own
Perſon, further than his place might well allow; they are now other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

Robert Maxwell, afterwards Biſhop of
Kilmore.</head>
                  <p>THAT he obſerved Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal</hi> and other <hi>Iriſh</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
at the <hi>Scots</hi> Invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> and as much dejected
at the Pacification, calling the Engliſh <hi>baſe degenerate Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
and the Scots <hi>diſhonorable Bragodochios,</hi> that merchandiz'd their
Honor for Mony; and being asked the reaſon of their joy at bad
news, and their ſorrow at good, anſwered, <hi>That if the Fewd had
continued, they hoped the Earl of</hi> Strafford <hi>would have periſhed in the
Combuſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had frequent meetings Two or Three thouſand in a
company before the Rebellion, and borrowed great Sums of Mony of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> without any apparent neceſſity, but paid little or none:
that one <hi>Mac Caſe</hi> a Prieſt, being diſoblig'd by Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> inform'd
the Lord Deputy <hi>Wandesford</hi> of a Plot, but either he was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
or ſaid nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Phelim O Neal</hi> brought home two Hogſheads of Powder un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of Wine, a little before the Rebellion, and the Powder
was bought by ſmall parcels, Ten or Twelve pound at a time, in
the Names of ſeveral Gentlemen; and he brag'd that his Servants
<hi>James Warren</hi> and <hi>Paul O Neal</hi> were in the Plot, and apprehended,
but contrary to his expectation were diſmiſs'd at Council Table,
and <hi>that ſome Lord or other ſpoke for them there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal</hi> ſaid that the Plot was in his Head Five or
Six years before he could bring it to maturity, and diſſembled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<hi>as a Fool</hi> to bring it about, but ſince it was concluded on by the
Catholick Members of the Parliament, he was one of the laſt it was
communicated to.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Tirlogh O Neal,</hi> (Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Brother) ſaid that the buſineſs
was communicated by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Committee to the Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi>
who promis'd their Aſſiſtance, and that by their advice ſome things
formerly reſolved on were alter'd, and that it was a good Omen and
Sign of Divine Approbation <hi>that the major part of the Iriſh Committee
were Papiſts;</hi> and that whilſt the Proteſtants retir'd to a ſeparate
meeting at <hi>Chicheſter-Hall,</hi> the remaining Papiſts ſign'd a Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
writing of this Rebellion in the <hi>Tolſel,</hi> which that <hi>Seſſion</hi> drew
on, ſooner than was at firſt intended.</p>
                  <p>That Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> ſaid, That if the Lords and Gentlemen of the
other Provinces, then not in Arms, would not riſe but leave them in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65997:462"/>
the Lurch for all, he would produce their Warrant Signed with
their Hands, and Written in their own Blood, that ſhould bring
them to the Gallows, and that <hi>they</hi> Sate every day at Council Board,
and whiſpered the Lords Juſtices in the Ear, who were as deep in that
buſineſs as himſelf.</p>
                  <p>That the Earl of <hi>Antrims</hi> Siſter ſaid, Her Brother had taken <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
Caſtle, being removed thither to that purpoſe, and her Brother
<hi>Alexander,</hi> had taken <hi>Carigfergus,</hi> and that all <hi>Ireland</hi> was in the ſame
Caſe with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster:</hi> That the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſhould be preſerv'd as long as it
was conſiſtent with publick ſafety, and when not, '<hi>tis better an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
periſh than ones ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Alexander Hovenden,</hi> half Brother to Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> told him
that the Fryers of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> (by Father <hi>Thomas,</hi> Brother to the
Lord of <hi>Slane</hi>) had the Second time invited Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> and offered
to betray the Town to him; and Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> ſaid of the ſame Fryer,
<hi>that he ſaid Maſs at</hi> Finglaſs <hi>on Sunday morning, and in the afternoon did
beat Sir</hi> Charles Coot <hi>at</hi> Swords; and the Fryar being by, anſwered,
<hi>that he hoped to ſay Maſs at</hi> Chriſtchurch, Dublin, <hi>within eight Weeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ſeveral of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers and Fryers ſaid, <hi>Why may not we
as well fight for Religion, which is the Subſtance, as the</hi> Scots <hi>fight for
Ceremonies, which are but Shadows? and that</hi> Straffords <hi>Government was
intollerable;</hi> and being anſwered that it lay no heavier on them than
on the <hi>Britiſh;</hi> they replied, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> were <hi>no conſiderable part of
the Kingdom;</hi> and beſides they were certainly inform'd, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England</hi> had a Plot to bring the Papiſts to Church or cut
them off, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and in <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>Scots;</hi> that
they were ſure of aid next Spring from the <hi>Pope, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
and that the Clergy of <hi>Spain</hi> had already contributed Five thouſand
Arms and Powder for a whole Year then in readineſs: That the
Prieſts and Fryers were their beſt Agents, eſpecially <hi>Paul O Neal,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whoſe arrival with advice from <hi>Spain</hi> the War broke out, and
ſince that, he had gone to <hi>Spain</hi> with Letters, and return'd back
again with inſtructions in a Month.</p>
                  <p>That being asked why they pretended a Commiſſion from the
King, and at other times from the Queen, they anſwer'd, <hi>That it was
Lawful for them to pretend what they could in advancement of their
Cauſe,</hi> and that in all Wars, <hi>Rumours and Lies ſerved to as good purpoſe
as Arms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Sir</hi> Phelim <hi>at firſt pretended only</hi> to Liberty of Conſcience, <hi>but
as his Succeſs ſo his Demands increaſed,</hi> viz. To have all Offices of State
and Juſtice in Iriſh hands, and no Army, Tithes and Church-Lands be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
to the Papiſts; all Plantations ſince 1 <hi>Jacobi</hi> Diſſanul'd; no payment
of Debts nor reſtitution of Goods to the Proteſtants; all Fortiffcations in
Popiſh hands; <hi>Britiſh</hi> to be reſtrain'd from coming over; <hi>Poynings</hi> Act
and all Statues againſt Papiſts repealed, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,
<hi>and even all this would not reduce Sir</hi> Phelim <hi>without a
grant of the Earldom of</hi> Tyrone, <hi>and the Priviledges of</hi> O Neal.</p>
                  <p>That Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> pretended to a Propheſie, <hi>that he ſhould drive King</hi>
Charles <hi>and his whole Poſterity out of</hi> England, <hi>to be</hi> profugi in terta
aliena in aeternum; and that ſeveral great Men drank a Health <hi>on the

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and <hi>King of</hi> Ireland.</p>
                  <p>That he was informed, That an Alderman of <hi>Dublin</hi> who was
bound in One thouſand Pound Reogniſance for the appearance of a
young Rebel, did nevertheleſs adviſe him to make his eſcape, as he
afterwards did.</p>

That Captain <hi>Walter White</hi> told him that <hi>Roger Moor</hi> and <hi>Brian
O Neal</hi> were two of thoſe that were to Seize on the Poſtern door of
the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and that himſelf (<hi>White</hi>) was in the Plot and
knew it to be ſo. That Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> told the Deponent, that he was
invited to <hi>Strabane,</hi> tho' to colour the buſineſs they ſhot Nine or Ten
ſhot over his Head. That Dr. <hi>Daly</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Sir</hi> Phelim <hi>would never

Antrim <hi>would have taken Arms as ſoon as himſelf;</hi> and others ſaid, his

and did the like to another Woman; and that they cut a collop

the <hi>Iriſh</hi> took delight to hear them talk as they dig'd the Ditches

Whips and Wattles, to beat and thraſh off the Mens privy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which done, the Children would return with joy, and were
received by their Parents in triumph for that Service; they
would leave People mortally Wounded on purpoſe that they might
die in Torment. That one Boy having his Back-bone broken eat
all the Graſs round him, and then they removed him to a better Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,

Country (ſince my Lord of <hi>Muskery</hi>'s departure) own a Power of
doing right to us: But by their diverſity of Governments, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of Governours, the Parties Injured are poſted from place
to place, and put to circular and formal courſes of Petitioning and
Proſecuting; by the delay and diſcouragement whereof, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline

of theſe particulars were debated, and ſeveral of them, as the
Firſt, Second and Fifth, ſufficiently cleared and evidenced to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to us; and that at that time, they promiſed to ſend unto
me within Eight or Ten days, ſuch poſitive orders for redreſs in thoſe
manifeſt particulars, as we could reaſonably expect; and that in
thoſe which were then left doubtful and diſputable, I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Commiſſioners ſhould be aſſigned to meet with ours within
Eight or Nine days, to redreſs all Grievances, and to determine all
differences. But from thenceforth, I could never receive any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of that promiſe or other ſatisfaction; but having impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned

interim, they keep all things in difference within their own poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

By means whereof, and of their willful withholding of thoſe

Rights whereout I ſhould have raiſed ſome reaſonable ſupport for
His Majeſties Forces here, more eſpecially by their deteiner of the
Three Houndred Pounds worth of Cattle, ordered unto me by your

ſince, to ſend unto his Majeſty, there remained not Two Hundred

Majeſties Service, the many Injuries, Inſolencies and Preſſures ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
and Multiplied daily on the poor <hi>Engliſh,</hi> doth beget ſo many
heavy clamours and complaints, ſuch diſencouragements, anguiſh and
vexation of Spirit, as makes the wretched Souls weary of their
Lives, and me of the ſad and perplexed condition whereunto I am

                  <head>Appendix XVIII. The Declaration of the Parliament againſt the

                  <p>AS it is evident to all the World, that this late horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did without any colour or
pretext of Provocation profeſſedly and boldly aim at the
deſtruction of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, the rejecting of the Laws of
<hi>England,</hi> and the Extirpation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Inhabitants out of that
Kingdom: So it is no leſs manifeſt, that this Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
(to whom his Majeſty hath left the managing of the War againſt
thoſe Rebels,) hath taken the Troubles of <hi>Ireland</hi> to heart with
that reſentment and compaſſion, as may evidence their Zeal to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
their Love to their Diſtreſſed Country-men and Brethren
there in theſe times, when the like Jeſuitical Practices have caſt
<hi>England</hi> into woful Diſtractions and Unnatural War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, the Reducing of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath ſtill been a chief part of
the care of this Parliament; and God hath been pleaſed to bleſs our
endeavours with ſuch ſucceſs, as that thoſe furious Blood-thirſty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
have been ſtopped in the carier of their cruelty; ſome part
of the Proteſtant Blood which at firſt was ſpilt like Water upon
the Ground, hath been revenged; their Maſſacres, Burnings and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhings,
have by a Divine retaliation been repaid into their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65997:473"/>
and the Proteſtant Party hath been erected to that condition
of Strength and Hope, that their Enemies are conſtrained (diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Forces) to have recourſe to their Craft and Policies; and
therefore by their ſubtil Agents at Court, and their active Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
elſewhere, have been endeavouring now of a long time to
make our Armies in <hi>Ireland</hi> diſaffected to the Parliament, what by
occaſion of their wants, not ſo readily ſupplyed, as their need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
what by amuſing them with theſe unhappy differences fallen
in here between King and People, labouring by that means to divide
thoſe Forces into Factions, to the end the main work they have in
hand, might be neglected, which is the Proſecuting the War againſt
the Rebels, ſo far brought low in ſome parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that if they
can be deprived of the benefit of this Harveſt, they are not likely
to ſee the next Summer. And therefore the Rebels finding, that
notwithſtanding the Diſtractions here, occaſioning the ſlowne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s and
ſcarceneſs of Supplies, yet they themſelves are in a far worſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being in a want of moſt things neceſſary, not only for the
maintaining of a War, but even of Life, the Judgment of God being
remarkable upon them in this, that as their Bloody and Treacherous
Religion made them inhumanely cruel in ſhedding the <hi>Protestants</hi>
Blood, ſo now the Famine amongſt many of them, hath made them
unnaturally and <hi>Canibal</hi>-like,<note place="margin">☜</note> Eat and Feed one upon another. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that they may have time to expect from their Friends abroad,
new Supplies, both of Victuals and Ammunition, and may without
moleſtation reap the Fruit of this Harveſt, they have laboured a
Treaty for a Ceſſation; which Project of theirs doth no leſs aim
at the overthrow of the remainder of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
than their treacherous taking of Arms at firſt, did intend the
deſtruction of them all; for <hi>their Ceſſation and Hoſtility, their War and

                     <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                     <hi>are alike to be eſteemed of,</hi> and <hi>with thoſe that neither in Peace
nor War keep any Faith, it is best to be in perpetual Defiance.</hi> Therefore
the Lords and Commons in Parliament aſſembled, according to the
continued care of that Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> do in a ſpecial manner
take into their conſideration the condition thereof, upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of an intended Ceſſation; and ſo much the rather, becauſe it is
feared, that the Proteſtant Forces through want of Proviſions for
their Armies, may at laſt, if not relieved, be perſwaded to admit of
this courſe, in hope thereby to procure ſome means for their ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
as alſo, becauſe there is too much ground to ſuſpect, that if
this Ceſſation ſhould be agreed unto, they might have opportunity to
joyn with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party here, for their greater ſtrengthning; And
though it were to have no influence upon this Kingdom, yet the
evil conſequences of it are ſo many and pernicious to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that
this Parliament ſhould betray the truſt repoſed in them, if they did
not declare againſt this Ceſſation, and uſe all means in time to make
it abortive; and therefore they deſire that it may be obſerved and
taken notice of,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From whence the Counſel and Deſign of this Ceſſation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
even from the Rebels and <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, <hi>for their own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;</hi>
for ſoon after they had miſſed of their intent to make
themſelves abſolute Maſters of that Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by their
treacherous Surpriſes; and ſeeing that this Kingdom did with moſt
Chriſtian and Generous Reſolutions undertake the Charges of the
War, for the Relief and Recovery of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Propoſitions were
brought over from the Rebels by the Lords <hi>Dillon</hi> and <hi>Tafe,</hi> at
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65997:474"/>
which time they were intercepted, and reſtrained by the Order of
the Houſe of Commons; after that, they had the boldneſs, <hi>even
while their Hands were ſtill imbrued in the Proteſtants Blood,</hi> to petition
his Majeſty that their demands might be heard: And for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they obtained a Commiſſion to be ſent over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Perſons of Qality (whereof ſome were <hi>Papiſts</hi>) to Hear, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and Tranſmit to his Majeſty their Demands, which was done
accordingly; and one Maſter <hi>Burk,</hi> a Notorious Pragmatick <hi>Iriſh
Papiſt,</hi> was the chief Sollicitor in this buſineſs. After this, the Juſt
Revenging God, giving daily ſucceſs to handfuls of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Forces againſt their great numbers; ſo that by a wonderful Bleſſing
from Heaven, they were in moſt parts put to the worſt; Then did
they begin to ſet on Foot an Overture for a Ceſſation of Arms; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, what going and coming hath been between the Court
and the Rebels is very well known; and what Meetings and Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have been held about it in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by Warrant of his Majeſties
Ample Commiſſion ſent to that effect; and what Reception and
Countenance moſt Pragmatical <hi>Papiſts</hi> negotiating the buſineſs, have
found at Court; and that thoſe of the <hi>State</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who had ſo
much Religion and Honeſty as to diſſwade the Ceſſation, were firſt
diſcountenanced, and at laſt put out of their Places, and reſtrained to
Priſon; as Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> One of the Lords Juſtices there; Sir
<hi>John Temple,</hi> Maſter of the Rolls; Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> Vice-Treaſurer
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Treaſurer at Wars; and Sir <hi>Robert Meredith;</hi> one
alſo of the Council Table.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lords and Commons deſire it may be obſerved,
that during all theſe Paſſages and Negotiations, the Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
were never acquainted by the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Ceſſation, much leſs was their Advice or Counſel demanded;
notwithſtanding that the care and managing of the War was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
on them, both <hi>by Act of Parliament,</hi> and by his Majeſties
Commiſſion, under the Great Seal, to Adviſe, Order and Diſpoſe of
all things concerning the Government and Defence of that Kingdom.
But the wants of the Army were often repreſented and complained
of, whereby with much craft a ground was preparing for the Pretext,
wherewith now they would cover the Counſels of this Ceſſation,
as if nothing had drawn it on, but the extream Wants of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
whereas it is evident, that the Reports of ſuch a Treaty have
been (in a great part) the cauſe of their wants; for thereby the
Adventurers were diſheartened, Contributions were ſtopped, and
by the admittance to Court of the Negotiators of this Ceſſation,
their wicked Councels have had that influence, as to procure the
Intercepting of much Proviſions which were ſent for <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo that
Ships going for <hi>Ireland</hi> with Victuals, and others coming from thence
with Commodities to exchange for Victuals, have been taken, not
only by <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi> having his Majeſties Warrant, but alſo by <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ships commanded by Sir <hi>John Pennington,</hi> under his Majeſty. And
moreover the Parliament Meſſengers ſent into ſeveral Counties, with
the Ordinance of <hi>January</hi> laſt, for Loans and Contributions, have
been taken and impriſoned, their Money taken from them, and not
one Peny either Loan or Contribution hath been ſuffered to be ſent for
for <hi>Ireland,</hi> from theſe Counties which were under the power of the
Kings Army; while in the mean time, the Houſes of Parliament by
their Ordinances, Declarations and Solicitations to the City of <hi>London,</hi>
and the Counties free from the terror of the Kings Forces, were ſtill
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65997:474"/>
procuring not contemptible Aid and Relief for the diſtreſſes of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the Lords and Commons have reaſon to declare againſt
this Plot and Deſign of a Ceſſation of Arms, as being treated and
carryed on without their Advice, ſo alſo becauſe of the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
which will thereby redound to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and the
encouragement and advancement which it will give to the practice of
Popery, when theſe Rebellious <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhall by this agreement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
and ſet up with more freedom their Idolatrous Worſhip, their
Popiſh Superſtitions, and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Abominations, in all the places of
their Command, to the diſhonouring of God, the grieving of all
true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Hearts, the diſpoſing of the Laws of the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> and to the provoking of the wrath of a Jealous God; as
if both Kingdoms not ſmarted enough already for this ſin of too
much conniving at, and tolerating of Antichriſtian Idolatry, under
pretext of Civil Contracts, and Politick Agreements.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In the Fourth place, they deſire it may be obſerved, that
this Ceſſation will prove diſhonourable to the Publick Faith of this
Kingdom, it will elude and make null the Acts and Ordinances of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
made for the forfeiting of the Rebels Lands, at the paſſing of
which Acts, it was repreſented that ſuch a courſe would drive the
Rebels to Deſpair; and it proves ſo, but otherways than was meant,
<hi>for deſpairing of their Force and Courage, they go about to overcome us
with their Craft.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly and Laſtly, What ſhall become of the many Poor Exiled
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> turned out of their Eſtates by this Rebellion, who muſt
now continue begging their Bread, while the Rebels ſhall enjoy their
Lands and Houſes? And who ſhall ſecure the reſt of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
that either by their own Courage, Induſtry, and great Charges, have
kept their Poſſeſſions, or by the ſucceſs of our Armies have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored?
<hi>Can there be any aſſurance gotten from a Perfidious Enemy, of
a Coſſation from Treachery and breach of Agreement, when they ſhall ſee
a fit time and opportunity?</hi> Theſe and many other conſiderations being
well weighed, it will appear evidently, that this Deſign of a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
is a deep Plot laid by the Rebels, and really invented for their
own Safety, and falſly pretended to be for the benefit of the Armies.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Lords and Commons have no certain Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the Treaty is concluded, but are informed by ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that all the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as well Inhabitants as Soldiers in that
Kingdom, are reſolved to withſtand that proceeding, and to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on the greateſt extremities, rather than have any ſort of peace
with that generation, <hi>who have ſo cruelly in time of Peace Murdered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Thouſands of our Countreymen, and laboured to Extirpate the</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Religion from amongſt them;</hi> ſo they do believe that theſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of a Ceſſation were firſt contrived by the Enemies of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Peace, and by their Practices. The Treaty was carryed
on with much Subtilty and Solicitation, thereby to ſtop the ſending
of Supplies from thence to our Armies, and for the cooling of the
affections of thoſe who have already ſhewed their zeal to the Weal
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and therefore the only means to defeat this their Policy,
and prevent the Evils intended by it, is to ſettle a courſe whereby the
Armies of <hi>Ireland</hi> may be at leaſt Fenced againſt Hunger and Cold:
For which prupoſe it is deſired, that all thoſe who are well affected
to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, either in this or that Kingdom, and all
thoſe who by their Adventures already made, have embarked their
particular Intereſts with the Publick of that Kingdom, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65997:475"/>
a good return of their engagements, would joyn their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for obviating of that neceſſity which may be made a ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to inforce a Deſtructive Ceſſation of Arms, and that they
would not through too much ſuſpition of it, forbear the providing
of Supplies, and ſo occaſion that inconvenience which they ought
by all means to prevent; for by ſo doing, they will loſe all their
former Pains and Charges, and the witholding of Proviſions now,
will gain credit to that Calumny laid againſt this Kingdom, of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the Armies of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and by the continuing of Supplies,
theſe Forces will be encouraged to continue the War, and ſo Crown
both their Work and ours. And laſtly, the Rebels ſeeing aſſiſtance
againſt them ſtill flowing from hence, muſt needs be out of hope of
Proſecuting or Concluding this their Deſign. The cry of much
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Blood, the great indigency of many Ruined Families, the
danger of our Religion almoſt exiled out of that Kingdom, calls for
this laſt Act of Piety, Charity, Juſtice and Policy from us; which
being reſolved on, Letters are to be diſpatched to the ſeveral parts
of that Kingdom, to encourage the Commanders and Soldiers upon
the aforeſaid Reaſons and Aſſurances, that they may not hearken to
ſuch an unjuſt and deceitful Counſel; and as by their proſecuting
of the War, through Gods Bleſſing they have ſucceſsfully reſiſted
the Rebels cruelty, ſo they may upon this occaſion, beware they be
not over-reached by their craft.</p>
                  <p>All which the Lords and Commons do earneſtly deſire, may be
ſeriouſly taken to heart by all the Kingdom; and that from thoſe
other encouragements mentioned at large, in the Ordinance of the
14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> laſt, and ſuch as now are offered, a Courſe may be
taken whereby ſuch a conſtant Weekly Contribution may be ſetled,
as will ſupply to the Armies in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the meer neceſſities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
which may be more punctually and ſeaſonably tranſmitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſeveral parts of that Kingdom, according to their reſpective
Wants, that ſo the benefit and honour of ſo Pious a work happily
begun, and ſucceſsfully hitherto carryed on, may not be loſt, when
ſo little remains to be done; and that the ſaving<note place="margin">☞</note> of a Kingdom,
the re-eſtabliſhing of ſo many <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, the re-poſſeſſing
of ſo many Thouſand Chriſtians into their Eſtates, may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
and let fall to the ground, for a little more pains and coſt.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>AT our Firſt entrance into this Unhappy Kingdom, we had
no other deſign than by our Swords to aſſert and vindicate
the Right of his Majeſty, which was here moſt highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed,
to redreſs the wrongs of his poor Subjects, and to advance
our own particulars in the proſecution of ſo honeſt undertakings.
And for the reſt of theſe, we do believe they have, ſince our coming
over, ſucceeded pretty well; but for the laſt which concerns our
ſelves, That hath fallen out ſo contrary to our expectations, that
inſtead of being rewarded, we have been prejudiced, inſtead of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Fortune, we have ſpent part of one: And though we behave
our ſelves never ſo well Abroad, and perform the Actions of Honeſt
Men, yet we have the reward of Rogues and Rebels, which is Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
and Want when we come home. Now (<hi>My Lords</hi>) although
we be brought to ſo great an Exigence, that we are ready to Rob
and Spoil one another, yet to prevent ſuch outrages, we thought
it better to try all honeſt means for our Subſiſtence, before we take
ſuch indirect courſes. Therefore if your Lordſhips will be pleaſed
to take us timely into your conſiderations, before our urgent wants
make us deſperate; we will as we have done hitherto, ſerve your
Lordſhips readily and faithfully. But if your Lordſhips will not
find a way for our Preſervation here, we humbly deſire we may
have leave to go where we may have a better being: And if your
Lordſhips ſhall refuſe to grant that, we muſt then take leave to
have our Recourſe to that Firſt and Primary Law which God hath
endued all Men with; we mean the Law of Nature, which teacheth
all Men to preſerve themſelves.</p>

1644, and anſwered by your Majeſty
the Five and Twentieth of the ſame.</head>
                  <p>1. WE moſt humbly deſire the Eſtabliſhment of the true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi>
Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Laws and
Statutes in the ſaid Kingdom now in force.</p>
                  <p>2. That the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Titular Archbiſhops,<note place="margin">☜</note> Biſhops,
Jeſuits, Fryers and Prieſts, and all others of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, be
baniſhed out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe <hi>they have been the Stirrers up of all

may continue of Force, and be put in due Execution.</p>
                  <p>3. That Reſtitution be made of all our Churches and Church
Rights and Revenues; and all our Churches and Chappels re-edified,
and put in as good Eſtate as they were at the breaking out of the
Rebellion, and as they ought to be, at the charge of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> (as they call themſelves,) who have been

                  </p>

Practice in that Kingdom, the rather becauſe the Lawyers in <hi>England</hi>

                  </p>

Conſederates exerciſe over your Majeſties Subjects, both in Cauſes
Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal.</p>

in time of danger, <hi>in any of which Towns no</hi> Papiſt <hi>may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Dwell or Inhabit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. That for the better ſatisfaction of Juſtice, and your Majeſties
Honour, and for the future Security of the ſaid Kingdom, and your
Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects there, exemplary Puniſhment according
to Law may be inflicted upon ſuch as have there, Traiterouſly Levied

Security as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>17. That according to the Preſidents of former times, in caſes of
general Rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Attainders which have been duly
had by Outlawry for Treaſon, done in this Rebellion, may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and confirmed by Act of Parliament, to be in due form of
Law, tranſmitted and paſſed in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that ſuch Traitors as
for want of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and indifferent Jurors to Indict them in the

Outlary or otherwiſe, may upon due proof of their Offences be by
like Acts of Parliament Convicted and Attainted; and all ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders

                  <p>18. That your Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects may be reſtored to the

out, and may be anſwered of, and for all the mean profits of the
ſame, in the interim, and for all the time until they ſhall be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
                  <p>19. That your Majeſties ſaid <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects may alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to all their Monies, Plate, Jewels, Houſhold-ſtuff, Goods and
Chattels whatſoever, which without due Proceſs or Judgment of

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65997:478"/>
during the ſaid time hath been delivered to any Perſon or Perſons of
the ſaid Confederates in truſt to be kept or preſerv'd, but are by
colour thereof ſtill withholden.</p>
                  <p>20. That the eſtabliſhment and maintenance of <hi>a compleat</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Army,</hi> and ſufficient <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Soldiers and Forces for the time
to come, be ſpeedily taken into your Majeſties Prudent, Juſt and

be no more endangered <hi>by the like Rebellions</hi> in time to come.</p>
                  <p>21. That whereas it appeareth in Print, that the ſaid Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates

thereby to open an eaſy and ready way in the paſſing of Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without having them firſt well conſidered of in
<hi>England,</hi> which may produce many dangerous conſequences, both to

to introduce ſo great a diminution of your Royal and neceſſary Power
for the confirmation of your Royal Eſtate, and protection of your

                  <p>22. That your Majeſty out of your grace and favour to your <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>

ſuch inſinuation, or intimation to your People of that Kingdom
touching that Parliament; wherein ſeveral Acts of Parliament have
already paſt, the validity whereof may be endangered, if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

high Nature, as we humbly conceive is not properly to be diſcuſſed

a free Parliament in Law, holden before a Perſon of Honour and
Fortune in the Kingdom, compoſed of good, loyal and well-affected
Subjects to your Majeſty, who doubtleſs will be ready to comply in
all things that ſhall appear to be pious and juſt, for the good of the
true Proteſtant Religion, and for your Majeſties Service and the
good of the Church and State; that if this preſent Parliament ſhould
be diſſolved, it would be a great Terror and Diſcontent to all your
Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects of the Kingdom, and may be alſo a
means to force many of your Majeſties Subjects to quit that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or peradventure to adhere to ſome other party there, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the <hi>Romiſh Iriſh</hi> Confederates, rather than to be liable to

inducing your Majeſty to agree to a Ceſſation of Arms for one whole

Security to your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects; but if the preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

ſo many of your ableſt and beſt Proteſtant Subjects have been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

full a View and Time of Mature Conſideration to be had of Acts

Hundred Years; and if their intentions were ſo clear as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
we know not why they ſhould avoid the ſtricteſt View and
Trial of your Majeſty, and your Councils of both Kingdoms; this
their deſire, tending to introduce a grand Diminution to the royal

Protection of your good Proteſtant Subjects there and elſewhere;
and what ſpecial uſe they aim at in ſeeking ſuch a repeal, your
Proteſtant Subjects as they know not the particular; ſo can they
conjecture of none, unleſs the ſaid Confederates have ſome deſign by
way of ſurprize, to obtrude upon your Majeſty in their new deſired
Parliament, ſome Acts of Juſtification of their ill-done Actions, and
for condemning ſuch of your Proteſtant Subjects, as have in their
ſeveral Degrees moſt faithfully ſerved your Majeſty there; which we

who have faithfully ſerved your Majeſty in that Parliament.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Prop.</hi> That all Indictments, Attainders, Outlawries in the King's-Bench,
or elſewhere, ſince the ſaid Seventh Day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1641. and
all Letters Patents, Grants, Leaſes, Cuſtodiums, Bonds, Recognizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and all other Records, Act or Acts depending thereon, or in prejudice
of the ſaid Catholicks; or any of them, be taken off the File, annulled
and declared void; Firſt, by your Majeſties Proclamation, and after by
Act to be paſſed in the ſaid free Parliament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This we conceive to be a very bold Propoſition, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
as we alſo conceive, by any Example, and tending to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an ill Preſident in After-times; for that was never ſeen, that
the Records were taken off the File, but where there was ſome
Corruption or Fraud, or ſome illegal or unjuſt Carriage uſed;
concerning the procuring or making up of ſuch Records, and the
ſame firſt we'll proved upon due Examination, and that may not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65997:481"/>
only conceal, but in ſome ſort ſeem to juſtify their abominable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Murders, Cruelties, Maſſacres and Plunders acted againſt your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Perſon, Crown and Dignity, upon the Perſons of your Majeſties
moſt Loyal Proteſtant Subjects in that Kingdom, and encourage the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
to do the like again; beſides the diſcouragement it may beget
in your Majeſties Officers and Subjects to do their duties in the like
Inſurrections, which may happen hereafter; which alſo may prove
very prejudicial to your Majeſties Rights and Revenues, if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
to ſupport the forfeitures wherein many of them are or may
be grounded, ſhould be taken off the File and Cancelled.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Prop.</hi> That inaſmuch as under colour of ſuch Outlawries and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Debts due unto the ſaid Catholicks, have been Granted, Levyed and
diſpoſed of; and of the other ſide, that Debts due upon the ſaid Catholicks
to thoſe of the adverſe Party, have been levyed and diſpoſed of to publick
uſe; that therefore all Debts be by Act of Parliament mutually relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
or all to ſtand in <hi>Statu quo,</hi> notwithstanding any Grant or Diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We humbly conceive, that in time of Peace, and moſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Government, when the courſe of Law and Juſtice is moſt open and
beſt obſerved, that Debts due unto the Crown actually levyed and paid
in to your Majeſties uſe, ought not to be reſtored, though the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the Forfeitures ſhould be legally reverſed, which is far from
the preſent Caſe; and this Propoſition tendeth to croſs that juſt
right of your Majeſty, and to make the diſpoſition by the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Papiſt Rebels, of Debts due to Proteſtants, and by the ſaid
Rebels by Fraud and Force levied and diſpoſed in maintenance of
their Rebellion, which cunningly they call by the name of Publick
uſe, to be in equal degree to the debts owing by the Rebels, and by
them all forfeited, and many of them by Law duly levyed, which is
a moſt unequal and unjuſt thing; and the ſaid Propoſition cannot,
nor doth make offer to have the Pope's Confederates cut off from
the debts due to them, which they have juſtly forfeited, but only
for a colour of conſideration, to have the Proteſtants loſe ſuch Debts
(juſtly due to them) as have been unjuſtly taken from them, who have
done no Act at all to forfeit them.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Prop.</hi> That the late Officers taken or found upon feigned or old Titles
ſince the Year 1634, to intitle your Majeſty to ſeveral Counties in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,
Thomond,</hi> the County of <hi>Tipperary, Limrick, Killkenny</hi> and
<hi>Wicklow,</hi> be vacated and taken off the File, and the Poſſeſſors thereof
ſetled and ſecure in their antient Eſtates by Act of Parliament; and that
the like Act of Limitation of your Majesties Titles for the ſecurity of the
Eſtates of your Subjects in that Kingdom be paſſed in that Parliament, as
was enacted in the One and Twentieth Year of his late Majeſties Reign in
this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We know not of any Offices found, or feigned Titles, nor
what the Confederates may demand, in reſpect of any Graces pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
by your Majeſty, which we intend not, nor have any occaſion
to diſpute; but do humbly conceive, that all thoſe who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Treaſon in the late Rebellion, ſubſequent to your Majeſties
Promiſe of thoſe Graces, have thereby forfeited the benefit thereof,
together with the Lands to which the ſaid Graces might elſe have
related; and ſo their whole Eſtates are now juſtly fallen to your
Majeſty by their Rebellion, which we conceive is of great importance
for your Majeſties Service to be taken into conſideration: As Firſt,
with regard of the Statutes made in the preſent Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:65997:482"/>
Secondly, that neceſſary increaſe of your Majeſties Revenue
decayed by the preſent Rebellion. Thirdly, the aboliſhing the evil
Cuſtoms of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and preſervation of Religion, Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
there. Fourthly, the ſatisfaction of the Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
loſſes in ſome meaſure. Pifthly, the Arrears of your Majeſties
Army, and other debts contracted for the War, and for preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Kingdom to your Majeſty. Sixthly, the bringing in of
more <hi>Britiſh</hi> on the Plantation. Seventhly, the building of ſome
walled Towns in remote and deſolate places, for the Security of that
Kingdom, and your Majeſties good Subjects there. Eighthly, the
taking of the Natives from their former dependency on their Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
who uſurped an abſolute Power over them, to the diminution of
all Regal power, and to the oppreſſion of the Inferiors.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Prop.</hi> That all Marks of Incapacity impoſed upon the Natives
of that Kingdom, to purchaſe or acquire Lands, Leaſes, Offices, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditaments,
be taken away by Act of Parliament; and the ſame to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the ſecuring of Purchaſes, Leaſes or Grants, already made; and
that for the Education of Youth, an Act be paſſed in the next Parliament,
for the erecting of one or more Inns of Court, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, Free and
Common-Schools.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This we conceive concerneth ſome of the late Plantations,
and no other part of that Kingdom, and that the reſtriction herein
mentioned is found to be of great uſe, eſpecially for the indifferency
of Trials, Strength of the Government, and for Trade and Traffick;
and we humbly conceive, that if other Plantations ſhall not proceed
for the ſetling and ſecuring of the Kingdom; and that if no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
be made of <hi>Popiſh</hi> purchaſing, or buylng of the Proteſtants
out of their former Plantations, where they were prudently ſetled,
though now caſt out of their Eſtates by the late Rebellion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to plant the ſame again for want of means, and therefore proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
upon eaſie Terms will part from their Eſtates to the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;
that thoſe Plantations will be deſtroyed, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of your Majeſties Service, and endangering of the Safety of that
Kingdom. Touching bearing of Offices, we humbly conceive that
their now Conformity to the Laws and Statutes of that Realm, is
the only Mark of Incapacity impoſed upon them; We humbly conceive
that we ought not to expect to be more capable there, than the <hi>Englsſh</hi>
Natives are here in <hi>England:</hi> In like manner for Schools in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
there are divers ſetled in that Kingdom already, by the Laws and
Statutes of that Realm; if any Perſon well affected, ſhall erect and
endow any more Schools there at their own Charges, ſo that the
School-maſters and Scholars may be governed according to Laws,
Cuſtoms and Orders of <hi>England,</hi> and the reſt of Free-Schools here,
we cannot apprehend any juſt exception thereunto: But touching
Univerſities and Inns of Court; We humbly conceive, that this part
of the Propoſition ſavoureth of ſome deſire to become independant
upon <hi>England,</hi> or to make aſperſion on the Religion and Laws of the
Kingdom, which can never be truly happy but in the good Unity of
both in the true Proteſtant Religion, and in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi>
for (as for matter of charge) ſuch of the Natives that are deſirous
to breed their Sons for Learning in Divinity, can be well content
to ſend them to the Univerſities of <hi>Lovane, Doway,</hi> and other <hi>Popiſh</hi>
places in foreign Kingdoms, and for Civil Law or Phyſick to <hi>Padua</hi> and
other places, which draws great Treaſure yearly out of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Dominions; but will ſend few or none of them to <hi>Oxford</hi> or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65997:482"/>
                     <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where they might as cheeply be bred up and become
as Learned, which courſe I conceive is holden out of their Pride
and Diſaffection towards this Kingdom, and the true Religion here
profeſſed: And for the Laws of the Land which are for the Common
Law agreable to <hi>England,</hi> and ſo for the greateſt part of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;
the Inns of Court in <hi>England</hi> are ſufficient, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
come thither without grudging, and that is a means to civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
them after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtoms, to make them familiar and in
love with the Language and Nation, to preſerve Law in the Purity,
when the Profeſſors of it ſhall draw from one original Fountain, and
ſee the manner of the practice of that in the ſame great Channel,
where His Majeſties Courts of Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> do flow moſt
clearly; whereas by ſeparation of the Kingdoms in that place of
their principal Inſtruction, where their Foundations of Learning are
to be laid, a degenerate Corruption in Religion and Juſtice may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
be introduced and ſpread, with much more difficulty to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
and reſtrained afterwards, by any Diſcipline to be uſed in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> or puniſhment there to be inflicted for departing from the
true Grounds of things, which are beſt preſerved in Unity when
they grow out of the ſame Root, than if ſuch Univerſities and Inns
of Court as are propoſed, ſhould be granted; all which we humbly
ſubmit to your Majeſties moſt pious and prudent Conſideration and
Judgment.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Prop.</hi> That the Offices and Places of Command, Honour, Profit and
Truſt within that Kingdom, be conferred upon Roman Catholick Natives,
in equality and indifferency with your Majeſties other Subjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We humbly conceive that the Roman Catholicks, Natives
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> may have the like Offices and Places, as the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
Natives of <hi>England</hi> have here, and not otherwiſe; howbeit
we conceive, that in the generality they have not deſerved ſo much
by their late Rebellion; therefore we ſee not why they ſhould be
endowed, with any new or farther Capacities or Priviledges, than
they have by the Laws and Statutes now in force in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Prop.</hi> That the inſupportable Oppreſſion of your Subjects, by reaſon of
the Court of Wards, and Reſpit of Homage, be taken away, and certain
Revenue in Lieu thereof ſetled upon your Majesty, without Diminution of
your Majeſties Profits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We know of no Oppreſſion by reaſon of the Court of
Wards; and we humbly conceive, that the Court of Wards is of
great uſe for the raiſing of your Majeſties Revenues, the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your Majeſties Tenures, and chiefly the Education of the
Gentry in the Proteſtant Religion, and in Civility and Learning,
and good Manners; who otherwiſe would be brought up in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Barbariſm, their Eſtates be ruined by their Kindred and
Friends, and continue their depending upon their Chieftains and
Lords, to the great prejudice of your Majeſties Service, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Subjects; and there being no colour of exception to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
juſt Title to Wardſhips, we know not why the taking away of
your Court concerning the ſame ſhould be preſſed, unleſs it be to
prevent the Education of the Lords and Gentry that fall Wards in
the Proteſtant Religion. For that part of this Propoſition which
concerns Reſpit of Homage; We humbly conceive that reaſonable,
that ſome way may be ſetled for that, if that ſtandeth with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
good Pleaſure, without prejudice to your Majeſty, or your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65997:483"/>
10. <hi>Prop.</hi> That no Lord, not eſtated in the Kingdom, or eſtated and not
reſident, ſhall have vote in the ſaid Parliament by proxy or otherwiſe, and
none admitted to the Houſe of Commons, but ſuch as ſhall be eſtated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
within the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We humbly conceive that in the Year, 1641, by the Graces
which your Majeſty then granted to your Subjects of <hi>Ireland;</hi> the
matter of this Propoſition was in a fair way regulated by your utter
aboliſhing of blank Proxies, and limiting Lords preſent, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that no one of them ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of more Proxies than two; and preſcribing the Peers of that
Kingdom not there reſident, to purchaſe fitting Proportions of Land
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> within five Years from the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> 1641, or elſe to
loſe their Votes, till they ſhould make ſuch purchaſes; which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes
by reaſon of the Troubles hapning in the Kingdom, and which
have continued for two years and a half, have not peradventure yet
been made; and therefore your Majeſty may now be pleaſed, and may
take juſt occaſion to enlarge that time for five Years more, from the
time when that Kingdom may again be ſetled in a happy firm peace:
And as to Members of the Houſe of Commons, the ſame is moſt fit,
as we humbly conceive to be regulated by the Laws and Statutes of
that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Prop.</hi> That an Act be paſſed in the next Parliament declaratory,
that the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> is a free Parliament of it ſelf, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of, and not ſubordinate to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and that the
Subjects of <hi>Ireland</hi> are immediately ſubject to your Majeſty, as in right of
your Revenue; and that the Members of the ſaid Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and all other the Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are independant, and no way to be
ordered or concluded by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and are only to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and governed within that Kingdom by your Majesty, and ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
as are or ſhall be there appointed, and by the Parliament of that
Kingdom according to the Laws of the Land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Propoſition concerns your Majeſties High Court of
Parliament both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and is beyond our Abilities
(who are not acquainted with the Records and Preſidents of this
Nature to give an Anſwer thereunto;) and therefore we humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
your Majeſties pardon for not anſwering unto the ſame.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Prop.</hi> That the aſſumed Power or Juriſdiction in the Council
Board of determining all Manner of Cauſes, be limited to Matters of
State; and all Patents, Eſtates and Grants, illegally and extrajudicially
avoided there, or elſewhere, be left in State as before, and the Parties
grieved, their Heirs or Aſſigns till legal Eviction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Council-Table hath always exerciſed Juriſdiction in
ſome Caſes, ever ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government was ſetled in that
Kingdom, and is of long Continuance in Caſes of ſome Nature, as
the beginning thereof appeareth not; which ſeemeth to be by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
and hath always been armed with Power to examine upon
Oath as a Court of Juſtice, or in the Nature of a Court of Juſtice in
Caſes of ſome Nature, and may be very neceſſary ſtill in many Caſes,
eſpecially for the preſent, till your Majeſties Laws may more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
be received in that Kingdom; and we conceive that Board is
ſo well limited by printed Inſtructions, in your Majeſties Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Time, and by your Majeſties Graces in the Seventeenth Year of
your Reign, that it needeth for this preſent little or no regulating
at all; howbeit, they refer that to your Majeſties great Wiſdom
and Goodneſs to do therein, as to Law and Juſtice ſhall appertain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:65997:483"/>
13. <hi>Prop.</hi> That the Statutes of the Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth
Years of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> concerning the Staple Commodities be repealed,
reſerving to His Majeſty lawful and just Poundage, and a Book of Rates
be ſetled by an indifferent Committee of both Houſes for all Commodities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The matter of this Propoſition is ſetled in a fitting and
good way by your Majeſty already as we conceive, amongſt the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
granted by your Majeſty to your People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Year of your Majeſties Reign, to which we humbly refer our
ſelves.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Prop.</hi> That inſomuch as the long continuance of the chief Governor
or Governors of that Kingdom, in that place of ſo great Eminency and
Power, hath been a principal Occaſion that much Tyranny and Oppreſſion,
hath been uſed and exerciſed upon the Subjects of that Kingdom; that
your Majeſty will be pleaſed to continue ſuch Governours hereafter but for
three Years, and that none once employed therein be appointed for the ſame
again, until the Expiration of ſix Years next after the End of the firſt
three Years, and that an Act paſs to diſanual ſuch Governor or Governors
during their Government, directly or indirectly, in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, Truſt or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to make any manner of Purchaſe or Acquiſition of any Mannors, Lands,
Tenements or Hereditaments within that Kingdom, other than from your
Majeſties own Heirs and Succeſſors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We humbly conceive, that this Propoſition tendeth to lay
a falſe and ſcandalous Aſperſion on your Majeſties gracious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that it toucheth very high upon your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Juſtice and Power; and under Colour of ſuppoſed Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
pretended to be in the greateſt Officer, that commandeth under
your Majeſty there, if he continue ſo long in his Government, as may
well enable him to find out and diſcover the true State of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the dangerous Diſpoſition and Deſigns of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party
there, to prevent him therein, and to turn him out from doing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
before or as ſoon as he is throughly informed and experienced
how to do the ſame, and then to hold him excluded ſo long, that in
all likelyhood he ſhall not live to come to that place the ſecond time,
which we humbly conceive will be a great Diſcouragement to any
Perſon of Honour and Fortune, to ſerve your Majeſty in that high
Truſt: And for their purchaſing Lands in that Kingdom, your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
may be pleaſed to leave them to the Laws, and puniſh them ſeverely
if they commit any Offence, or exerciſe any Oppreſſions under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of purchaſing of any Lands or Eſtates whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Prop.</hi> That an Act may be paſſed in the next Parliament, for the
raiſing and ſetling of Trained Bands, within the ſeveral Counties of that
Kingdom, as well to prevent foreign Invaſion, as to render them the more
ſerviceable and ready for your Majesties Service, as Cauſe ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The having of Train-Bands in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the preſent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
(under favour) be for your Majeſties Service, or the Safety of
that Kingdom; for that the Proteſtants by the ſaid ſad Effects of the
late Rebellion are ſo much deſtroyed, that the ſaid Bands muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in effect altogether of the Confederates, Catholicks; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
them in Arms, ſtored with Ammunition, and made ready for
Service by Muſtering and often Training, will prove, under Colour
of advancing your Majeſties Service againſt foreign Invaſions, a meer
Guard and Power of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Confederates, and by force of Arms
(according to their late Oaths and Proteſtations) to execute all their
cruel Deſigns for extirpation of the Proteſtant Religion, and <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Government; both of which they MORTALLY HATE however in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65997:484"/>
cunning they diſſemble it, and to prevent the ſetling an Army of
good Proteſtants, without which your Majeſties good Subjects cannot
live ſecurely there.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Prop.</hi> That an Act of Oblivion be paſſed in the next free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to extend to all your Majeſties ſaid Catholick Subjects, and their
Adherents, for all manner of Offences, Capital Criminal and Perſonal,
and the ſaid Act to extend to all Goods and Chattels, Cuſtoms, Meſne
Profits, Prizes, Arrears of Rent taken, received, or incurred ſince theſe
Troubles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We humbly pray that the Laws of force be taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
and do humbly conceive, that your Majeſty in Honour
and Juſtice, may forbear to diſcharge or releaſe any Actions, Suits,
Debts, or Intereſts, whereby your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects,
who have committed to Offence againſt your Majeſty or your Laws,
ſhall be barred or deprived of any of their legal Remedies, or juſt
Demands, which by any of your Majeſties Laws and Statutes, they
may have againſt the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Confederates, who are the only Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
or any of their party, for, or in reſpect of any Wrongs
done unto them, or any of their Anceſtors or Predeceſſors, in, or
concerning their Lands, Goods or Eſtates, ſince the contriving or
breaking forth of the Rebellion, the ſaid Confederates having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
provocation ſhed ſo much innocent Blood, and acted ſo many
Cruelties as cannot be parallelled in any Story: And we conceive it
to be high preſumption in them, upon ſo weak Grounds, to propound
an Act of Oblivion in ſuch general Terms, ſome of the Comederates
having been Contrives or Actors of ſuch cruel Murthers,<note place="margin">☞</note> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Acts of Inhumanity, as cry to God and your Sacred Majeſty
for Juſtice; and they having of your Majeſties Revenues, Cuſtoms,
Subſidies, and other Rights of your Crown in their hands, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed
by them, to the Value of Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds
and more.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Prop.</hi> For as much as your Majeſties ſaid Catholick Subjects, have
been taxed with many inhuman Cruelties which they never committed, your
Majeſties ſaid Suppliants therefore, for their Vindication, and to manifeſt
to all the World, their deſire to have all ſuch hainous Offenders puniſhed,
and the Offenders brought to Juſtice, do deſire that in the next Parliament
all notorious Murthers, Breaches of Quarter, and inhuman Cruelties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
of either Side, may be queſtioned in the ſaid Parliament, if your
Majeſty think fit, and ſuch as ſhall appear to be guilty, to be excepted out
of the ſaid Act of Oblivion, and puniſhed according to their Deſerts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We conceive this Propoſition is made but for a flouriſh, and
if the Confederates be ſo deſirous to try their innocency (as they
pretend) they need not ſtay for another Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
ſubmit to that which is now in being, which is an equal and juſt
Parliament, as in ſome of our Reaſons touching that point is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;<note place="margin">☞</note>

your Petitioners muſt be made guilty of imaginary crimes,

heard to plead in this cauſe before any Judgment be given therein,
and that the Examples of their former and frequent breaches of the

                  <p>WE have ſeen and conſidered the diſpatch directed from
you and our Council there, to our Truſty and Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Counſellor Sir <hi>Edward Nicholas,</hi> one of our Privy
Council of State, concerning the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
and your Proceedings thereupon; and as we could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the one without extraordinary amazement, that any mans folly
and preſumption could carry him to ſuch a degree of abuſing our truſt
how little ſoever, ſo we could not but be very ſenſible of the great
affection and zeal to our ſervice, which you have expreſſed in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our honour ſo highly traduced, into ſo ſpeedy and effectual way
of Vindication, by the proceeding againſt the ſaid Earl of <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan;</hi>
and though we are ſo well aſſured of yours and our Councils
entire confidence in the Juſtice and Piety of our Reſolutions, in what
concerns the maintenance of the true Proteſtant Religion, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of the Church and the Revenues thereunto belonging, and our
conſtant care of our good Subjects of the ſame in that our Kingdom;
as we do not think it needful to ſay any more to you upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
than what hath been ſufficiently declared by the practice and
profeſſion of our whole life, yet to the end that your zeal may be
the better intereſted in that particular, whereby to certify ſuch of our
Subjects as might be apt to be miſled by the ſubtilty and malice of
our Enemies; we thought fit to let you know, the whole truth
of what hath paſſed from us to the ſaid Earl, whereby he might in
any wiſe pretend to the leaſt kind of Truſt or Authority from us in
what concerns the Treaties of that Kingdom: The truth is, that the
preſſing condition of our affairs obliging us to procure a Peace in
that Kingdom, if it might be had upon any Terms ſafe to our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Conſcience, and to our Proteſtant Subjects there; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo, that the ſaid Peace could not be gained but by ſome ſuch
Indulgence to the Roman Catholicks in the point of freeing them
from the penalties impoſed upon the exerciſe of their Religion, which
although juſtly and duly we might grant, yet happily in a publick
tranſaction, could not be without ſome ſcandal to ſuch of our good
Subjects as might be apt to be wrought on by their Arts, who have
continually watched all advantages to blaſt the integrity of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we thought fit over and above our publick powers and directions
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65997:499"/>
to our Lieutenant to give our private inſtructions and powers,
to aſſure the Roman-Catholicks in a leſs publick way of the ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
from the penalties of the Law, and of ſome ſuch other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as might without blemiſh to our honour and conſcience, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to our Proteſtant Subjects be afforded them.</p>
                  <p>With the matter of theſe Inſtructions to you, we thought fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> at his going to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of his hearty affections to our Service, and withal knowing
his intereſt with the Roman-Catholick Party to be very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
we thought it not unlikely, that you might make good uſe of
him, by imploying that intereſt in perſwading them to a Moderation,
and to reſt ſatisfyed (upon his engagement alſo) with thoſe above
mentioned Conceſſions, of which in the nice condition of our affairs
you could give them no other than a private aſſurance. To this
end, and with the ſtricteſt Limitations that we could enjoyn him
meerly to thoſe particulars, concerning which, we had given you
private inſtructions, as alſo even in that, to do nothing <hi>but by your
ſpecial directions;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☞</note> it is poſſible we might have thought fit to have
given to the ſaid Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> ſuch Credential as might give
him credit with the Roman-Catholicks, in caſe you ſhould find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to make uſe of him, either as a farther aſſurance to them of
what you ſhould privately promiſe; or in caſe you ſhould judge it
neceſſary to manage thoſe matters for their greater confidence apart
by him, of whom in regard of his Religion and Intereſt, they might
be the leſs Jealous. This is all and the very bottom of what we
might poſſibly intruſt to the ſaid Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> in this affair,
which as things then ſtood, might have been very uſeful to our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in accelerating the Peace, and whereof there was ſo much need
as well for the preſervation of our Proteſtant Subjects there, as for
haſtning thoſe neceſſary aids which we were to expect from thence,
had we had the luck to imploy a Wiſer man; but the truth is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very confident of his affection and obedience, we had not much
regard to his abilities, ſince he was bound up by our poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
from doing any thing but what you ſhould particularly and
preciſely direct him to,<note place="margin">☞</note> both in the matter and manner of his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;
wherefore our pleaſure is, that the charge begun by the Lord
<hi>George Digby,</hi> our Secretary, according to his duty, be throughly and
diligently proſecuted againſt the ſaid Earl; and ſo no way doubting
of your and our Councils farther care, there to correſpond to your
beginning, in a matter ſo highly concerning us, We bid you hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in a Letter of the Seventh of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1644, importing a Brief
of Collections, whereby the Singing, Saying and Hearing of Maſs,
was granted, may obſerve, that notwithſtanding that Conceſſion,
the Lord Lieutenant did add a Proviſo, that no Maſs ſhould be
Said or Sung in Churches, Cathedral or Parochial, or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
thereunto belonging; by means whereof, and of an expreſs
denial to grant the Catholicks liberty to have a Catholick Biſhop
by any authority from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for want of other
Conceſſions in matters of Religion, without Proviſoes or Clogs
that would ſpoil them, matters of Religion were referred by the
late Articles, to further or other Conceſſions. And as we are
taught by the Tenents of Catholick Doctrin, that there can be no
Catholick Religion, nor eſſential parts thereof without Biſhops, who
in matters of Religion, depend, and ought to depend of the See
Apoſtolick, and without Prieſts made by ſuch Biſhops, or the Pope
himſelf, nor the Sacraments adminiſtred, without ſuch Prelates and
Paſtors; therefore the Exerciſe of Religion as to thoſe and ſeveral
other particulars eſſential, ought to made certain; or elſe that the
ſaid Statutes of the Second of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Statutes of Faculties
in the Twenty Eighth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, be totally Repealed as to
his Majeſties Roman-Catholick Subjects, and a proviſion made by
Act of Parliament for Roman-Catholick Biſhops and Paſtors, to be,
and remain in this Kingdom with impunity.</p>
                  <p>Upon conſideration of the Second Article, where it is expreſſed
that they ſhall not be diſturbed in the enjoyment of their Churches,
or any other Eccleſiaſtical Poſſeſſions, which were in their Hands at
the publication of the late Peace, until that matter with others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
already, receive a ſettlement, upon a Declaration of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
gracious intentions in a free Parliament held in this Kingdom,
his Majeſty being in a free condition himſelf. It is apparent by this
Second Article, beſides what is ſaid before, that the Firſt Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65997:504"/>
the Revocation of the Penal Laws, is not intended by the
undertaking of that engagement, to extend to the taking away of
the Penal Laws, that prohibit Maſs to be ſaid in Churches, and
ſeemeth, <hi>as to the Churches,</hi> to put us (by our own aſſent to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,)
in worſe condition than we were by the late rejected Peace,
for then and ſtill we have the reſolution of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in an order to hold our Churches always, and not to part
with them. And now if this Second Article were agreed on, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
only a promiſſive enjoying of them until Parliament, and ſo are
left as to that, in a worſe condition than before; and even until Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
it ſelf, there is no ſecurity at all for Churches or Church Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
within our Quarters, other than the undertaking of the ſaid
Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> who is ſubject to Mortality and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as other Mortal Men, and <hi>who was never yet of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> and
admit this were an aſſurance till Parliament, the ſame will fall on
the Kings Declaration to the contrary, if in a free condition; which
Declaration to be contrary, may probably be expected, <hi>ſo long as
his Majeſty is of a different Religion,</hi> and before that Parliament
be, all Perſons engaged, or to be engaged, are ſubject to Mortality:
Upon all which, we ſee no ſecurity at all for Churches or Church-Livings.</p>
                  <p>As to the Third, it containeth no conceſſion, and is but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of the ſaid Lord Marqueſs his Word, which is uncertain
and unſafe to rely on; without mentioning what Garriſons and
what Catholicks in them, and what number, and by whom they are
to be commanded, in regard the Commander in chief, may by his
Order remove or alter them, as he ſees cauſe, without looking after
the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> for Advice or Conſent; and in
effect, if the number to be put into Garriſons be not ſo aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,<note place="margin">☜</note>
                     <hi>that it may maſter the reſt there</hi> from the Proteſtant Party, it
is but to offer our Men to the Slaughter, and expoſe our ſelves to
what conditions they pleaſe, our Army abroad being thereby dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and the Party put into Garriſon, ſubject to be removed at the
pleaſure of him that ſhall command in chief.</p>
                  <p>As to the Fourth, whether the Catholick Lord General be of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Union, or faithful to the ſame, and what Commands to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on our Generals or Commanders, or upon which of them, or for
what time to continue, or to what chief Garriſons they ſhall be drawn,
or in what number, or how long they ſhall continue there, are
wholly uncertain, and all the particulars are alterable and ſubject
to the Will and Pleaſure of the Chief Governor for the time
being.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth only is matter of Security and mends not the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
granted, if the ſame were obtained, as is propounded; and if
our Union were diſſolved by any agreement before performance,
what means is left us to expect or obtain performance? And
certainly where the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> grounds all he
doth in this, on his own undertaking, without Warrant from his
Majeſty, we cannot prudently ſuppoſe, (having no other Grounds
for it) but his Majeſty will diſavow it, when he did diſavow
the undertaking of the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> to the Confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
made more ſolemnly to the Perſons wherewith the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was entruſted, and who had thus far an advantage beyond the
Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> that his Lordſhips the Earl of <hi>Glamorgans</hi>
Conceſſions were grounded on his Majeſties known authority, under
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65997:505"/>
his Seal Manual, and atteſted with his Royal Signature; whereas
the Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> goeth only on his own undertaking.</p>
                  <p>As to the Sixth, it containeth no certain command or order, which
may in future be had from his Majeſty, and being a certain contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
needeth no Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>As to the Seventh, concerning his Lordſhips undertaking, to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
for redreſs to be had in the next Parliament, therein we find
no manner of aſſurance for all thoſe who unjuſtly loſt their Eſtates in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> other than that the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> will Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſollicite, perſwade and uſe his beſt endeavours, whereof no man
is Judge but himſelf, and the event and engagement uncertain, and
the Act of Oblivion being only by that inſtrument of engagement
to extend to thoſe that ſhall joyn therein, and which engagement is
now ſuddenly expected to be concluded there; all others of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that are abſent, who cannot joyn therein ſo ſuddenly, and are
not privy, are left open to the danger of the extremities of the Law,
both for their Lives and Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, we conclude that the <hi>General Aſſemby</hi> now at hand, is
the only means left to conclude a certain ſtable Peace in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and no private or particular undertaking of any Subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified,
with any appearing authority; beſides the former induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to ſatisfy you, you ought ſeriouſly to conſider, that the Earl
of <hi>Glamorgans</hi> Conceſſions grounded on his Majeſties authority, and
read in the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> held in <hi>Lent</hi> laſt, and on which they
wholly relyed, will by theſe propoſitions (if accepted) <hi>be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
waved,</hi> contrary to the intention of the whole Kingdom, which
we deſire may be ſeriouſly reflected on amongſt the reſt, thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
by many degrees being more valuable, and grounded on
clearer authority, than the offerings or undertakings now made.</p>

                     </gap>attendance upon the publick affairs, being
hopeful, that in all this time, ſome good effects would have
been produced out of the forward and chearful Reſolutions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
obſerved in you, and many other Noble Perſons upon
your departure from hence, and the good concurrence that was
expected from many others, well affected to a happy and ſpeedy
ſettlement; but after Nine Weeks expectation, there hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
occurred to my knowledge, but the following particulars
which I ſhall diſtinctly ſet down, both to prevent miſtakes in you,
and clear the aſperſions that may be caſt upon others.</p>
                  <p>1. By Vote of the Aſſembly, the total rejection of the Peace, and
of all other both publick and private overtures and undertakings
that had relation thereto, deſtroying the only poſſible means that
could have united the Kingdom unto any hopeful way of preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as affairs now ſtand in the Kings Dominions.</p>
                  <p>2. A new Union Sworn, grounded upon impoſſible underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
if not in the Propoſitions themſelves; at leaſt in the moſt
material circumſtances of ſecuring them, thereby excluding all
hopes of Peace, and ſetling and confirming a laſting divided Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>3. That being compaſſed for ſome ſeeming ſatisfaction to thoſe
that were drawn into it, a plauſible ſhew of ſome other accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
was contrived; but that being brought up to <hi>Dublin</hi> by
Mr. Doctor <hi>Fennel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Geffery Barron,</hi> with much aſſurance given
by divers, of all the ſatisfaction that ſuch a change of reſolutions
could produce, there appeared but a Verbal Meſſage of ſome few
general Heads, they refuſing to give it in Writing, or to teſtify un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Hands what they acknowledgd my Lord Lieutenant took
<hi>Verbatim</hi> from them; neither would they aſſume any Power to make
any particular explanations, and yet earneſtly demanded Reſolutions
with expedition.</p>
                  <p>This unexpected delay, and continued uncertainty in ſuch a nick
of time, after ſo many former breaches on your parts, and ſo many
warnings and true intelligence given you by others, of the King's
being delivered up to the Parliament, the vaſt Preparations by
them made for Reducing this Kingdom; and even thoſe moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to his Majeſties Service in <hi>England,</hi> as forward as any to joyn
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65997:507"/>
therein, finding themſelves deſtroyed by the failing of the Peace here,
and the promiſed Aſſiſtance thereupon; Your not long ſince invading
and deſtroying the only remaining Party Obedient to the Kings
Authority, the ſmall regard had by you of the approaching dangers,
and the diviſions fomented and ſtill encreaſing amongſt your ſelves,
did by an unavoidable neceſſity, as I conceive, beget a reſolution in
my Lord Lieutenant and thoſe of his Party about <hi>Dublin,</hi> to try
ſome other expedient for their preſervation and redemption out
of the languiſhing, ſtarving condition they have theſe many Years,
with much patience endured; and for my own part, having long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the high Affronts and Diſreſpects put upon my Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
and many other of His Majeſty's Miniſters and Servants, and
the largeſt proportion of Malice caſt upon them, when they were
moſt induſtrious in the preſervation of the Kingdom, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the like reſolutions in me to try my Fortune in ſome other
Climate, ſince my Three Years conſtant expence of time, health
and fortune, for the advantage of the publick, hath gained no
other recompence, than to be Printed againſt by Declarations, Books,
and ſeveral other Papers, the Forces of other Provinces poured
down upon me to deſtroy my whole Eſtate; thoſe Forces under my
Command thereby inforced to Disband, the Officers and all other
of my Servants and Followers proſecuted, and nothing of means
or quarter left me to maintain a Guard of Horſe for my own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
my Wife and Family readily permitted to repair to <hi>Dublin,</hi>
but no allowance to return; all which particulars put together, I
leave it freely to you to judge, whether it be not high time for
me to depart, when the voice of the Kingdom repreſented in the
Aſſembly, have by a clear implication in their ſafe conduct declared
their deſires therein.</p>
                  <p>Since my coming hither, I have ſeen ſome Letters and find much
confidence in many, that the whole Aſſembly and Clergy are now
united to put a full power into my Lord Lieutenants hands, and
to make proviſion for his Lordſhip and his Party, both for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
and maintenance of a War, to which I may not preſume
to frame any Judgment at ſo late an hour of the day; but this I
conceive is moſt certain, that if it doth not appear ſuddenly, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
and clearly, with a full power and truſt, and apparent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
to make it good, it will hardly be relied upon, and that fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there remains nothing for me to do, but in another Country
to labour the perfection of Praying as well for my Perſecutors,

                  <p>IT is not without an unanſwerable proportion of Reluctancy to ſo

whereof we make without vain glory) manifeſted our ſelves ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
faithful, ſo hath it pleaſed the Divine providence to proſper our
endeavours with very many improbable ſucceſſes; to the attainment
whereof, though we have ſtrugled thro' all the difficulties, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with all the ſufferances that a People unſupply'd with all neceſſary
and ſecondary means, could undergo, yet have we encountred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that diſ-affection, or diſ-couragement, as we find admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
unto us, by a conſtant obſervation, that it is as well in the power
as it is in the practice, of our malicious and indefatigable Enemies,
to place and foment differences upon us, not only to our extream
ſcandal and diſgrace, (which we ſhould the leſs reſent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could terminate in us) but to the obſtructing of the ſupply order'd and
deſign'd for publick ſervice, and to the irreparable prejudice thereof,
which our Enemies can value at ſo low a rate, as to put it into the
bargain, they are in hand to make for our deſtruction. It being very
approvable by us, that ſeveral Perſons in power there do interpoſe
their endeavours to continue us (by the Impeding of ſupplies) in a
deſperate, languiſhing, and periſhable condition upon the Place, and
in a deſpicable and doubtful eſteem with the honourable Houſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

made by Letters from the Honourable Committee at <hi>Darby</hi>

of the Houſes the only Remora then alleadged to make ſtay of ſeven
thouſand Suits of cloaths, and ten thouſand pounds in money, being
before deſigned for our releif, there is no more than two thouſand ſeven
hundred pounds ſent unto us in mony, and thereof but fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds deſign'd for the feeding of us and the Souldiers under
our Command. And that notwithſtanding the ſignal Teſtimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of our real intentions and affections to that Cauſe and ſervice in
a late Engagement againſt the Rebels at <hi>Knockninoſſe,</hi> which we touch
at without any affection of vain-glory, the Votes then renewed for our
Relief, and the Order for our Indemnity, (which was conceived
would not have found ſo much heſitation, with thoſe whoſe ſervice
we had only profeſt) are laid aſide, and nothing effectual or advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
done in order thereto for our avail, ſave the tranſmittal of two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouſand
ſeven hundred pounds, but on the contrary, new jealouſies
and diſtruſts of us are reimbrac'd and fomented.</p>
                  <p>It is not therefore ſo inſupportable a diſ-comfort to us, to obſerve
our own lives expoſed a ſacrifice to the malice of our now potent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Enemies, who by the conjunction of three ſeveral armies are not
more encourag'd to confront us in the field, than we, by the art and
practice uſed to withhold thoſe juſt and neceſſary ſupplyes from us,
diſabled to joyn battle with them, as to obſerve our honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and Integrity, (dearer to us than our lives) brought into ſuch
frequent queſtion, and unworthily mangled, depraved and ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the calumnious aſperſions of our powerful and prevailing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaryes,
in deſpight of all our zealous and cordial Endeavours, to
give indubitable teſtimony and evidence of our Fidelities. What if
we are beyond any common meaſure afflicted and diſmay'd? we are
confident, that all perſons of honour will acknowledge that we have

for to provide, that we may not live hereafter but out of your favour.
So having intercepted and perverted the comfort, we well hoped to
have received from other teſtimonies of our ſincerity, they have only
left us this expedient, to teſtifie our mindfulneſs of our duty by, which
is to give humble intimation to that honourable Houſe, that we are
involved in ſo great and extream Exigences of diſtreſs and univerſal
want, with the preſſure of three joynt Armies, upon our weak and

                  <p>TO prevent the too frequent prejudices, incident through jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,
diſtruſts, and miſconſtructions to all undertakings,
we account it not the leaſt worthy our Labour, upon the
inſtant of our Arrival, to prepare this People, whoſe well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
we contend for, with a right underſtanding of thoſe intentions
in us, which in order to his Majeſties Service, we deſire may ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in their good.</p>
                  <p>To enumerate the ſeveral reaſons, by which we were induc'd, (for
preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Engliſh intereſt,)
to leave the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other his Majeſties Garriſons then
under our power in this Kingdom, in the hands of thoſe intruſted
by his two Houſes of Parliament, were to ſet forth a Narrative in
place of a Manifeſt. It may ſuffice to be known, that thoſe Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
had for one main ground this confidence, that by being under
the power of the Houſes, they would upon a happy expected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
of affairs in <hi>England,</hi> revert unto, and be reveſted in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
as his proper right.</p>
                  <p>But having found how contrary to the inclinations of the well-affected
to his Majeſties Reſtauration in <hi>England,</hi> the power of that
Kingdom hath unhappily devolv'd to hands, imployed only in the
art and labour of pulling down, and ſubverting the Fundamentals of
Monarchy, (with whom a pernicious party in this Kingdom, do
equally ſympathize and cooperate.) And being filled with deep ſenſe
of the Duty and Obligations that are upon us, ſtrictly to embrace all
opportunities of employing our endeavours, towards the recovery of
his Majeſties juſt Rights in any part of his Dominions. Having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the Proteſtant Army in the Province of <hi>Munſter,</hi> (by ſpecial

to have found means to manifeſt the Candor and Integrity thereof,
in a diſclaimer of any obedience to, or concurrence with thoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

                  <p>We have as well in obedience thereunto, as in purſuance of our own

our approbation and eſteem of the proceeding, of the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

Proteſtant Religion according to the Example of the beſt Reformed
Churches.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To defend the King in his prerogatives.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To maintain the priviledges and freedom of Parliament,
and the Liberty of the Subjects; that in order hereunto we ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to the hazard of our Lives, thoſe Rebells of this Kingdom,
who ſhall refuſe their obedience to his Majeſty, upon ſuch terms as
he hath thought fit by us to require it: And we ſhall endeavour to
the utmoſt the ſuppreſſing of that independant party, who have thus
fiercely laboured the extirpation of the true Proteſtant Religion, the
ruin of our Prince, the diſhonour of Parliament and the Vaſſalage
of our Fellow Subjects, againſt all thoſe who ſhall depend upon them
or adhere unto them, and that this our undertaking might not appear
obnoxious to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> but that we deſire a firm Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Agreement be preſerved betwixt us, we do likewiſe declare,
that we will continue free Traffick and Commerce with all his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
good Subjects of <hi>England;</hi> and that we will not in the leaſt
manner prejudice any of them that ſhall have recourſe to our Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
either in their Bodies, Ships or Goods; nor ſhall we take any
thing from them without payment of ready mony for the ſame. And
now that by his Majeſties ſaid Command, we have proceeded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter
upon the work of his ſervice in this Province, we conceive no
higher Teſtimony can be be given of his Majeſties acceptation, or of
the eſtimation we bear about us towards their proceeding, than by
reſorting unto them in perſon with his Majeſties Authority, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
unto them the incouragement and ſatisfaction they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in this aſſurance, that as we bear an eſpecial regard to their
preſent undertakings and performances, accompanied with a real
ſenſe of their former ſufferings; ſo leaſt there ſhould any advantage be
derived unto thoſe, who endeavour to improve all opportunities of
ſowing ſedition and diſtruſt by this ſuggeſtion, that the former diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in judgement and opinion, which have induced perſons to
ſerve diverſly under his Majeſty, and the Parliament, will occaſion
prejudice, or ill reſentments to ariſe towards ſuch Perſons, as have
not formerly concurred in judgment with others in his Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
We do declare that we are qualified with ſpecial Power and
Authority from his Majeſty to aſſure them that no diſtinction ſhall be
made in any ſuch conſideration, but that all perſons now intereſted
and engaged in this cauſe, ſhall be reflected upon with equal favour
and regard; and that we ſhall make it our endeavours ſo to improve
and confirm his Majeſties Gracious diſpoſure towards them, as that
we will never call to memory any paſt difference in Opinion, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Action, or Profeſſion to the prejudice of any Member of this
Army, or any perſon relating to it; but on the contrary ſhall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ready to atteſt our good affections towards them, in the diſcharge
of ſuch good Offices as ſhall be in our power; in return whereof we
ſhall only expect, their perſeverance in their preſent ingagements for
his Majeſties ſervice, with ſuch alacrity, conſtancy and affection as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65997:513"/>
may ſuit with their late publick Declaration and Profeſſions. To
whom we deſire this aſſurance alſo may be inculcated, that as we ſhall
in the future uſe our utmoſt care and diligence to provide for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
from the like hardſhips, to thoſe they have formerly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone;
ſo we have already employed our beſt induſtry and endeavours
for the ſettlement of ſuch a courſe as we may (with moſt reaſon)
hope will in theſe uncertain times, produce a conſtant and competent
ſubſiſtence for them, enabling them to make ſuch a progreſs in their
preſent undertakings, as may with the accompliſhment of the great
ends thereof, eſtabliſh their own Honour and content. Thus much
we have thought fit to publiſh unto the world to furniſh it with an
evidence of ſtrong conviction againſt us, if we ever ſwerve (to the
beſt of our power) from the juſt ways of maintaining the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

                  <p>AS a War undertaken principally for Religion, gave us all the
world over the reputation of a Catholick People, even ſo the
Peace now concluded between the Kings Lieutenant and us, ſpeak
us a moſt Loyal Nation, as complying with his Majeſty in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
neceſſity, though in our thoughts and occaſions during theſe ſeven
years Wars, we have ſtill this Loyalty, and have oft publickly ſworn
it, yet lay we under the ſuſpicion of many men; but by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Agreement all blemiſh of that kind is taken away; We are of
opinion, that our ſenſe of this Peace, would give you a confidence

the Being and Safety of Religion: And the Subſtance thereof, as

                  <head>Appendix XLV. <date>13 March 1649.</date>
Remedies propoſed to his Excellency for removing the Diſcontents and
Diſtruſts of the People, and for advancing his Majeſties ſervice, preſented
by ſuch of the Clergy as met at Lymerick the 8th. of March 1649. and
the Commiſſioners of Truſt.</head>
                  <p>I. HAving joyned our ſelves in this meeting upon your Excellencies
Summons, and in compliance with your pleaſure in delivering
our ſenſe how any life might be conſerved in this gaſping
Kingdom: The following conſiderations we thought fit to be repreſented
to your Excellency.</p>
                  <p>II. It is generally thought, that moſt of the preſent Diſtreſſes of the
Kingdom, did proceed from the want of a Privy Council (as ever it was
accuſtomed heretofore) to aſſiſt the Government of this Land in War and
Peace. We conceive it eſſentially neceſſary, that ſuch a Council be framed
of the Peers and others, Natives of the Kingdom, as well Spiritual and
Temporal, to ſit with your Excellency daily, and determine all weighty
affairs of the Country by their Counſel. The Commiſſioners of Truſt
being only inſtruſted for the due obſervation of the Articles of Peace, had
not the Authority of Counſellors, and the affairs that intrench moſt upon
the matters of State of the Kingdom, were not their ſtudy or charge.</p>
                  <p>III. That there be an exact Eſtabliſhment of the Forces forthwith ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
and agreed on, directing what numbers the Army of the Kingdom
ſhall conſiſt of Horſe and Foot, what each Province ſhall bear, what
number each Regiment, Troop, and Company ſhall conſiſt of; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down ſuch Rules that no payments be made, but according to the
number of Forces that ſhall be viſible and extant for ſervice; and the
ſaid eſtabliſhment to be forthwith put in Execution; and the ſaid Army
once eſtabliſhed, and made certain; not to be multiplied, or exceeded,
other than by ſolemn further eſtabliſhment to be made with the conſent
and concurrence of the Commiſſioners of Truſt, if there be cauſe for
it. And in that Eſtabliſhment a certain and ſure courſe to be taken,
that all the Forces have the ſame aſſurance, and the like equality of
payment for all the Army. And in that Eſtabliſhment all preventions
poſſible to be ſet down for avoiding the burthening of the People
with thorough-fare, Delinquency, or Free quarter, or any other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
than thoſe continued in the eſtabliſhment, and none to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
but in one capacity, and to ſerve in the head of that Command,
otherwiſe not to be in Command. And in the ſaid eſtabliſhment, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the neceſſity the Kingdom is reduced unto, the Burthen of general
Officers, or other burthens that may be ſpared, or not found neceſſary,
to be put by, and the Kingdom at preſent eaſed thereof.</p>
                  <p>IV. That on the compoſure of that Army, and on Garriſoning of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
neceſſary to be Garriſoned, exact warineſs be uſed, that none againſt
whom juſt exception may be taken, or who by any probability conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all circumſtances cannot be ſo well confided in, as others of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
be either of the number whereof thoſe eſtabliſhed Forces ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
or be put, or continued in Garriſon.</p>
                  <p>V. That ſeveral places are Garriſon'd without the conſent, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65997:523"/>
of the Commiſſioners of Truſt. It is propoſed that the Forces
placed in ſuch Garriſons, be forthwith removed and withdrawn, and not
Garriſon'd, but by conſent of the Commiſſioners of Truſt; and that
none be placed in ſuch Garriſons, but ſuch as the Commiſſioners of Truſt
will conſent to be placed therein. And for particular inſtance of this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
the Caſtle of <hi>Clare, Clonraud, Ballingary,</hi> and <hi>Bunratty,</hi> are inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and what elſe are of that nature, the Commiſſioners of Truſt are to
repreſent and inſtance forthwith, and ſee redreſs afforded therein to the
peoples ſatisfaction, if any ſuch be of that nature.</p>
                  <p>VI. That it is a great cauſe of jealouſie and miſtruſt among the people,
that where Catholicks were ſettled, or underſtood to be ſettled in ſome
of the greateſt employments of Truſt in the Army, they have been not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
removed and put by, for avoiding of thoſe cauſes, and
grounds of miſtruſt, the Catholicks ſo ſettled, or <hi>understood to be ſetled</hi>
in ſuch employments, are deſired to be forthwith reſtored.</p>
                  <p>VII. That for ſatisfaction of the people, who in the many diſorders of
theſe times ſee no face of Juſtice exerciſed among them, a Judicature be
erected, according to the Articles of peace wherein all Cauſes without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
between party and party may be heard and determined; and that
Judges of Aſſize go Circuits twice each year at leaſt; and over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, that ſome perſons as Juſtices of Peace in Quarter Seſſions, or
otherwiſe, be entruſted in each County to whom the Inhabitants of each
ſuch County may have their applications for redreſs againſt oppreſſions
and extortions hapning within that County; and for Debts and other
complaints not exceeding Ten pounds. This will free your Excellency
from the trouble of thoſe multitudes of complaints that come before you,
for want of other Judicatures, and will leave your Lordſhip the time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to be diſpoſed in the conſults of the <hi>State</hi> affairs, for the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the War, and other the great affairs that may concern the
better Government of the Kingdom; theſe being of ſo high a nature, and
ſo much tending to the peoples preſervation, as no other matter or cauſes
ſhould be interpoſed; that might give any interruption thereto.</p>
                  <p>VIII. That to the very great grievance and diſſatisfaction of the people
the Receiver general hath failed to clear his Accompts, concerning the
vaſt ſums of Mony levyed from the people ſince the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1648.
though the ſame hath been long expected, and the grievances from the
Agents of Counties long foreſlowed, in expectation of thoſe Accompts.
It is propoſed that ſome of the Commiſſioners of Truſt and ſome other
ſelect perſons, may be forthwith now named to be authorized and entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to take the ſaid Accompts; and to that purpoſe the perſons ſo to be
entruſted to be authorized to call before them the ſaid Receiver General,
the Commiſſary of the Victuals, and their Deputies, and all Receivers
whatſoever intruſted in the ſeveral Counties as they ſhall ſee cauſe, and
will find it neceſſary, and to take examinations on Oath, and to do all
matters that may tend to the clearing of thoſe Accompts; whereby on
the cloſe of ſuch Accompts, due ſatisfaction may be given to the people in
the knowledge of the right diſpoſal thereof; or the Parties failing in ſuch
accompts due puniſhment to be inflicted on them, and their perſons goods
and Eſtates ſeized on, and ſecured for ſatisfaction of the People, that they
be anſwerable for what they ſhall appear to be owing, to be applyed to the
publick ſervice. And for avoiding all jealouſies and miſtruſts for the future
in the diſpoſal of any of the publick monies, ſo far and for what any publick
Treaſury ſhall be neceſſary, all Sums and Payments be made, with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
conſent and concurrence of the Commiſſioners of Truſt, und
not otherwiſe; and no perſons to intermeddle hereafter in the receipts of
Publick dues that ſhall fail in the accompts for the time paſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:65997:523"/>
IX. That the Oppreſſions and Extortions of any of the Officers or
others of the Army hitherto hapned, and any Miſcarriages in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of the Army, either in Field-Service, or the render of Caſtles
or Towns to the Enemy, may be forthwith ſtrictly examined and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by the Lord-Lieutenant, aſſiſted by a Privy-Council now to be
choſen, and by a Council of War now to be named. And that for
the better Government of the Army, and for the Officers and others
of the Army, their due information how to demean themſelves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
and for the Peoples Satisfaction alſo, there be Rules and Orders
of War, drawn, printed and publiſhed, that may tend to the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
in the future, of ſuch Grievances as formerly have hapned for
want thereof. And for the Times paſt, what Oppreſſions or Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have hapned in any County, the ſame to be repreſented from
ſuch Counties to his Excellency, and ſuch Privy-Council as ſhall be
now named; upon which Repreſentation his Excellency and the ſaid
Council are to afford the beſt redreſs they may in the Grievances ſo to
be repreſented, for the Peoples Satisfaction and Redreſs; and this to
be intimated to the ſeveral Counties timely, that they may prepare
their ſaid Grievances.</p>
                  <p>X. That all <hi>Cuſtodiums,</hi> or other Acts or Orders done, or granted,
whereby any the Publick Revenue hath any way been diminiſhed, be
recalled by his Excellency, on the Inſtance of the Commiſſioners of
Truſt; and the private Perſons profiting thereby, to the prejudice
of the Publick, to accompt at full, notwithſtanding ſuch Orders or
<hi>Cuſtodiums;</hi> whereby the Publick Profit thereby to accrue, may admit
no diminution.</p>
                  <p>XI. That no Impoſition or Charge be impoſed on the People, by
Applotment, Free-quarter, or otherwiſe, but by the Commiſſioners
of Truſt, or with their Allowance, according to the Articles of Peace;
and none to have freedom in Applotments, but all to pay with equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and all Applotments or Impoſitions heretofore, ſince the <hi>17th</hi> of
<hi>January</hi> 1648, impoſed on the People, without the Conſent of the
Commiſſioners of Truſt, be put by, and due ſatisfaction given to the
People where ſuch Burdens have been impoſed.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch as it may happen, that your Excellency hath not Power
from his Majeſty to determine who ſhall ſerve as Privy-Counſellors;
yet it is propoſed that your Excellency may now fix on a number of
Select Perſons, ſatisfactory to the People, that may ſupply a Truſt and
Management of Affairs in ſuch ample manner, to all purpoſes, as
Privy-Counſellors, appointed by Authority from his Majeſty, were
accuſtomed to do, and might have done in time of Peace to all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
and their Acts to be obſerved for the better management of
the Publick Affairs.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>His Excellencies Anſwer.</head>
                     <p>I. IT it true, That the main End of Our deſiring a meeting of as
many of the Roman-Catholick Clergy, and of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as could be gotten together, during the Time We had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to ſtay at <hi>Limerick,</hi> was in hope, that by their joint Advice
and Aſſiſtance, Life might be conſerved in this gaſping Kingdom; and
the only means to attain to that End, (as We told you in our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

to remove ſuch cauſleſs Diſtruſts, as being maliciouſly infuſed into the
Peoples Minds, did ſlacken, if not wholly withdraw their Obedience
from his Majeſty's Authority in Us, rendring it impoſſible for Us
(with Honour, or hope of Succeſs) to contend againſt a powerful,
abſolutely obeyed, and plentifully ſupplied Enemy, under ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
Diſadvantages of Diſtruſts and Diſobedience. Some Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
We have given you of the Diſobediences, and of their ruinous
Conſequences, to which (next to God's Permiſſion) may principally
be attributed the unreſiſted Succeſs of the Rebels, even ſince we were
laſt at <hi>Waterford,</hi> where all our Deſigns (pointing firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
at the Safety of that City) for the recovery of <hi>Paſſage, Carrich,</hi>
and <hi>Roſſe,</hi> were not only fruſtrated, but the Authority we managed,
affronted, and our Perſon ungratefully put to hazard, by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of a very few, that by evil Practices, and falſe Pretences, had
gained Credit enough, among the well-meaning People, to miſtruſt
Us, that more than once conducted Forces to their Relief, and to
truſt them who purpoſed to build their private Safety, upon the Power
they have to ſacrifice the Liberties and Fortunes of their leſs diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fellow-Citizens; in anſwer to Our deſires, to have you to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
your Endeavours to procure ſuch Obedience to his Majeſty's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as might prevent the like Inconvenience in the future (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and not otherwiſe, We may be enabled and encouraged to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
our Determination, to run all poſſible Hazards for the King's
Service, and the preſervation of the Nation) We received from
you the above-mentioned Propoſitions, which how far they may be
conducible to that End, We know not, but do wiſh what We are able
to do for your Satisfaction, and the Satisfaction of the People upon
them, may have the Effect aimed at, and that with the ſpeed neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for your and their preſervation.</p>
                     <p>II. To the Second; We do not underſtand how the moſt of the
preſent Diſtreſſes of the Kingdom could proceed from the want of a
Privy-Council: nor (conſidering the State of the Kingdom, the
Power intruſted with the Commiſſioners, their Abilities, and how
freely We communicate with them Things of greateſt Importance)
how the framing of ſuch a Council can advantage the Management of
the War, which is now the only Matter of State. And that conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only of Proviſion to be made for an Army, and the employing
that Army to the beſt Advantage, is, or may be as well done, by
the Advice and Aſſiſtance of the ſaid Commiſſioners, as by any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of State, who will have no Power to raiſe Men, or to provide for
them, and to whom Deſigns upon the Enemy are no further to be
communicated, than We ſhall think fit. And with ſuch we ſhall as
readily acquaint the Commiſſioners, and as ſoon be adviſed by them,
as any other We can think of; the rather, that We know none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whoſe Faith and Judgment We may more ſafely depend, nor that
can better aſſiſt Us in any thing they ſhall be adviſed with, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their Knowledg of the Ability, and Burden of the Kingdom,
which We doubt (the State of moſt Men conſidered) cannot but be
increaſed by a Privy-Council. For theſe Reaſons we think not fit
unneceſſarily to preſume upon doing a thing, for which We neither
have Power, nor Precedent. Yet rather than there ſhould be any
thing wanting that is in Our Power to ſatisfy the People, let the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Acts that Privy-Counſellors have heretofore done, and are now
neceſſary, be inſtanced, and as far forth as they ſhall appear neceſſary
and fit, We ſhall qualify Perſons (free from juſt Exception) with
ſuch Powers.</p>

                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:65997:524"/>
III. All this Propoſition is aſſented unto, and as far forth as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
Us ſhall be obſerved, and immediately put in Execution; ſave
that if it be intended the Commiſſioners ſhould give their Conſent
to what particular Officers ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> We conceive that
a Power wherewith they are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> nor fit for
Us to bind Our ſelf, or any other chief Governour unto. And for
the not multiplying, or exceeding the Numbers to be fixed upon,
but by further ſolemn Eſtabliſhment, We conſent unto it, as far as
the ſame is agreeable to the Articles of Peace.</p>
                     <p>IV. To be explained what is intended by <hi>exact Wearineſs,</hi> or what
is underſtood by <hi>probable Circumſtances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>V. The too punctual Obſervation of this Propoſition hath been of
worſe Conſequence than the Particulars complained of have been.
And we expect that if the Articles of Peace be found deſtructively
ſtrict in this Point, they may be diſpenſed with: and not only Our
ſelf, but whoever commands a conſiderable Party of the Army upon
any Expedition, may have Power to Gariſon any place he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
neceſſary, without conſulting any Man.</p>
                     <p>VI. This is to be explained as to Particulars; and then ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
ſhall be given as is fit and agreeable to the Power given Us by
his Majeſty, and the Articles of Peace.</p>
                     <p>VII. We have been always ready to comply with this Propoſition,
and have more than once made offer of it; witneſs the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and are ſtill ready to perform what in this Point we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
unto by the Articles of Peace.</p>
                     <p>VIII. This Propoſition is aſſented unto, and was never hindred by
Us, ſave as to the diſpoſing of Money, wherein We inſiſt upon, and
ſhall conform our Self to the Articles of Peace; and could wiſh that
others beſides the Receiver General, accomptable for great Sums of
Money both before and ſince the Peace, had been or might be brought
to accompt for the Eaſe of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>IX. We are ready to do Juſtice unto the Country, and upon the
Offenders mentioned in this Propoſition, in ſuch manner, and with
ſuch Aſſiſtance as is uſual and requiſite in like caſes, and to that effect
we deſire that Particulars may be inſtanced.</p>
                     <p>X. To be explained.</p>
                     <p>XI. We acknowledg this Propoſition to be purſuant to the Letter
of the Articles of Peace, and that by unavoidable neceſſity it hath
been infringed: And we affirm that in the caſe the Kingdom is, the
ſtrictneſs thereof muſt be diſpenſed with, or otherwiſe certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
made for the Army; elſe no Service can be done.</p>

of the People; and Contempt of his Authority in this Kingdom,
your Excellency ſhould withdraw your ſelf, and his Authority.</hi> We have
conceived our ſelves in Duty bound for your Lordſhip's better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Inclination of this Nation, humbly to preſent unto
you, that however your Excellency might not have met with a ready
Concurrence to ſome Propoſals made for advancing his Majeſty's
Service, occaſioned through ſome Miſunderſtanding in ſome few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Places; yet this Country generally, and the Nation in it,
as they have already by expending their Subſtance in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
meaſure, and their Lives upon all occaſions, abundantly teſtified
their ſincere and irremoveable Affections to preſerve his Majeſty's
Rights and Intereſts intire unto him; ſo they will for the future, with
the like Chearfulneſs in attaining thoſe Ends, endeavour to overcome
all the Difficulties which the Enemies Power and Succeſs have laid in
their way. And that we who are here met (and doubt not the ſame
in general is the Senſe of the Nation) will with all Care and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs
endeavour not only to conſerve in the People ſuch their
good Inclinations; but if any Perſon or Place ſhall be refractory, or
decline that Obedience which is due to his Majeſty's Authority, we
ſhall contribute our beſt Endeavours to reduce them, and make them
conformable to the ſame. And although we may not undertake to
remove at preſent the Diſtruſts and Jealouſies the People entertain
through the want of Succeſs in Services, the Senſe of their Sufferings
and Apprehenſions for want of Redreſs of their Grievances; yet we
hope by the Bleſſing of God in the Succeſs of his Majeſty's Forces in
this Kingdom, when your Excellency is pleaſed to apply befitting
Remedies to the Preſſures and Grievances of his Majeſty's Subjects, to
be able to remove thoſe Apprehenſions in them. And as your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
by an Inſtrument dated at <hi>Loghreogh</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> laſt,
and preſented unto you in the Name of the Roman-Catholick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
of this Kingdom, may obſerve their hearty Affections and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to be obedient unto, and co-operate with his Majeſty's
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65997:525"/>
Authority in all the ways of his Service: So that we who are here
met, omit nothing within the reach of our Endeavours, which ſhall
tend to the ſame end of maintaining his Majeſty's Authority over
us, and his undoubted Intereſt in this Kingdom: And in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we humbly beſeech your Excellency to appoint Commanders in
the ſeveral Provinces to whom thoſe of his Majeſty's Subjects, who
by the Excitements of the Clergy (ready with Alacrity to undergo
that Care) ſhall be encouraged to take Arms, may repair for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the Power of the Rebels now drawing to a Body. And the
better to enable them thereunto, and for the Encouragement of thoſe
they ſhall perſwade to proceed in the Service, that a certain ſetled
courſe be taken, whereby the Means to be raiſed in the Country for
them, may be applied to their Maintenance, and not to any other
uſe. And this is humbly deſired by us here met to be immediately
ſettled, to the end that while other matters which concern the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of Grievances, regulating of the Revenue, and the carrying
on of the War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which require Time to be treated of, are in Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the People may be brought to a Head to reſiſt the Enemy, and
ſtop their further Progreſs, which we are confident may be effected
by the unanimous Reſolution, which we find in all Men to put their
Hands to the Work, and to give a ſignal Teſtimony of their Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                     <head>His Excellency's Anſwer.</head>
                     <p>AFter Our hearty Commendations in Anſwer to your Letter of
the laſt of <hi>April,</hi> We think fit to mind you, That upon our
communicating unto you his Majeſty's Letter of the ſecond of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
we then acquainted you at large with what had paſſed at
<hi>Waterford</hi> (which being by Us repreſented to his Majeſty, occaſioned
his ſending the ſaid Letter) as alſo, that we found the City of <hi>Lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
had taken Example thereby to affront and condemn his Majeſty's
Authority placed in Us, and from Us, by conſent of the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of the Confederate Catholicks at the Concluſion of the Peace,
derived to the Commiſſioners. Both which you paſs over with an
Extenuation of thoſe Diſobediences; and by attributing them to
ſome Miſunderſtandings, you ſeem in a manner to excuſe them:
whereas we had reaſon to expect, that (ſuitable to your general
Profeſſions) you would have reſented the particular Deportment of
thoſe places, and propoſed unto us how the Contrivers thereof
might be brought to Juſtice, and the Places reduced to perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
for as your Profeſſions of Care and Earneſtneſs to endeavour
not only to conſerve in the People the good Inclinations you find in
them, but that if any Perſon or Place ſhall be refractory, or decline
that perfect Obedience due to his Majeſty's Authority, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
your beſt Endeavours to reduce them, and make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65997:526"/>
to the ſame, cannot be evidenced or made good by you,
but by applying thoſe your Endeavours where We give you particular
undeniable Inſtances of Refractorineſs and Diſobedience; ſo there
can no Inſtance thereof be more pregnant, nor (if it be perſiſted in)
more deſtructive to his Majeſty, and the Nation than that of <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
To the immediate reducing whereof, We therefore thought,
and do now expect you would effectually apply your ſelves. We are
well ſatisfied that the Generality of the Country and Nation who have
given the Proofs you mention of their ſincere Affections, to preſerve
his Majeſty's Rights entire unto him, will perſevere therein, if thoſe,
upon whoſe Example and Advice they very much fix their Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
be active and induſtrious to lead and exhort them thereunto.
But We muſt withal let you know, that we cannot hope that thoſe
their good Affections and Alacrity in Defence of his Majeſty, and
their own Intereſts, can be ſucceſsful, if the City of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and all
other Cities and Towns be not in perfect Obedience, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be put under a Military Government for Military Matters, and
thereby into a Condition of Defence and Offence. Which to conceal
from the People, were towards them as great a Treachery as it would
be in Us a vain Raſhneſs, without ſuch Obedience firſt gained, to
attempt the oppoſing the Strength and power of the Rebels. And
therefore We muſt and do declare, that as the particular Refractori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the City of <hi>Waterford,</hi> hath more than any other humane
means contributed to all the Succeſſes of the Rebels in thoſe parts
ſince Our being at <hi>Waterford:</hi> And as the want of a ſtrong Garriſon
in <hi>Limerick</hi> (which we long ſince deſired might be received there,
but could not prevail) hath been the greateſt viſible means whereby
the ſaid Rebels have with ſmall, or no Reſiſtance gained or deſtroyed
the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and other parts adjacent: So the entire
Loſs of the Kingdom to his Majeſty, and the Deſtruction of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which We have no hope to prevent but by ſtrongly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
garriſoning and fortifying the ſaid City) muſt be imputed to
the Obſtinacy of that City, if it ſhall perſiſt therein, and to whoſoever
encourages or contrives with them therein.</p>
                     <p>As to theſe Diſtruſts and Jealouſies of the People, occaſioned (as
you ſay) for want of Succeſs in Services, the Senſe of their Sufferings,
and their Apprehenſions for want of Redreſs of their Grievances,
we anſwer, That both the Want of Succeſs, and the Senſe of their
Sufferings, whether from the Enemy or the Souldier, cannot be ſo
reaſonably attributed to any human Cauſe, as to the want of garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
the Army in principal Towns and Cities, wherein we cannot
yet prevail,<note place="margin">☞</note> nor ever could, till by the Enemies lying at one end of a
Town, we were not without articling and conditioning, permitted
to put ſuch Men as We could then get in at the other end: For, for
want of garriſoning the Army, and by being forced to quarter it at
large, it was not poſſible to have them exerciſed, their Arms kept in
Order, nor they under neceſſary Diſcipline; which when they were
to be brought together, rendred them worſe than ſo many new-raiſed
Men, by how much they had contracted a licentious Liberty, and
Habit of Rapine and Diſobedience. Nor could we prevent the Fraud
in Muſters, or reaſonably exact a ſtrict Accompt from Officers, of Men
ſo ſcattered, who when they ſhould be employed upon Service, were
forced (or pretending a Neceſſity wherein We could not diſprove
them) to range the Country to get in the means that ſhould enable
them to ſerve. As to their Apprehenſion for want of Redreſs to their

Authority in the Perſon of the Marqueſs of Ormond,
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, for the Miſgovernment of the
Subject, the ill Conduct of his Majeſty's Army, and the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

                     <p>THE Catholick People of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Year 1641, forced to
take up Arms for the Defence of Holy Religion, their Lives
and Liberties (the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> having taken a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to extinguiſh the Catholick Faith, and pluck up the Nation
root and branch, <hi>a powerful Army being prepared,</hi> and deſigned to
execute their black rage and cruel Intention) made a Peace, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
the ſame the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1648, with <hi>James</hi> Lord Marqueſs
of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Commiſſioner to that effect from his Majeſty, or from his
Royal Queen, and Son, Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> now <hi>Charles</hi> II, hereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting
their Loyal Thoughts to Royal Authority. This Peace or
Pacification being conſented to by the Confederate Catholicks, when
his Majeſty was in Reſtraint, and neither He, nor his Queen, or
Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> in condition to ſend any Supply or Relief to them,
when alſo the ſaid Confederate Catholicks <hi>could have agreed with the
Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> upon as good or <hi>better Conditions for Religion,</hi>
and the Lives, Liberties and Eſtates of the People, than were obtained
by the above Pacification, and thereby freed themſelves from the
Danger of any Invaſion or War to be made upon them by the Power
or <hi>England,</hi> where (notwithſtanding the Pacification with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty)
they were to diſpute and fight with their and his Enemies in
the three Kingdoms: Let the World judg if this be not an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Argument of Loyalty.</p>
                     <p>This Peace being ſo concluded, the Catholick Confederates ran ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
and cheerfully under his Majeſty's Authority in the Perſon of
the ſaid Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> plentifully
providing vaſt Sums of Moneys, <hi>well nigh half a Million</hi> of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Pounds, beſides ſeveral Magazines of Corn with a fair Train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
great Quantity of Powder, Match, Amunition, with other
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65997:528"/>
Materials for War. After his Excellency the ſaid Lord Lieutenant
fruſtrating the Expectation the Nation had of his Fidelity, Gallantry,
and Ability, became the Author of almoſt loſing the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to God, King and Natives, which he began by <hi>violating the
Peace</hi> in many Parts thereof, as may be clearly evidenced and made
good to the World.</p>
                     <p>I. The foreſaid Catholicks having furniſhed his Excellency with
the aforeſaid Sum of Mony, which was ſufficient to make up the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of 15000 Foot, and 2500 Horſe, agreed upon by the Peace, for
the preſervation of the Catholick Religion, our Sovereign's Intereſt,
and the Nation, his Excellency gave Patents of Colonels, and other
Commanders, over and above the Party under the Lord Baron of
<hi>Inchiquin,</hi> to Proteſtants, and upon them conſumed the Subſtance of
the Kingdom, who (moſt of them) afterwards betrayed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
us.</p>
                     <p>II. That the Holds and Ports of <hi>Munſter,</hi> as <hi>Cork, Youghall, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi>
&amp;c. were put in the Hands of faithleſs Men, of the Lord of
<hi>Inchiquin</hi>'s Party, that betrayed the Places to the Enemy, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
endangering of the King's Intereſt in the whole Kingdom. This
good Service they did his Majeſty, after ſoaking up the Sweat and
Subſtance of his Catholick Subjects of <hi>Munſter,</hi> where it is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that upon making the Peace, his Excellency would no way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Loyal Catholick Subjects of <hi>Cork, Youghall, Kingſale,</hi> and
other Gariſons, to return to their own Homes or Houſes.</p>
                     <p>III. Catholick Commanders inſtanced by the Commiſſioners of
Truſt, according to the Pacification, and hereupon by his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's
Commiſſion receiving their Commands in the Army, as Col. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Purcel,</hi> Major General of the Army, and Col. <hi>Pierce Fitz-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi>
alias <hi>Mac. Thomas,</hi> Commiſſary of the Horſe, were removed
without the conſent of the ſaid Commiſſioners, and by no demerit of
the Gentlemen; and the ſaid Places, that of Major General given to
<hi>Daniel O-Neal</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Proteſtant; and that of Commiſſary of the
Horſe, to Sir <hi>William Vaughan</hi> Kt. and after the ſaid Sir <hi>William</hi>'s
Death, to Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> Kt. both Proteſtants.</p>
                     <p>IV. A Judicature, and legal way of adminiſtring Juſtice, promiſed
by the Articles of Peace, was not performed; but all Proceſs and
Proceedings done by Paper Petitions, and thereby private Clerks,
and other corrupt Miniſters inrich'd, the Subject ruined, and no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
done.</p>
                     <p>V. The Navigation, the great Support of <hi>Ireland,</hi> quite beaten
down, his Excellency diſheartning the Adventures, Undertakers,
and Owners, (as Capt. <hi>Antonio,</hi> and others) favouring Hollanders,
and other Aliens, by reverſing of Judgments legally given, and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitively
concluded before his Commiſſioners Authority. By which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
of Maritime Affairs, and not providing for an orderly and
good Tribunal of Admiralty, we have hardly a Bottom left to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a Letter to his Majeſty, or any other Prince.</p>
                     <p>VI. The Church of <hi>Cloyne</hi> in our poſſeſſion at the time of making
the Peace, violently taken from us by the Lord of <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Articles of Peace; no Juſtice, nor Redreſs was made,
upon Application or Complaint.</p>
                     <p>VII. That Oblations, Book-monies, Interments, and other Obven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Counties of <hi>Cork, Waterford,</hi> and <hi>Kerry,</hi> were taken
from the Catholick Prieſts, and Paſtors, by the Miniſters, without
any Redreſs or Reſtitution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:65997:529"/>
VIII. That the Catholick Subjects of <hi>Munſter</hi> lived in Slavery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Preſidency of the Lord of <hi>Inchiquin;</hi> theſe being their
Judges, that before were their Enemies, and none of the Catholick
Nobility or Gentry admitted to be of the Tribunal.</p>
                     <p>IX. The Conduct of the Army was improvident and unfortunate.
Nothing hapned in Chriſtianity more ſhameful, than the Diſaſter of
<hi>Rathmines</hi> near <hi>Dublin,</hi> where his Excellency (as it ſeemed to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Travellers, and Men of Experience who viewed all) kept ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Mart of Wares, a Tribunal of Pleadings, or a great Inn of
Play, Drinking and Pleaſure, than a well-ordered Camp of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
<hi>Drogheda</hi> unrelieved, was loſt by Storm, with much Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and the loſs of the Flower of <hi>Leinſter. We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ford</hi> loſt much by
the unskilfulneſs of a Governor, a young Man, vain and unadviſed.
<hi>Roſs</hi> given up (and that by his Excellency's Order) without any
Diſpute, by Col. <hi>Luke Taaffe,</hi> having within near upon 2500 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
deſirous to fight. After that the Enemy made a Bridg over
the River of <hi>Roſs,</hi> (a Wonder to all Men, and underſtood by no
Man) without any Let or Interruption, our Forces being within
ſeven or eight Miles to the Place, wherein 200 Muſqueteers at <hi>Roſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berkine,</hi>
being timely ordered, had interrupted this ſtupendious Bridg,
and made the Enemy weary of the Town. <hi>Carrig</hi> being betrayed
by the Proteſtant Ward there, our Army afterwards appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Place, the Souldiers were commanded to fight againſt the
Walls, and Armed Men, without great Guns, Ladders, Petards,
Shovels, Spades, Pickaxes, or other Neceſſaries, there being killed
upon the place above 500 Souldiers, valiantly fighting, yet near
<hi>Thomas-Town,</hi> our Souldiers being of tryed Foot, two to one, and
well reſolved, were forbidden to fight in the open Field, having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Ground againſt the Enemy, to the utter diſheartning of
the Souldiers and People. After this the Enemy came like a Deluge
upon <hi>Calan, Feathard, Caſhell, Kilmallock,</hi> and other Corporations
within the Provinces of <hi>Leinſter</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> and the Country about
rendred Tributary. Then followed the taking of <hi>Laghlin</hi> and <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny;</hi>
then that of <hi>Clonmell,</hi> where the Enemy met with Gallantry,
Loſs and Reſiſtance. Laſtly, <hi>Tecrohan</hi> and <hi>Catherlough,</hi> two great
Pillars of <hi>Leinſter</hi> ſhaken down; that of <hi>Tecrohan</hi> (to ſpeak nothing
for the preſent of all other Places) was given up by Orders. <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford</hi>
block'd up, is in a ſad Condition: <hi>Duncannon,</hi> the Key of the
Kingdom, unrelieved ſince the firſt of <hi>December,</hi> is like to be given
up and loſt.</p>
                     <p>X. That the Prelates, after the numerous Congregation at <hi>Cloan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macnoiſe,</hi>
(where they made Declarations for the King's great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
after printed) and after many other laborious Meetings and
Conſultations, with the Expreſſions of their ſincerity and earneſtneſs,
were not allowed by his Excellency, to have employed their Power,
and beſt diligence towards advancing the King's Intereſt, but rather
ſuſpected, and blamed, as may appear by his own Letter to the
Prelates then at <hi>James-Town,</hi> written <hi>Aug.</hi> 2. And words were
heard to fall from him dangerous, as to the Perſons of ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</p>
                     <p>XI. That his Excellency repreſented to his Majeſty ſome parts
of this Kingdom diſobedient, which abſolutely deny any ſuch diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
by them committed, and thereby procured from his Majeſty
a Letter to withdraw his own Perſon, and the Royal Authority, if
ſuch Diſobediences were multiplied, and to leave the People with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65997:529"/>
the benefit of the Peace. This was the Reward his Excellency
(out of his Envy to a Catholick Loyal Nation) prepared for our
Loyalty and Obedience, ſealed by the ſhedding of our Blood, and
the loſs of our Subſtance.</p>
                     <p>XII. That his Excellency, and the Lord of <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> when Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Catholicks, being very active in unnatural Executions
againſt us, and ſhedding the Blood of poor Prieſts and Churchmen,
have ſhewed little of Action ſince this Peace, but for many Months
kept themſelves in <hi>Connaught</hi> and <hi>Thomond,</hi> where no Danger, or the
Enemy appeared, ſpending their time (as moſt Men obſerved) in
Play, Pleaſure, and great Merriment, while the other parts of the
Kingdom were bleeding under the Sword of the Enemy. This was
no great Argument of Senſe or Grief in them, to ſee a Kingdom loſt
to his <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>XIII. That his Excellency, when proſpering, put no Truſt of
Places taken in, into the Hands of Catholicks, as that of <hi>Drogheda,
Dundalk, Trim,</hi> &amp;c. And by this his Diffidence in Catholicks, and
by other his Actions and Expreſſions, the Catholick Army had no
Heart to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight, or to be under his Command; and feared greatly
(if he had maſtered the Enemy) and with them the Commiſſioners
of Truſt, or the greater part of them; and many thouſands of the
Kingdom alſo feared he would have brought the Catholick Subjects,
and their Religion, to the old Slavery.</p>
                     <p>XIV. We will not ſpeak of many Corruptions and Abuſes, as
paſſing of a <hi>Cuſtodium</hi> upon the Abby of <hi>Killbegain</hi> (worth in paſt
Years to the Confederates well nigh 400 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>) to Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<hi>Lane</hi> for 40 <hi>l.</hi> (or thereabouts) <hi>per Annum,</hi> nor of many other

                     <p>XV. We do alſo notify to the Catholicks of the Kingdom moſt of
the above Grievances, and Breaches of the Peace, being delivered
to the Commiſſioners of Truſt in <hi>February</hi> laſt, that the Clergy and
Laity receiving Redreſs or Juſtice, the Diſcontent of the Subject
might be removed, no Amendment appeared after eight Months
effluxed, but the Evil ſtill continued, that occaſioned the Ruine of
the Nation. And we alſo proteſt to the whole World, having done
our beſt, we have no Power to remove the Jealouſies and Fears of
the People. Beſides the above Injuries, and Violation of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Peace, againſt Religion, the King's Intereſt and the Nation,
nothing appearing before the Eyes of the People but Deſolation,
Waſte, Burning, and the Deſtruction of the Kingdom; three parts
of four thereof being come under Contribution to the Enemy,
Cities, Towns and ſtrong Holds taken from them, Altars pulled
down, Churches loſt, Prieſts killed and baniſhed, Sacraments and
Sacrifices, and all things holy, profaned, and almoſt utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
Armies and great numbers of Souldiers by them maintained,
and the Enemy not fought withal; thoſe that would fight for them
born down, and thoſe that would betray them cheriſhed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced;
finally, no viſible Army or Defence appearing, they are
come to deſpair of recovering what is loſt, or defending what they
hold, and ſome inclining for ſafety of their Lives and Eſtates, do
compound with the Parliament, perſwading themſelves no Safety can
be to any living under the Government of the LORD LIEUTENANT,
attended by Fate and Diſaſter. For prevention of theſe Evils, and

                     <p>THAT in the Title of their Declaration, they aſſume unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a Power to declare againſt the continuance of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's

the reading of it. But whence they derive their Pretence to this
Power, we find not any where expreſſed; nor by whom they are
conſtituted Judges of the Miſgovernment of the People, the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his Majeſty's Army, or of the Violation of the Articles
of Peace. For the miſgovernment of the People, and ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his Majeſty's Army, we acknowledg no earthly competent
Judg of Us, but his Majeſty and the eſtabliſhed Laws. And for the
violation of the Articles of Peace, by the Conſent even of all thoſe
Biſhops, (unleſs there be gotten amongſt them ſome that oppoſed the
Peace, and joined with thoſe that aſſiſted the Engliſh Rebels, as long
as they could give them hire) the Truſt of looking to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Articles of Peace was repoſed by the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi>
with whom the Peace was concluded, in <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and the reſt of <hi>the Commiſſioners of Truſt,</hi> as appears by the ſaid
Articles. Whereby we ſuppoſe it is clear, that as the Biſhops have
arrogated to themſelves an Unwarranted Power to declare againſt the
continuance of his Majeſty's Authority where he hath placed it, and
to be our Judges in the Government of the People, and Conduct of
the Army, (wherein we doubt whether their Skill be anſwerable to
their deſire to try it); ſo have they as unwarrantably taken upon
them to judg what is, or is not, a Violation of the Articles of Peace:
And in all they have endeavoured to <hi>invade and uſurp both upon King
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65997:532"/>
and People;</hi> bereaving the one of <hi>Royalty,</hi> and the other of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>

                     <p>Now ſuppoſing they were the Monarchs they would be, let the
Grounds of their Excommunication, ſet forth in all that we have
ſeen, be duly examined, and it will be found that their Sentence is
moſt unjuſt. So that as their Tribunal is <hi>uſurped,</hi> their Judgment

                     <p>Concerning their Motives of taking up Arms in the Year 1641,<note place="margin">The Anſwer to the Preamble.</note> we
ſhall ſay nothing. But ſince they begin ſo high with their Narrative as
the Year 1641, it will not be amiſs to mind them, that betwixt that
and the Year 1648, there was, by Authority from his Majeſty, and
our Miniſtration, ſeveral Ceſſations, and at length a Peace concluded
with the Confederate Roman-Catholicks, in the Year 1646; which
Peace was ſhamefully and <hi>perfidiouſly violated, by the Inſtigation and

others of the Secular and Regular Clergy;</hi> and that not in ſlight and
ſtrained Particulars, ſuch as We are now charged with by them; but
by coming with two powerful Armies before the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
upon no provocation from Us, unleſs they eſteemed the continuance
of a Ceſſation for about three Years with them, and the bringing
them a Peace to their own Doors, ſuch a Provocation as deſerved
their bending their united Power againſt Us, leaving other Parts, that
neither had, nor would have Peace or Ceſſation with them unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted,
and at liberty to waſte their Quarters, whilſt they devoured
Ours, and ſought our Ruin. This is a particular blotting their Name
and Memory with the <hi>everlaſting Infamy of Perfidy, Ingratitude, and
undeniable Diſloyalty:</hi> They have reaſon to leap over their Preamble,
leſt they ſhould awaken the Curſes of thoſe Multitudes of People,
who being ſeduced into <hi>ſo horrid a Violation of Publick Faith,</hi> by their
impious Allurements, and helliſh Excommunications, are thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
deſolate Widows, helpleſs Orphans, and miſerable Exiles, from
the Place of their Birth and Suſtenance.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that his late Majeſty, and his now Majeſty, then Prince
of <hi>Wales,</hi> overcoming their juſt Indignation, with a pious compaſſion
of their ſeduced People, commanded Us over to treat and conclude a
Peace with the Roman-Catholicks of this Kingdom. In obedience
whereunto (and in humble imitation of their great Example, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
the ungrateful uſage We had met with) We undertook the
hazard of that Voyage, and at length concluded the Peace in this
Preamble mentioned. We are unwilling to ſay any thing that might
ſeem to leſſen the Loyalty and Affection of the Aſſembly that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the Peace: Nor is it to that End that We ſhall anſwer to thoſe
Men, that though his then Majeſty was in reſtraint, and his now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and his Royal Mother, not in condition to ſend Supplies and
Relief into this Kingdom; yet there wanted not <hi>apparent Motives of
Advantage</hi> to induce the Roman-Catholicks to conſent to the Peace;
which was thankfully acknowledged by a more Authentick Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of the Nation, than theſe Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
even by as many of them as really, or from the Teeth outward (for
ſuch we find now there were) that conſented to it. Upon what
Conditions the Confederate Roman-Catholicks could have agreed
with thoſe in this Declaration, called the <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> we
know not, nor do believe they are able <hi>to prove their Aſſertions,</hi> if
they be put to it. Though if it ſhould appear, it were not to be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65997:532"/>
wondred at, that Uſurpers (and ſuch as make almoſt as little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of breaking Public Faith as theſe Declarers) are more liberal in
the Diſpenſation of their unlawful Acquirings by way of Brokeage,
than a juſt Monarch, whoſe Purpoſe it is to keep, as well as it is in his
Power only to grant Conditions to a People in the State the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
were in.</p>
                     <p>Next in their Preamble, they ſay, That after the concluding of the
Peace, the Catholick Confederates came ſincerely and cheerfully under
his Majeſty's Authority in Us, plentifully providing vaſt Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
well nigh half a Million of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pounds.</p>
                     <p>By which they ſeem to inſinuate, firſt, That all the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of <hi>Ireland</hi> came thus cheerfully under his Majeſty's Authority,
whereas <hi>Omen O Neil, with his whole Army, and divers of the County of</hi>
Wickloe <hi>with others,</hi> were, and continued in Rebellion long after the
Concluſion of the Peace; as is well known to many of the Declarers,
who were of their party; as alſo that our firſt Work was to reduce
<hi>places held by them</hi> lying in our way to <hi>Dublin,</hi> as <hi>Mariburough-Athy,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>They mention next after, their providing plentifully vaſt Sums of
Money, adding alſo theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> near half a Million of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Pounds, to have it believed we were ſet forth with ſuch a Sum,
and all the following Proviſions of Corn and Ammunition: though
it is notoriouſly known, that for all the half Million of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pounds,
the Army we had brought together could not march from about

                           </gap>loghgregan,</hi> till upon our private Credit <hi>we had borrowed eight hundred
Engliſh Pounds</hi> of Sir <hi>James Preſton,</hi> which is yet owing him, and for
which we have lately written to you to ſee him ſatisfied; by means
whereof, and of a little Meal, not yet paid for neither, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
we took in <hi>Tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>olſtown, Caſtle-Talbot</hi> and <hi>Kildare.</hi> But there our
Money and Meal failing us, and having borrowed about one hundred
Pounds <hi>from twenty ſeveral Officers</hi> to give the Souldiers Suſtenance,
we were forced to ſtay on the Weſt-ſide of the Liffy, and thereby
loſt an Opportunity of engaging <hi>Jones,</hi> who with a much leſs Force
than ours was drawn forth of <hi>Dublin</hi> as far as <hi>Johnſtown.</hi> And in
what continual Want the Army was, from our ſetting forth, even to
the Defeat at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> being about three Months, is ſo notoriouſly
known (having during all that time, been very meanly ſupplied in
Money, and that in ſmall inconſiderable Sums, as by the Receiver-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's
Accompts may appear): that if we be to be blamed, it is for
<hi>undertaking an Expedition ſo meanly provided,</hi> and which we can only
anſwer with the Neceſſity of attempting <hi>Dublin</hi> and thoſe parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſhould receive Supplies out of <hi>England,</hi> and upon Diſcovery
deſtroy ſuch as were faithful to his Majeſty, and importuned us daily
to advance.</p>
                     <p>For Magazines of Corn, Ammunition, and Materials for War, the
Stores we found ſo inconſiderably furniſhed, or rather ſo abſolutely
unfurniſhed, that till we with the Aſſiſtance of the Commiſſioners,
procured ſome Supply thereof in <hi>Waterford, Limerick</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> it
was not poſſible for us either to reduce the Fort of <hi>Mariburough</hi> and
<hi>Athy,</hi> held by <hi>Owen O Neil</hi>'s party, nor to march, as we did, towards
<hi>Dublin.</hi> And for Ammunition, we were forced to bargain with <hi>Patrick
Archer,</hi> and other Merchants, for a Supply thereof, engaging the
King's Cuſtoms and Tenths of Prizes, elſe that want of Ammunition
had abſolutely hindred our March; nor is the ſaid <hi>Archer</hi> yet ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Ammunition.</p>

                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:65997:533"/>
The Truth of this is referred to the Knowledg of many<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Viz.</hi> Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reagh.</note> there
met, who can witneſs with us herein, and in many other Diſtreſſes
and Difficulties we met with for want of Money, which we cannot
call to mind. How much of this half Million of Pounds hath come
in, in Money, or been diſpoſed of by Warrant from us, we leave to
be cleared by the Receiver-General's Accompts. But we are confident
it will not amount to <hi>the tenth part of half a Million of Pounds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next Place they ſay, We have fruſtrated the Opinion of the
Nation held of our Fidelity, Gallantry, and Abilities, and become
the Author of loſing the whole Kingdom, to God, King, and Nation.
If the Nation held a greater Opinion of our Gallantry and Ability
than there was cauſe for it, we are ſorry we came ſhort of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
But whatever it pleaſed God to beſtow on us in thoſe
Gifts, we faithfully employed it in the Cauſe we undertook, and have
not at all failed their Expectation in point of Fidelity: Nor are we
therein the Author of loſing the Kingdom to God, King, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as theſe Declarers have Rhetorically expreſſed themſelves. How
they make good the laſt Aſſertion of their Preamble (<hi>viz.</hi>) That we
began the Loſs of the Kingdom by violating the Articles of Peace, is
next to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>How We have been furniſhed with the aforeſaid Sum of about half
a Million of Pounds,<note place="margin">The Anſwer to the firſt Article.</note> We have told you in Our Anſwer to the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
If they urge Our giving Commiſſions, which they call Patents,
to Proteſtant Officers, as a Breach of the Articles of Peace, and had
purpoſed to have made it good, they ſhould have ſet down the Article
violated by it. But they have been ſo uſed to have Credit given to
their Words upon Truſt, <hi>that whether what they ſay be true or falſe, they
are ſure it will do their Work;</hi> and That, and <hi>not Truth</hi> is the thing
they aim at. We confeſs to have given Commiſſions to many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Officers, and that they and their Men were provided for, as
others of their reſpective Conditions. And we do affirm that for
their Fidelity, Gallantry and Ability they deſerved their Commiſſions
and Pay, full as well as any other of their reſpective Conditions.
And it is not true, that they, or the moſt of them, or any of them,
that we gave Commiſſions to, did betray any Perſon under their
Command, or ever deſerted Us, or the Cauſe we undertook.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that We finding the Deſire and Deſign of many of the
People, ſet on by the Declarers, was to <hi>ſtarve, or otherwiſe deſtroy and
break the Remain of the Proteſtant Party that came to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> for theſe, and
other Reaſons hereafter to be expreſſed,<note place="margin">☞</note> We permitted them in <hi>June</hi>
or <hi>July</hi> laſt, to make their Conditions with the Enemy, and ſo ſent
them away. But that any one Place was betrayed by any of thoſe
Proteſtants, cannot be inſtanced; nor that any more than about three
of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (whereof one was a Major, and the other two Lieutenants)
ever went away without Our Licenſe. How many of them died va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly,
doing their Duty, or that were creully put to Death by the
Enemy, there are many amongſt you that know.</p>
                     <p>It is very well known,<note place="margin">The Anſwer to the ſecond Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> that we put not the Holds or Ports in <hi>Munſter</hi>
into the Hands of any, but left them in the Hands We found them, as
we had good reaſon to do, thoſe Perſons, <hi>without Capitulation,</hi> having
received Us as his Majeſty's Lieutenant: And if any of them have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
thoſe Places (as we conceive the Governours of <hi>Cork, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale</hi>
and <hi>Youghall</hi> did not, but were by others betrayed) We are not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65997:533"/>
reaſonably chargeable with their Treachery: And we believe they
ſoaked as much of the Sweat and Subſtance of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and were
as chargeable to that Province before as after the Peace. Nor is it
ſtrange if they would not agree to a Peace, that muſt have let in
thoſe <hi>that had been of a contrary Party,</hi> to be Maſters of the Holds
they had before the Peace, upon any occaſion of their drawing forth,
till a full Settlement by Parliament, till when the Conſederate Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks were to hold the Towns poſſeſſed by them, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
was made that ſuch as were not admitted to re-inhabit the
Towns (for we underſtood divers were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)<note place="margin">☜</note> were to have the full bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of their Houſes and Eſtates in the ſaid Towns or Gariſons. So
that what is remarkable, in that in making the Peace, we would
not allow the return of thoſe of <hi>Cork, Youghall</hi> and <hi>Kingſale</hi> to their
Houſes, we ſee not, more than that, as without they were debarred
from it for a time, neither the Army under the Command of the
Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> nor the then Inhabitants of the Towns, would be
drawn to ſubmit to the Peace; ſo the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> being convinced
thereof, and of the great Danger it might bring upon the Kingdom
to have them oppoſe the Peace, conſented to the Articles, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Book of the Articles of Peace. But that which theſe
Declarers would indeed have marked and collected out of their
dark Note, is, <hi>that by this means theſe Towns were perhaps pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
given up by us to the Rebels:</hi> For as they have infected the
People, they know them ſo ready to make the worſt Conſtruction of
all Events, that they need not ſpeak plainly to them.</p>
                     <p>To this we have fully anſwered in our Anſwer to the ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the pretended Grievances,<note place="margin">The Anſwer to the third Article.</note> except the particular of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
O Neile,</hi> who was not named in the ſaid Article; and for your
clearer Satisfaction we ſhall recite that Anſwer as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Whoever looks upon the Articles of Peace recited in this Section,<note place="margin">This was an Anſwer to the ſecond Article of the Grievances.</note>
and upon the Compoſure of the Army ever ſince the Peace, will find
that we have done much more for the Satisfaction of this Nation,
than we were obliged unto: For whereas if we had upon perfection
of the Articles of Peace, conferred <hi>two</hi> places of Command, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Profit and Truſt in his Majeſty's whole Army in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
upon any two of the Roman Catholick Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
we had without Controverſy fulfilled the literal Obligation
that was upon us as to the point of Inſtances: And if we had not
divided the places equally betwixt Proteſtant and Roman Catholick,
we had performed the Articles to the Roman Catholicks in the moſt
favourable Conſtruction they could bear; yet was the General of the
Horſe, the Maſter of the Ordnance, the Major-General, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General
of the Horſe, and (for a good while) the Commiſſary-General
of the Horſe, the Muſter-Maſter General, the Commiſſary-General
of the Victuals, and the Quarter-Maſter Generals both of
Horſe and Foot, all of his Majeſty's Roman Catholicks of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
Places, certainly, as they are more than <hi>two parts of three</hi> of
the general places of an Army, ſo are they of Honour, Profit and
Truſt, and moſt of theſe were conferred on ſuch as were inſtanced
unto us by the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> that concluded the Peace with us, though
that by the Articles there was not ſo much as a Power to inſtance
either in the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> or <hi>Commiſſioners.</hi> To ſave time, we omit to
mention the many Colonels and inferiour Officers of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65997:534"/>
Religion, we gave Commiſſion unto, though theſe be all
Places of <hi>Honour, Profit,</hi> and <hi>Truſt.</hi> But it is conſiderable in this
Particular, that in the Army of <hi>Connaught</hi> (which under the
Conduct of the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> commanding as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
reduced the whole Province) there was <hi>not one Proteſtant Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
that we remember. And now we leave it to any reaſonable
Perſon to judg, whether Commands have not more than indifferently
been conferred on Roman Catholicks? and whether we are juſtly
charged with the breach of this Article (which provides not that
no Roman Catholick once in Command ſhall not be removed) if
(for the Union of an Army the Uniformity of Command in the
general Officers, according to their degrees over the whole Army,
and the more chearful Conjunction of all Parties in the Service) we
did, by the Advice of ſome of the <hi>Commiſſioners of Truſt,</hi> and of
the principal Officers of the Army, perſwade Colonel <hi>Peirce Fitz-Gerrald</hi>
voluntarily to reſign that place to Sir <hi>William Vaughan,</hi> when
at the ſame time Colonel <hi>John Barry,</hi> a Roman Catholick, was made
Lieutenant-General of the Horſe, and had Command over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſaid Sir <hi>William</hi> (that was placed in Colonel <hi>Fitz-Gerrald</hi>'s
room) who by his good Conduct and impartial Diſtribution of
Orders, had gained the general Love and Eſteem of the Army,
and at <hi>Rathmines</hi> died nobly in the head of his Charge.</p>
                     <p>We underſtand not how Major-General <hi>Purcell</hi> comes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
as one diſplaced. Sure we are there was no ground for it
when this Collection was made; neither is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there yet any other than
his voluntary declining the Execution of his place, to ſatisfy the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
and unconſtant Humours of ſome that are never long
pleaſed with any Government. As to the inſtance of the Fort of
<hi>Duncannon,</hi> it is not true that ever Capt. <hi>Roch</hi> was removed from
thence, but to his dying day continued Governour there: True it
is; that upon receipt of certain Letters from him to us and the Earl of
<hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">☞</note> implying <hi>that he was ready</hi> (upon the firſt approach of
the Rebels) <hi>to give up that important Fort,</hi> we commanded thither
Colonel <hi>Edward Wogan</hi> with a Company of Gentlemen. By which
means only (under God) it was preſerved; as might be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
but that we ſpare to ſay more of that deceaſed Gentleman.
But that there was no purpoſe to remove him, is clear by this, that
as ſoon as the Rebels had (principally by the Courage of thoſe
Gentlemen) removed their Siege, the ſaid Gentlemen were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and <hi>Roch</hi> left in the ſole Command.</p>
                     <p>Whether his Majeſty's whole Army in this Kingdom did conſiſt of
ſo many as was promiſed in the Articles, we leave to be cleared by
the Muſter-Rolls, whereby we believe it will appear, that in all
places it conſiſted of much more: But if it did not, that is not to
be imputed unto us as a breach of the Articles, ſince we were ready
to have enlarged it upon the deſire of the Commiſſioners. But that
of the Army of Foot, the much greater part was compoſed of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Officers, is ſo far from Truth, that we are confident the
Proteſtant Officers were not by a third part ſo many as the Roman
Catholicks, though we find no proportion between Proteſtant and
Roman Catholick Officers preſcribed by the Articles, but that we
were at liberty to raiſe and levy as many of that Profeſſion as we
thought fit.</p>
                     <p>What is intended by the Communication of Countenance, or how
pertinently we are directed to the meaning of it by the Marginal
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65997:534"/>
Note of <hi>Baggatrath,</hi> we underſtand not; if the meaning be, that
the Roman-Catholick Officers were againſt the manning of <hi>Bagga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trath,</hi>
and that yet it was mann'd, that is not true; for the manning
of it was unanimouſly agreed on, if it ſhould be thought fit by the
Officers that went to look upon it, <hi>who were all Roman-Catholicks,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to whoſe Opinion it was mann'd. That there was inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Pay, either in Field or Gariſon, and Complaint thereof made
unto Us without Redreſs, as far as We had Power, is as untrue:
And for the Marginal Note of <hi>the Catholicks having but ſeven weeks
Pay,</hi> We neither knew when, or where it was, or who had more.
The manner of <hi>Daniel O-Neil</hi>'s coming into Command, was
thus; As He had taken great pains in bringing his Uncle, General <hi>Owen
O-Neil,</hi> to ſubmit to the Peace, and his Majeſty's Government; ſo did
he effectually labour, after that Work was effected, to bring the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi>
Army to our Aſſiſtance, when <hi>Cromwel</hi> was on his march from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
towards <hi>Wexford. Owen O-Neil</hi> being ſick, the Army was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by Lieut. Gen. <hi>Farrell,</hi> and Major Gen. <hi>Hugh O-Neil;</hi> but
when it joined with the <hi>Leinſter, Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Connaught</hi> Forces,
and ſome Engliſh and Scotiſh Horſe and Foot, we found great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
how to diſtribute Orders with ſatisfaction to all thoſe Parties;
the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Party being unwilling to receive them by Major Gen. <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi>
and the reſt were as unwilling to receive them by Major General
<hi>Hugh O-Neil.</hi> But all Parties were content to receive them from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
O-Neil,</hi> and by him they were diſtributed; and Major Gen. <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
was ſent into <hi>Munſter,</hi> where he had, and exerciſed a Command
in Chief in the abſence of Superior Officers; nor was his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
annulled, or a new one of his place given to any other to this day.
So that if the diſplaceing of him, or any other Officer, without the
Conſent of the Commiſſioners, had been a Breach of the Articles of
Peace, as it is not, there is no Truth in the Affirmation that he was
diſplaced.</p>
                     <p>For Anſwer to the Fourth Article,<note place="margin">Anſwer to the 4th Article, is the ſame that was given to the 3d Article of Grievances.</note> we muſt refer you to our Anſwer
to the Third Article of the pretended Grievances, as followeth. By
the Articles of Peace, Judicatures were to be raiſed, and Judges
named by the Advice, and with the Conſent of the Commiſſioners.
For which purpoſe We ſent to his Majeſty for leave to make and uſe a
Great Seal; which as ſoon as we had received, We cauſed a Great
Seal to be made, and were at all times ready to have agreed with the
Commiſſioners what kind of Judicatures to raiſe, and with what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to have ſupplied them; as will not be denied by the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners:
Which may ſuffice for Us to anſwer to that particular.
We acknowledg, that according to the neceſſary Power at all times
inveſted in the chief Governour, or Governours of this Kingdom,
We have received many Petitions, and (to the beſt of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding)
have made juſt and equal Orders and References upon
them; and have alſo (upon Certificate of the ableſt Men we could
find) finally determined ſome of them, but never to the alteration
of Poſſeſſion, unleſs perhaps upon clear proof of forcible Intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by Violence, contrary to all the Rules of Law and Reaſon. Which
if We had not done, during the want of Judicatures, every Man's
Power would have been his Judg in his own Cauſe. What the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
or Preſident have done irregularly or contrary to the Articles
of Peace, they ſhall be brought to anſwer, when they or he ſhall be
particularly charged. That Inns of Court have not been erected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65997:535"/>
to the Articles of Peace, Poſterity may tell us as loud as
they pleaſe; but if they have Schools to learn Engliſh enough to
read the Articles of Peace, they will find that his Majeſty was only
to enable the Natives of this Kingdom to erect one or more Inns of
Court, in or near the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> or elſewhere, as ſhould be
thought fit by his Majeſty's Lord-Lieutenant, or other chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or Governours, for the time being. Whereby (by the ſcope
of the Article, which is for removing of Incapacities) it is plain, the ſaid
Inns of Court were not to be erected at his Majeſty's Charge. And
ſure no Man will have the impudence to ſay, that We (who had
the honour to govern under his Majeſty) did give the leaſt interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the erecting of them; or, that it was ever propoſed to Us
to give way to the erection of the ſaid Inns. Whereof We confeſs
there was never more need, if their Property be to inſtruct the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in their Duty of Obedience and Government; with this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That to charge Us with want of doing Juſtice, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing
the particular Caſes wherein We failed, thereby taking
from Us the means to vindicate our Self from ſo high a Crime, is
<hi>ſuitable to the Juſtice and Practices of theſe Declarers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Fifth Article,<note place="margin">The Anſwer to the 5th Article.</note> We are again charged in general with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartning
Adventurers, Undertakers, and Owners, and no Man
named but Capt. <hi>Antonio;</hi> nor the particular wherein he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned
ſet down. We are further charged with reverſing of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
legally given, and definitively concluded before Our coming to
Authority; but no particular Judgment ſo reverſed is, or indeed
can be inſtanced. So that all We can anſwer to this part is, <hi>That it is
not true.</hi> And for what remains, We ſay, That We placed the Power of
the Admiralty in this Kingdom, according to the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> Inſtance,
and from time to time gave Commiſſions to ſuch Perſons as the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi>
deſired in ſeveral Parts to hear and determine Maritime
Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>And as to the Sixth Article,<note place="margin">The Anſwer to the 6th Article, is the ſame with the Anſwer to the firſt of the Grievances.</note> We muſt refer you to our Anſwer to
the Firſt Article of the pretended Grievances, which was as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Firſt, We deny that they (if thereby be meant the Roman-Catholick
Clergy) were not ſuffered to enjoy the Churches, and
Church-Livings, which at the time of perfecting the Articles of
Peace they poſſeſſed, or that by the Articles of Peace they ought to
poſſeſs. And as to the Inſtances made in the Margent, the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of this Article do very well know, that their Poſſeſſion of thoſe
Churches and Church-Livings were ſtatly denied by the Proteſtant-Clergy.
And it is very well known to the Commiſſioners, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that Buſineſs with diligence and earneſtneſs enough, that We
never refuſed nor delayed to afford them any juſt means of bringing
that Controverſy to a final End, till at length by Treachery, and the
Rebels Power, the things controverted were loſt to both Parties.
Nor was there any Complaint made unto Us ſince the concluſion of
the Peace till now, that the Romiſh Prelates, or Paſtors, or any of
them have been hindred from exerciſing their reſpective Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Functions amongſt their Flocks, except one Complaint made
of the Governour of <hi>Dungarvan,</hi> wherein we were ready to have
given Redreſs (upon hearing all Parties) as ſhould have been found

Grant made by his Majeſty of any Biſhoprick whatſoever ſince the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65997:535"/>
concluſion of the Peace; nor can we find any Article of the Peace
that reſtrains his Majeſty from making ſuch Grants, ſo the Roman-Catholick
Biſhops be not thereby diſpoſſeſſed of what they were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of upon concluſion of the Peace, until his Majeſty declare his
Pleaſure in a Free Parliament in this Kingdom. And whatever his
Majeſty might intend to declare, the making of Proteſtant Biſhops
could be no anticipation thereof, to the Prejudice of the Roman-Catholicks,
ſince Biſhops are held <hi>eſſentially neceſſary</hi> to the Exerciſe
of the Religion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

by the Miniſters herein mentioned, that where they had poſſeſſion of
the Church-Livings, the Obventions here mentioned were alſo due
to them. But whether it were or not, ſure we are, there was never
any Complaint made to Us in this Particular, till our coming to
<hi>Tecroghan</hi> after the loſs of <hi>Drogheda;</hi> and that within a very little
time after, before the Truth of the Allegation could be examined, the
Towns of <hi>Munſter</hi> revolted, and the Buſineſs was ſo decided, at
leaſt if any Difference of this kind continued in the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi>
which was longer held, We never after Our being at <hi>Tecroghan</hi>
heard of it, that We remember.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>8th</hi> Article,<note place="margin">The Anſwer to the 8th Article.</note> we anſwer, That no Complaint of any ſuch Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
impoſed by the Lord Preſident or Preſidency, was made to Us;

our Letters to him to ſwear and admit of the Council of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
the Lord Viſcount <hi>Roch</hi> of <hi>Fermoy,</hi> the Lord Viſcount <hi>Muskery,</hi>
Major General <hi>Patrick Purcel,</hi> Lieut. Col. <hi>Gerard Fitz-Morrice,</hi> and
others; all which were written unto by the Lord Preſident to
come to him to be ſworn accordingly; whereof the Lord <hi>Muskry,</hi>
Major General <hi>Partick Pureell,</hi> and Lieut. Col. <hi>Fitz-Morrice</hi> were
ſworn, but the reſt not coming according to the Letters, could not
be ſworn.</p>
                     <p>For the improvidence of the Conduct of the Army,<note place="margin">The Anſwer to the 9th Article.</note> We ſhall
only anſwer, That it was as provident as We had means and skill
to conduct it; and for the Misfortune, We aſcribe that to the good
Pleaſure and Juſtice of God. But how far forth the Diſaſter at
<hi>Rathmines</hi> was ſhameful beyond any thing that ever hapned in
Chriſtianity, as they expreſs themſelves, We refer you to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what We have ſaid upon that Subject in our Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
in what concerns the ſame in the pretended Grievances, and
to the Teſtimony of divers now there that were upon the place
with us.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Defeat at <hi>Rathmines,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This was in anſwer to the Grievances.</note> it is as with all Misfortunes of
that Nature in War; every Man (at his pleaſure) making himſelf
Judg of the Cauſes of them, and many times, without looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
or having knowledg of the true Condition of the beaten Party,
deliver their Judgments upon miſtaken Grounds, and for the moſt
part are guided by their Paſſions (either of Envy, or Self-conceit of
their own Abilities) to judg ſuperciliouſly or malitiouſly of thoſe
Actions whereunto they are willing Strangers. And this being a
Diſadvantage whereunto all Commanders have been, and ever will
be ſubject, we have no Reaſon to expect an Exemption from it; and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65997:536"/>
might therefore paſs by this Grievance, reſerving Our ſelf for an
Account of Our Actions, till it were required from Us by him to
whom only in this Caſe We are obliged to render one. But ſuch
is our deſire to ſatisfy thoſe that are faithful to the Cauſe We have
laboured in, and may have been ſtumbled at that Chance of War,
that We ſhall give them the Reaſon and Grounds of Our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
and of the ſuppoſed Omiſſion recited in what remains of theſe
Grievances.</p>
                     <p>And firſt it is neceſſary it ſhould be underſtood, that a little before
the time of that Defeat, the Condition of Affairs in this Kingdom
ſtood thus. The Provinces of <hi>Leinſter, Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Connaught,</hi> were
entirely reduced to his Majeſty's Obedience, except the City of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
and <hi>Baliſhannon</hi> which were block'd up with a ſmall Number of our
Men. But in <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> the Rebels, by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Owen O-Neil,</hi>
and the Interruption given to the Lord Viſcount <hi>Mountgomery</hi> by the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Clergy, had raiſed the Seige of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Maſters of the Field.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time alſo We had certain Intelligence, that <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
with a very ſtrong Army, a vaſt Sum of Money, and great
plenty of all Proviſions, was ready ſhip'd for this Kingdom. And it
was from good Hands intimated unto Us, that he purpoſed his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
in <hi>Munſter,</hi> and that he had Intelligence with ſome Governour
of the Sea-ports there.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon it was taken into Conſideration at a Council of War,
whether the blocking up of <hi>Dublin</hi> ſhould be continued? or, whether
We ſhould not retire from thence to <hi>Drogheda, Trym,</hi> and the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
adjacent, and prepare our ſelves for ſecuring <hi>Munſter,</hi> and
making a defenſive or offenſive War, as occaſion ſhould afterwards
be offered? And of this Opinion We were the rather, becauſe it was
there alſo concluded, that the Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter</hi> with a good
Party of our beſt Horſe, ſhould go into <hi>Munſter</hi> to ſecure it; and
that the very Day we roſe from <hi>Finglaſs,</hi> and marched to <hi>Rathmines,
Reynolds</hi> landed with 600 Horſe and 1500 Foot.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto it was ſtrongly objected, That if We ſent away Our
heavy Cannon, which we propoſed ſhould be done, the more to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate
an orderly Retreat, the People would deſpair of the taking of
<hi>Dublin;</hi> that they would accompt all that was done as good as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
unleſs that City were reduced; That they would not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the City was to be reduced by diſtreſſing it, by blocking up,
(which might have ſecurely been done the way We propoſed) but
taking the Matter to be given over, and conſequently deſpairing of
the Eaſe they expected by the total Reduction of the Kingdom, would
grow more and more backward in their Contribution, and perhaps
be ſeduced to a Conjunction with <hi>Owen O-Neil,</hi> and a Rejection of
the Peace, and his Majeſty's Authority thereby eſtabliſhed over them;
which <hi>even then</hi> We found was (though under-hand privately and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
other Pretences) aimed at by ſome that ſince have taken the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the time to declare themſelves without Diſguiſe.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo objected that unleſs <hi>Dublin</hi> were reduced before <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s
Landing with the Force and Treaſure we were ſure he had in
Readineſs at the Water-ſide, that it was to be feared he would be able
to corrupt many of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which, conſidering the Treaſure he
brought with him, and the want We were in, might as reaſonably be
apprehended, as that <hi>Owen O-Neil,</hi> and his Party, ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Mercenary to Sir <hi>Charles Coot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="195" facs="tcp:65997:536"/>
Perſwaded by theſe Arguments delivered by the whole Council of
War, We were reſolved to continue before <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to endeavour
to approach near unto it, to the end to take from them within, the
Conveniency of grazing betwixt Our Camp and their Works, which
if it had been effected, their Horſes being 1200, muſt in three days
have ſtarved, and then the Benefit of the Sea would have been with
much eaſe taken from them; which would ſo much have diſcouraged
all their Souldiers, that it was probable they would in a few Days
more, have forced their Officers to a Treaty and Surrender of the
City.</p>
                     <p>It was then conceived that <hi>Baggatrath</hi> was the fitteſt Place to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.
But before We gave Order for it, We ſent the Earl of <hi>Caſtle-haven,</hi>
General <hi>Preſton,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Aſhton,</hi> and Major General <hi>Purcel,</hi>
to view it: who returned unto Us, approving the Place as in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
fit for our Purpoſe. We then gave the Major General Order to
command thither in the beginning of the Night 1500 Foot with Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
to fortify, which was the Number adviſed to be ſent by thoſe
Perſons that had ſeen it. In the Morning at Day-break we went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and finding the Work not advanced to Our Expectation, found
fault therewith. The Major General told Us, That he was ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
from the Camp thither (which was not an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile) that
he came not to the Place till an Hour before Day. Yet ſuch was the
natural Strength of the Place, that being helped with a few Hours
Work, We conceived it might very well be made good againſt any
Attempt of the Enemy. But the better to ſecure it, We put the
whole Army in Arms, and appointed it to be drawn down near
<hi>Baggatrath,</hi> ſhewing every General Officer where his Charge was,
and appointing the drawing down ſome Cannon to an Eminency of
Ground commanding the ſame, and ſome of the Fields leading from
<hi>Dublin</hi> thither. And then, having been up all Night, partly in
writing of Diſpatches, and to be in the better Readineſs in caſe the
Enemy (upon diſcovering Our Men marching) ſhould ſally, We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to take a little Reſt, which was about nine of the Clock.</p>
                     <p>About ten We wakened with the Noiſe of Shot, and before we
could get on Horſeback, Our 1500 Men were beaten out of <hi>Bagga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trath,</hi>
and ſoon after was Sir <hi>William Vaughan</hi> kill'd, and the Horſe
with him routed. Whereupon all thoſe in the left Wing, except
Our Brothers and Colonel <hi>Miles Reyly</hi>'s Regiments ran away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
once facing the Enemy, and (as was alledged, which we have
not heard diſproved) againſt their Officers uttermoſt Endeavour. In
ſhort, The Rebels gained Field after Field, till they came up to the
Ordnance, and thence into the Rear of Us ſtanding in a Field with a
Party of Foot commanded by Colonel <hi>Gifford,</hi> who gave very good
Fire upon them for a while, but upon Diſcovery of another Party of
the Rebels marching up to their Front, ſome called for Quarter, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
threw down their Arms, and ſome continued Shooting: Then
We quitted the Field, and endeavoured (but in vain) ſeveral times to
rally the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Grounds for continuing the blocking up <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
this is briefly as much of the manner of the Defeat as We were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of, and can readily call to mind.</p>
                     <p>That his Majeſty's Army on that ſide the River attempted by the
Rebels, was far more numerous than the Rebels, is not true; for the
Rebels were effectually 4000 Foot and 1200 Horſe, and the Army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
at <hi>Rathmines</hi> was not ſtronger in Horſe or Foot. We deny
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65997:537"/>
not but that the Defeat may reaſonably be aſcribed to the Faithleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Negligence, Ignorance, or Cowardize of ſome of the Officers
and Souldiers. Nor have we ever read or heard of any Defeat given,
where the encountering Numbers were near upon equal, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
was aſcribed to one or more of theſe Failings. And yet it is for
the moſt part found difficult, and many times unfit, to fix the Blame
where it may moſt juſtly be placed.</p>
                     <p>But that the Peoples Belief of this is fortified, for that no Search
or Inquiry hath ſince been made by a Court or Council of War of
the Deportment of the Officers, is an Argument ſuitable to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and Miſconſtruction all Our Actions have met with. If the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
were not fit for the Employments given them, they were yet of
thoſe inſtanced to Us by the general Aſſembly. And if new raiſed
Men under expertleſs Officers, accompanied with a general want of
all things neceſſary for Support, Offence and Defence, have been
beaten by a like, or leſs Number of old, well-armed, experienced
and continually gariſoned Souldiers, the wonder is not great,
nor the Accident rare, even in this Kingdom, and <hi>where We have
commanded the prevailing Party.</hi> If we could have had the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in Election of Officers, and Power to have gariſon'd them and
their Souldiers, where We might have overlooked them, and cauſed
them to have been exerciſed, as We have always in vain deſired, it
might yet have pleaſed God to have diſpoſed of the Victory as he
did; but then We might more juſtly than now, have been charged
with a Failure on Our Part.</p>
                     <p>But to return to what follows, and clear the next Objection, it
will be neceſſary that We ſet down what We did preſently after that
Defeat.</p>
                     <p>When We found it impoſſible, after twelves Miles riding, to head
any conſiderable Number of the ſcattered Horſe, and that as faſt as
We could rally them, they broke from Us, We immediately directed
Our Letters to thoſe We had left on <hi>Finglaſs</hi> ſide of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and that
had not that Day ſeen the Enemy, being the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi>'s, Sir <hi>Thomas
Armſtrong</hi>'s, the Lord <hi>Moor</hi>'s, and Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Purdon</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Horſe, Colonel <hi>Warren</hi>'s, Colonel <hi>Wall</hi>'s, and Col.
<hi>Mich. Byrne</hi>'s Regiments of Foot, to march immediately the one half
to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and the other half to <hi>Trym,</hi> for the Security of thoſe
Places, and went Our ſelf to <hi>Kilkenny</hi> to rally what We could of the
Army, and to raiſe what new Forces We ſhould be able. This was
accordingly done; and that Day ſeven-night after the Defeat, We
marched out of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> with what Strength of Horſe We could
make to relieve <hi>Drogheda,</hi> before which <hi>Jones</hi> was ſat down. Upon
Our Approach to <hi>Trim</hi> with about 300 Horſe, which was all that We
could in that time rally, he raiſed his Siege, and We went unto
<hi>Drogheda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>During our being there, <hi>Cromwel</hi> landed with his Army on or
about the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> not a full Fortnight after the Defeat at
<hi>Rathmines.</hi> It was then plain we were to be on the defenſive part
of the War, and that he would draw forth ſuddenly to recover
thoſe Places we had gained. And firſt, we were aſſured he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to attempt <hi>Drogheda;</hi> We therefore applied our uttermoſt
Induſtry to ſupply that Place with what it wanted, placed in it
Sir <hi>Arthur Aſton,</hi> as expert and gallant a Governour as we could wiſh
for, gave him the ſame Men, and the ſame number of Men, Horſe
and Foot that <hi>he deſired,</hi> and furniſhed him with the full propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65997:537"/>
of Ammunition and other Proviſions he demanded, judging that
if <hi>Cromwell</hi> could be there foiled, of kept before it but for a time, it
would much advantage us that had ſo lately received ſo great a
Blow, as required time to recover, and the Rebels in the Neck of
it having received ſo great a Coountenance and Strength as <hi>Cromwell</hi>
brought with him, being the beſt of the Rebels old Army in <hi>England.</hi>
But it pleaſed God in a few days to give that Town into their Hands,
and all the Officers and Souldiers that were within it, to the Cruelty
of their Swords; where there were loſt 2000 of our beſt Souldiers,
with all their Officers, who were choſen as the likelieſt Men, by
giving a Check to <hi>Cromwell</hi> in his firſt attempt, to recover the
Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Now that after the Defeat at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> and that great Loſs at
<hi>Drogheda</hi> (for ſo it was) ſo powerful and ſo prevailing an Army as
<hi>Cromwell</hi>'s, marched without interruption from us (that had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
700 Horſe, and 1500 Foot, and of thoſe ſome not to be truſted,
others newly raiſed, and all diſcouraged) from <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>Roſſe,</hi> is
not much to be wondered at; for all the Men we could make were
not ſufficient to man <hi>Wexford,</hi> which being taken (as we have before
ſaid) there were loſt in it others of our beſt Men, to a conſiderable
number.</p>
                     <p>That the Rebels might have been prevented in building over their
Bridg at <hi>Roſſe,</hi> conſidering the Situation of the Place, and the Power
their Ordnance had from the Key to and upon the other ſide of the
River, we believe they are very ignorant or malicious that will affirm.
But if it had been a thing as eaſy as they would have it believed, we
were ſo far from being able to attempt any thing, that we never all
that time had either 24 hours Pay, or Proviſion before hand, to keep
the Men we had together where they were upon no Duty, much leſs to
bring them near an Ene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap> where they muſt be held to hard Duty cloſe
together. It ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> alſo be conſidered, that during <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s
March from <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>Wexford,</hi> and thoſe Parts, began the Revolt
of the Towns and Army in <hi>Munſter,</hi> which occaſioned very much
of Jealouſy, Diſtraction and other Interruptions, and gave the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
leiſure to proſecute their Victories.</p>
                     <p>When they marched over their Bridg at <hi>Roſſe</hi> towards <hi>Carrick;</hi>
it was believed they meant to march to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and if we had not
been diverted by a falſe Alarum (which coming as it did we had
cauſe to credit) of their being gone as far as <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Bridg to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> whilſt we lay at <hi>Thomas-Town,</hi> and thereby drawn
thither for the Defence of that City, we had, as our purpoſe was,
engaged them to fight before their getting to <hi>Carrick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In what miſerable Condition our Army was when we came to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
which we were forced to leave meerly for want of Proviſion to
keep it, and ſo much Money as to make neceſſary Materials to gain
that Place, is ſo generally known, that it muſt argue the Contrivers
of this Article guilty of a ſtrange degree of Malice to object to us
as an Omiſſion, that the Rebels Army, whilſt it lay before <hi>Waterford,</hi>
was not attempted or once faced by us: And ſure we are it is as
openly known, that in Perſon we twice conducted Men for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Waterford;</hi> and that the laſt Supply we brought, was that
which occaſion'd the Rebels raiſing their Siege, as the refuſing a
Gariſon, and other Diſobediences of that City, were the Inducements
moving them to come before it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:65997:538"/>
When by this means the Rebels were removed, and retired to their
Winter-Quarters, ſo harraſſed, as that their ſpeedy marching forth
was not to be feared; we deſigned the regaining of <hi>Carrick</hi> and
<hi>Paſſage</hi> firſt, and then of <hi>Roſſe</hi> and <hi>Wexford,</hi> and to that effect brought
with us a Party of Horſe and Foot; but were ſo far from gaining
any Admittance for them into the City, or to lie under the Walls,
though they brought the Means with them, and were to receive
their conſtant Pay out of the Country, that for thoſe our good
Intentions, and former Pains taken for the Relief of that City when
<hi>Cromwell</hi> was before it, it was there brought in queſtion, at a
Council held amongſt ſome of the City, <hi>Whether we and the Men we
brought ſhould not be fallen upon as Enemies?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We were then for our Safety forced to reitre thence, leaving
thoſe indeed eaſy Works, we had deſign'd, undone, there being no
means of doing them but by and out of that City, whereunto as
to the firſt viſible Cauſe, and to the Example thereby taken by
<hi>Limerick,</hi> may be attributed all the following Succeſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
this laſt Summer.</p>
                     <p>What ancient Travellers or Men of Experience they were that
informed the Declarers, that we kept a Mart of Wares, a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of Pleadings, or an Inn of Play, Drinking and Pleaſure, rather
than a well-ordered Camp of Souldiers, we know not; but do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
theſe Declarers themſelves want not the malicious Invention to
forge it in their own Heads: Which we the rather believe they have
done, by the ignorance appearing in charging it as a Fault, and
want of Order, that in a Camp there ſhould be a Mart of Wares, or a
Tribunal of Pleadings, which to have in the moſt peaceful time and
place, are amongſt the greateſt Arguments of good Government.
But if they intend by the Tribunal of Pleadings, as that wherein we
more buſied our ſelf, than conſiſted with the Duty of a General,
that meaning is known to be maliciouſly falſe. And ſo it is if it be
meant by us, that we kept an Inn of Play, Drinking and Pleaſure,
being content to have all the Lies in this Declaration taken for
Truth,<note place="margin">☞</note> if it can be proved, that during three Months time we were
in the Field, we drank twice betwixt Meals, or at Meals more than
was fit; that we plaid thrice at any Game, though at fit times we
account. Recreation no fault, or unuſual in well-governed Camps; or
in all that time we ever took the Pleaſure of ſleeping otherwiſe than
in our Cloaths. And of this we have better Teſtimony than the
Declarers, though they had been upon the place. But they being to
juſtify with ſome colourable Pretences, ſo high a Treaſon as <hi>the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of the Regal Power,</hi> we wonder not they ſhould make their
way to it through any Calumny they can defame us withal.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>Drogheda, Wexford, Roſſe, Carrick,</hi> and the not fighting
the Enemy near <hi>Thomas-Town,</hi> we refer you to part of our foreſaid
Anſwer to the pretended Grievances; with this Addition to that of
<hi>Carrick,</hi> that as it is more than hath or can be proved, that <hi>Carrick</hi>
was betrayed by the Proteſtant Ward that was in it (ſurprized indeed
it was); ſo the Endeavours of recovering that Place was not under
our immediate Conduct, we going that day it was attempted, with
a Party to <hi>Waterford.</hi> But who it was that importuned the falling
on of the Men ſo unprovided, Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon,</hi> and others there
preſent (as we have heard) are able to inform you. And for not
fighting at <hi>Thomas-Town,</hi> it is here ſet down, as if the Officers and
Souldiers had propoſed ſome ſuch thing, and were abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65997:538"/>
or refuſed leave, or to be led on by us to fight; which is a
malicious and falſe Suggeſtion: For never any ſuch Motion was made
to us by any Officer or Souldier, nor indeed could be; for before
the Enemy were drawn up that Morning on the Top of the Hill,
on the other ſide of the Water over againſt <hi>Thomas-Town,</hi> we were
by a falſe Alarum drawn towards <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> (as is ſet down in our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

Bryen,</hi> and others (we believe) there aſſembled.</p>
                     <p>Here again the Declarers muſt be beholden to their ancient
Travellers to make it good, that it is an Advantage of Ground to
have a Bridg to paſs by three or four in a front in the ſight of an
Enemy, and a ſteep Hill to aſcend to the Charge of an Enemy
drawn up in order on the Top of the Hill; for thus, it is very well
known, is the Situation of <hi>Thomas-Town,</hi> and the Hill whereon the
Enemy, drew up after we were drawn away to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.
The reſt of this Article is a paſſionate Enumeration of the
Enemies ſubſequent Succeſs; wherein the Declarers, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
have more to anſwer for, than we, as we were a greater
Loſer than many of them put together.</p>
                     <p>But how we become chargeable with the Loſs of any Place in
<hi>Leinſter,</hi> ſince we put the whole Management of the Affairs of that
Province into other Hands (eſpecially of <hi>Catherlogh,</hi> commanded by
a Biſhop) we much wonder: And if we had not Proof of theſe Mens

at their ſhameleſs Impudence, in ſaying <hi>Tecroghan</hi> was given up by

ſpeak nothing for the preſent of other Places), inſinuating, that if
they would, they are able to tell of many other Places given up
by our Order, when they might have been longer held: For ſo

it ſhould be underſtood: Which is ſo foul, ſo unchriſtian, and ſo
uncharitable a way of proceeding, that it would make one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they rather conjured for the Spirit of the Father of Lies, than
invoked the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt to aſſiſt when they framed
this Declaration.</p>
                     <p>What Endeavour there was uſed to relieve <hi>Tecroghan,</hi> and how
it was given up, there are many there met that are able to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

His Majeſty, That divers Places in this Kingdom were in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

a Truth as well known to theſe Declarers, as any Work is known
to the <hi>Workman that made it.</hi> Which to have concealed from his

Us, and to have taken upon Our Self the blame due to them. We
alſo acknowledg to have humbly deſired his Majeſty's leave to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
Our own Perſon out of the Kingdom, in caſe thoſe Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
were multiplied. Which having received, and thoſe Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
being multiplied, We had withdrawn Our Self from being an
idle Witneſs of the loſs of the Kingdom, and the Ruin of many of
Our Friends, had not divers of theſe Declarers ſeveral times (but

remove his Authority, or how elſe to diſpoſe of it, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarers
are. But how really troubled they are that the People
ſhould be deprived of the King's Authority, and the benefit of the
Articles of Peace, is apparent by this Declaration and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
(<hi>wherein they direct the People to return to their Aſſociation,</hi>
which is inconſiſtent with both) And by the Anſwer of the Biſhops
at <hi>Galloway</hi> to the Commiſſioners, whereof We ſhall have occaſion to
ſpeak hereafter. And where they charge Us with Envy to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for doing Our Duty to the King, We hope to have given ſuch
proof of the contrary as hath ſatisfied the moſt intereſted Men in the
Nation. And We conceive We could not have manifeſted Our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

Majeſty's Authority in the Perſon of the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Clanric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,</hi>

                     <p>As to the <hi>12th</hi> Article,<note place="margin">Anſwer to the 12th Article.</note> we are not willing to look back ſo far as to
the time when, by his Majeſties Command and Commiſſion, We bore
Arms in the War againſt the Confederates; but muſt juſtify Our

Our want of deſire to oppoſe the Enemy; We anſwer, That in the time

We gained full as eaſy, as thoſe gotten by the Enemy againſt
Us, have been upon the like advantage on their part. It is true,
that all this laſt Summer, We, and the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Connaught</hi> and <hi>Thomond,</hi> where there was no Enemy. But it
is alſo true,<note place="margin">☜</note> 
                        <hi>that We were not ſuffered to have the means of preparing

fit to mind divers in that <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> to whom it is well known, that
many of the Biſhops did long ſince, upon ſeveral Occaſions declare,
that all their Suſpicion, and the Suſpicion the People held of Us, was
by reaſon of the Power the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> had with Us. And that
during his continuance in Imployment, or the continuance <hi>of any of
his Party in the Army,</hi> it was not poſſible for them to remove that
Suſpicion out of the Minds of the People. But that if his Lordſhip

fell, firſt to call their Meeting at <hi>James-Town,</hi> and then to publiſh
this Declaration, from which they were with-held for fear all the
time the foreſaid Parties were with Us. <hi>This We ſuſpected would be
the iſſue of their working away the Proteſtant Party, and of all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi>
Yet to leave them wholly without Excuſe, and to ſatisfy ſome

theſe Biſhops and others had ſo often and ſo ſolemnly made
to Us, of giving Us, and procuring for Us, all poſſible Compliance
and Obedience; the Reſult whereof appears in their Declaration.
Yet it is very well known, that when-ever the Enemy drew towards
the <hi>Shannon</hi>-ſide, We drew together all the Men We could to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Paſſages, which otherwiſe the Enemy had gained. And
whatever our Play and Merriment was, We had certainly as great

the Hands and Truſt of Sir <hi>Arthur Aſhton</hi> a Roman-Catholick;
and that of the Souldiers and Officers of that Gariſon, the greater

Mr. <hi>Daniel O-Neil,</hi> who (though a Proteſtant) was yet a Native
of this Kingdom, and one that had manifeſted great Affection to
the Nation. That the greater part of the Officers and Souldiers

For <hi>Dundalk,</hi> it is known that Place was given up through
the good Affection to his Majeſty of divers Officers and Souldiers,
rather than forced by Siege, or otherwiſe, with ſome of whom We
conceived it fit to leave the Charge thereof. What Actions or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Ours they were that diſheartned the Roman-Catholicks
to fight, or be under our Command, is not here ſet down. So that
We can no otherwiſe anſwer to this, than that We never did any
ſuch Action, or let fall any ſuch Expreſſion, but were indifferent in our
Actions and Expreſſions of Civility and Reſpect to all the Officers of
the Army. What theſe Catholicks, and many Thouſands of the
People with the <hi>Commiſſioners of Truſt,</hi> or the greater part of them
might fear, if We had maſtered the Kingdom, We are not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

                     <p>The Concluſion of their Declaration is a general Recapitulation
of the Miſeries and Deſolation fallen upon the Kingdom and People

them a belief, that all thoſe Afflictions are through Our means fallen

(next to the good Pleaſure of God to chaſtiſe the Nation) the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thereof may moſt reaſonably be attributed to the Sedition Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty,
Pride, Covetouſneſs and Ambition to Rule of theſe Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
whom We challenge to inſtance, whom We have born down
that would have fought for them, or whom cheriſhed or advanced,
that would or did betray them. And where they ſay that ſome are

inclining to ſubmit to thoſe they call the Parliament, perſwading
themſelves that there can be no ſafety under Our Government, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by Fate and Diſaſter (as they expreſs themſelves more like
Heathen-Poets, than Chriſtian-Biſhops and Church-men) it is known
to ſome there, that to Our certain knowledg divers Perſons, and
Places of conſideration, would have ſubmitted to the Enemy, if
We had gone, rather than live under the Tyranny and Confuſion
of the Government projected by theſe by theſe Declares (which was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

                     <p>Next, they ſay that for Prevention of thoſe Evils, and that the
Kingdom ſhould not be utterly loſt to his Majeſty, and his Catholick
Subjects, they found themſelves bound in Conſcience to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Continuance of his Majeſty's Authority in Us, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

                        <hi>That to prevent the Loſs of the Kingdom to his Majeſty,

any Addreſs to him, or pretending to have received any Direction or

conveniently be called, or until upon application to his Majeſty, he

Affairs in the World, to declare the Senſe of the People with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

aſſume the Power of diſſolving, and erecting the Temporal

and at all times readily to be taken up, can only be anſwered
by the Laws of the Land, the will not allow the Excuſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

And if either his Majeſty had refuſed them Hearing and

had been ſome colour for their proceeding as they did.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt part of their Concluſion they prepare the People with
an Apology of the deſperate State the Kingdom is left in by Us, to
bear the more patiently the <hi>utter loſs of it</hi> under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                     <p>In the Order (atteſted by the Biſhop of <hi>Clonfert</hi>) for publication
of the Excommunication (which publication was made at <hi>Loghreagh</hi>
the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>September</hi>) it is expreſſed, That the Order given to the
Committee of Biſhops at <hi>Galloway</hi> by the Congregation at <hi>James-Town</hi>
was, That in Caſe We would not depart the Kingdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Advice, and depute the King's Authority with Perſons of
Truſt, or that We denied to depart the Kingdom, and no demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
could be made how the Kingdom could be preſerved under
Our Government, that then the ſaid Declaration ſhould be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It is further expreſſed in the ſaid Order, That We, being
ſolicited to the effect aforeſaid, with urgent Reaſons, abſolutely
denied to conſent thereunto: and that We neither did, nor could
demonſtrate unto them any way of preſerving the remainder of the
Kingdom under Our Government; and therefore, according to the
Truſt repoſed in them by the ſaid Congregation, they did publiſh
the ſaid Declaration, denouncing to all Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This is all We obſerve in this Order of Publication more than is
contained in the Declaration at <hi>James-Town.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What We have to anſwer in this Order for Publication is breifly
this. They held it fit We ſhould quit the Kingdom, and depute the
King's Authority, with ſome Perſon or Perſons of Truſt (<hi>that is, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to them).</hi> We refuſe ſo to do upon their Advice, giving them
ſome Reaſons why We refuſe, and promiſing them more, if they
would at a free Conference hear them. For not following this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
without refuting the Reaſons We gave for Our not going,
and without hearing, or ſo much as asking what other Reaſons
thoſe were which We were unwilling to write, and yet would tell
them at a free Conference, (by which Caution they might imagine
they were of Moment) they proceeded to their Declaration and
Excommunication. Here (though We have formerly touched it)
let it be obſerved, That having ſeveral Times, and upon ſeveral
Occaſions, offered to leave the Kingdom, and to depute the King's
Authority (not to diſparage the Nation) with the<note n="*" place="margin">Clanrickard.</note> 
                        <hi>only</hi> Perſon in
all reſpects fit for it, and a Roman-Catholick: this was not accepted
of; but We are made believe the Lord of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> being removed
from any Charge of the Army, and the Proteſtant Party gone, there
remained no further diſtruſt, or diſlike of US, and that then all
Obedience would be given Us. All this and whatſoever elſe they
adviſed being done on Our part, Our Frigat (which lay in <hi>Ire-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi>
whence We might have ſecurely gone) being ſent away, and
the Harbours blocked up by the Rebels Ships, they impoſe upon Us
to effect an Impoſſibility, namely, to go out of the Kingdom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
means of Tranſportation; or elſe (as far as in them lies) We
are rendred infamous throughout the World, and to all Ages, by
their defamatory Libel. Whatever Our Demerit had been, and if
We were the faithleſs, the negligent, the every-way unworthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
they have deſcribed Us to be, certainly they cannot free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the guilt of ſo <hi>mean and baſe a Treachery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let it be next conſidered, That if when a Company of Biſhops, or
a Congregation of Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have a mind to ſet
up themſelves, or any others as <hi>Governours</hi> over the Kingdom, (and
this Power they aſſume at leaſt in the interval of Aſſemblies, and have
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65997:541"/>
now <hi>twice</hi> practiſed it) and the Governor appointed by Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
or (when that is abſent, which ſhould never be ſuppoſed)
by a juſt Repreſentative of the Nation, will not give them room
(by quitting the Government, he is placed in, at their deſire) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
direction from the Power whence he derives his Authority, or
without unavoidable Neceſſity inforcing him; if (we ſay) for his
not doing a thing ſo contrary to the Truſt repoſed in him, to the
Senſe of thoſe intruſted by the People, as the <hi>Commiſſioners of Truſt</hi>
were, and contrary to the Senſe of the moſt intereſted Perſons of
the Kingdom, the foreſaid Company of Biſhops, or Congregation,
may therefore with impunity deliver all Men to Satan that ſhall feed,
help, or adhere to him: It is in this Caſe eaſy to diſcover that ſuch
Biſhops,<note place="margin">☜</note> or a Congregation thus doing, do aim at, and will (if ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted)
eaſily compaſs the Supream <hi>Temporal</hi> Power. If it be ſaid,
they only do it upon evident Neceſſity, for the preſervation of the
People in apparent Hazard of being loſt, and that in this Caſe only
of ſo abſolute neceſſity, they pretend to ſuch Power, and when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
or convinced, will lay it down to the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly:</hi> We
believe no King or State careful of their own preſervation, will allow
they have this Power <hi>even in this Caſe.</hi> For inſtance, If the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
or Congregation of both Clergies, of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi>
or of any Signiory under the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhould pretend to a
Power (upon any Neceſſity whatſoever, whereof the ſaid Biſhops
and Congregation to be Judges) of diſcharging the Subjects of the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> from obeying the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> or the Subjects
of any Signiory under the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> from obeying the Governor
(of any ſuch Signlory) appointed by the State, directing them in
the mean time to obſerve and obey ſuch Form of Government as the
ſaid Congregation ſhould preſcribe, till it ſhould be otherwiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the ſaid King or State: We ſuppoſe it would not paſs for
Orthodox Doctrine in that Roman-Catholick Kingdom, or State,
that a Congregation is qualified with ſuch Power. Nor would the
Neceſſity of their ſo doing, nor yet the Sanctity of their Function,
or Perſons, protect them from ſevere Puniſhment. That our King's
Prerogative in that particular, is as great in this Kingdom, as the
King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s in <hi>Naples,</hi> or that of the State of <hi>Venice</hi> in any Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory
of theirs, it is Treaſon to deny: as it is to affirm, that in
this Particular ſuch a Congregation here hath more Authority, than
a like Congregation in that Kingdom or State. But theſe Men have
not only in this Caſe exceeded whatever at any time, or in any place
was pretended to by any of their Function; but had leſs ground, if
leſs might be, for ſuch a Pretenſion than any others. For here, in a
Solemn Aſſembly of the Nation, a Peace was concluded; moſt of the
Biſhops ſigning this Declaration, were actually there <hi>conſenting to
the Peace;</hi> and all the Congregation, either at, or after the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Peace, ſubſcribed to it. So that by the general Conſent
of the Congregation, firſt or laſt, <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Dillon,
Donogh</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Muskery,</hi> &amp;c. were to look to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the Articles of Peace, and thereby had greater pretence to be
proper Judges of the Violation of the ſaid Articles, than this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yet (without conſulting them) they publiſh this Declaration,
and fulminate their Excommunication againſt any that ſhould adhere
to Us, among other things for pretended Violation of the Peace, and
would not by the ſaid Commiſſioners be perſwaded to retract it.</p>
                     <p>Where they ſay, We neither did, nor could demonſtrate unto
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65997:542"/>
them any way of preſerving the Remainder of the Kingdom under
Our Government, it was a Queſtion never asked of Us, either by the
Biſhop of <hi>Dromore,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Charles Kelly,</hi> who brought Us the
Meſſage, or by the Biſhops of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Clonfert,</hi> that were ſent to Us
for Our Anſwer, or indeed by any other. If ſuch a Queſtion had
been moved to Us, We ſhould doubtleſs have anſwered, That the
moſt probable way of preſerving the Remainder of the Kingdom,
was by the chearful Submiſſion of the Cities, Towns and People, to
the rightful Authority placed over them. And if the Congregation,
or as many of them as are now there, ſhould be put to ſhew a more
probable way, or to quit the Kingdom, it is poſſible it might be fit
for them to think of their Voyage, as it might in ſuch caſe be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
hoped the Kingdom might be preſerved.</p>
                     <p>Thus have We gone through, and anſwered all that we could ever
ſee or hear objected againſt us by the Congregation, and acquainted
you by what Steps they have proceeded to their Declaration and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
wherein we have recited their own Words, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
their own Actions ſo truly, that they cannot (if they would)
deny any part of what we have ſet down as theirs; and therein alſo
we have been the more particular, becauſe it is doubtful whether ever
we ſhall have another Opportunity of vindicating our Self from falſe
Aſperſions caſt upon our Perſon and Actions.</p>

made by the ſaid <hi>Bourk</hi> of the King's Pleaſure as aforeſaid, they,

other for ordering Affairs accordingly; but there being (as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)
jealous Eyes over them, they could not for a time compaſs it
conveniently; he ſaid that in the Parliament then ſitting at <hi>Dublin,</hi> they
would often take occaſion to retire into the withdrawing Room, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Lords Houſe of Parliament, in the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
but being followed by others they had not their Conveniency for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
which they deſired. That having appointed a Meeting at the
Bowling-Ally in the Colledg-green in <hi>Dublin,</hi> they would there ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
exchange ſome Words; but having at length gained a fit Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for a Meeting, after ſome Debates, it was by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
That preſent Diſpatch ſhould be made and ſent to the King of
that reſolved on for his Service. <hi>Ormond</hi> asking <hi>Antrim,</hi> Whom he
would employ in that Buſineſs to the King? he anſwered, that he would
ſend the Lord <hi>Macgnire;</hi> And I, ſaid <hi>Ormond,</hi> will ſend over my Lord
of <hi>Muskery;</hi> and a time being appointed for preparing the ſaid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches,
they then parted; but after ſome Days <hi>Ormond</hi> again meeting
with him, the Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi> told him that <hi>Dublin</hi> was no conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Place for their Buſineſs, that therefore the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi>
would retire into the Country for preparing of the ſaid Diſpatches,
deſiring him, the Lord of <hi>Antrim,</hi> to meet him, at a time appointed at
<hi>Kilka</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> belonging to the late Counteſs-Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of <hi>Kildare,</hi> whither <hi>Ormond</hi> ſaid he would come on Pretence of a

freely: That the time of meeting drawing nigh, and the Lord of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim</hi>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:65997:543"/>
prepared for it, he was therein prevented by a Meſſage from <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
wherewithal Colonel <hi>John Barry</hi> was ſent, intimating that the
Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> having conſidered of the Buſineſs he conceived it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
that one of them two ſhould repair to the King immediately,
rather than ſo great an Affair ſhould be truſted by any other: That for
himſelf he ſaid, that being a Stranger at Court, his going thither
could not be without Suſpicion, but that he the Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi>
might paſs freely, earneſtly deſiring him to undertake the Work: but
he the Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi> refuſed, ſaying, He would not go if <hi>Ormond</hi>
would not go alſo; yet was the Lord of <hi>Antrim,</hi> by the preſſing Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Colonel <hi>Barry</hi> aforeſaid, perſwaded to ſend ſome one from
himſelf to the King, for intimating what was reſolved for his Service,
and ſignifying the already disbanding thoſe 8000 Men raiſed in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> This Diſpatch was ſent by Captain
<hi>Digby,</hi> Conſtable of the Caſtle of <hi>Dunluce</hi> in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Lord of <hi>Antrim:</hi> with thoſe Diſpatches the ſaid <hi>Digby</hi>
did overtake the King at <hi>York,</hi> he being then on his way to <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and from <hi>York</hi> was <hi>Digby</hi> returned back to him the Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi> by
the King, ſignifying his Pleaſure, That all poſſible Endeavours, ſhould
be uſed for getting again together thoſe 8000 Men ſo disbanded; and
that an Army ſhould immediately be raiſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
for him againſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and to do what was
therein neceſſary and convenient for his Service. Upon receiving this
the King's Pleaſure by Captain <hi>Digby,</hi> he the Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi> imparted
the Deſign to the Lord of <hi>Gormonſtown,</hi> and to the Lord of <hi>Slane,</hi>
and after to many others in <hi>Lienſter,</hi> and after going into <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> he
communicated the ſame to many there; but the Fools (ſuch was his
Lordſhip's Expreſſion to us) well liking the Buſineſs, would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
our time or manner for ordering the Work, but fell upon it
without us, and ſooner, and <hi>otherwiſe</hi> than we ſhould have done,
taking to themſelves, and in their own way, the managing of the
Work, and ſo ſpoiled it. It being by us demanded of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
how he intended it ſhould be managed? He anſwered, That the
Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> being then to be ſurprized, if the Lords Juſtices
ſhould oppoſe the Deſign, the Parliament then ſitting ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
for the King againſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and that
the whole Kingdom ſhould be raiſed for the King's Service; and that
if the Lords Juſtices would not join in the Work, they ſhould be
ſecured; and all others who would or might oppoſe them ſhould
be alſo ſecured. Which Diſcourſe was freely made by his Lordſhip
without any Caution given us therein of Secrecy; yet was it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by us, Whether his Lordſhip would give us leave to have
the ſame ſignified to his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and to the Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter?</hi> His Lordſhip anſwered, That
he gave us free liberty ſo to do, which his Lordſhip's Diſcourſe
we have for our better Remembrance reduced to Writing, and
teſtified the ſame under our Hands, to be as aforeſaid.</p>

                     <head>Obſervations on the Marqueſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim's
Information.</head>
                     <p>FIrſt, it expreſly clears the King from giving any Commiſſion for
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, nor is there any thing in it that can charge
his Majeſty with the leaſt Thought or Intention that his Proteſtant
Subjects in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be either plundered or murdered; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
when an unthinking Reader finds that the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> was
to be ſurpriz'd, he runs away with the Notion, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
was purſuant to that Order, and the King was in the bottom
of that barbarous Rebellion: and this perhaps was one deſign of this
Information; but the chief end of it was to abuſe the World with
a Belief, that the King was not neceſſitated to a War with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
by any thing then newly happened in 1642. but that he
had projected it long before, and had made this Preparation to put
it in Execution.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This Information cannot be true, but either <hi>Antrim</hi>
deceived the World, or <hi>Burk</hi> impoſed upon him; for beſides that,
<hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Antrim</hi> was unfit to be joyned in a Commiſſion, as well
becauſe there were never any good Underſtanding between them, as
alſo becauſe they were of different Religions and Intereſts; how
much more obvious, and eaſy, leſs ſcandalous and more effectual
would it have been for the King to have made <hi>Ormond</hi> Lord-Deputy,
than to order him to ſurprize the Caſtle and the Lords Juſtices?</p>
                     <p>Moreover, theſe 12000 additional Men could not have been raiſed
without Noiſe and Time, nor kept without Money, nor Armed at
all, for there were not 12000 Arms in the Store 23 <hi>Octob.</hi> and yet
8000 of them were the Arms of the diſbanded Men which they
were to keep on Foot.</p>
                     <p>But it is yet more ſtrange, that before any Breach with the
Parliament, and whilſt Matters tended to an Accommodation more
hopefully than in ſome Months before, the King ſhould by ſuch a raſh
and imprudent Action adminiſter ſuch cauſe of Jealouſy to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65997:544"/>
at ſo unſeaſonable a time, whilſt he was abſent in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
as would certainly put the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in a Flame, and loſe
his Majeſty the Hearts and Hands of more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavaliers than he
could gain of <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Men.</p>
                     <p>But to put this matter out of doubt, the King long before he went
to <hi>York</hi> (which was in the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi>) knew the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army
would be disbanded, and therefore conſented to licenſe four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
