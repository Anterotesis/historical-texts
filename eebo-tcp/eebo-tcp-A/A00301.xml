            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Hurt no man. Obey God and nature.
Suffer iniuries. Deſerue wel of al men as

ſeing a certain
fellowe voide of al good
condicions, hauing a
bolde ſpirite to ſpeake
yet to an ill intente, giuing his minde
to the ſtudy of Philoſophie: he with
a loude voyce cryed out on the faythe
of God and man, reprouing the man
in theſe wordes: O man ſée whether
the veſſell be cleane, wherin thou doſt
put theſe things. For if thou ſhalte of
arrogancie poure them in, they wil pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſhe:
if they ſhall putrifie, they wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vrine, or vineger, or worſe than
theſe, if worſe may be. He ment, that
learning inferreth great hurt and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
if it happen vpon a mind which
is corrupted with yll affections: &amp; the
more excellente euery learning is, the
greater hurte it cauſeth if it happen
on a naughtie man: like as there is
no thing more better then a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
<pb facs="tcp:1781:47"/>
ſo there is nothing more peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
then an ill diuine. <hi>Gellius. lib. xvij. cap.

            <p>He on a time hearing of a certaine
man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would eaſilie be flattered, ſaid,
the crowes plucke dead mens eies out
of the carkaſſes and that not withoute
a cauſe, for none which is depriued of
life, hath the vſe of hys ſight. But flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers

            <p>He counſelled that we ſhoulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
thrée maner of wayes: the man
with whome we are conuerſaunte:
whether he be better than we oure
ſelues are, or inferiour, or equall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs. It is méete to heare diligently, &amp;
obeye him whiche is better then oure
ſelues, modeſtly to perſuade the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or inferioure, and to agrée w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy

Although this be before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1781:47"/>
the precepts, yet I thought good
againe to repeate and recken it alſo
in this place. For as the prouerbe is,
<hi>Bis &amp; ter quod pulchrun eſt repetendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi>
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, that which is goodly ought twice
and thrice to be ſayd or repeated.</p>
            <p>He being demaunded, what man
was riche. To whom (ſayed he) that is
ſufficient which he hath. <hi>Strob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſayd that the Gods did not hate
ſuch, as in this life doe contende and
wraſtle w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diuers miſeries. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
meaning was, that aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was vnto men auailable: to whom
if things do proſper according to their
deſire, they are ſo vexed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Furies,</hi>
that is, with anger, couetouſneſſe and
luſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> through their proſperitie, they
moue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gods to wrath. This is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
in <hi>Bruſonius Conturſin us. li. ij. Exempl.</hi>
He being demaunded, by what meane
a man might purchaſe an honeſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte,
he aunſwered. If thou wilt haue
a good name, learne to ſpeake well,
when thou haſt learned to ſpeake wel,
endeuoure to do well, and by this
<pb facs="tcp:1781:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meanes thou ſhalt get a good reporte.</p>
            <p>He being demaunded howe a man
might procure ſorrow to his ennimie,
ſayd: If a man do ſo frame and diſpoſe
hymſelfe, that he do all good things.</p>
            <p>The ſame was accuſtomed to ſaye,
that it was more neceſſarie to cure the
ſoule than the body, ſeing that it is bet
to dye, than to leade an ill life. <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
