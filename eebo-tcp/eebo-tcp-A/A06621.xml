            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Come to the Tayler, hee is gone to the Paynters, to learne howe more cunning may lurke in the fashion, then can bee expressed in the making. Aske the Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they will say their heads ake with deuising notes beyonde Ela. Enquire at Ordinaries, there must be sallets for the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian; picktooths for the Spaniard; pots for the German; por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge for the Englishman. At our exercises, Souldiers call for Tragedies, their obiect is bloud: Courtiers for Commedies, their subiect is loue: Countriemen for Pastoralles, Shepheards are their Saintes. Trafficke and trauell hath wouen the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Nations into ours, and made this land like Arras, full of deuise, which was Broade-cloth, full of workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe.</p>

That greedines of <hi>Mellacrites,</hi> whose heart-stringes are made of <hi>Plutus</hi> purse-stringes, hath made <hi>Mydas</hi> a lumpe of earth, that should be a god on earth; and thy effeminate minde <hi>Eristus,</hi> whose eyes are stitcht on <hi>Caelias</hi> face, and thoughts gyude to her beautie, hath bredde in all the court such a tender wantonnes, that nothing is thoght of but loue, a passion proceeding of beastly lust, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with a courtlie name of loue. Thus whilest we follow the nature of things, we forget the names. Since this vnsatiable thirst of gold, and vntemperat humor of lust crept into the kings court, Souldiers haue begged almes of Artificers, and with their helmet on their head been glad to follow a Louer with a gloue in his hatte, which so much abateth the courage of true Captaines, that they must account it more honorable, in the court
<pb facs="tcp:10276:9"/>
to be a cowarde so rich and amorus, than in a campe to be valiant, if poore and maimed. He is more fauoured that pricks his finger with his mistres needle, then hee that breakes his launce on his enemies face: and he that hath his mouth full of fair words, than he that hath his bodie ful of deep scarres. If one be olde, &amp; haue siluer haires on his beard, so he haue golden ruddocks in his bagges, he must be wise and honourable. If young and haue curled locks on his head, amarous glaunces with his eyes, smooth speeches in his mouth, euerie Ladies lap shalbe his pillow, euery Ladies face his glasse, euery Ladies eare a sheath for his flatteries; only Souldiers, if they be old, must beg in their owne countries; if yong, trie the fortune of warres in another.

                  <p>Stay <hi>Martius,</hi> though I know loue to growe to such losenes, and hoarding to such miserie, that I maye rather grieue at both, than remedie either: yet thy ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating my father to continuall armes, to conquere crowns, hath only brought him into imminent danger of his owne head. The loue hee hath followed, I feare vnnaturall; the riches he hath got, I know vnmeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the warres he hath leuied, I doubt vnlawfull; hath drawn his bodie with graie haires to the graues mouth; and his minde with eating cares to desperate determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: ambition hath but two steps, the lowest bloud; the highest enuie: both these hath my vnhappie father climbde, digging mines of gold with the liues of men, and now enuied of the whole world, is enuironed with enemies round about the world, not knowing that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition hath one heele nayled in hell, though she stretch

her finger to touch the heauens. I woulde the Gods would remoue this punishment, so that <hi>Mydas</hi> would be penitent.

Let Phrygia be an example of chastitie, not luste; liberalitie, not couetousnes; valor, not tyrannie. I wish not your bodies banisht, but your mindes, that my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and your king, may be our honor, and the worlds wonder. And thou <hi>Caelia,</hi> and all you Ladies, learn this of <hi>Sophronia,</hi> that beautie in a minute is both a blossome and a blast: Loue, a worme which seeming to liue in the eye, dies in the hart.

O vnquenchable thirst of gold, which turneth mens heads to lead, and makest them blockish; their hearts to iron, and makest them couetous; their eyes to delight in the view, and makest them blinde in the vse. I that did possesse mynes of golde, could not bee contented till my minde were also a myne. Could not the treasure of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> nor the tributes of <hi>Greece,</hi> nor mountaines in the East, whose guts are gold, satisfie thy minde with gold? Ambition eateth gold, &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth blood; climeth so high by other mens heads, that she breaketh her owne necke. What should I doo with a world of ground, whose bodie must be content with seauen foote of earth? or why did I couet to get so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie crownes, hauing my self but one head? Those that tooke small vessells at the sea, I accompted Pyrates; and
<pb facs="tcp:10276:12"/>
my selfe that suppressed whole Fleetes, a Conquerour: as though robberies of <hi>Mydas</hi> might masque vnder the names of triumphs, and the traffique of other Nations bee called treacherie. Thou hast pampred vp thy selfe with slaughter, as <hi>Diomedes</hi> did his horse with blood; so vnsatiable thy thirst, so heauie thy sword. Two bookes haue I alwaies carried in my bosome, calling them the dagger, and the sword; in which the names of all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Noblemen, and Gentlemen were dedicated to slaughter, or if not (which worse is) to slauerie. O my Lords, when I call to minde my cruelties in <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> my vsurping in <hi>Getulia,</hi> my oppression in <hi>Sola:</hi> then do I finde neither mercies in my conquests, nor colour for my warres, nor measure in my taxes. I haue written my lawes in blood, and made my Gods of golde; I haue caused the mothers wombes to bee their childrens tombes, cradles to swimme in blood like boates, and the temples of the Gods a stewes for strumpets. Haue not I made the sea to groane vnder the number of my ships: and haue they not perished, that there was not two left to make a number? Haue I not thrust my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects into a Camp, like oxen into a Cart; whom hauing made slaues by vniust warres, I vse now as slaues for all warres? Haue not I entised the subiects of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor Princes to destroy their natural Kings? like moaths that eate the cloth in which they were bred, like vipers that gnawe the bowels of which they were borne, and like woormes that consume the wood in which they were ingendred? To what kingdome haue not I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended clayme? as though I had been by the Gods created heire apparant to the world, making euerie tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle a title; and all the territories about me, traitours to me. Why did I wish that all might bee gold I toucht,
<pb facs="tcp:10276:13"/>
but that I thought all mens hearts would bee touched with gold, that what pollicie could not compasse, nor prowes, gold might haue commaunded, and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. A bridge of gold did I mean to make in that Iland where all my nauie could not make a breach. Those I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes did I long to touch, that I might turne them to gold, and my selfe to glorie. But vnhappie <hi>Mydas,</hi> who by the same meanes perisheth himself, that he thought to conquere others: being now become a shame to the world, a scorne to that petie Prince, and to thy self a consumption. A petie Prince, <hi>Mydas?</hi> no, a Prince protected by the Gods, by Nature, by his own vertue, and his Subiects obedience. Haue not all treasons beene discouered by miracle, not counsell? that doo the Gods chalenge. Is not the Countrie walled with huge waues? that dooth Nature claime. Is hee not through the whole world a wonder, for wisdome and temperance? that is his owne strength. Doe not all his Subiects (like Bees) swarme to preserue the King of Bees? that their loyaltie mainteineth. My Lords, I faint both for lack of food, &amp; want of grace. I will to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, where if I be rid of this intollerable disease of gold, I will next shake off that vntemperat desire of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and measure my Territories, not by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my minde, but the right of my Succession.</p>

                  <p>There dwelt somtimes in Phrygia, a Lady very fair, but passing froward, as much maruelled at for beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as for peeuishnes misliked. Hie she was in the instep, but short in the heele; strait laced, but loose bodied. It came to passe, that a gentleman, as yong in wit as yeres, and in yeres a very boy, chanced to glaunce his eies on her, &amp; there were they dazeled on her beautie, as larkes that are caught in the Sunne with the glittering of a glasse. In her faire lookes were his thoughts intangled, like the birdes of Canarie, that fal into a silken net. Dote he did without measure, and die he must without her loue. She on the other side, as one that knew her good, began to look askaunce, yet felt the passions of loue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into her heart, though shee dissembled them with her eyes.</p>

I see that by obscure shadows, which you cannot discerne in fresh colours. <hi>Apollo</hi> in the depth of his darke answere, is to mee the glistering of a bright sunne. I perceiue (and yet not too late) that Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos wil not be touched by gold, by force it cannot: that the Gods haue pitched it out of the world, as not to bee controlde by any in the world. Though my hande bee golde, yet I must not thinke to span ouer the maine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean. Though my souldiers be valiant, I must not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke my quarrels iust. There is no way to nayle the crowne of Phrygia fast to my daughters head, but in letting the crownes of others sitte in quiet on theirs,</p>
