            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of the late <hi>Great and Famous Victory</hi> Obtained over Two Thouſand High-Land Rebels, In the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by His Majeſty's Forces, Commanded by Sir <hi>Tho. Leviſtone,</hi> WITH A particular Relation of the Killing Five Hundred of the Enemy, and the Taking of One Huodred Priſoners; of which Number, were ſeveral Officers of Note.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Licenſed, and Entered according to Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>JUſt now the Council received the following Account, by an Expreſs from Sir <hi>Thomas Leviſtone</hi> (who Commands a part of our Forces in the <hi>North</hi>) that he having intercepted ſome Letters which diſcovered ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegues of the Rebels, and the meaſures they deſigned to take; he immediately aſſembled his Forces, which conſiſted of Eleven Hundred Men, and marched all Night after the Enemy, who were to the Number of Two Thouſand: And, in their March, were forced to Ford a River up to their Arm-pits; Colonel <hi>Leviſtone,</hi> and other Officers, (to encourage the Soldiers) went in firſt: Our Men came up to the Enemy before day, and Attaqued them in their Camp; which was ſo great a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to them, that they immediately fled; and, in purſuit, there were Killed about Five Hundred of the Rebels, and One Hundred taken Priſoners, (among which were many conſiderable Officers of Note) with little loſs on our ſide. The Priſoners gave Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> an account, That they expected daily to be joyned by a great many more; of whom the Colonel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to go in purſuit of; and doubts not, but in a very little time, to be able to give a very good account of them.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> advice was brought to <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That a Ship Landed in <hi>Gallaway,</hi> near the Mouth of the Water of <hi>Oar,</hi> ſent from the late King <hi>James,</hi> from the Bay of <hi>Dublin,</hi> with Men, Arms, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they Landed ſome Men in the Night, undiſcovered, who have gone through the Country with ſeveral Letters from the late King <hi>James.</hi> The Country People in that Place being in a poſture of Defence, the next day ſeized the Veſſel in the River, with the Arms and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Sixteen Officers, who are ſent for by the Council. This Ship car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried but Four pieces of Cannon.</p>
            <p>As the happy News, which almoſt daily arrives from <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the good Succeſs His Majeſties Forces meets with there, both by Sea and Land, is ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the hopes all good <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and Well-wiſhers to the Intereſt of great <hi>Brittain</hi> have, of a ſpeedy and intire Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of that Kingdom, to the ſubjection of the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> So the no leſs happy Accounts we have received of His Majeſty's Affairs in the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> confirms all good Men in their Belief of the ſpeedy and intire Settlement of that Kingdom, in the true Foundations of Peace and Unity; notwithſtanding the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and other <hi>Jacobites,</hi> Enemies to the Intereſts of their Majeſties, and theſe Kingdoms, by their no leſs Impudent than falſe and ſcandalous Reports, which they daily ſpread abroad, with deſign to Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Minds of many well-meaning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and perſwade them to the contrary: For as hitherto Almighty <hi>God</hi> has bleſt His Majeſty, and His Arms with Succeſs, in all His no leſs Juſt and Righteous, than Great Undertakings; ſo we doubt not but He will continue his Bleſſing unto Their Majeſties, and Their good Subjects, and fruſtrate all the Deſigns of their <hi>Enemies.</hi> For a continuance of whoſe Bleſſing is, and ought to be the Prayers of all good Men.</p>
