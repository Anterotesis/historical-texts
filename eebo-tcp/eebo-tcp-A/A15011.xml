            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is for thee (Chriſtian friend) Gods ſacred and pure Law, perſpicuouſly and orderly vnfolded, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of thoſe glorious beams more now then euer enlarged, though we haue many that haue done excellently. For in this ſhort and pithie Treatiſe, if thou pleaſeſt ſeriouſly to be acquainted with it, as alſo make an holy vſe of it, there will iſſue three bleſſed benefits of ſpeciall and weighty importance.</p>
            <p>Firſt, hereby thou maiſt more clearely know thy ſelfe, and diſcouer thy cold faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thy leane and idle ſeruices, and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:20406:3"/>
diſpoſition, and that ſnakie brood of ſinne that lurketh in thy euer-vitious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for it is the Lawes office to detect ſin, as a looking glaſſe to bewray ſpots, and as the Sunne to diſcouer euen little motes. Whence is it men ſee not their miſled liues, but becauſe they are vndiſciplin'd in the Lords walkes? Can there be a worke of greater conſequence then a large opening of theſe holy rules, which although the full ſplendor thereof is reſerued for the glory aboue, yet open thine eyes to the bleſſed brightneſſe which ſhines out of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, to diſcouer thy darke ignorance, thy infidelitie and ſtubborne pride, how rich thou art in follie, how poore in grace, and how conſcience hitherto hath beene ſealed with a curſed brand: here wee may be ſad ſpectators of our froward way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, our wandring and groueling thoughts, our barren memories, our raging diſcontented paſsions, and dull edg'd lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den affections, yea the diſorder of the whole man, turning face to Satan and backe to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20406:3"/>Secondly, it lends powerfull aide in the ſeruices and worſhips of God. This will bring thee with a hunger-bitten ſoule and heauy heart to behold the Lords ſhining face in the preaching of the word, and bends thy will to it with abſolute yeelding. This is a notable touch-ſtone to try thy ſelfe to the heart root when thou art to receiue that ſacramentall meat, and will furniſh thee with much ſtore and varietie for prayer. Wouldst thou confeſſe against thy ſelfe? behold here a large field: Or wouldst begge graces of God? ſee here a ſampler: here is matter for meditation, for Chriſtian parlees; this will enable thee to catechize and inſtruct thy familie, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens thy vnderſtanding in reading the Scriptures, and for dayes of humiliation, times of pretious worth with Gods people; this worke thorowly lookt into, ſhall cauſe thee to fall out with thy ſelfe, and ſhall ſend thee with penitent eyes to bewaile thy wretched eſtate, and powre out thy ſoule into the boſome of Chriſt, and will put ſuch marrow and ſtrength into thee, that
<pb facs="tcp:20406:4"/>
humbly and hotly thou maist wraſtle with God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this ſhall direct all thy paths, and wiſely conduct thee through this thornie life; it will cauſe thee thinke well, ſpeake well, and liue well, and furniſheth thee with knowledge, faith in God, humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectedneſſe, ſpirituall wiſdome, a well tuned conſcience, a ſtooping will, heauenly thoughts, a right fraught memorie, and ranks in order thy loue, feare, ioy, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and all the reſt of thoſe ſubordinate faculties of the ſoule, bending them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue what is good, and ſtand ſtifly armed againſt euery euill. And as for being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted of the world, and to liue vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, wronging neither thy ſelfe, nor any man, in ſoule, bodie, eſtate, name, or place, take this booke for thy counſellor. Feaſt thine eyes then with a ſubiect neceſſarily vſefull, and ſo exactly compiled, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but winne eſteeme with euery knowing man and gratious heart. For I muſt tell thee, diuers friends of exquiſite iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hearing that this worke was in my
<pb facs="tcp:20406:4"/>
hand, did earneſtly ſollicite me to turne it to common good. Amongst the reſt, a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned worthy vnderſtanding Diuine, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter R. Bolton,</hi> hauing peruſed it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it vnto mee in theſe termes: <hi>Me thinkes, in ſhort and little roome, it opens &amp; repreſents the marrow and myſteries of that adored depth, the banks and bottome whereof, no wit of man ſhall euer be able fully to fathom and comprehend, while the world laſts, with more cleare, exact, and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dexteritie, then I haue diſcouered in others, though they haue alſo done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently.</hi> And he perſwaded with the Author, and ſince alſo with me, to let it paſſe abroad more publikely. Let then the more then ordinarie parts of the workman, and of ſuch as haue commended it, as alſo the great paines of our pen-man, who hath told me, he had a long harueſt for this hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of corne, together with the pretiouſnes of the ſubiect, and the goodly meeds thou maiſt gaine by it, let theſe perſwade thee to read it, and that vnpartially: In the meane

                     <item>2. The affections.</item>

               <p>The ſenſes called inward are two.</p>
               <list>

                  <item>2. Memorie.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Imagination, or the thinking power, which receiuing the obiects from the ſenſes doth order, moue and diſpoſe them according to its owne liking: and the duty of this is, to be thinking of God continually, more plentifully, largely, conſtantly, then of all other things. For though he be not ſubiect to ſenſe, yet from things ſubiect to ſenſe wee are bound to forme in our ſelues thoughts of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies (according to our abilitie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing,) <hi>viz.</hi> of his power, goodneſſe, mercie, wiſdome, &amp;c. So as the minde of man ſhould more abundantly buſie it ſelfe in ſuch conceits and thoughts of God, then of any other thing in the world, yea of all other things laid together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſenſe called inward is Memory, which is a power of making that thing preſent to the ſoule, which is abſent from the ſenſes. And the duty of mans ſoule, ſo much as concernes this facultie, is a perpetuall and continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of God; that is, a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him to it ſelfe as preſent, though to the ſenſes hee doe not appeare, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20406:9"/>
that, ſo as we remember nothing ſo firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor ſo often as him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Leſſe principall faculties inward are called affections, which are powers of the ſoule, in the reaſonable creature, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the will, whereby the ſoule worketh it ſelfe to the ſeeking and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of good, and ſhunning and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding of euill. Now of theſe affections there are 4. which may and muſt be ſet vpon God, and that with all their ſtrength, and with the fulneſſe of their working, and farre more then vpon any or all other things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt affection is Loue, whereby the ſoule is moued and inclined to be one with any good thing; and becauſe God is the beſt thing, euen goodneſſe it ſelfe, therefore ſhould the ſoule bee moſt frequently and earneſtly filled with ſuch motions and inclinations towards him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond affection is Feare, whereby the ſoule is moued from euill, with a kinde of ſhrinking and fainting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from it, when it is comming. Now becauſe God conſidered as angry and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, is to the creature the greateſt euill (of miſery) that can be conceiued of, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20406:9"/>
ought it decline his anger and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with the moſt frequent and earneſt motions, aboue all other euill things, not daring ſo much as once to make any offer of incurring his diſpleaſure, yea ſhunning and abhorring it, more then all other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of puniſhment, that may be poſſibly ſuffered. Now this compoſition of Loue and Feare is called reuerence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third affection is Ioy whereby the ſoule doth receiue comfort and content in a good thing, and is moued to embrace and enioy the ſame. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is the chiefe good, therefore ought the ſoule to be moued with more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and often motions of gladneſſe for his excellent glory and happineſſe, in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then for any other thing, and more for his loue, fauour and good will, then for any other thing beſides his glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth affection is Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereby the ſoule is moued to reſt and ſtay it ſelfe vpon any thing, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the good it willeth. And becauſe God is of infinite power, and all power is his, neither hath any creature any abilitie to doe any thing without him, therefore muſt the ſoule reſt it ſelfe wholly and only
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20406:10"/>
vpon him, according to the truth of his promiſe, for the attaining of all good things both ſpirituall and temporall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The leſſe principall facultie outward, is alone the facultie of ſpeaking, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit of the imagination, and the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the vnderſtanding. For no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward facultie, except only this of ſpeech, can be in any ſort exerciſed vpon God, as its obiect, but this may: and its dutie is to be continually exerciſed as any occaſion is offered, in ſpeaking good of God. A man is bound to talke much more of God and his excellencies, to the ſetting forth of his glory, then of any other thing, yea then of all things beſides: both becauſe hee is moſt fully repleniſhed with all excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and alſo becauſe the affection of loue which cannot but rule the tongue, ought to be moſt ardent towards him.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of duties of dependance. Now follow the duties of conformitie, theſe alſo are to be found in all the powers of man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the chiefe faculties called reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which are three.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Perfect knowledge of the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of God, according to the meaſure of age, gifts, and meanes, that euery man enioyeth, ſo that the minde muſt apply it ſelfe more to the ſearching out of his reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will, then of any other things. And the matter of this knowledge is the truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed of God, concerning our duty in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and prohibitions; and the reward of doing our duty in promiſes, or of not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in threats, in vnderſtanding of which, the minde muſt buſie it ſelfe more then in all other knowledge, after the knowledge of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond chiefe grace of the vnderſtanding is Perfect faith to and in the promiſes and threats of God, (vnder which is alſo contained faith in his prouidence, the gouerning of all things, and that for the good of his, being one of the things that he hath vndertaken) whereby we doe ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly and fully aſſent vnto them and apply
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20406:11"/>
them each vnto himſelfe, according to their nature, and as there is cauſe and vſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third chiefe grace of the vnderſtanding, is Spirituall prudence, or wiſdome, which is the grace whereby we are able to order our ſelues, and all our actions aright, for the attaining of the true ends of our being, according to the reuealed will of God. It is a readines &amp; nimblenes of minde to make continuall vſe of diuine truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to vs. A fruit of the feare of God, which is deriued from the knowledge of him. It hath two parts. Firſt, conſideration whereby the minde doth ſeriouſly ponder and conſider of the truths knowne. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, heedfulneſſe, warineſſe, or obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby it attendeth to all its owne acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all other neceſſary occaſions, for its ſpirituall good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond chiefe facultie called reaſonable, is Conſcience or a knowing with God, which is a power of the ſoule, whereby it is inabled to diſcerne of its own eſtate and actions, in regard of Gods liking or diſliking the ſame. A power to iudge whether God approue and fauour me or mine actions, yea or no: that is conſcience, of which we muſt conſider two things.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The third chiefe faculty called rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, is the Will, the vertue of which is flexibleneſſe to the will of God, and that in regard of</p>

               <p>THE ſumme of it is to order vs in the ſolemne worſhip of God, or exerciſes of diuine ſeruice, called vſually, religious exerciſe. That any thing may be called an act of diuine ſeruice, three things are required.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it be done with immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God, in that himſelfe or ſome thing in his ſtead is the obiect of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it doe tend to the doers inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20406:26"/>
directly and of it ſelfe to the getting or increaſing of ſome or all the chiefe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces required in the firſt Commandement, by winning and obtaining them, or ſome of them from God, when they hope to pleaſe and content him by ſuch an act.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there be a ſeparating of ones ſelfe from all other buſineſſes, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſuch acts wholly and altogether. And euery exerciſe of religion or of diuine ſeruice, hath diuers particular actions that be as parts of the whole, and in the orderly vniting of which, the whole it ſelfe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and whatſoeuer is done in ſuch exerciſe of religion for the end and purpoſe of pleaſing God, and getting grace with reſpect of conſcience to him, as eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he muſt and will haue it ſo, or elſe thy ſeruice ſhall not be ſo well-pleaſing and acceptable vnto him. This is a part of worſhip or of diuine ſeruice: for example, to offer a young bullocke was an exerciſe of religion, becauſe the Prieſt did intend to offer it vnto God with an intention of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith and obedience, and that directly. The doing of it in ſuch a place, with ſuch garments, with ſuch rites, were parts of this worſhip, or religious exerciſe, becauſe in all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20406:27"/>
theſe the intention of the doer was carried to God, accounting the ſeruice not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him without them, and hoping and purpoſing by the due obſeruation of all theſe things to pleaſe God, to exerciſe faith and obedience, and other graces, as much as by the very offering it ſelfe.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:20406:32"/>1. To the higher offices of Paſtors or Biſhops, men vnſpotted of criminous faults in their liues, and of learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Scripture, to teach, exhort, and confute the gaine-ſayers in ſome ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as is not required of all common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the inferiour office of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, men of vnſpotted life and ſound in faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing we muſt know, is by whom and in what manner, that is, with what ſolemnities, and in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they muſt be aſſigned. And here I ſuppoſe the Scripture hath preciſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined nothing, but left it to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the ſeuerall Churches to take fit wayes for their owne beſt commoditie: for there is no precept expreſſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaying, Let ſuch men in ſuch orders aſſigne Miniſters or conſecrate them, nor any equiualent that can be deduced out of Scripture. And as for examples, that goe ſingle without precept, they ſhew what may be done, and are a good allowance, they cannot proue what muſt be done, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are any obligation to the conſcience, for only by the Law comes the knowledge
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20406:33"/>
of ſinnes, and where there is no law there is no ſinne. Now in theſe particulars there is neither any law, nor any vniforme exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: wherefore in theſe caſes, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſitie nor ſinne, but a libertie of taking different courſes in diuers places, as ſhall ſeeme beſt to the Churches and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian gouernours; for God knew in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that it was not fit to tie all kindes of Ciuill Eſtates and Gouernments to one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this behalfe, and therefore hath he laid no ſuch tie vpon man. And its a raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in men to tie themſelues or others, where God hath not tied.</p>
               <p>This is one part of Church diſcipline, reſpecting the Miniſterie, <hi>viz.</hi> the aſſigning of fit men to fit offices. A ſecond is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the vnfit (<hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that runne into ſcandalous conuerſation, &amp; teach falſe and dangerous doctrine) from theſe places, to be done by the ſame that aſſigned them.</p>

And the duties of thoſe that are vnited in affinitie, is to be to thoſe that are thus tied vnto them, euen as if they were their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinſmen, both in loue, and in the effects of loue.

               <p>This inequalitie is twofold, as the cauſes of it are double, for the difference is barely in regard of certaine endowments or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or elſe in regard of ſome function, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or eſtate.
