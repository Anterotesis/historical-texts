            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And with them two men
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:133480:5"/>
on horſeback with each of them a woman behind him, and one woman walking on the better way or path. In this poſture did they march, and in ſuch a caſe, that one <hi>George Witherley</hi> noting their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, asked them to come in the better rode, adding that God expected no ſuch extremity: but they continued on their way, not anſwering in any other notes, but what were muſicall, ſinging <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabbath,</hi>&amp;c. Thus continued they, till by their wandring they came to the Almſehouſe within the Suburbs of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where one of the women alighted, and ſhe with the other of her own ſex lovingly marcht on each ſide of <hi>Naylor</hi>'s Horſe. This <hi>Witherley</hi> ſaith, he ſuppoſes they could not be leſſe deep in the muddy way then to the knees, and he ſaith they ſang, but ſometimes with ſuch a buzzing mel-<hi>ODIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> noyſe that he could not underſtand what it was.

               <p>Q. Art thou the only Son of God?</p>
               <p>A. I am the Son of God, but I have many Brethren.</p>
               <p>Q. Have any called thee by the name of Jeſus?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:133480:10"/>A. Not as unto the viſible, but as Jeſus, the Chriſt that is in me.</p>
               <p>Q. Doſt thou own the name of the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi>?</p>
               <p>A. Not as a creature, but if they give it Chriſt within I own it, and have a Kingdom but not of this world, my Kingdome is of another world, of which thou watſt not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or no art thou the Prophet of the moſt high?</p>
               <p>A. Thou baſt ſaid, I am a Prophet.</p>
               <p>Q. Doſt thou own that attribute, the Judge of <hi>Iſrael</hi>?</p>
               <p>A. The Judge is but one, and is witneſſed in me, and is the Chriſt, there muſt not be any joyned with him: if they ſpeak of the ſpirit in me, I own it only as God is manifeſt in the fleſh, according as God dwelleth in me, and judgeth there himſelf.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom wert thou ſent?</p>
               <p>A. By him who hath ſent the ſpirit of his Son in me to try, not as to carnal matters, but belonging to the Kingdome of God, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the Father and the Son, the judge of all ſpirits to be guided by none.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether art thou more ſent then others, or whether others be not ſent in that meaſure?</p>
               <p>A. As to that I have nothing at preſent given me of my Father to anſwer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your birth mortal or immortal?</p>
               <p>A. Not according to the Natural birth, but according to the Spiritual birth, born of the immortal ſeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Wert thou ever called the Lambe of God?</p>
               <p>A. I look not back to things behind, but there might be ſome ſuch thing in the letter; I am a lamb, and have ſought it long before I could witneſſe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is thy mother, or whether or no is ſhe a virgin?</p>
               <p>A. Nay, according to the naturall birth.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the hope of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in thee?</p>
               <p>A. The hope is in Chriſt, and as Chriſt is in me ſo far the hope of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtands; Chriſt is in me the hope of glory.</p>
               <p>Q. What more hope is there in thee then in others?</p>
               <p>A. None can know but them of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt give an account.</p>
               <p>Q. Art thou the everlaſting Son of God?</p>
               <p>A. Where God is manifeſt in the fleſh, there is the everlaſting Son, and I do witneſs God in the fleſh; I am the Son of God, and the Son of God is but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Art thou the Prince of peace?</p>
               <p>A. The Prince of everlaſting peace is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why doſt thou not reprove thoſe that give thee theſe attributes?</p>
               <p>A. I have ſaid nothing unto them but ſuch things are written.</p>
               <p>Q. Is thy name Jeſus?</p>
               <p>A.—Here he was ſilent.</p>
               <p>Q. For what ſpace of time haſt thou been ſo called?</p>

               <p>Q. Ith ere no other Jeſus beſides thee?</p>

               <p>Q. Art thou the everlaſting Son of God, the King of righteouſneſs?</p>
               <p>A. I am, and the everlaſting righteouſneſs is wrought in me, if ye were acquainted with the Father, ye would alſo be acquainted with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any kiſſe thy feet?</p>
               <p>A. It might be they did, but I minded them not.</p>
               <p>Q. When thou waſt called the King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> didſt thou not anſwer, thou ſayeſt it.</p>

               <p>A. As do the Lillies without care, being maintained by my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Who doſt thou call thy Father?</p>

               <p>A. I was guided and directed by my father.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:133480:12"/>Q. Why waſt thou called a Judge to try the cauſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi>?</p>

               </p>

               <p>A. I can do nothing of my ſelf: the Scripture beareth witneſs to the power in me which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting; it is the ſame power we read of in the Scripture. The Lord hath made me a ſigne of his coming: and that honour that belongeth to Chriſt Jeſus, in whom I am revealed, may be given to him, as when on earth at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure.</p>

               <p>A. It tended to my Fathers praiſe and glory; and I ought not to ſlight any thing which the Spirit of the Lord moves.</p>
               <p>Q. Dost thou think the Spirit of the Lord moved or commanded them?</p>

               <p>HE is a man of ſo erroneous and unſanctified a Diſpoſition, that it is hard to ſay whether hereſie or impudencie beareth the greater rule in him, as will appear,</p>
               <p>Firſt, in what he teſtifieth before ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; ſee the brief Relation of the Northern Quakers, pag.22. that he was as holy, juſt, and good as God himſelf. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he in a Letter to one in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, expreſly ſaith, That he that expected to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt that died at Jeruſalem, ſhall be deceived: ſee Mr. <hi>Billingſly</hi>'s Defence of the Scriptures, pag.16. The Perfect Phariſee, pag. 8. And ſo ſaid another of that Sect:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:133480:23"/>
he was not ſuch a fool, as to hope to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt that died at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſixteen hundred years ago: See Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi>'s Myſterie of Godlineſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs: Thus they glory in their ignorance, and count that fooliſhneſs which is the true Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in a letter I had in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, but now lent to a friend, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Paſtor and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Congregation in the North, whereof <hi>Nayler</hi> once was a member, till for his apoſtacy he was excommunicated, It is offered to be proved, and by them teſtified to be true, that one Mris. <hi>Roper,</hi> her husband being gon on ſome occaſion from her a long voyage, this <hi>Nayler</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented her company, &amp; was ſeen to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle her upon his knee, and kiſs her laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly: and in that time of his ſociety with her, ſhe was brought to bed with a child, when her husband had been abſent ſeven and fourty weeks to a day from her; and on a time he was ſeen to dance her in a private room; and having kiſt

her very often, ſhe took occaſion to ſay, Now <hi>James,</hi> what would the world ſay if they ſhould ſee us in this poſture? to which he ſaid ſomewhat, but he was ſo low, that it could not be heard. This was objected againſt him, but he denied to anſwer it before the ſaid Church; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that he would not ſpeak to them that ſpoke not immediately by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in that when I had diſcourſe with him concerning perfect perfection, at the Bull and Mouth, he ſaid I was a liar to ſay he owned it; then <hi>I</hi> proved it from his own writings, as that he ſaid, they that ſay they have faith, and their life is not the life of Chriſt, and them that ſay they have faith, &amp; yet they cannot be ſaved from their ſins but in part in this world, them &amp; their faith I deny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which he hypocritically ſaid, that I was a lyer to ſay that he owned it in himſelf, though he diſowned it in others. And when I had objected any thing againſt what he ſaid, he would deny it ſo ſoon as

he had ſpoke it: which to convince the people of his lying deceits, I deſired them that ſtood by me, to Remember that he ſaid, All that are in the world are of the world, in direct oppoſition to that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. I pray not holy father that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world, but preſerve them from the evil of the world; which I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed him with: for which he called me lyer; for he ſaid, he ſaid not ſo: I then deſired them that heard him to teſtifie to the truth, againſt the lyer and his deceit; which they did: but his fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impudence was ſuch, that he ſaid, ſhould a thouſand ſay ſo, they were all lyers: with much more to the like effect.</p>

               <p>A Friend of mine being deſirous to be reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a doubt, as, Whether that which was reported of that Heretical Sect were more then they erred in, or leſs then they erroneouſly maintained contrary to the Truth; he went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Meeting within Alderſgate: where he had no ſooner entered that Synagogue of Satan, but the then-ſpeaker (namely, <hi>George Fox</hi>) cried out, (but on what occaſion, he knoweth not) <hi>Quakers, Quakes, Earth's above God,</hi> in the open houſe, before hundreds then preſent. At which my friend wondered: and preſſing forwards a little into the multitude, he ſaw ſome diſputing upon the ſame words: who demanding what was the matter, one anſwered, that <hi>George Fox</hi> ſaid <hi>Earth is above God</hi>; and here is one ſaith, that whatſoever <hi>George Fox</hi> ſhould or did ſay, he would maintain: (pointing to a young man then ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by) to whom my friend replyed, he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken a harder task then he was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: for God was the Creator of the earth, and all things elſe; and therefore above the earth, and not the earth above him that created it, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the workman is above his work: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

an Artificer ſhall by Art compoſe any thing that is never ſo excellent, yet it can claim no equality with the maker, in regard that what is excellent in it, is the makers excellency, and not its own: for, deſtroy the work, and the workman can make the like; but deſtroy the workman with the work, and both periſh. To which he replied, He did not mean the earth under our feet, but earthly ſin in man. To which my friend replyed, that now his blaſphemy was worſe then it was before: for take the earth ſimply in it ſelf, it hath no prejudice towards God; but ſin is that which ſeeks Gods deſtruction, and therefore he was not to be converſed with, being of ſo diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical an opinion.</p>
