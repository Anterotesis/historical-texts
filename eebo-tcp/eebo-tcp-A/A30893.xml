            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO The Excellent and Elegant SPEECH MADE BY Sir Thomas Player, The Worthy Chamberlain of <hi>London,</hi> To the Right Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> the Lord Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On Friday the 12th of <hi>September,</hi> 1679. <hi>By</hi> H.

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot but wonder at the manner as well as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of Sir <hi>T.P.</hi> his Diſcourſe. As to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I ſuppoſe he might have inform'd your Lordſhip and the Court of Aldermen of any danger the Citie were in, upon any account whatſoever, without bringing an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons at his heels. I muſt take the boldneſs to tell him, that it lookt more like a tumultuous number of Apprentices doing execution upon Bawdie-houſes, than any ſolid conſiderate way of adviſing good for the Citie or Kingdom. But I ſuppoſe the great Policie of that, might have Three Conſiderations: one, to ſhew that he is able to lead up his men: another, that he is able to make an excellent Speech: or thirdly, that he, for his great zeal and love to the Citie and Nation, was ſollicited by thoſe perſons, out of their great fears and apprehenſions of dangers partly created by himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98264:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 5 -->I am very ſorry that a Gentleman ſhould have given occaſion for any Citizen to have ſaid ſo much: but any thing concerning his Highneſs had been received better from another hand than his, becauſe of the known Grudge.</p>
            <p>Next, as to the ſubject matter, he ſeems to be very much offended at the Citie's being Libell'd in the <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer,</hi> by ſaying that the Citie ſhould ſend to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Highneſs his return: As if it were ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſtain to the reputation of the Citie, never to be deleted! I wonder it was never taken notice of before. Had we congratulated him now, it had not been the firſt time. When he return'd from Sea, where he hazarded his life for the maintaining of our Trade, (which we are the gainers by) and had been in the heat of fight, where ſeveral Noble-men were killed about him, we could then congratulate him, as alſo did the Nation with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. He did not want Honour or Preferment, to do this for us. But we might have congratulated him, as he hath condeſcended to be a Member of us.</p>
            <p>If his Highneſs had ſo much malice in him as to neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate us to be upon our Guards in the nature propoſed, ſurely he would never have ventur'd himſelf as a private Sea-man, for our ſervice.</p>
            <p>Neither can I conceive any ſuch great danger of our Religion, ſince his Majeſtie is living, and well (God be thanked.) His Highneſs his Title may never happen. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Aſſembly of Parliament, and our Members there, will take care of us in that point.</p>
            <p>We ſpeak well of our King generally, although I am afraid there be ſome amongſt us that are ſorry they can't ſpeak otherwiſe, to further their deſignes of enſlaving us under a parcel of Factious and Ambitious fellows. And I hope there be yet perſons ſufficient amongſt us (upon diſcovery of any ſuch deſignes) to correct any ſort of Faction againſt the King, Laws, and Eſtabliſhed Government, whether Popiſh, or any other predominant

               <!-- PDF PAGE 5 -->
among us: for neither the one nor the other (I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured) conſiſt with the Freedom of the Subject.</p>
            <p>We cry out of Arbitrary Government, and I know not what beſides, with which the Vulgar are amuſed: whilſt we in our Government in the Citie are the moſt guilty of Arbitrarineſs in the execution of the Laws that we be Judges of, of any body elſe. For how many Thouſand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> come into our Purſes by a Knack of chuſing Sheriffs, in making choice of perſons whoſe occaſions we know will not permit them to ſerve that Office; and then, to excuſe them, we muſt have Four or five hundred pound apiece? with many ſuchlike Devic<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. And how many young Citizens have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by moneys paid for coming on of our Liveries; a Tax more conſiderable than twenty Publique Taxes for the ſupport of the Government? Theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great number more, we have and ſhall finde will leſſen our Trade and Intereſt; elſe would not our houſes ſtand unlet, and our ſhops be uncuſtom'd.</p>
            <p>When the King had thanked us for our Care in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Militia,</hi> and making the Citie a Gariſon, for the preſervation of his perſon; His Majeſtie told us he would take care of himſelf, yet this would not make us lay down our Arms. Nor do I know by what Law the Lieutenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie there can make us keep them up. 'Tis true, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancie themſelves, or we that are the principal men, value not the Charge, being little to us, in compariſon of what it is to the poor Trades-men, who had more need be minding their buſineſs, than they or their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſo employed, to the debauchery of the youth of the Citie. And many of thoſe mean perſons that are forced to be at this intolerable charge, will be fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to give aſſiſtance in any new Rebellion.</p>
            <p>And if you pleaſe to peruſe the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes for ſetling the <hi>Militia,</hi>

               </note> you'll finde there how our Trained Bands are to be marſhal'd: That in caſe of Invaſion or Inſurrection, every Souldier is to be

provided of one Months pay; but no perſon to be charged further, until the ſaid Months pay be reimburſed him. And in times of peace, the General Muſter and Exerciſe of Regiments not to be above once a year. That the Training and Exerciſing ſingle Companies be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four times a year, unleſs upon ſpecial Direction by the King or Privie Council; and the ſame not to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue above two days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Acts were made with abundance of Conſideration for the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that the King ſhould not lay any extraordinary bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon our eſtates, upon any pretence whatſoever. And I wonder how it hath been ſubmitted unto by our pretence of Authority ſo long, being abſolutely againſt Law.</p>
            <p>It's impoſſible for us to thrive in the Citie, whilſt we amuſe our ſelves with theſe kinde of Fears. Let us truſt God and the King with the Government: let's mend our ſelves at home, and endeavour to encourage and increaſe the Trade of the Citie. When the King or Government is in danger, we ſhall hear of it time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: or if the King hath a minde to make us of his Privie Council, he knows his own time for it. Certainly the King hath more to loſe than any of us.</p>
            <p>I muſt refer it to your Lordſhips conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to take notice of this <hi>Intelligencer</hi> as a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller or not; and alſo whether there be occaſion for any Guards at all, for the conſiderations aforeſaid.</p>
