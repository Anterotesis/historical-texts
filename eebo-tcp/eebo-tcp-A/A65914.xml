            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am commanded by the Houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> to preſent unto your Lordſhips a Vote which hath paſſed that Houſe upon ſome propoſitions made unto them, for the ſpeedy, and effectuall reducing of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland:</hi> I deſire the Vote may be read, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I ſhall offer a few Reaſons to invite your Lordſhips conſent unto it.</p>
            <p>After the Vote read,</p>
            <p>My Lords,</p>
            <p>You obſerve three Motives for the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> to paſſe this Vote.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Reducing of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The reducing of that Kingdom at this time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not only the Civil Power, but the exiſtence of our Religion. Their former Rebellions have been
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96610:3"/>
only conflicts with Soveraignty, to withſtand the ſubjection to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> the preſent revolts goes to the extirpation of our Nation and Religion amongſt them. They have falſely ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized the Piety and Honour of His Majeſtie, and of the Queen; and yet pretend loyalty, and would cover their wickedneſſe with the cloak of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>It is too evident, they intend not only to ſhake of the Government of <hi>England</hi> over them, but to blot out the name of the Engliſh, and Proteſtants, and if their ſtrength can equall their malice, and ſuffice to tranſport them hither, they will ſtain this Land with the bloud of Proteſtants, as they have already with moſt barbarous cruolties taken away the lives of many thouſands of our poor Brethren in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.The queſtion is not now, Whether Engliſh or Iriſh ſhall govern; but whether the Proteſtant, or the Popiſh Religion ſhall be eſtabliſhed, and which of them ſhall be ruined. The very life and ſoul of our Religion lyes now at ſtake, and no good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant but will readily lay down his own life and fortunes, to ſuccour and maintain it. Theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions tend to that good end, and there can be no greater motive to entertain them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The greatneſſe and profit of His Majeſty is ſo much concerned herein, That as the loſſe of that large and fertile Iland, would cut off a third part of His Majeſties Dominions; ſo a through reduction of it would eſtabliſh the Kings throne which hath been totterring there above 400. years, and would much advantage the greatneſſe and profit of His Majeſty.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96610:3"/>
3. The eaſe of the people of <hi>England,</hi> your Lordſhips will readily condiſcend unto, when you ſhall be pleaſed to remember the great and heavy payments they have lately undergone. I omit thoſe illegall ones before the Parliament, where the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a puniſhment for ſubmiſſion to unlawfull taxes; but thoſe neceſſary great levies raiſed by Authority of this Parliament; and whereby the happy ſettlement of the peace and union of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been wrought, Theſe with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generall decay of trade have brought the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very low; and we finde ſome in the Country more apprehenſive, what ſummes go out of their Purſes, then what honor or liberty they gain therby.</p>
            <p>Our Stories acquaint us with ſad effects of great and often taxes; If theſe propoſitions ſucceed, thoſe dangers will be prevented; the inferiour and poorer ſort eaſed, and ſufficient to do the work, raiſed voluntarily by ſuch as are beſt able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpare it, By many liberall and cheerfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, whom God will bleſſe for it. It will be a pleaſing ſacrifice to him, and an immortall honor to thoſe moſt worthy perſons, who ſhall bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls to this building, And this not without ſtrong hopes of advantage to themſelves.</p>
            <p>When profit ſhall be an ingredient with Charity and Loyalty; the plaiſter will be the ſooner, and better tempered, that may cure the wounds of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And when Charity doth relieve our poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Brethren; Loyalty to our King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to preſerve the honour and profit of both, And Piety to God, and our own ſouls are the Motives.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96610:4"/>
I doubt not of the cheerfull concurrence of your Lordſhips with the Houſe of Commons, to embrace all good and honorable means, for the effecting this great work of reducing that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I come now to the propoſitions. The firſt is, That two Millions and a half of Acres may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to ſuch as ſhall disburſe moneyes for this ſervice. The propoſitions may ſeem at the firſt very large and difficult; but when it ſhall appear by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of men of great experience of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and upon ſolid grounds, that the content of this Iſland is above 15 Millions of Acres of profitable Lands; whereof 5 Millions of Acres are eſtimated to belong to the Kings good Subjects there: out of the ten Millions remaining, they ask but two Millions and a half; and yet three parts of four of that Kingdom, are out in Rebellion.</p>
            <p>This may make the propoſitions ſeem neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate nor difficult.</p>
            <p>The proportions to be aſſigned to the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, will be found equall and reaſonable.</p>
            <p>The ſecond propoſition is in advancing the Kings Revenue by reſerved Rents to him, out of theſe two Millions, and half Acres. It is well known, the Revenue of that Kingdom, out of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and Court of Wards there, never exceeded forty three thouſand pounds <hi>per an.</hi> beſides the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, which never yeelded much, and altogether would ſcarce defray the charge of that Crown. And ſome late pretences of improving the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue there, appear to your Lordſhips upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be very ſmall, and all that was advanced,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96610:4"/>
came by unworthy Monopolies, and to private hands. By theſe propoſitions, the Rent to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, will amount to between thirty and forty thouſand pounds <hi>per an.</hi> beſides ſeven Millions and a half, of Acres left to be diſpoſed, and what even the Cuſtomes have been at the higheſt, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally trebled unto his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The other propoſitions are for the ſpeedy pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch ſummes as ſhall be raiſed, whereby the Warre may proceed with a full ſtrength and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. <hi>Livy</hi> obſerves, that the <hi>Romans</hi> made their Warres great and ſhort. Thoſe with the <hi>Latines, Samnites,</hi> and <hi>Tuskanies,</hi> concluded in ſhort times; one in ſix dayes, another in ten dayes, and a third in twenty dayes ſpace. I mention not this with hopes to be imitated, but to ſhew how much their actions which bear a great ſway in the world, confirm this truely, That nothing in War can be more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to a State, that to bring it to a ſpeedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>I cannot remember, without much grief of heart, the unhappy delayes in the relief of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but thoſe obſtructions are now in a good meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and our hopes raiſed, that by a bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of his Royall Majeſty, your Lordſhips, and the Houſe of Commons, the great work of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed, will be finiſhed. A narrow and thrifty courſe in this buſineſſe, will prove after the old Proverb, but penny wiſedome. To prolong time, would give advantage to neighbouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whoſe particular intereſt may, perhaps, at this time, engage them; otherwiſe ſtand at gaze, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96610:5"/>
are full of jealouſies of theſe proceedings, to take the firſt occaſion to oppoſe us, and to ſupport our enemies.</p>
            <p>I ſhall trouble your Lordſhip no further, but with a ſhort obſerva<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
