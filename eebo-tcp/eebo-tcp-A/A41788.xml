            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Queſtion, <hi>Whether there be any God?</hi> is ſo wicked and abſurd, that none but Fools will admit the Debate.</p>
            <p>For he that ſhall once ſay in his Heart there is no God, the next thought in him may be, that he himſelf is God, ſeeing there is no Creature known to us above Man. The Heavens, Earth, and Seas, do all ſerve Him.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing He made not himſelf, nor any of theſe things; it muſt be, that He that made Man, and all things that are made, is above all, and to be obeyed in Love above all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Remember therefore your Creator in the days of your Youth, and dedicate the prime of your ſtrength to his Service. Content your ſelves with ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, as is held forth to you in his Holy Word and Mighty Works, and as ſhall be wrought in you by the Spirit of Grace, as you adhere to Him.</p>

               <p>No, <hi>Adam</hi> (the Man we ſpeak of) did break the Covenant of his God, and brought himſelf and all his Poſterity under the Sentence of Death, and the Curſe or Condemnation of the Almighty. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18.</p>

               <p>The Mercy of God did intervene or come in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, and the Sentence due to him for Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. by which he was put into a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from his dreadful Fall.</p>

               <p>To love his merciful Lord, and to ſerve him, by obeying him in <hi>Duties of Religion,</hi> and to walk humbly with his God, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 8.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>The word Religion ſignifies, an holy Tye, Bond or Covenant, by which all Men ſtand obliged to love and ſerve Almighty God, their Creator and Preſerver. <hi>To you, O Men, I call, and my Voice is to the Sons of</hi> Adam, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 4. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O</hi> Adam <hi>(or Man) what is good—to do juſtly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God,</hi> Mich. 6. 8.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Was <hi>Adam</hi> left in a capacity to do this after the Fall?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>By the free Grace of God, he and all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are left or put into a capacity to obey God, ſo as he will accept them, when and in what he requires their Obedience, elſe they could not ſin by not obeying him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 14, 15, 16.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Surely, if God Almighty do indeed require the Duties of Religion of all Men, then there is undoubtedly a poſſibility of Salvation for all Men, <hi>this gives me ſome hope.</hi> I beſeech you therefore make this plain, that God requires the Duties of Religion of all Men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p n="1">1. Undoubtedly all Men are concern'd in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, as their chief Buſineſs; otherwiſe they ſhould not much excel the Beaſts of the Field.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Knowledg which Man hath, or the Reaſon which God hath given him, being only imployed about earthly things, would only make him the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Animal: and yet ſome Animals, or ſenſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, would ſeem to outdo him in ſome things; and particularly the Hony-Bee, both in the gathering of Hony, and preſerving of it; and in the Government
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107509:5"/>
ſhe maintains in her Common-wealth, to the due imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof few Monarchs could arrive, if any at all have done it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whilſt Man may ſuppoſe himſelf the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Creature in the Gift of Invention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet when the admirable quickneſs of Senſe, Agility of Body, with the Foreknowledg which is in many of them of Times and Seaſons, and the neceſſary Proviſions which they make for themſelves accordingly, without any to inſtruct or exhort them thereunto, is duly conſidered, it may much abate the Pride of Man, who indeed has learned much more of them, than they of him; and yet they can and do learn many things of Man alſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee plainly, without God to be our God, and Religion to be our Buſineſs, we are as the Beaſts of the Field. I deſire a further Demonſtration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>If all Men be not concern'd to mind the Buſineſs of Religion, with hope of the acceptance of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they are expoſed to as ill a condition as the Devils, or fallen Angels. For it's certain, Man is a very ſinful Creature as well as the fallen Angels; and if he muſt be <hi>irreligious</hi> too, <hi>(as he muſt be ſo, if God require it not of him)</hi> then God hath made him only a fit Companion for the Devils, of whom it is certain God requires no Duties of Religion.</p>
               <p>We ſee then, the chief, and indeed the only thing that is truly valuable in fallen Man, above all Creatures here below, and above the fallen Angels, is this, That he is capable of the Mercy and Knowledg of God, and by the Mercy of God made capable to ſerve God, in ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious walking with God, and a dependance upon him as therein to pleaſe God, and to find acceptance with him.</p>

               <p>It is true indeed, this is the ſum or main Body of true Religion, but this is mentioned in the Scripture; how do's it appear that the Nations know any thing of it who have not the Scripture?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>It appears from the very places which I have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe the Prophets and Apoſtles here, do not ſpeak of Religion as then newly inſtituted, but as that which had been of long continuance, even in every Nation. And the Scripture further ſhews, that the Way of God had been made known to all Fleſh in the old World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 11, 12. elſe they could not have corrupted it. This way of God was again renewed to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9. 8, 9, 12. for an everlaſting Religion to the whole World. All are bound to take notice of, and to depend upon the Lord as a gracious God, and to do juſtly, love Mercy, and walk humbly with their God.</p>

               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>But can Man pleaſe God, under any of theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of himſelf, without an Aſſiſtant?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>No, he cannot, therefore God provided an Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107509:6"/>
the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World, to take away the Sin of the World, <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. whom he placed as a Mediator between himſelf and Man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>But how ſhall any Man have benefit by this Lamb of God, or this Mediator, who have not the means to know him by his Name, nor his Offices?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p n="1">1. Many who never had the means to know the Mediator particularly and diſtinctly, muſt yet have Salvation by him, or elſe none of the Infant-race, dying ſuch, could be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All that know the Lord to be ſuch a <hi>God as do's exerciſe loving-Kindneſs, Judgment, and Righteouſneſs in the Earth,</hi> do know this Mediator virtually, and believing on the Lord as ſuch, do know him ſavingly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All the common Providences of God are given chiefly for this end, to direct Men to ſeek the Lord; becauſe it appears from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they have a capacity to feel after him, and to find him. For he is not far from every one of them, becauſe in him they live, move, and have their being.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And as to their ignorance in things, which they had not particular and diſtinct means to know; 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, The Lord winked at it; that is, he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly paſſed by their weakneſs, and would not exact the utmoſt Farthing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 26, 27, 30. See and conſider <hi>Job</hi> 37. 23, 24.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But when Men grow preſumptuous and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and give the Honour of the incorruptible God to created things, or things of their own deviſing, they thus unmanning themſelves, and forgetting that they are the Off-ſpring of God, then, and not till then, do's God withdraw his Love from them, and ſuffers them to be filled with their own ways, as is moſt clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 2 Chapters, and alſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 22, 23, 24.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:107509:7"/>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee it is not good for us to pride up our ſelves againſt the Nations, which have not the Goſpel as we have. But it ſeems to be an Argument that God loves us more than he loves them, becauſe he gives us greater means of Grace than he gives them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Behold, God is mighty, and deſpiſeth not any.</hi> Let this Truth take place in thy Heart, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 5. And then admit the Love of God to be much more to ſome than to all, yet it's ſufficient to all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet I muſt inform thee, that when we conſider Mankind <hi>as they are all the Off-ſpring of God,</hi> and as he has <hi>appointed the bounds of their Habitations, that you ſhould ſeek the Lord.</hi> Then like as we may not conclude, that a good Father do's therefore not love his youngeſt Son, ſo well as he loves his eldeſt Son, becauſe he gives him but half ſo much of his Eſtate, as he gives the eldeſt Son. So neither may we conlude that God loves <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> better then he loves <hi>America,</hi> becauſe we have greater means of Goſpel-Light than they. He that improves one Talent well, ſhall be accepted as well as he that improves five.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I am well ſatisfied in this enquiry, I ſee that God expects the Duties of Religion of all Men, according to what Light and Knowledg he hath given them, in all Ages and Nations, And that through the Mercy and juſtice of God, whoever worſhips God, and doth his Will, according to the manifeſtation which he has given Men of his Will, ſhall be accepted of God.</p>
               <p>I pray now inform me concerning the true way of God's Worſhip, or the true Chriſtian Religion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Goſpel; Leſt whilſt we ſeem concern'd for others, we be found to neglect our own Salvation.</p>
               <p>And, firſt, I defire to be inſtructed, whether the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Church,</hi> muſt be our guide in theſe Soul-concernments?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>There is no doubt but theſe three agree in one Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107509:7"/>
For the Scriptures are the Teſtimony of the other two: Being indeed the Inſpirations of the Holy Spirit, and the Prophets or Miniſters of the Church of God, receive thoſe Inſpirations, and gave them forth in Writings, which Writings are the Holy Scriptures.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Is this Church always to be receiving and giving forth Inſpirations of this kind?</p>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>No, in no wiſe, for ſo every Age might Produce a new Bible. Wherefore that our Rules might not be too burthenſom, it pleaſed God, that but few of the things which Jeſus himſelf did, ſhould be written, and that we believing according to the Scripture might have Life, <hi>John</hi> 20. 31. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>That ye may be mindfull of the words which were ſpoken before by the Prophets, and of the Commandment of us the Apoſtles of the Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> If any <hi>come unto you and bring not this Doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him not into your houſe.</hi> 2 John <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Seeing ſome pretend to the infallible conduct of the Holy Spirit in whatſoever they Decree in Council; and others think they preach by infallible Inſpiration.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

If any deny the truth of thoſe Records, they only deprive themſelves of the Authority of all Records that are extant in the World of former Ages: for the truth of the Divine Scripture has the higheſt Teſtimony of all other; and if theſe fall, all muſt fall with them.</p>

                  <p>That God gives Repentance potentially, is true; Jer. 31. 18, 19. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned: ſurely when I was turned, I repented.</hi> Yet this Power is not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible, but it is ſufficient, either to effect Repentance, or to leave the Sinner without excuſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1.</p>

                  <p>Yes, there are three diſtinct Baptiſms pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Chriſtian Man. The firſt is <hi>the Baptiſm of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for remiſſion of Sins;</hi> This was of divine Original, it came from Heaven, and was firſt adminiſtred by that great Prophet and Meſſenger of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 25.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, is the pouring out of the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and in the ordinary way of its reception, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of Sins. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 5. &amp; 2. 38. &amp; 19. 5, 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
                  <p>The third is the Afflictions which attend Chriſtians for the Goſpel's-ſake, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 50. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 22.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It cannot be a violent laying on of Hands [as ſome prophanely imagine]; our Saviour taught none to lay violent Hands upon his People; and yet the very act of Laying on of Hands here, is called a Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>It muſt be a Service which concerns all Chriſtians <hi>equally,</hi> as they are <hi>Babes in Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it is called Milk for Babes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13. a beginning Principle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. and placed among thoſe other five Principles, which do equally concern all Chriſtians to know, as you are Babes in Chriſt.

                  <p>Theſe things are very plain to ſuch as are willing to be informed. I deſire now to be informed, what is the reaſon why ſo very few do receive theſe Principles, in the native purity and ſimplicity of them, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally theſe two practical ones, Baptiſm, and Laying on of Hands?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p n="1">1. One great reaſon is, becauſe a falſe Baptiſm, without Repentance and Faith, and diſpenſed in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing way: and likewiſe an outwardly Glorious and Ceremonious Biſhoping, has obtruded upon very many, by which they are blinded, that they cannot, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, that they will not ſee theſe Truths, than which ſcarce any are more plain and eaſy to be ſeen.</p>

the Great pride of Man's Heart, ordained theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, to try them, whether they would be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his Commands, how low ſo ever, or whether they would contemn the very foot-ſteps of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the only Son of God. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> led the way in this Rebellion againſt God's Counſel, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29. and many follow them, <hi>rejecting the Counſel of God, againſt all Power in Heaven and Earth,</hi> Matth. 28. 17, 18. being not baptiſed <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                  <p>I confeſs we have the foot-ſteps of Chriſt moſt plain in the caſe of Baptiſm; but have we any thing from him to favour us in the Laying on of Hands with Prayer for the promiſed Spirit?</p>

                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes verily, we have as much from his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample herein, as the caſe could bear; for Jeſus, as ſoon as he was baptiſed, <hi>prayed, and the Heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcended in the bodily ſhape of a Dove upon him; and a Voice came from Heaven which ſaid, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The things which from hence favour our Cauſe in hand, are theſe. 1. Chriſt did not ask this ſealing and confirming Spirit, till after he was baptiſed: but as ſoon as baptiſed, he prays, and receives the Holy Ghoſt. Here is nothing wanting but the Adminiſtrator, which could not be found among Men; for who durſt pray for Chriſt that he might receive the Spirit? I could object upon others, that in Chriſt's Baptiſm Repentance was wanting. Yet ſure his Baptiſm is very precedential to us, it coming as near us as the caſe would bear; and ſo likewiſe he comes as near us in his waiting for the Spirit after Baptiſm as the caſe will bear.</p>

                  <p>Finally, We can none of us perfectly underſtand how hainous the Sins of thoſe are, who reject the Grace of God in the Gift of his Son; and therefore we are not able to meaſure what Puniſhment is proportionable to ſuch Iniquity.</p>

                  <p>That I ſhall endeavour to do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven.</hi> Chriſt teacheth us, to put on Charity when we pray; that is, to include our Brethren with our ſelves. When we pray unto God, we muſt alſo pray in Faith, believing that he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 6, 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Which art in Heaven.</hi> Here we profeſs that our God is in Heaven, as the place of his ſpecial Reſidence. Hence our Saviour in Prayer did frequently lift up his Eyes to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi> We are to make the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory of the Name of God, the deareſt to us of all things; thus <hi>Moſes</hi> was more willing to die, than that the Name of God ſhould be reproached.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> The Kingdom of God is to be conſidered, with reſpect to his Church in this World. And then we pray, in this Petition, for it's growth in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107509:28"/>
Number and in Grace. We ought alſo to hope for the coming of Chriſt's Kingdom in the Glory of it, and by Prayer to ſeek for it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Thy Will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven;</hi> It is evident here, that by Heaven is meant Heaven in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſence, the place which is oppoſed to the Earth. And in all Prayer we muſt ſubmit our will to the Will of God, and to beware that we do not act contrary to his Will, and ſo contradict our own Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Give us this Day our Daily Bread.</hi> Here we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that our common Mercies are all in the Hand of God to give them, or to withhold them. We are alſo taught to live by Faith in theſe Enjoyments, and not only by ſome, becauſe God has promiſed that all theſe things ſhall be added to thoſe that ſeek him rightly.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>And forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors.</hi> We learn here that the beſt of God's Children are liable to offend, they never eſteemed themſelves pe<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> without all Imperfection: and they that offend, must pray, and that Daily too, for remiſſion of Sin; this teacheth us to humble our ſelves daily before God. We ſee here alſo a neceſſity of being merciful to ſuch as offend us, and to forgive with readineſs all that treſpaſs againſt us; ſpecially if they do turn, ſaying, I repent. Prayer for Mercy, without Charity in him that prayeth, will not be accepted of God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>And lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from Evil.</hi> Here we profeſs to believe, that God has the diſpoſing of all Tryals which do attend us in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal State; And here we pray that he will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able, but that he will with the Temptation make a way to eſcape, that we may be able to bear it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory for ever.</hi> Here we profeſs our Faith in Prayer. 1. <hi>That the Kingdom is His;</hi> and that therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107509:28"/>
on him for the proſperity of it, and for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious coming of his Kingdom. 2. <hi>That all Power is his,</hi> and therefore we depend on him to provide for, and to deliver us, according to his Will. 3. <hi>That the glory is everlaſtingly due to God;</hi> and therefore we aſcribe it, as the Church did, <hi>not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory;</hi> this is alſo to praiſe God in Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Amen.</hi> This word being truly expreſſed, ſhews the full aſſent of the mind to the whole of the Prayer, whether expreſs'd by our ſelves in private, or by ſuch as join ſincerely with us in publick.</p>

                  <p>Obſerve theſe Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Know that no Man of true Chriſtian Modeſty, will pretend to be immediatly ſent by a Commiſſion from Heaven. And yet,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God muſt make Men Miniſters by the Gifts of his Grace, illuminating their Underſtanding, and capacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to ſpeak to edification, before the Church can make them Miniſters.</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:107509:29"/>
3. No unbaptiſed Perſon, let his Parts be what they will, has any liberty to be a Miniſter in the Church of God, becauſe he is not yet imbodied with the Church of God, nor can be without Baptiſm. And here remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our dear Saviour would not preach one Sermon till he was baptiſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Men are competently gifted and qualified in point of Life, being Church-members, they are to be choſen by the Church, and ordain'd to the Work of the Miniſtery, by Prayer and Faſting, with the Laying on of Hands of the Meſſengers and Elders of the Church, for ſuch Offices as the Church finds them moſt capable.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is a liberty in the Church, for Brethren which are capable, to exerciſe their Gifts to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Body; and Men thus called, or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Church, thou mayeſt lawfully hear.
