            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

both under the Reign of her Father, and that of her Sister, from her Mortal Enemies, the Blood-thirsty <hi>Papists;</hi> and how, after that, it had pleased God to shield her from all their Execrable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Attempts.

            <p>
               <hi>ELizabeth,</hi> the youngest Daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, was born at <hi>Greenwich</hi> on the 7th day of <hi>September</hi> 1533. Her Mother being Queen <hi>Anne Bollen,</hi> the Eldest Daughter of <hi>Thomas Bollen</hi> Earl of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, one of the Daughters of <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and Earl Marshal of <hi>England.</hi> Now <hi>Anne Bollen,</hi> in her tender years, attending on <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Queen, to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> was, after that Queens return, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Retinue of the Dutchess of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52243:6"/>
               <hi>Alanzon,</hi> where she got, in perfection, both the <hi>French</hi> Language and Air. She so abounded in all the Gifts of Nature, that she became the most celebrated Beauty of that Court; and returned to her own Countrey, with all those Advantages that the <hi>French</hi> Breeding can add to an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Beauty. Whereupon, being admitted amongst the Queen's Maids of Honour, at the Age of two and twenty years, King <hi>Henry</hi> being thirty eight years old, and overcome with the Excellency of her Charms, and the gracefulness of her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, endeavoured to make her his Wife, in hopes of Issue Male.</p>
            <p>Now some time before this Ladie's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>France,</hi> King <hi>Henry,</hi> being, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seventeen years Marriage, something disgusted with the Bigottry, Reservedness, and <hi>Spanish</hi> Gravity of Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> he became very susceptible of the Doubts and Scruples that were insinuated by the Ministers of the <hi>French</hi> King, concerning the lawfulness of his Marriage with Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> his Brother <hi>Arthur's</hi> Wife. The like being started by those of the Emperour, concerning the Legitimation of the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and all these foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52243:6"/>
by Cardinal <hi>Wolsey;</hi> who being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of the Popedom, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> both which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had flattered his hopes with; He resolved to promote a Divorce, for the better effecting his Revenge on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; and the Measures he had taken with <hi>France,</hi> by proposing a Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Henry</hi> and that King's Sister, and concluding a League with the <hi>French,</hi> when they were at the lowest Ebb of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. In consideration of which, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> remitted unto them a Debt of 500000 Crowns, partly accruing by some former Contracts, and partly for the payment of the Forfeiture incurred by <hi>Charles</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, with which the <hi>French</hi> King had charged himself by the Capitulations.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the King maketh it his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to the Pope, that he would send Delegates into <hi>England,</hi> to hear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine this Business: To which end, the Pope appointed the Cardinals, <hi>Campeius</hi> and <hi>Wolsey:</hi> But the Pope did privily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a Bull to <hi>Campeius,</hi> wherein, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be favourable to the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, he granted all things, in case it should happen that the Marriage contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52243:7"/>
with Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> were declared Null, and no Marriage. But this Bull was either to be concealed or published, according to the Success of the Emperour's Affairs in <hi>Italy.</hi> Now were Questions every where started and handled, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were allowed of by God's Law for the Brother to take to Wife the Brother's Widow? and if this were forbidden by the Law of God, whether it might not be made Lawful by the Pope's Dispensation? But when several of the Universities of Christendom, as likewise many of the Learned men of that Age, had asserted such a Marriage to be repugnant to the Sacred Laws of both Testaments, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Pope's Dispensation, the King became daily more charmed with <hi>Anne Bollen;</hi> which being discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Wolsey,</hi> it not only cooled his Zeal in promoting the Divorce, but made him endeavour, and procure of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> not to confirm the Judgments of the Universities; by reason that <hi>Anne Bollen,</hi> being extremely addicted to the Doctrine of the Protestants, had conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great Aversion against him for his Pride and Ambition. Whereupon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52243:7"/>
Pope, notwithstanding the Supplications of the Prelates, Nobility, and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> for the confirming, by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Authority, what the two Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of this Land, that of <hi>Paris,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, as well as divers Just and Learned men, had affirmed to be true, and were ready to maintain and defend, as well by Word as Writing; I say, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding such manifold Assertions, the Cause being prolonged and delayed, both at <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> without Consideration had to the King's having defended the Apostolick See by his Sword, Pen, Word and Authority, the King grows exasperated at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and resolves to make way through all Obstacles which might stand betwixt Him and the accomplishment of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; wherefore he first sends back <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> an Alien born, then caused <hi>Wolsey</hi> to be Indicted and Attainted in a <hi>

Thus, the King, being grown more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in the Equity and Justice of his Cause, by the Determinations of most of the Universities abroad, and his own Clergy at home, and wanting no Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the <hi>French</hi> King, for the promoting of his business; he advanced <hi>Anne Bollen</hi> to the Honour of Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> took her to Wife, and gave Order for her being inaugurated Queen.</p>

dissatisfied, to see the Wealth of the Land exhausted to so little Advantage; their Ancient Structures demolished, the Blood of the Nobility and others, both Papists and Protestants, promiscuously spilt, and the Countrey incumbred with a <hi>Scottish</hi> War; taking all these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to heart, and being grown extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Corpulent, he died of a Viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Inflammation in his Leg, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Year 1547.</p>

            <p>During these sad Occurrences, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of their own Religion, under a Protestant Mask, they made Use of him for the bringing about their Ends, by sowing Distraction in the Nation, by setting the Protector and his Brother <hi>Thomas Seymour</hi> at variance, which he effected, through a Female Emulation between the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> the Protector's Wife, and the Queen Dowager, the Wife of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> And amongst other Articles of High Treason that were laid to <hi>Thomas</hi> his charge, was that of intending to seize the King, and of taking the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> the King's Sister, to Wife. But she, being wholly ignorant of this business, and freeing her self from all suspicion, and advancing towards a mature Age, she was not onely extremely beloved by the King her Brother (who never call'd her by any other Name than his sweet Sister Temperance) but likewise by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the whole Nation in general.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward,</hi> by the Practices of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> having declared the Lady <hi>Jane Gray</hi> for his Successor, she was immediately after his Decease publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaimed Queen of <hi>England:</hi> and for the maintaining her in that Degree, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52243:12"/>
were put forward; as first, the Invalidity of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Mother's Marriage; both being made void by Legal Sentences of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, and those Divorces ratified by Acts of Parliament, which Acts of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s and Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, were never duely repealed: (Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that the King their Father had by the same Act declared, that they should succeed in order after <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, in case he failed of Issue.) Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It was pretended, that these two Sisters, being but of half Blood to the Deceased King, (admitting them to have been born in lawful Wedlock) were not in a capacity by the Common Law to be Heirs unto him, or to succeed in any part of that Inheritance, which came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto him by his Father. Now the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Jane</hi>'s Mother, being the Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> Daughter, and one of the Co-heirs of <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> the late Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> by <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife, Queen Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>France,</hi> and youngest Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, Grand-father to King <hi>Edward,</hi> now deceased: Now, I say, the Lady
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52243:13"/>
               <hi>Frances,</hi> her Mother, might seem both by the Law of Nature and the Right of Succession, to have precedency in Title before her; yet she received no injury, because she was willing to pass by all her personal Claims for the Preferment of her Daughter. It was also given out, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, by his last Will and Testament, conveyed the Title of the Crown to the Lady <hi>Jane Gray:</hi> and moreover, Politick Reasons and Pretexts were used, as that there was an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able danger of reducing this Kingdom under the Vassalage and Servitude of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in case either of the King's two Sisters should marry with a Foreign Prince of that Religion, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of themselves revoke the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Authority, and subject the <hi>English</hi> to a Popish Yoke.</p>
            <p>But, through the extraordinary Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Nobility and Commons had for the Daughters of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, this great Storm was dispersed within the space of twenty dayes, to the fatal End of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Jane:</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> was proclaimed Queen throughout all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52243:13"/>
And at her coming to <hi>London</hi> with an Army, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> met her with five hundred Horse, (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the offers that had been made her by the Duke, of a vast Sum of money, and certain Lands, if she would resign her Title to the Crown) lest she should fail her Sister's, and her own Cause, which was then in hand.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> caused, in the first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that she held, all those Acts to be repealed, that had been made against the Marriage of Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> her Mother, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, and the Marriage was judged to be agreeable to the Laws of God, and to all intents valid and available. The same Form also of Religion, and Service of God, and Administration of the Sacraments, which had been in use at the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, were re-established; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without any acknowledgment or mention at all of the Pope's Authority; notwithstanding all the Efforts of the Queen and Cardinal <hi>Pool:</hi> for the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament were very unwilling to admit and acknowledge the Authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was now shaken off.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52243:14"/>
Neither would they suffer that the Queen should lay down the Title of <hi>Supream Head of the Church of England,</hi> unto which most of the Nobility, Bishops, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, had sworn to <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, his Heirs and Successors. But the Queen was very desirous to lay down this Title, as believing that her Pretensions to the Crown had no better Foundation than the Authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> who had maintained her Cause, after that her father had procured her to be declared Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate. And indeed, at this time, the apprehensions of the <hi>English</hi> were so great of Popery, and of being inslaved by it's means, and by the Match that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with <hi>Phillip,</hi> to the Yoke of <hi>Spain,</hi> as that it caused some to break out into Rebellion, as <hi>Wyat</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the Papists had got their will, by procuring, after much opposition, the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Kingdom, by authority of Parliament, and those Acts to be repealed that had been made against the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, and <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth; yet there being no Issue to be expected from the Queen, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52243:14"/>
she was fourty Years old, Weak and Infirm, they stood in fear of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who had gained the hearts of all the Nation, by her Loyal and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct, being the Admiration of her Age, both for her Beauty, and the Qualities of her Mind, and was so inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable in Study, that before she had attained to the Age of Seventeen Years, she had acquired, to Perfection, both <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and other ancient Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and <hi>French, Italian,</hi> and other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Tongues; and had likewise gained all other Accomplishments that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the composing a Perfect Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. Thus, being looked upon as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Learning and Prudence, as well by Foreigners as the English, the Papists were sensible, how much it was their Interest to remove out of the way, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, who seemed threatning the Fall of their Superstitions here in <hi>England;</hi> they used all their Arts to dispose Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to take away her Life; which the Queen refused to do, notwithstanding they would have perswaded her, that she was obliged to do every thing, though never so unjust, that was requisite and necessary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52243:15"/>
for the promoting and settling the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion. And Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat,</hi> Sir <hi>Peter Carew,</hi> and others, having stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up some Commotions, the Papists, most maliciously, set Rumours on Foot, that the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did countenance, and was privy to, those Tumults, and that she was to be marryed to the Earl of <hi>Devonshire.</hi> Hereupon, they caused her to be put into Prison, and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they would have forced several of the Tumultuaries, by Torture, to have declared her Accessory to their Rising; yet, the Rack was not able to make them wrong her Innocence; and, such as had seemingly accused her, in hopes of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, cleared her at the time of their Execution.</p>
            <p>But, the Papists having got that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess into Prison, they were so far from putting an End to their Persecutions, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding her Innocence, that they used her with all the Barbarity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Insomuch, that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Kings thought it convenient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, by making her great Offers, Promises of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doing all that lay in their Power, in her Behalf. But this did but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52243:15"/>
the more inflame the Rage of her Popish Enemies, who were resolved to take away her Life, either by accusing her of High Treason, or of Heresie; Hereupon, they forced her to hear Divine Service, after their Superstitious manner, and to go likewise to Confession; yet, Cardinal <hi>Pool, Bonner,</hi> and others of the Bishops, were not satisfied with this severe and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Treatment, but declared, that it was requisite she should dye, for the Security of the Catholick Religion; insomuch, that this harsh Usage moved the <hi>Spam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> himself to pitty, and King <hi>Philip,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Husband, interceeded in her Favour, and admiring her extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Virtues, would have marryed her to his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> or, as others say, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed her for himself, maugre the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Principles of Religion. And, for this Reason, he broke off the Proposals that were made for the marrying her to <hi>Emanuel Philibert</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he was not able to gain her for his Son, finding, that the People of <hi>England</hi> would never permit, that the next Heir of the Crown should be sent out of the Kingdom. In the mean time, Queen

               <hi>Mary</hi>'s Hatred daily increasing against her Sister <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> this Lady's Ruine must have been certain, had not it pleased God to divert the thoughts of it, by the War that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against <hi>France,</hi> in favour of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Philip.</hi>

old, was the Choice she made of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, picking out such of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Council, as were well known to be able men, and such as were firm Pursuers of the True Interests of the Nation; adding such others, as might moderate and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them for the Protestant Religion. She likewise caused new Commissions and Instructions to be sent to the several Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors as resided in the Courts of the various Princes and States; but more particularly, her Minister at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> was ordered to represent unto that King, how sensible she was of the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities she had received from him, in the time of her Persecution and Troubles. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions were likewise dispatched to Sir <hi>Edw. Harne,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Agent at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to acquaint the Pope with Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Death, and her succeeding upon the Throne, with a desire that they might mutually receive all good Offices from one another. But, the Pope's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was in the usual rigorous Stile of that Court, <hi>That the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>was held in Fee of the Apostolick See; that she could not succed, being illegitimate; that he could not contradict the Declaration of</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52243:18"/>
Clement <hi>the Seventh, and</hi> Paul <hi>the Third that it was a great Boldness to assume the Name and Government of it, without him yet, being desirous to shew a fatherly Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if she will renounce her Pretensions, and refer her self wholly to his free Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he will do whatsoever may be done with the Honour of the Apostolick See.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Queen having made him this Complement, did not think of having any Answer, nor was she much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when she had. In the mean time, King <hi>Philip,</hi> having had notice of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> his Wife's Death, he caused his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor the Count of <hi>Feria,</hi> to propose a Match between Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and himself, promising to procure a Dispensation from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> These offers put the Queen into great perplexity, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it but an ill return, to reject a Prince who had done her such Kindnesses du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Troubles. And the <hi>French</hi> King was no less concerned, fearing lest this Kingdom, being again united to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> his Dominions must at length have buckled under so great a Power. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he used all his Endeavours to put a Stop to the Dispensation at the Court of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52243:18"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> and to all the other Places that might be made towards this Match else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But he might have spared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self these Troubles; for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> never designed to enter into any such Marriage; well knowing, she would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have acknowledged her self to have been born in unlawful Wedlock; and, likewise considering, that the Marriage of a Woman with her deceased Sister's Husband, is prohibited by Sacred Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as well as the Marriage of a man with his Brother's Widow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unlawful, notwithstanding the Pope's Dispensation: wherefore, she putteth off King <hi>Philip</hi> by degrees, and with all the Civility and Circumstance imaginable. Now many, who were imprisoned upon the Account of Religion, were set at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; at which time, a merry Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Court petitioned her in Favour of the Evangelists, who had been so long imprisoned in a <hi>Latin</hi> Translation, that they might be set at Liberty, and walk abroad as formerly, in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue. To whom she immediately replyed, in this manner, That he should first endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to know the Minds of the Prisoners,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52243:19"/>
who, possibly, desired no such Liberty as was demanded. Now the Queen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly desirous of promoting the Protestant Religion, she consulted with her most trusty Counsellors, how that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion might be established, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish abolished, causing all Dangers to be well poised, that might arise on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the Means and Expedients that might be used for the preventing and avoiding them. Hereupon, she put into the Principal Courts of Judicature, and Offices of Trust, such Persons as were well known to be of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or inclined to it, and did the same in the Commission of the Peace, in every County. The Dangers that might be expected from abroad, were either from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by his Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and exposing the Kingdom to any Invasion; or, from the <hi>French</hi> King, who, in such a Juncture, might have broke off the Treaty of Peace at <hi>Cambray,</hi> and make War upon the <hi>English,</hi> in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> not only as Enemies, but likewise, as they are pleased to call the Protestants as Hereticks, and might have procured <hi>Scotland</hi> to have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52243:19"/>
done the same, being at that time at his Devotion; or from the <hi>Irish,</hi> a People extreamly bigotted to Popery, and always very ready to break out into a Rebellion. Now, as for the Thunder-bolts of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were looked upon as things not at all to be dreaded; but was resolved that in case the <hi>French</hi> made any offers of a Peace, they were to be accepted; if they did not, then offers were to be made to them, by reason that such a Peace would also comprehend <hi>Scotland;</hi> but however to stick close to, and give all manner of Aid and Countenance to those of the Reformed Religion both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> that the Garrisons in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and upon the Borders of <hi>Scotland</hi> should be better manned and fortified, and that the Treaties with the House of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> should be confirmed, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship continued with the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> And now having provided against all Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances that might happen from abroad, she proceeded to do all that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce towards the advancement and setling of the Protestant Religion at home, by ordering that none should be chosen into any Colledges of both Universities,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52243:20"/>
but Protestants; and that all Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Presidents, Heads, and Masters, should be put out and removed, both from thence, and all other Schools of the Land; and for the curbing the rash zeal of both Parties, she caused two Proclamations to be published; by one of which it was commanded, That no man, of what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion soever he was in Points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, should be suffered from thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to preach in publick, but only such as should be licensed by her Authority; and that all such as were so licensed or appointed, should forbear preaching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Point which was matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and might conduce rather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the exasperating, than the calming of mens Passions: Which Proclamation was observed with all the care and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness imaginable. By the other Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it was ordered, That no Man, of what Quality or Degree soever, should presume to alter any thing in the state of Religion, or innovate in any of the Rites and Ceremonies thereunto belonging; but that all such Rites and Ceremonies should be observed in all Parish Churches of the Kingdom, as were then used and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52243:20"/>
retained in her Majesties Chappel, until <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome further Order should be taken in it. Only, it was permitted, and withal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, That the Litany, the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Creed, and the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, should be said in the English Tongue, and the Epistle and the Gospel, at the time of the High Mass, should be said in English, which was accordingly performed in all the Churches of the Kingdom. She likewise ordered the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, who officiated in her Chappel, not to make any Elevation of the Sacrament, for the abolishing the Popish Superstitious manner of adoring it, which she could not endure should be done in her Sight, as being wholly contrary to her Judgment and Conscience. And then she proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the reviewing and correcting of the former Liturgy, which she committed to the Care of several learned, moderate, and judicious Divines and Gentlemen; but, she only acquainted four of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of her Privy Council with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Funeral of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Queen was solemnized with very great state, in the Abby of <hi>Westminster,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52243:21"/>
and the like Ceremony was performed within a few days after, for the Death of that Great Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who having two Years before resigned the Empire to his Brother, and all his other vast Dominions to his Son, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all the Grandeurs of this World, and retired into a Monastery, where he wholly devoted himself to God and his Service. But notwithstanding, the State of these Solemnities was extraordinary in it's kind, yet was it far short of the Splendour and Majesty that attended her Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as a Preparation thereunto, she restored some to their former, and raised others to new Honours: Having perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which, she was Conducted with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Pomp and Triumph from the Tower, through the City of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Westminster,</hi> with incredible Joy and Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and behaving her self with so Graceful, Modest, and yet Majestick an Air, that as it caused Tears of Joy to fall from some, so it inspired the Hearts of all, with Prayers and Thanksgivings; but nothing charmed them more than her accepting of an <hi>English</hi> Bible richly Bound; which was presented to her from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52243:21"/>
one of the Pageants, by a Child represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truth. At the sight whereof, she kiss'd both her hands, and with both her hands she receiv'd the Book, and then laid it to her Bosom, intimating that it should be the nearest of all things to her heart, being fuller of acknowledgment to the City for that Excellent Present, than for all the rest she had received from them that day in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch Abundance, and promised to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the reading of it: By which, and sundry other such like Pious Acts, she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly gained the Affections of all the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, and by their means, the Hearts of all her other Subjects.</p>
            <p>The next day after this Cavalcade, she was Crowned at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by the Bishop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> all the other Bishops refusing to perform that Office, as fearing the Pope's Displeasure, and the Fall, or at least some Alteration of the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> in this Kingdom, which they were resolved not to Conform themselves to. Her Devotion was so great, that every Morning, as soon as she was up, she spent some time in Prayer, and besides, at the appointed hours, she went constantly to her private Chappel. In <hi>Lent</hi> she was Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

her Ministers had been careful to have it repealed in what concerned her self. But <hi>Bacon</hi> not only knew the old Law Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, <hi>That the Crown takes away all the defects and stops in blood, and that from the time the Queen did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> assume the Crown, the Fountain was cleared, and all Attainders and corruption of blood discharged.</hi> And besides, he possibly thought it more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Queen Mother's Marriage should pass as a thing unquestionable and no ways subject to dispute, than to ground it upon the inconstancy of Acts and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. There pass'd also an Act for the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Crown the Tenths and first Fruits, first setled upon it in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and afterwards remitted by Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> There likewise passed an Act for the Dissolution of all those Monasteries, Convents, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders, as had been Founded and Established by the late Queen. In the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of these Acts there was little Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but when they came to debate of the Act of Supremacy, it seemed to several a thing both strange and contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Policy, that a Woman should be declared Supream Head on Earth of

            <p>Now Men differing so much in points of Religion, it was ordered by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that no man should speak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently of the Sacrament, and both kinds were allowed to be administred.

But notwithstanding that, a Conference was appointed to be held at <hi>Westminster</hi> between the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants;</hi> 1. <hi>Concerning Common Prayer, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments in the Vulgar Tongue;</hi> 2. <hi>Concerning the Authority of the Church, in constituting and abrogating Ceremonies, to edification; and</hi> 3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacrifice of the Mass:</hi> and Persons were chosen on both sides, for to dispute upon these Points: yet all fell to nothing, not being able to agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Method they were to hold in their Disputations; the <hi>Papists</hi> not daring to dispute upon Points that had never been controverted in their Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having first consulted the <hi>Pope;</hi> but pretended and complained of the hard usage they had met with from the <hi>Lord Keeper Bacon,</hi> in not giving them time sufficient to consider upon the Points in Question; they looking upon him as their bitter Enemy. And some of the Popish Bishops were so fiery and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant in their Expressions, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the Queen, and all others that had occasioned the overthrow of the Superstitions of the Church of <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In the mean time, the Pope, being made perfectly well acquainted with all these passages, and being netled to the quick by so great a loss as he suffered by this change, he ordered <hi>Sir Edward Carne,</hi> who had been Ambassadour at the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, for Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and now for Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> not to act any longer as such: And to use his own words, <q>By Vigour of a Commandment given by word of Mouth, by the Oracle of the most Holy Lord the Pope, in vertue of his most Holy Obedience, and under pain of his greater Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and loss of all his Goods and Lands, not to depart the City, but should take upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>English</hi> Hospital.</q> Which was likewise done, lest Sr. <hi>Edward</hi> should acquaint the Queen with the secret Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises of the <hi>French</hi> against her, and was

Prayers in the Congregation, and the use of singing, and of Reverences in Divine Worship to be kept in Churches. By the Injunctions she made way to her Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which was performed by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners in their several Circuits, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by a Book of Articles, printed and published for that purpose. By Vertue of which Articles, the Commissioners remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all carved Images out of the Church, which had been formerly abused to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition; defacing likewise, all such Pictures, Paintings, and other Monuments, as were made for the Representation of feigned Miracles; and this they did with so much Order, Moderation, and Decency, that the Papists themselves, could not find Fault with, and without commiting the least Sacriledge, by appropriating to their own use any of the Plate or other Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils, that had been restored, and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Church, in the late Queens Time. Inquiry was in like manner made into the Life and Doctrine of Ministers, their Diligence in their respective Cures, the Decency of their Apparel, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that was borne them by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishoners, the Reverent Behaviour
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52243:26"/>
of all manner of Persons during Divine Service. Inquiry was also made into all sorts of Crimes, as frequenting of Taverns and other publick Houses by the Clergy, Adultery, Fornication, Drunkenness, amongst the Laity, with several other things that have since been practised in the Visitations of particular Bishops; an Oath of Supremacy was likewise offered to most of the Popish Bishops, and others of the Clergy, which they had most of them sworn to in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and such as refused it were displaced, and others substituted in their places. And this was the Course and Method that was taken for the abolishing the Superstitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the introducing and setling the true Reformed Religion in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which was done with that ease, and with so little Commotion and Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, as put all <hi>Christendom</hi> into Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to see that Gradually, Maturely, and yet in a short time, this change had been brought to pass. For, after Popery had continued a full Month after <hi>Queen Maries</hi> Decease, in the same estate as formerly, on the Twenty seventh of <hi>December,</hi> the Epistles, Gospels, the Lords Prayer, Ten
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52243:26"/>
Commandments, the Creed, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, were allowed to be used in <hi>English:</hi> On the Twenty second of <hi>March,</hi> the Parliament being then Assembled, a Law of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's was renewed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both kinds were permitted to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred in the Lords Supper: On the Twenty fourth of <hi>June,</hi> by Authority of an Act, the Sacrifice of the Mass was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and the Liturgy in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue Established; in <hi>July,</hi> the Oath of Supremacy was ministred to the Bishops and others: And in <hi>August</hi> Images were removed out of the Churches, broken, or burnt. Thus was our Church purified from the Filth and Idolatries of Popery, and the Crown of <hi>England</hi> rendred more Independent than any other of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> who had rendred and continued themselves Slaves by submitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Yoke of <hi>Rome,</hi> and infinite Sums of Money were continued at home, that used to be Exhausted hence by the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> by Popish Artifice and Trifles, for first Fruits, Pardons, Dispensations, and other such like trash of Popery.</p>
            <p>During these religious Transactions, and while that Ecclesiastical Affairs were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52243:27"/>
thus setling, the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at the Treaty of Peace at <hi>Cambray,</hi> did contend hard for the Restitution of <hi>Calice;</hi> all which, was however to no purpose, though they offered in Lieu thereof, to remit three Millions of Crowns that were due from the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> at that time, holding firm to the <hi>English,</hi> both for that the English had lost it in his Quarrels, and that he was sensible, according to all Appearances, that it would be more for his Interest in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> that it should be in the Hands of the <hi>English,</hi> than possessed by the <hi>French.</hi> On the contrary, the <hi>French</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that <hi>Calice</hi> alone was not sufficient to satisfie the Damages the English had done them, in helping the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to take their Towns; many places in <hi>Britta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> having been burn'd by the English Fleet, their Ships taken, their Trade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, and vast Sums of Money spent in hindring an Invasion of the English. But, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the mean while, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving discovered Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to a Match with him, the Paces she had made towards the introducing the Reformed Religion, and her Resolution
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52243:27"/>
to treat with the <hi>French,</hi> without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication first had with him, he grew faint, and fell off from promoting the English Pretensions; which being percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and fearing that she should be abandoned if she conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued any longer in her demands upon that Point, or else, preferring Publick Good before Private Interest, she came at length to this Agreement; That the <hi>French</hi> King should peaceably enjoy for the Term of eight years, the Town of <hi>Calice,</hi> with the Appurtenances and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen great Pieces of Ordnance; and that when that term was expired, he should restore the same with the Town, to <hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> or otherwise, should pay unto the Queen, the Sum of five hundred thousand Crowns. In Consequence of which Accommodation, Peace was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed on the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> between the <hi>Queens Majesty</hi> on the one part, and the <hi>Most Christian King</hi> on the other; as likewise, between her and the King <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> with his Wife the <hi>Queen of Scots,</hi> and all the Subjects and Dominions of the said four Princes. The People were however, dissatisfied with this Peace, in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52243:28"/>
regard, that <hi>Calice</hi> was not restored, and laid the blame thereof upon the Bishops, and other Papists. But, the <hi>French</hi> King lived not long to enjoy the Benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he being killed at a Turnament in <hi>Paris,</hi> by the <hi>Count de Montgomery;</hi> and though his eldest Son and Successor, <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> caused the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> his Wife, to assume the Title and Arms of <hi>England,</hi> yet she resolved to bestow a Royal Obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy on the King deceased, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly performed in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in a most Solemn manner.</p>
            <p>The Parliament being now to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, the House of Commons made an humble Address unto her, in which they most earnestly besought her, that for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Satisfaction of all her good and loving Subjects, she would think of marrying, without particularizing to her any one man, but leaving to her the Choice of the Person. Whereto she made Answer, That she was obliged to them for their good Affections, and took their Application to her to be well intended; and the rather, because it contained no Limitation of Time or Person; which, had it done, she should
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52243:28"/>
have disliked it very much, and have looked upon it as a very great Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That she had long since made choice of the State of Life wherein she then lived, and hoped that God would give her Strength and Constancy to go thorough with it; that if she had been inclined to have changed that Course, she neither wanted many Invitations to it, in the Reign of her Brother, nor many strong Impulsions in the time of her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. <hi>Moreover,</hi> says she, <hi>to satisfie you, I have already joyned my self in Marriage to a Husband, namely, the Kingdom of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and behold,</hi> continued she, <hi>which I marvel you have forgotten, the Pledge of this my Marriage and my Wedlock with my Kingdom;</hi> and thereupon, took the Ring off her Finger, wherewith, at her Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, she had in a set Form of Words, given her self in Marriage to her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And then, making a Pause, <q>And do not, said she, upbraid me with mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable lack of Children; for, every one of you, and as many as are English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are Children and Kinsmen to me, of whom, if God deprive me not, (which God forbid) I cannot, without
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52243:29"/>
injury be accounted Barren.</q> And then having promised she would take a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in case the good of the State should so require, she licensed them to depart to their several Businesses.</p>
            <p>Amongst other Acts that passed during this Session of <hi>Parliament,</hi> besides those that have been already related, was a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere one against any violence offered against the <hi>Queens</hi> Person; one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing going to Church upon Sundays and Holydays, a Mulct of Twelve Pence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imposed for every days Absence: Likewise one concerning Seditious Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours against the <hi>Queen,</hi> Merchandize, Shipping, Cloathing, Iron-works, and of Tumultuous and Unlawful Meetings; and besides several others, one concerning the Possessions of Archbishops and Bishops; <q>That they should not Give, Grant, or Lease out the Livings of the Church, but for one and twenty Years, or three Lives, to others than the Queen and her Successours, reserving the old Rents.</q> But that Exception <hi>for the Queen,</hi> proved beneficial to the Bishops and her Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who abused her Bounty to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Church, for which reason

it was repealed in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>James.</hi> In this Parliament, there was not a Person proscribed, tho' usual in the first Parliament of every Reign, but several were restored in Blood, and then it was dissolved.</p>
            <p>Shortly after which, came the Duke of <hi>Finland,</hi> as Ambassador from the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to propose a Marriage between <hi>Her Majesty</hi> and <hi>Prince Ericus,</hi> that King's Eldest Son; and, this Ambassadour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been magnificently treated by the Queen, was at length dismissed, with the same Success as all the rest, who, before and after, came upon that Errand.</p>
            <p>And now the Emperour and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes, interceeded with the Queen by several Letters, that such Bishops as were displaced might meet with a kind Usage, and that the Papists might be allowed Churches by themselves, in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Whereto she made Answer, <q>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though those Popish Bishops have inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and openly repugned against the Laws and Quiet of the Realm, and do now obstinately reject that Doctrine, which most part of themselves, under <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52243:31"/>
Sixth, had of their own Accord, with Heart and Hand, publickly in their Sermons and Writings, taught unto others, when they themselves were not private Men, but publick Magistrates: yet would she, for so great Princes Sakes, deal favourably with them, though not without Offence to her own Subjects: But, grant them Churches to celebrate their Divine Offices in, apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, she cannot, with the Safety of the Common-wealth, and without wrong to her own Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Neither is there any Cause why she should grant them, seeing <hi>England</hi> embraceth no new and strange Doctrine, but the same which Christ hath commanded, the Primitive and Catholick Church hath received, and the Ancient Fathers have with one Voice and Mind approved. And to allow Churches with contrary Rites and Ceremonies; besides, that it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugneth against the Laws establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Authority of Parliament, were nothing else but to sow Religion out of Religion, to distract good Men's Minds, to cherish factious Men's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52243:31"/>
disturb Religion and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and mingle Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things: Which were a thing indeed evil, in Example worst of all, to her own good Subjects hurtful, and to themselves, to whom it is granted, neither greatly Commodious, nor yet at all safe. She was therefore determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of her Natural Clemency, and especially at their request, to be willing to heal the private Insolency of a few by much Connivance; yet so as she might not encourage their obstinate minds by Indulgence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> having lost all hopes of a Match between <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> and himself, and fearing lest the <hi>Crown of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> might happen to be joyned to the Scepter of <hi>France,</hi> he perswaded the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Ferdinand</hi> to propose one of his Sons for a Husband to <hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> which accordingly he did by an Ambassadour, whom he sent to that purpose, but all to the same effect as the rest that had been before him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, those of the Reformed Religion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> being weary of the <hi>French</hi> insolency and oppression, and no
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52243:32"/>
longer able to endure the Idolatries and Impositions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded of their own Authority to a change in Religion; and being influenced by the greatest Men in the Kingdom, and stirr'd up by <hi>Knox</hi> in his Sermons, they fell upon destroying all Altars and Images in several Places, demolishing of some Religious Houses, and burning of others; And being countenanced and seconded by the Nobility, they seize upon <hi>Perth</hi> and other places, and assuming to themselves the Name of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> they mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their own Affairs apart from the rest of the Kingdom, and began to stand upon such high Terms, as to pass an Act for the depriving the <hi>Queen Regent</hi> of all Place and Power in the publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereupon the <hi>Queen Regent,</hi> to provide for her own security, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received some <hi>Forces</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> though not sufficient, she desires, and is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with farther Supplies. Hereupon the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> dispatch <hi>Melvin,</hi> and <hi>Maitland,</hi> Lord Secretary to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> making Complaints, that since the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had been married to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> the Government of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52243:32"/>
Kingdom was changed, all Places laid waste by Foreign Souldiers, the highest Offices of the Kingdom were bestowed upon <hi>French-men,</hi> the Castles and all other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Places put into their hands, and the purer Money of the Realm was embased for their gain; and that by these and such other like Contrivances, the <hi>French</hi> made way for their seizing on the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in case it happened otherwise than well with their Queen; and therefore they implore her Succours and Assistance for the expulsion of that People, who might otherwise be destructive, and of ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to both Realms. Whereupon this Affair being taken into consideration, some were of Opinion, that it was not safe for the Queen to condescend and comply with their desires, but others were for the <hi>Queens</hi> granting them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Succours, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the <hi>French</hi> were making such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Preparations, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> of Men and Ammunition for to be transported into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as were not only sufficient to subdue that Kingdom to their Wills, but seemed to threaten an Invasion of <hi>England,</hi> through that Door, by their Contracting <hi>Alliances</hi> with other
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52243:33"/>
States, and the <hi>French</hi> King's taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Title of <hi>England,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Queen was obliged, both out of Piety and Prudence, to give such assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the <hi>Scots,</hi> as might hinder the <hi>French</hi> from taking possession of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, great Preparations were made for this Expedition, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was appointed Lieutenant General in the Northern parts towards <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> who had been Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the late Queens time, was sent back thither, with Instructions for the preventing any Change in that Kingdom; and the Queens Commissioners being met with those of the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Berwick,</hi> it was concluded, and a League made to this Effect: <q>That whereas the <hi>French</hi> go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all right and reason to subdue <hi>Scotland,</hi> and unite it to the Scepter of <hi>France,</hi> the Queen of <hi>England</hi> shall take the Duke of <hi>Chastel-heraut,</hi> Heir apparent to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Nobility and People unto her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, as long as the <hi>French</hi> King hath <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> in marriage, and a year after.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52243:33"/>
by Sea and Land, with all War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like provision, to expel and exclude the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> She shall not enter into Peace with the <hi>French,</hi> but with condition that <hi>Scotland</hi> may enjoy her Ancient Liberty. The Forts and Strong Holds, recovered by the Aid of the <hi>English</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> shall forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be razed, or else delivered into the hands of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> at his choice. The <hi>English</hi> shall fortifie no Places in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but by the Consent of the Duke of <hi>Chastel-heralt,</hi> and the Nobility of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates shall aid the <hi>English</hi> all they can; they shall hold for Enemies all who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall be Enemies to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi> They shall not suffer the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be united to <hi>France,</hi> by any other means than as they are now conjoyned by Marriage. If <hi>England</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by the <hi>French</hi> on this side the Rivor <hi>Tine,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> shall send two thousand Horse and a thousand Foot under the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s Pay.

that at their own Charges, the space of thirty dayes, as they use to do for the Defence of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi> Justicer General of <hi>Scotland,</hi> shall do his best that the North part of <hi>Ireland</hi> be reduced into order, upon certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, on which the Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and he shall agree. Finally, it is prescribed what both of them shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, in case <hi>Mac Conel</hi> or other <hi>Hebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> shall attempt any thing in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> For Confirmation of these Articles, before such time as the <hi>English</hi> Army enter into <hi>Scotland,</hi> Host<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages shall be sent into <hi>England,</hi> to be changed every Sixth or Fourth Month, at the Choice of the <hi>Scots,</hi> during the Marriage betwixt the <hi>French</hi> King and the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and a year after, the Duke of <hi>Chastel-herault</hi> and the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Earls and Parliamentary Barons, shall ratifie these Articles by their hands and Seals, within twenty days: And withal, (for as much as the Queen of <hi>England</hi> undertaketh these things, in no other respect, than in regard of Amity and Neighbourhood, to defend the <hi>Scots</hi> from the Yoke of servitude; they shall make
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52243:34"/>
Declaration that they will yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi>) and the King her Husband, in all things which shall not make for the taking away of their ancient Liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In Consequence of this Agreement, and of the publick Declarations of the <hi>French,</hi> of their design to invade <hi>England,</hi> an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of six thousand Foot and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse, were sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the Command of the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Captain; and some ships being sent to block up the <hi>Frieth</hi> of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> they dispersed and put to flight some <hi>French</hi> Men of War that hovered upon that Coast.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding all this Cajoslery, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> kept firm to her <hi>Motto,</hi> viz. <hi>Always the same,</hi> insomuch that the Pope was deceived in his hopes. The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52243:38"/>
that the Pope is said to have designed to have made by this Abbot, were, That he would disanul the Sentence against her Mothers Marriage, as unjust, Confirm the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy by his Authority, and grant the use of the Sacraments unto the <hi>English</hi> under both kinds, upon condition she would joyn her self unto the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Primacy</hi> of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and an offer made of several Thousand Crowns to such persons as should perswade her to it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, notwithstanding that the <hi>French King</hi> had promised to ratifie all that his Ministers should conclude at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> yet he delayed, or rather refused so to do, upon several frivoulous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts.</p>
            <p>Now the Affairs of the Kingdom being in a more setled Posture, <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> to promote and keep those of the Church from being corrupted, caused two very seasonable Proclamations to be Published. By the one, she ordered the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and such like Sects to depart the Realm within Twenty Days, whether her Natural born Subjects or Foreigners, upon very severe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52243:38"/>
Penalties. By the other, she restrained a Sacrilegious sort of People, who under the Specious Pretext of abolishing Superstition, committed several Extravagances to the disadvantage of Honourable Families, by defacing their Epitaphs and Coat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and to the Church, by taking away the Bells, and plucking away the Lead from the Roofs. She likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the <hi>Abby</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> into a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Church, and repaired and reduced the Money which had been embased in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth to the just value.</p>
            <p>While that the <hi>Queen</hi> was busied in these Reformations both in Church and State, there broke out a Rebellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was headed by <hi>John-O-Neal,</hi> a Man of great Authority in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but the <hi>Queen,</hi> having sent some Forces thither out of <hi>England,</hi> he was quickly obliged to submit himself to her Mercy.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding her Power, and the love of her Subjects at home, her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Credit abroad, and her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess every where, yet the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> though her Husband the <hi>French King</hi> was

            <p>During these Transactions, the truly Learned and ever Famous <hi>Bishop Jewel,</hi> in a Sermon Preached by him at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, made this bold and noble Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, That if any Learned Man amongst the <hi>Papists,</hi> or all the Learned Men in the World, could bring any one sufficient Proof or Sentence out of any <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctor, or Father, or General Council, or Holy Scripture, or any one Example in the Primitive Church, whereby it may clearly and plainly be proved, during the first six Hundred Years, <q>1. That there was at any time any private Mass in the World; 2. Or, that there was any Communion Administred unto the People under one kind; 3. Or that the People had their Common-Prayer in a strange Tongue, that the People under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not; 4. Or that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was then called an Universal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or the head of the Universal
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52243:40"/>
Church; 5. Or that the People were then taught to believe that Christs Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is Really, Substantially, Corporally, Carnally, or Naturally in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 6. Or that his Body is, or may be, in a Thousand places or more at one time; 7. Or that the Priest did then hold up the Sacrament over his Head; 8. Or that the People did then fall down and worship it with Godly Honour; 9. Or that the Sacrament was then, or now ought to be hanged up under a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy; 10. Or that in the Sacrament, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the words of Consecration, there remained only the Accidents and Shews, without the Substance of Bread and Wine, 11. Or that then the Priest divided the Sacrament into three parts, and afterwards received himself all alone. 12. Or that whosoever had said that the Sacrament is a Figure, a Pledge, a Token or Remembrance of Christs Body, had therefore been judged for an Heretick; 13. Or, that it was lawful then to have Thirty, Twenty, Fifteen, Ten, or Five Masses said in one Day; 14. Or, that Images were then set up in the Churches, to the intent that the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52243:41"/>
People might Worship them; 15. Or, that the Lay People were then forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to read the Word of God in their own Tongue; 16. Or, that it was then lawful for the Priest to pronounce the Words of Consecration closely, or in private to himself; 17. Or, that the Priest had then Authority to offer up Christ unto his Father. 18. Or, to Communicate and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for another, as they do; 19. Or, to apply the virtue of Christs Death and Passion to any Man, by the means of the Mass; 20. Or, that it was then thought a sound Doctrine to teach the People, that Mass, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> (that is, even for that it is said or done) is able to remove any part of our Sin; 21. Or, that any Christian Man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sacrament of the Lord, his God; 22. Or, that the People were then taught to believe, that the Body of Christ remaineth in the Sacrament as long as the Accidents of Bread and Wine remain there without Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 23. Or, that a Mouse, or any Worm or Beast, may eat the Body of Christ, for so some of the <hi>Papists</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52243:41"/>
have said and taught; 24. Or, that when Christ said, <hi>Hoc est Corpus Meum,</hi> the Word <hi>hoc</hi> pointed not the Bread, but <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> as some of them say; 25. Or, that the Accidents, or Forms, or Shews of the Bread and Wine, be the Sacraments of Christ's Body and Blood, and not rather the very Bread and Wine it self; 26. Or, that the Sacrament is a Sign or Token of the Body of Christ that lieth hidden under it; 27. Or, that Ignorance is the Mother and cause of true Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Which if they did, he would be willing to yield and submit himself to whatsoever they should impose.</q> The <hi>Papists,</hi> both at home and abroad, were extreamly startled at this Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, that was made in so publick a place, and so great an Auditory, and none of them durst enter into the Lists against him; but only at a distance let fly some small Crackers at him, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished immediately into Smoak; until at length, his old Acquaintance and School-Fellow, <hi>Doctor Harding,</hi> one of the most Learned Divines amongst the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> took up the Cudgels against him; but was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52243:42"/>
so baffled by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> that the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves acknowledged, that they had not a Champion that could Oppose him.</p>
            <p>During these Occurrences, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Steeple being burnt, and the whole Church having received extraordinary dammage, through the negligence of a Plummer, the <hi>Queen</hi> not only contributed very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her self towards it's Reparation, but likewise took care that a Benevolence should be raised for the Compleating and bringing it to it's former Lustre and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Which Example and Zeal so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Clergy, both of the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Diocess of London,</hi> that the former contributed the fortieth part of their Benefices, and the later the thirtieth part of the Livings that were liable to the Benevolence, and the twentieth part of those that were not. By which means that Work was so hastned and furthered, that in a short time it was compleated and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, great Preparations were making for the opening and holding of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> to which the Pope endeavoured to procure, that Divines
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52243:42"/>
might be sent from <hi>England.</hi> To which end he dispatched to the <hi>Queen</hi> a <hi>Nuncio;</hi> who being come into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> stayed there in hopes of procuring leave to be admitted into <hi>England;</hi> for, that it was provided by an ancient Statute, that the <hi>Pope's Nuncio</hi> should not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Realm, without Leave first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. But, the Queen, having abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refused to admit the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> most of the Princes of Christendom endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perswade her by then Letters, to refer her self in matters of Religion, to the Occumenical Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Whereto she made Answer, That she was very desirous of an Occumenical Council, but she would not send Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to a Popish Council; that she had nothing to do with the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> whose Authority was expelled <hi>England</hi> by Act of Parliament; and that it did not belong to the Pope, but to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, to call Councils; nor could, nor would she acknowledge any greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in him, than in any other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</p>
            <p>Much about this time, the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> being sollicited by the Popish Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52243:43"/>
to return into that Kingdom, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown weary of <hi>France,</hi> since the Death of the late King, her Husband, she caused Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be desired to grant her free passage thither, pretending that she could not ratifie the Treaty of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> without the Advice of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> suspecting that some dangerous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises were contriving against <hi>England;</hi> for the preventing them, not only thought fit to deny her her Request, but to send Sir <hi>Thomas Randolph</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the Nobility to mutual Amity, and to keep firm to the Promises he had made her; and he found them and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation so well resolved to adhere to her, that she was under no Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen, or her Party. However, it was judged safe to intercept her, if possible, in her passage thither; To which end, a Squadron of Men of War was fitted out, though under other Pretexts; yet the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> her self, by the favour of a great Fog, escaped unperceived by the <hi>English,</hi> and landed safe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> though some of the Ships that attended her in that Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52243:43"/>
were taken, and brought into <hi>England.</hi> That Queen, being now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> sends an Envoy, with Letters to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> wherein she expressed a great deal of Love and Kindness to her, as her dearest Friend and Sister, and desired that all true and sincere Friendship and Correspondence might be maintained between them; Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> receiving Letters at the same time, to the same effect, from most of the Nobility of that Kingdom. But this was not the whole Errand of this Envoy, for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by him demand to be declared Heir Apparent to this Kingdom, as being, she said, the surest way to continue Amity and Friendship between the two Crowns. Whereto the Queen could not be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to make any other Answer, than that she would do nothing to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of her Cousin of <hi>Scotland</hi>'s Title, leaving the rest to be considered of at a Personal Conference that was to be held at <hi>York</hi> shortly after; which Interview was however broken off by Popish Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, lest it might be a means towards the creating in the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:52243:44"/>And now finding, that tho' she had made all the fair offers imaginable to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and treated the <hi>Guises</hi> with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Kindness and Honour; yet her Ministers at the Courts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> instead of meeting with fair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns and Civilities, received affronts upon all Occasions; wherefore, though she had found her Treasure all exhausted, yet she began to make all imaginable Warlike pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, for the security of her self and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And, amongst other her Provisions for that purpose, having caused a many Pieces of great Ordnance of Iron and Brass to be cast, God favouring all she un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, caused a most rich Vein of rich and Native Brass to be discovered at the same time; as was likewise the Stone called <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> first found out in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being very necessary for Brass Works. Her Majesty caused likewise Gun-powder to be made here at home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first that had been made in <hi>England</hi> the <hi>English</hi> before having been obliged to beg hard, and pay dear for it to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She also caused the several Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons belonging to the Kingdom to be better strengthened with new Works,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52243:44"/>
Men, and Fortifications. She likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the Pay of the Souldiers, and took Care to provide for those that had been maimed in the Service of the Land. She added to, and provided her Fleet with all manner of Necessaries, making it the best Navy that ever belonged to <hi>Brittain;</hi> insomuch, that all Foreigners did truly term her, <hi>The Restorer of the Glory of Shipping, and the Queen of the North Sea.</hi> She caused all manner of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to furnish themselves with Arms, and to use Martial Discipline and Exercise. She gave all manner of Encouragement to Husbandry and Tillage, by permitting the Transportation of Grain. And by a Proclamation she prohibited the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants from supplying the Emperour of <hi>Russia</hi> with Ammunition against the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> and caused the Officers of her Exchequer to pay duely the Pensions to such Religious Men as had been cast out of Abbeys. She revoked the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Purveyors both for the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Fleet; and designed to have done the same with those of her House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. She augmented the Stipends of the Judges: And though she was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52243:45"/>
liberal and bountiful to desert, yet she took Care not to alienate the Domain.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Civil War broke forth in <hi>France;</hi> the Faction and Family of the <hi>Guises</hi> aiming at that Crown, they were sensible, that they should never compass their Designs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as long as the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were in Being: wherefore, they used all manner of means to extirpate those Protestants; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they were forced to take Arms, both in Defence of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and themselves. Now Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> well knowing the Practises of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> to advance the Interests and Pretensions of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> she supplyed the Protestants of that Kingdom, with Money, Corn and Ammunition, for the Service of the <hi>French</hi> King, and for the defending the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, and hindring the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Normandy</hi> from being possessed by the <hi>Guises,</hi> who might, from thence, with more Ease, have executed their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs upon <hi>England.</hi> She obliged her self, to aid the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and his Associates, who headed the Protestants, with her Forces both by Land and Sea,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52243:45"/>
for the taking in of such Castles, Towns, and Ports, as were possessed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the House of <hi>Guise;</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and his Party, being bound not to come to any Terms of Peace with their Enemies, without the Privity and Approbation of the Queen; and, that for the Security of the Moneys and Forces that her Majesty should supply them with; they should put into her hands, the Town and Port of <hi>New Haven,</hi> or <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> to be garrisoned by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Souldiers, and commanded by any Person of Quality, her Majesty should authorize. Presently after the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Agreement, she caused a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to be published; in which she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, how that having preferred the Peace of Christendom before her particular Interests, she had relinquished her Claim to the Town of <hi>Calais</hi> for the term of eight years; when as all other Princes were restored to their lost Estates by that Treaty; that for the same Reasons she had preserved the <hi>Scots</hi> from being made Vassals to the <hi>French,</hi> without retaining any part of that Kingdom in her own Possession, after the Service was performed: that with the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52243:46"/>
like sence of Commiseration, she had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice how much the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>France</hi> and the young King were awed and shackled by the <hi>Guisian</hi> Faction; who in their Name, and under the Pretext of their Authority, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to extirpate the Professors of the Reformed Religion; In pursuance of which Design, those bloody minded Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists had, in less than five Months time, caused above an hundred thousand <hi>French Hugonots</hi> to be massacred and butchered; that with the like Injustice and Violence they treated such of her Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as traded into the Ports of that Kingdom, causing their Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize to be seized, themselves impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and barbarously murdered, and for no other Crime, than that they were Protestants; and therefore, in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what's aforesaid, Her Majesty thought her self obliged to endeavour the rescuing the <hi>French</hi> King and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the hands of so dangerous a Faction, by aiding such of the <hi>French</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as preferred the Service of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and the good of their Countrey, before all other respects whatsoever, for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52243:46"/>
preserving the Reformed Religion from an Universal Destruction, and the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her own Subjects and Dominions in Peace and Safety.</p>
            <p>She not only published this <hi>Manifesto,</hi> to acquaint the whole World with the reasons of her taking up Arms on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, but she also commanded her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour to give a more particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom she looked upon as the Principal Patron of the <hi>Guisian</hi> League. She likewise caused her Ministers and Agents with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germany</hi> to sollicit them to aid and assist their Brother Protestants. And then she her self fell to supplying the <hi>Hugonots</hi> with all things necessary to a War, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Ships, Arms, and Men, both for the scowring the Seas, and securing the Land. The Forces she sent amounting to 6000 Men, under the Command of the Lord <hi>Ambrose Dudley,</hi> the Eldest Son then living of the late Duke of <hi>Northunber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Papists, apprehending that the Queen by these Courses would lay the axe to the Root of their Religion, laid a Conspiracy against her Life, for which the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52243:47"/>
Countess of <hi>Lenox,</hi> Grand daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, by his eldest daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was confined with the Earl her Husband to her House: and <hi>Arthur Pole,</hi> Grand-child of <hi>Margaret</hi> Countess of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> by <hi>Geofry</hi> her third Son, the younger Brother unto <hi>Reginald Pole,</hi> the late <hi>Cardinal Legate,</hi> was Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and Arraigned, as also his Brother in Law <hi>Geofry Fortescue,</hi> and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, but confessing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy and being of the Blood Royal, they were reprieved by the <hi>Queen.</hi> The Lady <hi>Katherine Grey,</hi> Daughter to the <hi>Duke of Suffolk,</hi> and Grand Daughter to another Sister of <hi>King Henry</hi> the Eighth, was sent to the Tower, with her Husband the Earl of <hi>Hertford,</hi> for marrying without the Queens Consent, and were detained there several Years, and their Marriage declared by the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury, to be an undue and unlawful Carnal Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her, and that for such their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, both he and she to be punished.</hi> About the same time was Published an Elegant and Acute Discourse, called, <hi>The Apology of the Church of</hi> England, written Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in Latin, by the truly Learned
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52243:47"/>
               <hi>Bishop Jewel,</hi> and Translated immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into <hi>English, Dutch, Italian, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, French,</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and was highly approved of by all Pious, Learned, and Judicious Men.</p>
            <p>Now the Practices of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and the danger the <hi>Queen</hi> and State were in, by their means obliged the <hi>Queen</hi> to call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which being Assembled at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the first Act that passed was, <hi>for assurance of the Queens Royal Power over all Estates and Subjects within our Dominions:</hi> And Enacted, that the Oath of Supremacy should be Administred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Persons, for the better discovery of such as were Popishly affected; several of that Party having lately busy'd themselves by inquiring into the length and shortness of her <hi>Majesties</hi> Life, by Conjurations and other Diabolical Arts, and thereupon had caused some dark and doubtful Prophecies to be spread abroad; for which reason there passed two other Statutes for suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the like dangerous Practices, by which her Majesties Person might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, the People stirred up to Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or the Peace disturbed. By which, and other Acts for the strengthning of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52243:48"/>
Navy, and the continual breeding of a Seminary of expert Mariners, the <hi>Queen</hi> was so well provided and secured against the Machinations and Conspiracies of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Adherents, as to lie under no apprehensions of their bloody rage and malice.</p>
            <p>During this Session of Parliament, it was declared by the Bishops and Clergy, then Assembled in their Convocation, <hi>To be a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the Custom of the Primitive Church, to have publick Prayer in the Church, or to Administer the Sacraments in a Tongue not understood by the People.</hi> To confirm which Declaration, it was Enacted. <hi>That the Bishops of</hi> Hereford, <hi>St.</hi> Davids, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, Llandaff, <hi>and St.</hi> Asaph, <hi>should take care amongst them for Translating the whole</hi> Bible, <hi>with the</hi> Common Prayer Book, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the</hi> Welch, <hi>or</hi> Brittish <hi>Tongue, on pain of forfeiting Forty Pound apiece in default thereof. And to encourage them thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was ordered, that one Book of either sort being so Translated and Imprinted, should be provided and brought to euery Cathedral or Parish Church, as also for all Parish Churches, and Chappels of ease, where the</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:52243:48"/>
               <hi>said Tongue is commonly used, the Minister to pay one half the Price, and the Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners the other.</hi> Care was likewise taken for the Translating the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> being looked upon as a necessary part of the publick Liturgy, by reason of the Rubrick at the end of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. This Parliament likewise congratulated her Majesty for the happiness of the Times, for Religion Reformed, Peace restored, <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Scotland</hi> freed from the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemy, Mony refined, the Navy strengthned, Warlike Ammunition provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both for Sea and Land, and for the Laudable Enterprize in <hi>France,</hi> for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of <hi>England,</hi> and of the young <hi>French King,</hi> and the recovering of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> they granted the Clergy one Subsidy and the Laity another, with two Fifteens and Tenths.</p>
            <p>During these Occurrences at home, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> was intercepted, and taken Prisoner in that memorable Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> as was likewise Sir <hi>Nicholas Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi> who shortly after paying his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, was set at Liberty. But the <hi>Admiral Chastillon,</hi> Commanding both the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Forces, had beetter Success, by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52243:49"/>
taking in of <hi>Caen</hi> and other considerable Places: which so startled those of the <hi>Guisian</hi> Faction, that they agreed unto an Edict of Pacification, by which the <hi>French Princes</hi> were restored to their Kings favour, <hi>Conde</hi> lured with hopes of the Lieutenancy General of <hi>France,</hi> and a Marriage with the <hi>Queen of Scots,</hi> the <hi>Hugonots</hi> allowed the free exercise of their Religion, and all things setled for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to their full satisfaction. And having thus agreed among themselves, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously abandoned the <hi>English,</hi> they join their Forces, and contrive how to drive them out of <hi>New-haven</hi> in case they would not evacuate it upon demand. Now sometime before this agreement, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages for <hi>Calice</hi> endeavoured to make their escape, with <hi>Ribald,</hi> a Famous Pilot, who had been sent secretly into <hi>England</hi> for that purpose, but were discovered, and seized just as they were ready to take ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. The Queen having secret notice of the <hi>French</hi> designs upon <hi>New-haven,</hi> offered to exchange it for <hi>Calice.</hi> Which being refused, War was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed on both sides. And such an extraordinary great Fleet of the <hi>English</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52243:49"/>
scoured the Seas, as not only shut up the <hi>French</hi> in their Havens, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewise; and their Pyracies upon them being very great, the Queen caused her Ambassadour to make Excuses at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and restrained them by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>New-haven</hi> being close Besieged, and hard pressed by the <hi>French,</hi> and the Pestilence raging hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly in the Town, the <hi>English</hi> were forced to capitulate, and render up that Place, hoping that by leaving it they should escape the Plague; but instead thereof, they brought it with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> where it sorely afflicted the whole Kingdom, and especially the City of <hi>London,</hi> where there dyed of it Twenty one Thousand one Hundred and thirty Persons.</p>
            <p>The Fathers at <hi>Trent</hi> were very much displeased with <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> both for assisting the <hi>French Hugonots</hi> against their King, and passing the Statute for Punishing all those who counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and maintained the Popes Authority within her Dominions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:52243:50"/>
which so incensed the Pope, that he sent a Commission to those Fathers, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an Excommunication of the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> But the Emperour, being, by his Ministers, sed with hopes of a Marriage betwixt the Queen and his Son the Arch-Duke <hi>Charles;</hi> he, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Pope and his Legates, disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them from proceeding to such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, and caused the Pope to revoke the Commission he had sent to his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates in <hi>Trent.</hi> Shortly after which, that Council broke up; but were so far from having re-united the Church, that on the contrary, the Breach was become great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Discords inreconcilable.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> fearing, without any Reason, a Match between Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Austria;</hi> to divert it, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the said <hi>Charles</hi> for a Husband to his Neece, the Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> who, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting this Business to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> she advised her to marry, but not the <hi>Arch-Duke;</hi> and recommended to her, for a Husband, <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised her, That if she would marry him, <hi>She should, by Authority of Parliament, be</hi>

And though the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> took all imaginable Care to gain the Love of her Subjects, and keep them at Peace, yet they insulted her frequently; nor was she able to suppress the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> now grew daily more enraged against the <hi>English,</hi> for that his Ambassador here had been confined to his House, and subjected to Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and publick Reprehensions, for that the <hi>English</hi> Privateers had invested the <hi>French</hi> upon the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to set forth a Voyage to the <hi>West Indies.</hi> And the King of <hi>Spain</hi> manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted his Displeasure, by causing Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be made in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and other places, though under Pretext of the

               <hi>Pestilence</hi> being in <hi>England,</hi> that no <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ship, with Cloaths, should come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any part of the Low Countries; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Goods of <hi>English</hi> men to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated upon very light Causes: and, by new Edicts, certain Merchandise were forbidden to be transported, the Passage through the Low Country Provinces with Horses, Salt Peter, and Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, out of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> was forbidden. Whereupon, and at the earnest Suit of the Merchant-Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, the Queen prohibited the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of Wool unwrought; and the Mart or Staple of Cloaths, or English Merchandizes, was removed to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> upon the River <hi>Ems</hi> in <hi>Friez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apprehension that these and other Circumstances gave the Queen of the Councils of <hi>Spain,</hi> made her the more willingly hearken to a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> which was concluded upon these Terms, which were as advantageous as the Juncture would afford. <q>That neither Party should invade the other.

            <p>Being now at Peace with <hi>France,</hi> and in fair-seeming Terms with the King of <hi>Stain,</hi> she resolved to take the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of a Progress; in the Course

of which she made a visit to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where she was received with all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, Ceremony and Acclamation imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and to her own, as well as their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary satisfaction; and the like Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour she did to <hi>Oxford,</hi> being attended with the same Circumstances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Alvarze a Quadra,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour here, a Man zealously addicted to Popery, had fed the <hi>Papists</hi> here with hopes of having the <hi>Romish</hi> Superstitions again restored in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and had been a <hi>Grand</hi> Promoter of the Distrusts and Dissatisfactions that were then brooding between the two Crowns; being dead, he was succeeded by <hi>Don Diego Gusman de Sylva,</hi> who being a wise Man, and sensible how damageable the Courses his Predecessors had taken, were to both Parties, he endeavoured to heal up the Breaches, and by his mediation procured the Commerce to be restored, and all that had been De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and Proclaimed on both sides to be suspended.</p>
            <p>The most remarkable Action which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Queen's return from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was, the preferring Sir <hi>Robet Dudley</hi> to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52243:52"/>
Titles of Lord <hi>Denbigh</hi> and <hi>Earl of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester;</hi> she having before made him <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Garter,</hi> Master of the Horse, and Lord Chancellour of the University of <hi>Oxford;</hi> and these Honours were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him for the better qualifying him to be Husband to the <hi>Queen of Scots.</hi> And now <hi>Leicester,</hi> for the better screwing himself into that <hi>Queens</hi> favour, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately accused to <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> the Lord <hi>Keeper Bacon,</hi> who was looked upon as an Enemy to the <hi>Queen of Scots,</hi> and an Opposer of her Title to the <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Queen of Scots,</hi> knowing her Title to be disputed in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and being grown jealous of the Practices of the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> her Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Brother, and others at home, she thought it her interest to recall the <hi>Earl of Lenox</hi> to his Native Countrey, from whence he had been driven in the time of <hi>King Henry;</hi> by whose great Power and Influence she hoped to ballance the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Mutineers.</hi> This Lord, being of Royal Extraction, <hi>King Henry</hi> to engage him the more in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, had given him in Marriage
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52243:53"/>
the Lady <hi>Margaret Douglas</hi> Daughter of <hi>Queen Margaret</hi> his Eldest Sister, by <hi>Archibald Dowglas</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> lier second Husband; of which Marriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, was the Lord <hi>Darnly.</hi> Now <hi>Lenox,</hi> being returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> after twenty Years Abode in <hi>England,</hi> he sends for the Lord <hi>Darnley</hi> to that Court. Where, being arrived, and being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Graceful, Lovely, and of a Gentile Carriage, and not yet full Twenty Years old; he quickly insinuated himself into that Queens Affections. She fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied she had now met with a Man who was pleasing to her Heart, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to her Interests, for that both their Pretensions being joyned together, her Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> would be the better secured.</p>
            <p>Now Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> having got some notice of this Design of the <hi>Scottish Queen,</hi> she advised her to think of some other Match, saying, that this would have so incensed the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that she was forced to Prorogue them, least they should have acted something against her Title to the Succession. Wherefore, she again recommended unto her, the Earl of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52243:53"/>
               <hi>Leicester,</hi> for a Husband; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, she sent Commissioners to <hi>Berwick,</hi> to treat with those of the Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> about a Match. But this Queen had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven such Instructions to her Deputies, they maintained, That it did not stand with the Dignity of their Queen, to enter into such Measures, after having refused the Offers of several great Princes of Christendom. Wherefore, they broke up, without coming to any Conclusion; And, the Queen being intent upon her Marriage with the Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> it was at length consummated: And of this Marriage was born <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, in the Palace of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> on the 19 of <hi>July,</hi> in the Year 1566, Solemnly crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> on the same day of the Month, in the Year 1567, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> on the 14 of <hi>March,</hi> in the Year 1602.</p>
            <p>But, not only the <hi>English,</hi> but the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves, being displeased with this Match, the <hi>Scots</hi> raised some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, with design to have prevented it; but, being over-powered, were forced to take Refuge in <hi>England;</hi> where, by Connivance, they were allowed a safe Retreat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52243:54"/>During these Transactions, the great Renown and Glory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Reign, having invited <hi>Corcille,</hi> Sister to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and Wife to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher</hi> Marquess of <hi>Baden,</hi> to come, tho' big with Child, from the farthest Places of the North, to see the Lustre of her Court, and observe the Wisdom of her Government; after a tedious Voyage by Sea and Land, she at length arrived at <hi>Dover,</hi> where she was received with all possible Magnificence and Respect, and entertained by the Queen all the while she stayed here, with all the Tenderness, Affection, and Splendour imaginable. Within a few days after her Arrival, she fell in Labour, and was delivered of a Son, whom the Queen christned in her own Person, by the Name of <hi>Edwardu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Fortunatus; Edward,</hi> in Memory of her dearly beloved Brother; and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> in regard of his being born after a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Journey. Having remained here, they were dismiss'd with many rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, and an Annual Pension from the Queen. During their Entertainments here, a French Ambassador came hither to be installed Knight of the <hi>Garter,</hi> in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52243:54"/>
the Place and Person of that King; and, to present the Order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> the principal Order of <hi>France,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Leicester;</hi> which were performed with the Ceremonies, State and Pomp, usual on such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was again sollicited to Marry, by those who were fearful that the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> in this Kingdom might be extirpated by the Pretensions and authority of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> should she come to the Crown; and amongst other offers, the <hi>Emperour Maximilian</hi> did very seasonably renew the Proposals of a Match between her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and his Brother <hi>Charles.</hi> About the same time, there arose great Dissentions at Court between the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Leicester,</hi> the former favouring this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the other opposing, in regard of his own hopes and pretensions, but were at length, at least seemingly reconciled by the <hi>Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the same time came likewise into <hi>England, Donald Mac Carty More,</hi> a Lord of great Authority and large Territories in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were confirmed to him,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52243:55"/>
and his Heirs Males by the Queen; who likewise conferred new Honours both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and his Son, by making the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Earl of <hi>Clencarn,</hi> and the Son <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Valentia,</hi> and so engaged them by Gifts and Presents, that they procured great Opposers of the Innovations design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Desmond.</hi> Now Sir <hi>Nicholas Arnold</hi> being called from the Government of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> was sent in his stead, as Justice of that Kingdom: The <hi>English</hi> Vicegerents there being at first so termed, and since Deputies or Lieutenants, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pleasure of the <hi>Prince. Sidney,</hi> at his Arrival finding great confusion, through the Discord of the <hi>Earles of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and <hi>Desmond;</hi> the <hi>Queen,</hi> to prevent any further mischief through their Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thought fit to send for the latter into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Parliament being met, they again move the <hi>Queen</hi> either to marry or declare her Successour, which her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty looking upon as an Imposition, she checked both Houses for what had passed in them upon this occasion; and though they had offered far greater Sums than were usual, upon Condition she would
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52243:55"/>
nominate a Successour, yet she flatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused that extraordinary offer, remitting the fourth payment of the Subsidy, saying, that Money in her Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Coffers was as well as in her own. Nevertheless, she fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured very much the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and punished those who called it in question.</p>
            <p>Shortly after these Occurrences, the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> falling into a languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition, she recommended the Prince, her Son, to the Protection of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but before that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, her Affection for the King her Husband being much cooled and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and this Unkindness in her being much fomented by one <hi>David Rizie</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> first a Musician, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>French</hi> Secretary to the Queen. The King, her Husband, through the instigations of several Lords, resolved to dispatch a man, who had taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him more than became him; which, having accordingly performed, it was not long before the King himself was assassinated by <hi>Murray</hi>'s Contrivances, though some Historians have laid that Regicide to the Queen his Wife's Charge.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52243:56"/>
After this detestable Action, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the Queen to accept of the Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> one of the Conspirators, for a Husband, being a Person renowned for his Courage; and therefore the better able to assist her against so many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as she was represented to have: but, being accused of that horrid Parricide, he was brought to the Bar, and acquitted by Law. Whereupon, having new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours conferred upon him, the Queen accepted him for a Husband; which bred a Suspition in several People, That the Queen was privy to the Murder. Which Umbrage being promoted by the Male-contents, they took Arms, caused <hi>Bothwell</hi> to fly; though, as some say, privy to their Designs: and, having sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the Queen, they put her into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; which, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and detesting the Insolency of those People, she sent Sir <hi>Nicholas Throck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to expostulate the matter with the Confederates, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her Restauration to her former Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Authority. Yet, though this Ambassadour used all imaginable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in Vindication of that Queen,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52243:56"/>
yet, he found that People so strangely exasperated against her, that instead of complying with his Demands, they put the Queen under a stricter Confinement; insomuch, that at last, to make her freely resign the Government of the Kingdom, they menaced to call her in question for Tyranny, the King's Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and incontinent Living; insomuch, that at length they compelled her to set her hand to three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Instruments: In the first whereof, she resigned her Kingdom to her young Son, at that time, scarce thirteen Months old; In the second, she constituted <hi>Murray</hi> Vice-Roy, during the Minority of her Son; and, in the third, she named, in case that <hi>Murray</hi> should refuse that Office, several of the principal Noble-men of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Within a few days after this Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, her Son, was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King; the famous <hi>John Knox</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Coronation Sermon. Now, <hi>Murray</hi> being declared Regent, he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Queen not to disturb the Peace of the Kingdom, by endeavouring her Liberty, by Instigating the Queen of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52243:57"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>French</hi> King, to a War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> or by thinking any more of <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s Love, or meditating Revenge upon his Adversaries. As soon as <hi>Murray</hi> was confirmed in the Regency, he put to death some of <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s Servants, who protested at their Execution, that <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> were the Contrivers of the Kings Death.</p>
            <p>But, while that the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King were, in vain, solliciting the Liberty of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> eight years being now expired since the Treaty of <hi>Cambray,</hi> Ministers were sent into <hi>France,</hi> to demand the re-delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Calice,</hi> with the Appurtenances; but this Business being delayed, and prorogued by the <hi>French</hi> from time to time, at length the thoughts of it were wholly laid aside, through the Civil War that then broke out in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> being sent Ambassador to the Emperour, to treat of the Marriage that had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by his Imperial Majesty, in favour of the Arch Duke his Brother: which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission he the more willingly accepted of, in that it might be a means for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52243:57"/>
the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi>'s Pretensions. But he met with several Difficulties in this Negotiation, both as to Religion, the Arch Duke's Maintenance, the Title of King, and the Succession. As for the Title; the Arch Duke <hi>Charles</hi> should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Name and Title of King of <hi>England:</hi> Concerning the Succession, He could not by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, for that would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to their Children; of whom it was agreed however, that he should have the Guardianship: and all other things as fully granted, as they had been to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> when he married to <hi>Queen Mary.</hi> As touching his Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he would at his own charge main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Train he should bring and keep about him; the Queen would bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully supply the rest, according to his Royal Dignity; nay, and that other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, if he would require it. But the main obstacle was, concerning Religion; the Emperour and Arch Duke requiring a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church for the celebrating Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, after the <hi>Romish</hi> manner; which not being granted, nor the Expedient allowed of that was devised by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52243:58"/>
he might have some private place in the Court granted him for Divine Service; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, that no <hi>English</hi> man should be admitted thereunto: That he himself should forbear, in case of any Disorders in point of Religion: That neither he, nor any of his, should speak against the Religion of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and moreover, That he himself should be present with the Queen at Divine Service, to be celebrated after the manner of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Yet, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these plausible Offers, the Queen, after mature Deliberation, made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That should she consent hereunto, she should offend her Conscience, and openly break the publick Laws of the Realm, which could not be done, without endangering both her Dignity and Safety; but however, invited the Arch Duke <hi>Charles</hi> to come into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> promising, That he should not repent of his Journey. Whereupon, the Emperour dismissed <hi>Sussex</hi> with great Honour; and thus those Proposals fell to nothing by degrees, though all mutual good Offices continued to pass between the Queen and the Emperour, who
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52243:58"/>
persevered in thwarting all the Designs of the Pope against her Majesty; and not long after, the Arch Duke <hi>Charles</hi> took to Wife, a Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much about the same time, came Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours to the Queen, from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Muscovia,</hi> bringing very rich Presents to her Majesty, that Emperour having granted very great Priviledges to the English, who had, not long before, discovered a Passage by Sea, into his Countrey; and of whom, a Company was formed for Commerce into those parts. With those Ambassadors, returned into <hi>England, Anthony Jenkinson,</hi> being the first of all the English, who sailed upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea: By him, the <hi>Czar</hi> made Proposals of an Offensive and Defensive League with the <hi>Queen;</hi> which her Majesty made slight of, not being willing to enter into farther League with a Prince, who had created an Aversion to him in his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, through his Tyranny and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Practises.</p>
            <p>Now, Let us pass over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where we shall find <hi>Shan O Neal</hi> so puffed

up with some Victories he had gained in the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Service, that he fell to committing such Extravagances, that the <hi>English</hi> could not forbear checking him; which his haughty Spirit not being able to brook, he again breaks out into Rebellion; but, having received several Losses, and being defeated by the <hi>English,</hi> he designed to have craved Pardon, and submitted himself to the Lord Deputy. But, being disswaded by some of his Crew, from so doing, he was advised to try the Amity of the <hi>Hebridians,</hi> by whom, he and his were slain, after a seeming kind Reception. After his Death, some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions were raised in other parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> through the Dissentions of the Earls of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Desmond,</hi> which were still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by seizing on the latter, and sending him into <hi>England.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Protestants lying under heavy Persecutions in <hi>France, Queen Elizabeth</hi> took them into her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, supplyed them with Money and Ammunition, and received, with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of kindness, those that fled hither,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52243:61"/>
notwithstanding they had basely abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her at <hi>New-haven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the War began to flame forth in the Low Countries. For the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> a Man of the highest Arbitrary and Tyrannical Principles, being sent Governour thither by the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and being an Enemy of their Nations, he trampled under Foot all their Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, introduced the Inquisition, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by all manner of Cruelties to extirpate the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> in all Places of his Government; insomuch, that the People being no longer able to support his Tyranny, began to be Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous, which, though quieted for a while, burst out at length into a long and dangerous War. At that time vast Sums of Money being sent in some <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships by <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants, to be employed in Bank in the Low Countries, for the ruine of the <hi>Protestants</hi> there, and being forced by <hi>French</hi> Men of War, to take refuge in <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> at first ordered, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should be kindly used, and be defended against the <hi>French;</hi> and the Money being brought on Land for the better security, and the Queen having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52243:62"/>
to what ill Purposes it was designed, and that it did not belong to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> himself, she was advised by the Privy Council, to borrow it of the Merchants; some of the Owners themselves being affraid the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi> would seize upon it: Yet she religiously promised to restore it, if it was made out that it was the <hi>Spaniards</hi> own Money. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the Impetuous <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately caused all Goods to be sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that belonged to the <hi>English</hi> in the Low Countries, and kept the <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> Prisoners. And the Queen caused the same to be done with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants here in <hi>England;</hi> which being of far greater value than those of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had reason to repent of these and other Courses, that brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him an Unfortunate and Bloody War.</p>
            <p>Upon the Detention of this Money, several Peers of the Realm accused Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cecil</hi> of sending Money into <hi>France,</hi> but the <hi>Queen</hi> finding that all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from their envying his being so much in her favour, she checked them, and protected him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:52243:62"/>In the mean time, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi> sent a Person to demand the Money, but after some stay, returned with a denial; hereupon that <hi>Duke</hi> prohibited all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the <hi>English,</hi> and appointed Searchers to hinder any thing from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imported or exported out of the Low Countries by them; amongst whom, was one Doctor <hi>Story,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Fugitive, and a Person who had used several means against the Queens Life, and suggested to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi> gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that none but Men of War should put to Sea out of the Low Countries, and that they should seize on the <hi>English,</hi> wheresoever they met with them. And the <hi>Spaniard</hi> used several other Practices for the raising a Rebellion in <hi>Engiand</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but all to no purpose. The <hi>English</hi> hereupon remove their Staple to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and so plyed the <hi>Spaniard</hi> with Privateers, that the Queen thought fit to restrain them by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now though such as envyed the Prosperity of <hi>England</hi> used all manner
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52243:63"/>
of Contrivances to disturb it; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, endeavoured to put a stop to that part of our Trade as then flourished in <hi>Russia,</hi> by sowing Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Russians,</hi> and amongst the <hi>English</hi> themselves; yet they were in that Favour with that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, out of the respect he bare to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that he granted them freedom from all Customes in his Countrey, allowed them liberty to trade all over his Empire, and through it to <hi>Astracan,</hi> and so by the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea into <hi>Persia.</hi> And though that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was somewhat disgusted at some Refusals and Slights of the Queen, yet he ever continued to use the English with all possible Humanity and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Murray,</hi> having clap'd up in Prison the principal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Party, it caused several Rumours to be spread abroad to his disadvantage; which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having dispersed by a Publick Writing, she taking Pity of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> condition, sollicited her Restauration to her Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52243:63"/>
But while she was making these Paces in her favour, she found that that <hi>Queen</hi> did underhand Cabal against her, and was contracting a Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> without her Privity and Consent; whereupon that Duke was committed to the Tower, and the Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi> and <hi>Ridol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About which time, the Earls of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, Westmerland,</hi> and others, made an Insurrection in the North, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instigated thereunto by one <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a Popish Priest, who was sent by the Pope to pronounce <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> an Heretick. But after these Rebels had by their Declarations invited all the Catholicks to come in to their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and committed several Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies at <hi>Durham,</hi> by tearing to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all the Bibles and Common-Prayer-Books in the English Tongue, that they could find in the Churches there; and after twelve dayes Rebellion, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Army to be but six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horse, and four thousand Foot strong, and hearing that the Queens
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52243:64"/>
Forces were marching against them in two Bodies, the one of seven, and the other of twelve thousand; and being proclaimed Traytors, the two Earls, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves unable to make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such great Forces, they fled with a small Company into <hi>Scotland;</hi> from whence, the Earl of <hi>Westmerland</hi> made his Escape into the Low Countries, where he lived, though poorly, to a great Age. But <hi>Northumberland</hi> was betrayed by his Party, to <hi>Murray.</hi> The Heads of the Rebels being convicted of High Treason, were proscribed, and several of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted: Presently after which, there broke forth a new Rebellion in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> the number of the Rebels amounting to three thousand Men; but, were fought, routed, and dispersed, by the Baron of <hi>Hunsdon.</hi> There was likewise a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but was quickly extinguished through the Queens prudent Conduct, and the Orders she sent to the Deputy of that Kingdom. But notwithstanding these Commotions both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> she failed not to assist the <hi>French</hi> Protestants, with Men, Money and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. But, as the Queen assisted the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52243:64"/>
               <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, out of Revenge, designed to have done the same to the <hi>Scots,</hi> had he not been prevented by Death.</p>
            <p>During these Occurrences, <hi>Murray,</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when he had setled all things to his Desire, and thought himself secure against all Attempts, he was shot by one <hi>Hamilton</hi> in the Belly, as he was riding along the Streets in <hi>Litchquo;</hi> of which Wound, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dyed, the Assassinate making his Escape into <hi>France.</hi> Presently after his Death, the <hi>Scots</hi> that were devoted to their Queen, being joyned with the English Fugitives and Rebels, made some Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions into <hi>England;</hi> but, Forces being sent against them under the Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and the Borders of that Kingdom severely punished for their Folly. After which Performances, the English assisted their Friends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, removed from the King, the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons,</hi> and the rest who stood for the deposed Queen. Whereupon, the Lords of that Kingdom met together about choosing a new Regent, and demanded
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52243:65"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Advice in the Business; but she replied, That she would not be concerned in it, lest if any thing should be done to the prejudice of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> she might be suspected for it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they created the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; which was the more pleasing to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as hoping he would have a particular care of the young King, being his Grand-child, and live in good Intelligence with the English, by Favours and Benefits he had received during his abode among them, and be at her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, because she had his Wife in her Power.</p>
            <p>Whilst Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was thus as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the Queen's Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Castle-Herault,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> Lieutenants, send an Envoy to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> to demand his Assistance and Offices, in favour of their Queen; which he readily granted, promising to do all that lay in his Power to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Request; and thereupon sent them Arms, Powder, Cannon and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. In the mean time, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadours request Queen
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52243:65"/>
               <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the name of their Masters, to set the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> at Liberty; to all which Importunities, <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Answer, That as she would do all that lay in her Power to reconcile the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> and her Subjects, so she thought it was but Justice in her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for her own, and her Subjects Safety. And now the Pope, seeing that these Princes could not procure that <hi>Queens</hi> Liberty, he caused one <hi>Felton</hi> to fasten up in the Night-time his <hi>Bull De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory,</hi> upon the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>'s Palace; wherein, he absolved all <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance, or any other Duty; and all who obey her, accursed with <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> Whereupon, <hi>Felton</hi> being taken, and confessing, and justifying the Fact, he was condemned, and executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, near the Place where he had fixed up the Bull.</p>
            <p>About this time, were some Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Suspicions of more; amongst the rest, a Conspiracy of some <hi>Norfolk</hi> Gentlemen, to set the Duke of that Name at liberty; but soon defeated, and some of them executed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:52243:66"/>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was delivered out of the Tower the same day that <hi>Felton</hi> was Executed, having Confessed, and asked forgiveness of his Crime, with a promise under his hand, never to think of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> nor to do any thing more against the Queens Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Shortly after which, broke out a new Conspiracy in <hi>Darbyshire,</hi> whereof the principal Ringleaders were two o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,</hi> being the younger Sons of the Earl of <hi>Darby;</hi> their Design was to have freed the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> out of Prison: But the Plot being revealed by one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, the Heads of it were taken, and put into Prison.</p>
            <p>Hereupon followed an Expedition into <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Sussex</hi> and the <hi>Lord Scroop,</hi> who forced the <hi>Scots,</hi> of the <hi>Queen</hi> of that Names Party, to give it under their hands, that they would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from War, and forsake the <hi>English</hi> Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> being now full of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage and Suspitions, by reason of the several late Conspiracies, and the <hi>Popes</hi> Bull, she sent Sir <hi>William Cecyl,</hi> and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52243:66"/>
Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay</hi> to the <hi>Queen of Scots,</hi> to Treat with her; they found her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning her Condition, excusing <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and referring her self wholly to the <hi>Queens</hi> Clemency, they proposed, that the Treaty of <hi>Edenborough</hi> should be confirmed; that she should renounce her Title and Claim to <hi>England,</hi> as long as <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and the Children law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully born of her Body should live: that she should not renew or keep any League with any Foreign Prince against <hi>England:</hi> that she should not receive any Foreign Souldiers into <hi>Scotland:</hi> that she should have no intercourse of Counsels with the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Irish,</hi> without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the <hi>Queen</hi> therewith: that she should deliver up the <hi>English</hi> Fugitives or Rebels: that she should recompence the dammages done to the <hi>English</hi> Borderers: that she should enquire according to Law, into the Murther, as well of the Lord <hi>Darnly</hi> her Husband, as of <hi>Murray:</hi> that she should deliver her Son into <hi>England</hi> as an Hostage: that she should Contract Marriage with no <hi>English</hi> Man, but with the Advice of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> nor with any other against the Wills of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52243:67"/>
Estates of <hi>Scotland:</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> should not cross over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence obtained out of <hi>England:</hi> that for Confirmation of these things, the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the Delegates to be appointed, should set to their Hands and Seals: that the Hostages whom the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England</hi> should name, should be sent into <hi>England:</hi> that if the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> should attempt any thing by her self, or any other, against <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> she should, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> forfeit all her Right and Title she claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>England:</hi> that <hi>Humes</hi> Castle, and <hi>Fast</hi> Castle, should be holden by the English for three Years: that in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, some strong Holds in <hi>Galloway</hi> or <hi>Cantyr,</hi> should be delivered into the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish mens Hands, lest from thence the Scottish Irish might infest <hi>Ireland.</hi> Lastly, That the Estates of <hi>Scotland</hi> should confirm all these things by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To which Propositions, the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> replyed, with a <hi>Proviso,</hi> referring the fuller Answer to the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> her Ambassadour in <hi>England,</hi> and to some other Delegates, who afterwards, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some of the Propositions, and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, the Treaty came to nothing,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52243:67"/>
and things remained in the same state as they were in before: Onely <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> as Head of all <hi>Britain,</hi> by her Authority prorogued the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Whilst things were in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, the Pope supplied the English Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells and Fugitives with Monies, and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> contracted a Marriage with <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> Daughter to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> his own Neece by his Sister; and she being to go by Sea from <hi>Zealand</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to shew the Love and Respect she had for the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> sent Sir <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> with the Navy Royal, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy her through the <hi>British</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>And now Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> having compleated the Twelfth year of her Reign, which some Wizzards had flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Papists that it would be her last, the People, out of their great Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Loyalty to her Majesty, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the 17th of <hi>November,</hi> with all the Pomp, Joy, and Thanksgiving ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; which was not only continued upon that day during her Life, but even to this very day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:52243:68"/>In <hi>Ireland,</hi> a new Rebellion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, by the Earl of <hi>Thoumond,</hi> and his Adherents; which was disappointed when it was just ready to break out, merely by the Earl's Suspicions of his being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: whereupon, he fled into <hi>France,</hi> and confessing his Crimes, and showing himself very penitent to the Queen's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador there, this Minister procured him his pardon, and the Restitution of his Estate.</p>
            <p>Soon after which, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made a very magnificent Entry into the City of <hi>London,</hi> for to go see the new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Burse, which Sir <hi>Thomas Gresham</hi> had newly built; and, in a solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nam'd it the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> with Sound of Trumpets, and by the Voice of an Herald. Shortly after which, she cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Sir <hi>William Cecyl</hi> Baron of <hi>Burghley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was at this time in <hi>England</hi> Delegates from the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> of whom <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> having demanded that they should explain the Reasons they had for deposing their Queen; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they exhibited so insolent a Writing, that the Queen could not read it, without Indignation; and told them, That she did not see that they had any just Cause to treat their Queen after that manner; and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52243:68"/>
therefore, desired they would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately think of some means to allay the Dissentions of that Kingdom. Hereupon, several Propositions were again made them for the setting the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> at Liberty; which being rejected by the Scottish Delegates, and <hi>Norfolk</hi> beginning a new his Practices in favour of that Queen, and she her self corresponding and caballing with the Enemies of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> whereto, they were both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by <hi>Ridolpho</hi> the Pope's Agent, that <hi>Queen</hi> had many of her Servants taken from her, and she her self put under a stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter Confinement, and a watching Eye was kept over the Duke, to whom, the Pope had promised great Assistance, both of Money and Men, in case he would raise a Rebellion; assuring him, That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would aid him with four thousand Horse, and six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, and that he had already deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a hundred thousand Crowns, and that he would be at all the Charge of the War.</p>
            <p>But whilst these things were acting in <hi>England,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Party was very much oppressed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> several of her principal Adherents being put to Death, and their strongest Holds taken
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52243:69"/>
in. In <hi>France</hi> was the Marriage now so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized between <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, the <hi>French King,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> Daughter to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> to Congratulate which, the <hi>Lord Buckhurst</hi> was sent into <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and was there received with all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Pomp imaginable and possibly the more, in respect of a Motion that the <hi>French</hi> Court designed to make in favour of a Match between the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Lord <hi>Buckhurst</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Commission, he returned home with great Presents, and with one <hi>Cavalcantio</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who had atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in his Embassy. This <hi>Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantio</hi> being a prudent Person, was entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the Queen Mother of <hi>France,</hi> to make a motion of this Match to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Which he accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and the Queen seemed to listen favourably to the Proposal; for by this Match, there should be added to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> the Dukedoms of <hi>Anjou, Bourbon, Avern,</hi> and possibly the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> it self. Whereupon a Treaty was held, in which the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:52243:69"/>
proposed three Articles, one concerning the Coronation of the <hi>Duke;</hi> another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the joint Administration of the Kingdom; a third, concerning a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Religion; whereto it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that the two first Articles might in some sort be composed, but hardly the third; for though a contrary Religion might be tolerated between Subjects of the same Kingdom; yet between a Wife and her Husband, it seemed very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and inconvenient; however the matter was brought at length to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that if the <hi>Duke</hi> would afford his presence with the Queen at Divine Service, and not refuse to hear and learn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he should not be compelled to use the <hi>English</hi> Rites, but at his pleasure use the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> not being expressly against the Word of God. But they could not accommodate these Niceties; insomuch that the Treaty was quite broak off, after it had continued almost a Year.</p>
            <p>But during these Occurrences, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at <hi>Kinnaston</hi> in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> the ground was seen to open, and certain Rocks

with a piece of Ground removed, and went forwards four days together, carrying along great Trees and Sheep-Coats; some with sixty Sheep in them, and overthrew <hi>Rimnalstone</hi> Chappel: the Depth of the whole where it first broke out, is thirty Foot, and the bredth of the Breach, six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Yards; also, High-ways were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved near an hundred Yards, with Trees, and Hedg-rows, and the like.</p>
            <p>And now the Papists were plotting and contriving new Attempts against the Queen, but they were all frustrated by the <hi>goodness of God,</hi> and the Prudence of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the Loyalty and Zeal of her Ministers and Protestant Subjects. Amongst others of those Devillish Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Popery, was the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Ambassador; who made it his whole Business to excite and stir up People to Rebellion. He had laid several Plots for seizing Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and freeing the Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> but they all failed him in the Execution. But notwithstanding that Bishop had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so many checks for these Practices of his, yet he continuing them to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as not only to pervert the Subjects
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52243:70"/>
from their Loyalty, but even to Designs against the Queen's Life; the Privy Council, after mature Deliberation in the Business,, notwithstanding his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, thought fit he should be sent, and kept close Prisoner in the Tower; which was accordingly done,: as likewise with the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who was again committed to the same Place, it having been discovered by a Pacquet of Letters, that he still continued in his Affections, Design to marry, and free out of Prison the Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> having for that end, kept correspondence with the Pope, and the other Enemies of the Crown, and traiterously consulted to take away the Queens Life, and to bring in Foreign Forces to invade the Kingdom; for which being brought to his Tryal, he was found guilty by his Peers, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly beheaded.</p>
            <p>The Parliament being assembled upon this occasion, it was Enacted amongst other Laws, that if any man should go about to free any Person imprisoned by the Queens Commandment, for Treason or Suspicion of Treason, and not yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, he shall lose all his Goods, for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52243:71"/>
his life time, and be Imprisoned during the Queens Pleasure, if the said Person having been Arraigned, the Rescuer shall forfeit his Life; if Condemned, he shall be guilty of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Presently after the Dissolution of the Parliament, a Consultation was had whether <hi>John Story,</hi> Doctor of the Laws, the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Searcher, who some time before having been engaged to go on Board a Ship, to search for Goods, was by that piece of cunning brought into <hi>England,</hi> being an <hi>English</hi> Man born, and having in <hi>Brabant</hi> consulted with a Foreign Prince, were to be held guilty of High Treason; which being given in the affirmative, by the Learned in the Law, he was thereupon brought to his Tryal, and Accused, of having consulted with one <hi>Preshal</hi> a Conjurer, to make away the Queen, that he had Cursed her daily, when he said Grace at Table: that he shewed a way to the Duke of <hi>Alva;</hi> how to Invade <hi>England,</hi> of which being found guilty, he accordingly suffered Death as a Traytor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:52243:71"/>About this time <hi>Matthew Stuart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the King's Grandfather, was surprized unawares by the Nobility of the adverse Faction, and having yielded himself to <hi>David Spence</hi> of <hi>Wormstone,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon lost his Life in his Defence, and they were both slain together by <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Chaulder,</hi> after he had with great Pains and care governed the Kingdom for his Grandchild above fourteen Months; and in his room was unanimously elected by the Kings Faction, the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> for Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two full of troubles for a Man of his quiet Disposition, he departed this Life after he had Governed thirteen Months.</p>
            <p>Some few days after the Execution of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> one <hi>Barnes</hi> and <hi>Mather</hi> were put to Death, for Conspire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one <hi>Herle</hi> to take away the Life of certain Counsellours, and freeing the Duke; and at the same time, suffered one <hi>Rolph</hi> for Counterfeiting the Queens hand.</p>
            <p>Shortly afterwhich, the Queen confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red new Honours upon several of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52243:72"/>
concluded a League with the <hi>French</hi> King, and sent several Persons to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate with the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> for that she had usurped the Title and Arms of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and had not renounced the same, according to the Agreement of the Treaty of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> that she had endeavoured the Marriage of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> without acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Queen; and had used all forcible means to free him out of Prison; had raised the Rebellion in the North; had releived the Rebells both in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in the Low Countries; had implored Aids from the Pope, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and others; had conspired with certain of the English, to free her out of Prison, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare her Queen of <hi>England:</hi> and finally, that she had procured the Pope's Bull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Queen,</hi> and suffered her self to be publickly named the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in Foreign Countries: all which Points, she either denyed, or endeavoured to extenuate. And though, as she said, she was a free Queen, and not subject to any Creature, yet she was willing, and desired, that she might make her perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Answer at the next Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:52243:72"/>In the mean time, <hi>Scotland</hi> was full of Civil Distractions and Dissentions, the English countenancing the King's Party, and the French the other. And the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having made Complaints to the <hi>Queen,</hi> by his Ambassador, that the Low Country Rebells were entertained and harboured in <hi>England;</hi> the Queen cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a severe Proclamation to be put forth, That all the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who could, in any wise, be suspected of Rebellion, should immediately depart the Kingdom; which proved rather disadvantageous than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> For, <hi>Count Vander Marea</hi> and other of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> being hereupon compelled out of <hi>England,</hi> first seised upon the <hi>Brid,</hi> and then upon <hi>Flushing;</hi> the Surprize of which Places, being attended by the Revolt of other Towns, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were, in a short time, in some kind, excluded from the Sea, and were never after able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themselves in those Countries.</p>
            <p>During these Transactions, the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador here, made Intercession in the behalf of the Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> and likewise, endeavoured to promote the Match between the Queen and the Duke
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52243:73"/>
of <hi>Anjou,</hi> but perceiving that all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were to no purpose, he returned into <hi>France,</hi> where he found that Court very much taken up with making Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for the Marriage of the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> with the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Sister. To this Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were allured, by an inviting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of perpetual Peace and Amity, not only the Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and the Chief of all the Protestants in that Kingdom; but likewise the Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector Palatine's Sons, with several of the Principal of the Reformed Party of other Nations, were desired to be at the Celebration of that Marriage, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing at one Blow to have cut down the Protestant Religion; And though those Blood-thirsty Papists could not catch all they aimed at, yet as soon as the Marriage was Solemnized, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that Cruel Massacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that terrible Butchering of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> throughout all the Cities of <hi>France:</hi> but for the extenuating and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this horrible Fact, Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Edicts were immediately put
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52243:73"/>
forth, whereby the <hi>Protestants</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of a Conspiracy against the <hi>King</hi> and the whole Royal Family: But the <hi>French</hi> King notwithstanding his mask of Piety did not escape Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; for before a year was expired, he fell sick of a Bloody Flux, which brought him to his end, after long and tedious Torments. And now came the Head of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to the Block, who Rebelling, and then flying into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was by the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> delivered for a Sum of Money to the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> Governor of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and was shortly after Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time was Sir <hi>William Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyl</hi> Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> promoted to be Lord High Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Decease of the Marquess of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who a little before end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his days, after he had lived Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seven years, and had seen the Issue of his Body, to the number of One hundred and three Persons. Not long before which was a motion made to the Queen in favour of a Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Majesty and the Duke of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52243:74"/>
               <hi>Alanzon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's youngest Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which though rejected by her, by reason he was scarce seventeen years old, and the Queen now past eight and thirty; yet <hi>Alanzon</hi> did not cease prosecuting the Suit. In the mean time, the Queen fell sick of the Small Pox, but recovered again, before that it was known abroad that she was so, attending the Affairs of Government, taking Care to suppress se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fresh Rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and sending a new Colony thither. She also repaid, with Thanks, the Money she had borrowed of her Subjects; and put forth two Proclamations, by one of which, she commanded the Noble-men to observe the Law, in keeping Retainers; by the other, she restrained Informers, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of discovering Crown-Lands, concealed by private Persons, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiously seized upon the Lands of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches, and Alms-Houses, piously endowed by the Queens Ancestors. And she likewise gained a great deal of Love and Honor, by two Acts of Justice; the one, That she satisfyed the English Merchants out of the Goods that were detained, belonging to the Dutch, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52243:74"/>
restored the rest to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and made a full Transaction with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Genoua,</hi> for the Money inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; the other, That she free'd <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at this time, of the Debts which her Father and her Brother had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Foreign parts, and were encreased by yearly Interest; and caused the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the City of <hi>London,</hi> which had been so often renewed, to be given in, to the great Satisfaction of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Conduct in the Low Countries, having not met with that Success that was expected; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, several of their Towns being lost, all the Provinces ready for a Revolt, and the Fleet they had sent to the Relief of the English Catholicks vanquished by the <hi>Zelanders;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> finding how disadvantageous the cutting off Commerce with the <hi>English,</hi> had been to his Masters Subjects, he began to treat the English with more Kindness, and thereupon, the Commerce was again laid open, which had been, for some Years, prohibited between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> for two years, which term being expired,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52243:75"/>
the <hi>English,</hi> removed their Trade to the Confederated States.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, comes over a <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour to complain of the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that the Queen gave to the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> of that Kingdom, to Request her Majesty to be Godmother to the <hi>French</hi> King's Daughter, and to use all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Offices toward the promoting a Match between the Queen and Duke of <hi>Alanzon.</hi> Whereupon her Majesty sent the Earl of <hi>Worcester</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> with a Present of a Font of Massy Gold, and to stand as her Deputy at the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the Christening. And now the <hi>French</hi> use all their efforts for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of this Match, desiring that the Duke of <hi>Alanzon</hi> might have leave to come over; which after much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, she consented to, upon condition, that he should not take it for any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, should he return without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his Suit: And that he should first procure a Peace in <hi>France,</hi> and do something in favour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of that Kingdom. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52243:75"/>
a Peace was concluded, and the <hi>Hugonots</hi> allowed the Exercise of their Religion in certain Places. And the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> being elected King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and resolving to go by Sea thither, the <hi>French</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, that he might have free Passage through the <hi>British</hi> Ocean; which the Queen not only willingly granted, but made Offer of a Fleet for the convoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him thither.</p>
            <p>There having been no Regent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ever since the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi>'s Death, <hi>James Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> was now made Regent, by the Procurement of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and was continued and maintained by the Authority and Power of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> maugre all the Practices of the Papists, and the French against him. This Regent enacted many profitable Laws for the Defence of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Papists and Hereticks, in the King's Name. But, the Protection and keeping of the King's Person, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to <hi>Alexander Ereskin,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> (to whom the Custody of the Kings, in their tender years, belongeth by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52243:76"/>
Priviledge) though he were in his Minority: And now the Regent meeting with some Opposition through the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the <hi>French,</hi> he implored Aid of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which she granting him, he therewith overcame his and the Kingdom's Enemies, and brought that Realm into a very setled and quiet Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi> was let out of Prison, but expelled <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and being abroad, he continued his Sollicitations to the Pope and all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Princes, in favour of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> his Mistress, from all whom he received fair Promises, but no Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. And indeed he had lost the main support of his Hopes in the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who about that time was recall'd from his Government of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, both for that he was grown too Great, and that the People there had a Mortal Aversion for his Person, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Cruelty. He was succeeded by <hi>Requesens,</hi> a man of a milder Spirit, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own, not concerning himself with either <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Scottish</hi> Affairs, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to oblige Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by all manner of good Offices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:52243:76"/>Now again broke out several new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but were suppressed by the care and Industry of the <hi>Queen's</hi> Ministers and Officers there. But they had raised a desire in <hi>Walter Devereux,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> to go against them, which being opposed by Sir <hi>William Fitz-Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi> Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> an Expedient was found out by the Queen, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Essex</hi> to take a Patent of the Deputy; which having accordingly done, he went into <hi>Ireland</hi> with some Forces; but not meeting with the Success he had promised himself, he long sollicited, and at length obtained leave to return home.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alanzon,</hi> a Pretender to the <hi>Queen,</hi> being suspected by the Queen Mother of <hi>France,</hi> of some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs against her Authority, were put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Confinement: whereupon <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> sent an Envoy to sollicit their Reconciliation and Liberty. But now <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King dying, he was succeeded by his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; who having left the Throne of <hi>Poland,</hi> and being returned into his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, my Lord <hi>North</hi> was sent Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52243:77"/>
to congratulate his Arrival, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration into his Kingdom: who, in return, sent a Person with the same Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter hither, but whose chief Errand was to make strong Intercessions in the King's and <hi>Queen</hi> Mothers name, in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Match between her Majesty, and the Duke of <hi>Alanzon.</hi> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the Kindness that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Courts, and that the League of <hi>Blois</hi> was now again confirmed and ratifyed by both Crowns, yet the <hi>French</hi> continued their Practices in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Queen of Scots;</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have got that King over into <hi>France,</hi> contrived how to deprive <hi>Morton</hi> the <hi>Regent,</hi> of his Authority; and the <hi>French</hi> King having demanded, by Letters, whether the mutual Defence mentioned in the League, was intended to comprehend the Case of Religion also? Which the <hi>Queen</hi> answering in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, he immediately began to prepare for War against the Protestants; and <hi>Alanzon</hi> being engaged in the adverse Party, there was no Talk of a Match for a long time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:52243:77"/>During these Occurrences, <hi>Requesens</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Governour of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, finding how much his Predecessors neglect of Marine Affairs was prejudicial to his Master's Interests, he made his Request to <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> that he might take up Ships and Marriners, for his Majesties Service: That the <hi>English</hi> Fugitives, in the Low Countries, might serve the King of <hi>Spain</hi> against the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and have free Access to the Ports of <hi>England;</hi> and that the Dutch, who were Rebells against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> might be banished <hi>England.</hi> But, for several Reasons, she thought not fit to grant any of these Particulars; yet to preserve inviolate the old <hi>Burgundian</hi> League, she put out a Proclamation, wherein she commanded, that the Ships of the Dutch, that were made ready, should not go forth of the Haven; nor yet, the Dutch who had taken up Arms against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> enter into the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> and by Name, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and fifty other of the principal of that Faction. In Return of which Favour, the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52243:78"/>
               <hi>English</hi> Seminary at <hi>Doway</hi> was dissolved, and the Earl of <hi>Westmerland,</hi> and other <hi>English</hi> Fugitives were Banished the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Confederated States finding their Forces too small to oppose the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they consulted to whose Protection they might most securely betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The <hi>French</hi> they saw then engaged in a Civil War, the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were loath to part with their Money, could seldom agree amongst themselves, and were not altogether of a mind with them in Religion: whereupon knowing none more powerful nor capable of protecting them than <hi>England,</hi> they sent an Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Embassy of several Persons to the <hi>Queen,</hi> offering her the Soveraignty of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand;</hi> forasmuch as she was descended from the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by <hi>Philippa,</hi> Wife of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, Daughter of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Count of <hi>Hannonia</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> by whose other Sister the Hereditary Right of those Provinces came to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Of this Offer the <hi>Queen</hi> took time to consider, and after mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52243:78"/>
she made answer, after that she had thanked them for their good Intentions towards her; that she held no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more glorious than Justice, that as she could not with the safety of her Honour and Conscience receive those Provinces into her Protection, much less assume them into her Possession; yet she would use her endeavours with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that a good Peace might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Requesens</hi> dying, the States of the several Provinces took upon them the ancient Administration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was fain to Confirm unto them, till such time as <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> was arrived, whom he designed for a Successor to <hi>Requesens.</hi> In the mean time, the Queen by her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters endeavoured to compose Matters in those Countries; but the minds of the Factions were so exasperated against one another, that all her efforts in that kind proved Abortive. Yet he continued to intercede with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in their behalf; and the Ambassador she sent for this purpose to that Court, finding that that King's Ministers would not admit in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52243:79"/>
the Queens Title the Attribute of <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Faith,</hi> he demanded it with that Courage and Prudence, that he thereby gained the favour of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himself, who desired him that the Queen might know nothing of this Dispute, and gave severe Command that the Title should be admitted.</p>
            <p>About this time there happened some disorders upon the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which having been favoured by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the <hi>Regent,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would in no wise be satisfied until the <hi>Regent</hi> himself came into <hi>England</hi> to make his Submissions to the Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Commissioner.</p>
            <p>Much about the same time the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> received a great affront, for amidst his great Exploits and Victory in <hi>Ireland,</hi> through the Practises of his Enemies at Court; He was of a sudden recalled home, and ordered to resign his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in <hi>Ulster.</hi> But <hi>Leicester</hi> being jealous of his Presence at Court, caused him to be sent back thither with the empty Title of <hi>Earl Marshal</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for grief whereof he fell into a Bloody Flux, and ended his days in grievous Torments,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52243:79"/>
but not without suspicion of Poyson, by the Earl of <hi>Leicester's</hi> means, for that he had marryed his Widdow immediately after his Death.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Confusions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in the Low Countries, which the Queen endeavoured very much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and though the States had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to the <hi>French,</hi> yet she sent them twenty Thousand Pounds Sterling, upon Condition, they should neither call in the <hi>French</hi> into the Low Countries, nor change their Prince nor their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor refuse a Peace, in case it were offered by <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> upon reasonable Conditions. And that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour being now arrived, <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> sent a Person of Quality to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his coming thither, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him her assistance, if the States called in the <hi>French</hi> into the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>The Seas being now extreamly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested with Pyrates, the Queen caused several Men of War to put forth to scoure them; which they did to that purpose, as to take Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them, and to put them
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52243:80"/>
in Prisons all along the Coast. She like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise caused the <hi>Zelanders</hi> to make Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Satisfaction of the <hi>English</hi> Goods they had taken and confiscated. And now all the World courting the Prosperity of <hi>England,</hi> and the prudent Conduct of it's Queen, the <hi>Portugals</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested, that the Commerce might be restored, that had been now for some time prohibited between the two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and the Conditions which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and were accepted, were as much or more to the <hi>English,</hi> as their Advantage About the same time, <hi>Martin Forbisher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And now, a great Friend and Ally of <hi>Queen Elizabeth's,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> being dead, she sent Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> to his Son <hi>Rodolphus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to condole his Fathers Death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his Succession, causing the same Offices to be done with the surviving Son of the then newly deceased Electo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:52243:80"/>In <hi>Ireland,</hi> fresh Rebellions breaking out about this time, the prudent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Queen and her Ministers, was such, that all those Commotions were suddenly suppressed, and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought to a greater Subjection than it had ever been before; but her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters proceeding to lay new Taxes, she gave Order for the moderating them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aying, that she would have her Subjects shorne, not devoured.</p>
            <p>But, the Papists still continuing their Practices against her Majesty, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> to endeavour the Escape of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots;</hi> which, when he should have procured, he was to have marryed her, and thereupon, have demanded as well <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in Right of his Wife. But this Plot and all the Contrivances to bring it about, being discovered by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> to <hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> she there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon entred into a Defensive League with the States of the Low Countries. After which, some Forces were sent over thither, with whom, flocked several Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers of Quality. <hi>Casimir</hi> the Elector Palatine's Son came likewise thither, with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52243:81"/>
an Army of <hi>German</hi> Horse and Foot, at the Queen's Charges. These Forces were unexpectedly attacqued by <hi>Don John,</hi> at the Head of a great and experienc'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, assisted by the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and other the best Commanders of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy; and though they had expected a certain Victory, yet after an obstinate Fight, they were compelled to retreat: but rallying again, they thought to have surprized the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Volunteers, but were again repulsed by them, and the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> were so fiery in this Engagement, that, casting away their Garments by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the hot Weather, they fought in their Shirts, which they made fast about them.</p>
            <p>Before this Action, <hi>Don John</hi> had sent to <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> to complain of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the States. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self having done the same, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the <hi>French</hi>-man, of his Hugonot Subjects. Thus sate this Queen as an Heroical Princess and Umpire between the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the States; insomuch, that it was true what one hath Written, that <hi>France</hi> and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52243:81"/>
               <hi>Spain were the Scales in the ballance of</hi> Europe, <hi>and</hi> England <hi>the Beam to turn them either way:</hi> For whom she assisted, did ever play the Master.</p>
            <p>Now though Embassadours come from the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and the <hi>French</hi> King into the Low Countries, with Proposals of Peace, yet their Negotiation proved to no purpose, for that <hi>Don John</hi> refused to admit the Protestant Religion, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> refused to return into <hi>Holland.</hi> But shortly after, <hi>Don John</hi> Dyed in the flower of his Age, some say of the Pestilence, others of grief, both for his being out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the Spanish King, and for that, his Ambition had been disappointed; first, of the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and afterwards of that of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> began again new Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the People having conceived a great Aversion against the Lord <hi>Morton,</hi> the Regent, the Nobility unanimously resolved to transfer the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government upon the King, though then but Twelve

years old, appointing him a Council of twelve of the Principal Lords, three of whom were to attend him a Month by course. Hereupon the King sent an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador to Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> who was dismissed with satisfaction in most of the Points he came about: but the Lord <hi>Morton,</hi> not being able to brook the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of being put from the Regency, taketh the Administration of all Affairs to himself; which so provoked the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of that Kingdom, that they raised a great Army, and were ready to fight him and his Forces, when, through the Intercession of Sir <hi>Robert Bowes,</hi> the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ambassador, things were accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated for the present.</p>
            <p>And now the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Pope conspire the utter Ruine, as they imagined, of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> having taken all the necessary Measures for an Invasion of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> But <hi>Don Sebastian,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> being to Head this Enterprize, was killed in the memorable Battel, wherein three Kings were slain in <hi>Africa;</hi> whereupon the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Thoughts and Forces were wholly taken up how to secure the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Portugal</hi> to himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:52243:82"/>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Alan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon</hi> renews his Suit to the Queen, sending over several French Lords to sollicit in his behalf: and amongst the rest, one <hi>Simier,</hi> who had the Reputation of a great Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and one who understood the Art of Love, better than any one Person of his time; and indeed, he seemed to have made such Advances in his Negotiation, as made several of the other Pretenders jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and caused the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> to report, that this French-man crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queens Affections by Love Potions and unlawful Arts, for which, and other Speeches, and his being married to the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> his Widow, he was confined to the Castle of <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and had it not been for the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> though his greatest Adversary, he had been committed to the Tower: But this course so provoked the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and there were such suspicions of a Design of murdering <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier,</hi> that the Queen put out a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, commanding, that no Person should offer Injury to the Ambassador, or any of his Servants. Yet it happening at that time, that the Queen going in her Barge with <hi>Simier,</hi> and some English Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52243:83"/>
to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> a young Fellow, shooting off a Musket, shot one of the Rowers in the Barge, through the Arm with a Bullet, for which he was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried to the Gallows; yet upon So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Protestation that he did it unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and with no ill intent, he was let go, and pardoned. And notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that was suggested to the Queen, yet she was so far from suspecting her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that she frequently said, <hi>She would not believe any thing against them, which a Mother would not believe against her Children.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few days after which Accident, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alanzon</hi> himself came <hi>incognito</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and unexpected by the <hi>Queen;</hi> with whom, having had some private Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he returned back to <hi>France;</hi> and within a Month or two after his Departure, the Queen appointed Commissioners to treat with <hi>Simier,</hi> concerning the Articles of the Marriage.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> having constituted the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> Governour of the Low Countries, <hi>Qu.

And about this time, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Drury</hi> succeeded in the Deputiship of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> who had been eleven years Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at several times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:52243:83"/>And <hi>Casimir,</hi> Son to the Elector Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of the Rhine, came into <hi>England;</hi> and after he had been magnificentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the <hi>Queen,</hi> having procured of the Grand Seignieur a full Liberty for her. Subjects to-trade in all the Territories of <hi>Turkey,</hi> a Company of <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants was first set up about that time; who carried on a great and most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trade in the several Parts of his vast Dominions.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, followed the Death of Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; in whose place, succeeded Sir <hi>Thomas Bromley,</hi> with the Title of Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of <hi>England.</hi> And now broke out new Rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Natives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being thereunto stirred up by the Pope and his Adherents: During which, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Drury</hi> dying, <hi>Arthur</hi> Lord <hi>Gray</hi> was made Deputy in his stead. And now the Pope having bestowed the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for that Qu. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> forsooth, had forfeited her Right by being an Heretick; great Forces were sent into that Kingdom;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52243:84"/>
both of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> for to assist the Rebells in driving and expelling the English from thence; and though the Rebells and their Auxiliaries, had the advantage in some Rencounters, yet they were at length, totally routed by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> hanged, and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> put to the Sword. And no less successful were the English in the Low Countries, where <hi>John Norris</hi> and <hi>Oliver Temple,</hi> English Commanders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned with some Companies of Dutch, attacked early one Morning, the wealthy, strong, and large City of <hi>Mecklyn,</hi> in <hi>Brabant;</hi> and after some Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, took it. Not long before these Occurrences, dyed Sir <hi>Thomas Gresham,</hi> who, besides the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> and other publick Structures, dedicated to the Profession - of Learning, a fair House of his in the City, since called <hi>Gresham</hi> Colledge; constituting therein, Lectures of Divinity, Civil Law, Physick, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, Geometry, and Rhetorick, with reasonable Stipends.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>English</hi> Seminaries abroad, who were incited to maintain and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, That the Pope hath such Fullness
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52243:84"/>
of Power, by Divine Right, over the whole World, both in Ecclesiastical and Divine Matters, that by virtue thereof it is lawful for him to excommunicate Kings, absolve their Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance, and deprive them of their Kingdoms: And now I say, those Seminaries began to spawn out Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into all Parts, for the teaching and inculcating this Doctrine; and, amongst others, came the Jesuits, <hi>Parsons</hi> and <hi>Compian,</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> who spoke to the Papists so venemously of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and of deposing her, that the Papists themselves did design to have discovered them. Whereupon, for that these and several more of that wicked Tribe, lay lurking, and in Masquerade, stirring up People to Rebellion, and using all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of abominable Machinations against the <hi>Queen</hi> and her Authority; her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty thought fit, to put out a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein she declareth, <q>That she had attempted nothing against any Prince, but for Preservation of her own Kingdom; nor had invaded the Provinces of any other, though she had sundry times thereunto been provoked,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52243:85"/>
by injuries, and invited by opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. If any Princes do assail her, she doubteth not but to be able (by the favour of God) to defend her People, and to that purpose she had mustered her Forces both by Sea and Land, and had now made them ready against Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile Invasions. Her faithful Subjects she exhorteth to continue unmoveable in their Allegiance and Duty towards God and their Prince, the Minister of God. The rest which had shaken off their Love to their Countrey, and their Obedience to their Prince, she commandeth to carry themselves mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly, and not to provoke the severity of Justice: For she would no longer offend in such sort, that by sparing the bad, she should be cruel against her self and her good Subjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>About this time it was that Captain <hi>Drake</hi> returned home from his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Voyage round the World. He was a Person Born of mean Parentage in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> his Father being Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, for Protestantism, changed his Abode, and lived privately in <hi>Kent,</hi> but after that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52243:85"/>
Kings Death, he procured to read Prayers among the Mariners of the Queens Navy; and bound his Son <hi>Francis</hi> Prentice to the Master of a Ship, who traded to <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Zeland.</hi> Now this Master took such a liking to <hi>Francis</hi> for his Activity and readiness in all things he took in hand, that at his Death he left him his Pinck as a Legacy: This Vessel <hi>Drake</hi> sold, and thereupon in the Year 1567, attended Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi> in his Voyage to <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> but with the loss of all he had in the World in that Voyage. Some time after, having gained a considerable Sum of Money, by Trading and Privateering, he again undertook a Voyage to <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> wherein the first Prize he made, was great store of Gold and Silver, carried over the Mountains upon Mules, whereof he carried the Gold to his Ships, but left and buried his Silver. After this Exploit he proceeded, took, plundred, and fired a great place of Commerce, called the Cross, upon the River <hi>Cherarge,</hi> and whilst he was wandring and roving about the adjacent places, he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Mountains, the South Sea.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52243:86"/>
Hereupon inflamed with Affectation of Glory and Wealth, falling upon his knees, he craved the assistance of God, and bound himself by a Vow to undertake the Navigating and Surveying of those Seas: And now, having obtained great Riches, he for the present returned home: Afterwards, about the middle of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> in the Year 1577, He set Sail with five Ships, and about 163 Seamen, from <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> for the Southern Sea, and in the space of five and twenty days came to the Cape of <hi>Cantyne</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and then sailed along the Isle of <hi>Fogo,</hi> that casteth forth Sulphury Flames; and at his being under the Line, he caused every Person in his Ships to be let Blood, and Arriving on the Twenty sixth of <hi>April,</hi> at the mouth of the River of <hi>Plata,</hi> he saw an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Sea Calves; from thence sayling to the Haven of Saint <hi>Julians,</hi> he found a Gybbet, set up, as was thought by <hi>Magellan,</hi> when he punished certain Mutineers. In this very place <hi>John Doughty,</hi> a stout and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Man, the next to <hi>Drake</hi> in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, was called in question for raising Sedition in the Navy, and was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52243:86"/>
to Death, which he suffered very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly, after having received the Communion with <hi>Drake.</hi> On the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>August,</hi> he set Sail with three Ships, for the two lesser he had before left to the Waves, shipping the Men and Amunition into the rest, to the Streight of <hi>Magellan;</hi> the sixth of <hi>September</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the wide Southern Ocean, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Pacifique</hi> Sea, he found it extream Tempestuous, insomuch, that his Ships were dispersed by Storm; in the one of which <hi>John Winter</hi> was Master, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back into <hi>England. Drake</hi> himself, with only one Ship, Coasted along the Shoar, until he came to <hi>Mouch</hi> Island. And setting Sail from thence, he found a <hi>Barbarian</hi> fishing in a small Boat, who taking our Men to be <hi>Spaniards,</hi> gave them notice, that there rode at Anchor, a great <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship, at <hi>Villa Parizo,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them thither: And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> supposing him to be their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, invited him on Board, where he presently shut the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not being above eight Persons, under Hatches, and took the Ship, wherein was four hundred pound weight of Gold. Then went he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52243:87"/>
on Land at <hi>Taurapasa,</hi> where he found a <hi>Spaniard</hi> sleeping on the Sea Shoar, and lying by him thirteen Bars and Wedges of Silver, to the value of four hundred thousand Duckets; which he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be carried away, not so much as once waking the Man. Afterwards entring the <hi>Haven</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> he found there three Ships without any Seamen in them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, besides other Commodities, were seven and fifty Silver Bricks, each of which weighed twenty pound; from whence he sailed to <hi>Lima,</hi> where he found twelve Ships in one Road, and in them great store of Silks, and a Chest full of Money ready Coyned, but not so much as a Boy aboard; so secure they think themselves on that Coast: And then making all the Sail he could, he followed the rich Ship called the <hi>Cacofogo,</hi> and by the way met with a small Ship without Canon or other Arms, out of which he took fourscore pound weight of Gold, a Golden Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix, and some Emeraulds of a fingers length. On the first of <hi>March,</hi> he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the <hi>Cacofogo,</hi> and having shot down the Foremast with the shot of a great Piece of Ordnance, he set upon her and soon
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52243:87"/>
took her; and in her, besides Jewels, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score pound weight of Gold, thirteen Chests of Silver ready Coyned, and as much Silver, as would ballance a Ship. And now thinking himself suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently rich, he resolved to make Sail for <hi>England;</hi> and soon the third of <hi>November</hi> 1580, he arrived at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> having sayled round about the World in the space of three Years, to his Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, and the great admiration of all Men.</p>
            <p>He was graciously received by the Queen, who yet sequestred his Goods, that they might be forth coming if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> demanded them: And her Majesty having given order for his Ship to be drawn on shoar near <hi>Deptford,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and where it does remain for a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in it being consecrated for a Memorial with great solemnity; and having been there treated with great Magnificence, her Majesty conferred the Honour of Knighthood upon Captain <hi>Drake.</hi> But the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour in <hi>England</hi> began to bluster, and re-demanded the Goods that had been taken by <hi>Drake,</hi> and made
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52243:88"/>
Complaints of the <hi>English</hi> sayling in the <hi>American</hi> Seas: To whom the Queen replied, That she had caused the Goods to be sequestred, and that they were forth-coming, for the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; notwithstanding that the <hi>Queen</hi> had been at greater Expences in suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Rebellions that had been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>Spaniard's</hi> Instigations in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> than all the Money that <hi>Drake</hi> had brought with him: And as for sayling on the <hi>American</hi> Sea, that it was as lawful for her Majesties, and and other Princes Subjects, as the King of <hi>Spain's;</hi> and that she could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any Right in the Pope to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate those or any other Countreys to any Person. However, the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Agent in this Business, had a great Sum of Money repayed him, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being restored to the Owners, was employed against the Queen, and the Protestants in the Low Countries; where the English did extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in behalf of the confederated States, General <hi>Norris</hi> raising the Siege of <hi>Fenwick,</hi> that was besieged by the Forces of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and shortly after fought another
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52243:88"/>
               <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, but, being over-powered with Numbers, made a gallant Retreat. In the mean time, new Troubles were raised in <hi>Scotland,</hi> some envying the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> his great Favour with the King, accused him of endeavouring to pervert the King to Popery, and allure him into <hi>France,</hi> which suspicions he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to dissipate; and thinking those Rumours were promoted by <hi>Morton,</hi> and that he was not secure as long as <hi>Morton</hi> lived, he caused him to be beheaded, as accessory to the Death of the King's Father.</p>
            <p>During these Transactions, the Match with the Duke of <hi>Alanzon</hi> was prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted afresh, several of the Principal Lords of <hi>France</hi> coming over for that end, and shortly after that Duke himself came over hither. In the mean time, the Articles of Marriage were agreed upon by the Commissioners on both sides, but with some Reservations, that were disclaimed by the <hi>French</hi> King, who refused to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into an Offensive and Defensive League, until such time as the Marriage was consummated. Yet the French Duke's Presence here seemed to have so promoted his Business, that the Queen,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52243:89"/>
having one day given him publickly a Ring, this was looked upon as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, by all the standers by; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon publick Rejoycing was made in several Places abroad, as for a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but not so at home, when the innate Aversion the English have for the French, broke out into publick Murmurs, and Libells against this Match, which occasioned the Queen to put forth Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations to stifle them, and the Authors and Dispersers of those Seditious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets to be punished according to Law. About the same time, a Jesuit and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Popish Priests were convicted of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plotted the Ruine of the Queen and Kingdom; of adhering to the Pope, the Queens Enemy; and of coming into <hi>England</hi> to raise Forces against the State; for which they were condemned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly executed: Shortly after whom, several Papists suffered Death likewise for the same Crimes.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Alan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,</hi> suspecting that he had onely been lured with empty hopes of a Crown here in <hi>England,</hi> having the Government of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> conferred upon him
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52243:89"/>
by the States, he prepared for his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thither, and was accompanied by the Queen as far as <hi>Canterbury;</hi> where they parting, her Majesty ordered some of the Principal Courtiers to attend him to <hi>Antwerp;</hi> where, finding his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion so limited, that he had only the Name of Authority, he made a rash At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon <hi>Antwerp,</hi> for which he was forced to leave the Low Countreys, with the Aversion and Scorn of those People.</p>
            <p>But during these Occurences, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> subdued all <hi>Portugal</hi> in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty dayes time: which being a great Addition to the vast Dominions he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had, put all <hi>Europe</hi> in mind of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for their common Security. In the mean time, the <hi>English</hi> continued their Bravery in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and with great Success and Advantage to the <hi>States.</hi> And the Queen, to procure the Amity of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and an Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Customes in the <hi>Sound,</hi> sent him the Order of the Carter, which he accordingly received with all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment. And now broke out again new Commotions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King being surprized and detained by the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52243:90"/>
Earls of <hi>Goury, Lindsey, Marr,</hi> and others, who caused <hi>Arran</hi> to be imprisoned, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi> to be banished out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arguse</hi> to be called home from Exile. But shortly after, the King being then about eighteen years old, made his Escape out of their Hands; whereupon, Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi> was sent to him by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for the giving him good Counsel, and the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to compose the Distractions of that Kingdom: During which, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Irish</hi> Rebell <hi>Gyrald Fitz Gyrald,</hi> the eleventh Earl of <hi>Desmond</hi> of this Family, having a long time kept himself outof the hands of the <hi>English,</hi> by lurking in private places, was about this time found out, and slain by a Common Souldier, in a poor Cottage. This great Lord was descended from <hi>Maurice,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gyrald</hi> of <hi>Windsor,</hi> an English man, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous among those who first invaded <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Year 1170. He possessed whole Counties together, with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Palatine of <hi>Kerry,</hi> and had of his own Name and Race, at least five hundred Gentlemen at his Command; all whom, and his own Life also, he lost within the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52243:90"/>
space of three years, very few of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily being left alive. This Misfortune was brought upon him by his Disloyalty to his Prince, through the Instigation of Popish Priests.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> (where lately the Earl of <hi>Gowry</hi> was beheaded, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of several Treasons) were not the only Scenes of Plots and Conspiracies, but <hi>England</hi> it self was again filled with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Practices against the <hi>Queen's</hi> Life, and in favour of the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> But being discovered, some of the Nobility and Ring-leaders of the Faction, were taken into Custody, others confined to their Houses, and others made their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, some Disputes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening between the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muscovy</hi> and the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> this King not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself able to oppose that <hi>Emperour,</hi> sendeth a Royal Ambassy to request the <hi>Queen's</hi> Intercession in his Behalf, which accordingly her Majesty immediately performed; and, by her Ambassador ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated matters between those two Princes, upon very reasonable Terms. At the same time, the Queens Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52243:91"/>
obtained of the <hi>Czar,</hi> the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Priviledges of the <hi>English</hi> Merchants in <hi>Russia,</hi> maugre she had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him Satisfaction in several points, and one of her Subjects to be his Wife and Empress, which he had extreamly sollicited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mendora,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador at this time in <hi>England,</hi> was put out of the Kingdom, for joyning with the <hi>English</hi> Rebells, and stirring up the People to Rebellion; and an Ambassador sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> to justifie this Conduct, who not being admitted to Audiency of the King, but referred to the Counsellors, he disdained to open himself to them, and returned home without declaring the Cause of his Embassy. The Papists print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dispersed Books to exhort the Queens Women to commit the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Queen, as <hi>Judith</hi> had done with Commendations against <hi>Holofernes:</hi> The Book-seller for whom these seditious Libels were printed, was executed; but the Author could not be found out. And now farther Discoveries were made of the Practices of the Papists against the Queen and State, of a Design of invading
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52243:91"/>
               <hi>England</hi> by the Catholick Princes, and of the measures that had been taken by the Papists, for that purpose; which Discoveries being confirmed by the Confessions of some of the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, all possible Precautions were taken for the preventing the Execution of any such pernicous Designs; and amongst other Expedients, for the better providing for the Safety of the <hi>Queen's</hi> Person, a number of her Subjects, headed by the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> men of all Ranks and Conditions, bound themselves mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to each other, by their Oaths and Subscriptions, to persecute all those to Death, that should attempt any thing against the Queen; which League of theirs, was called the Association.</p>
            <p>The several Treaties that had been held with the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> having proved abortive, she fearing that this Association was designed for her Destruction, made this Proposition by <hi>Nave</hi> her Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the <hi>Queen</hi> and Council; That if she might be set at Liberty, and be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of the Queen's Affection, she would enter into a strict League and Amity with her; and passing by all
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52243:92"/>
matters of Offence, most officiously love and observe her, above all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Christendom;</hi> and enter also into the Association aforesaid, for the Queens Security, and into a League Defensive (saving that Ancient League between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>) This seemed to give great Delight and Satisfaction to Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and she was thought at that time to be really inclined to grant her her Liberty. But her Majesty being continually allarm'd with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions from the adverse Party, both of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> who exclamed, that the Queens Life was in no wise secure while the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was living, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at least, at liberty; insomuch that this Treaty was likewise broken off; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Adversaries sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions, she was taken from the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and committed to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody of Sir <hi>Amias Paulet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Drue Drury,</hi> which rendred her so desperate, that she grew the more importunate with the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to put their Designs in execution.</p>
            <p>And now there ran a Report, that the Catholicks had entred into a Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52243:92"/>
for the depriving Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of her Crown, for the disinheriting the King of <hi>Scots</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as being both of them detected of Heresie; the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to be married to some Catholick English Noble-man; that this Noble-man should be elected King of <hi>England,</hi> by the English Catholicks, the Election confirmed by the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> that his Children by the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> should be proclaimed Lawful Successors to the Crown; and all this was affirmed by one <hi>Hart</hi> a Priest. About this time, dyed in <hi>France</hi> the Duke of <hi>Alanzon,</hi> for grief; and in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was treacherously shot with three Bullets, by one <hi>Bethazar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> a <hi>Burgundian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the <hi>French</hi> King being elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> into the Order of the Garter, Her Majesty sent the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> to invest him therewith, with all the usual Solemnity.</p>
            <p>There being a Parliament assembled at <hi>Westminster,</hi> one <hi>Parry,</hi> a Member of the Lower House, was first imprisoned for opposing and exclaming against a Bill that was preferred against the Jesuits,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52243:93"/>
but being set at Liberty upon his Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he was immediately after accused by one <hi>Edward Nevil,</hi> of the Earl of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland's</hi> Family, of having held secret Consultations about taking away the Queens Life; which upon his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being confessed by him, with all the Particulars thereof; and being brought to his Tryal, and still confessing the same, he was accordingly condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Whereupon, the Parliament then sitting, made several seasonable Laws for the Security of the Queens Person. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was committed to the Tower. In the same Place, and at the same time, the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> a man of a lofty Spirit and Courage, who had been committed thither upon Suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a secret Consultation with <hi>Throckmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and the <hi>Guises,</hi> for invading of <hi>England,</hi> and setting the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> at Liberty, was found dead in his Bed, being shot with three Bullets, under his left Pap, his Chamber-door being barr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the inside. The Coroners Inquest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving examined the matter, and all other lawful Scrutinies being made, it was found and declared; how that for Fear of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52243:93"/>
Law, he had laid violent hands upon himself.</p>
            <p>The Practices of the Papists against the Queen and the reformed Religion, being thus dayly more and more discovered, the Queen resolved to endeavour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting an Offensive and Defensive League with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Protestant Princes and States of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Low Countries, and with the King of <hi>Scotland:</hi> to which purpose she sent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to their respective Courts, but it was delayed in <hi>Scotland</hi> by some new Commotions, which occasioned a change of Ministers and Officers of that Crown; till at length all being quieted and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, it was unanimously voted by all, that a Treaty of a <hi>League</hi> with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> should be agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Delegates nominated to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. During these Transactions, new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions broke forth in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers calling into their aid the <hi>Hebridian Scots,</hi> who together with the <hi>Irish</hi> were utterly defeated by the <hi>English,</hi> above three thousand of them, (being all except fourscore) killed upon the Place. Which Victory was famous and advantageous
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52243:94"/>
both for the present and future times, for hereby the name of the <hi>Mac-Williams</hi> in <hi>Connaught,</hi> was utterly extinct, and the insolent Attempts of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders absolutely crushed.</p>
            <p>About this time the States of the Low Countries being brought very low, and unable to secure themselves any longer against the ruine that was threatned them by the vast power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they implored Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Protection, and offered her the sovereignty of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which for the present, after much debate in her Council, she refused; but was willing to supply them with four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Souldiers, in case the Town of <hi>Sluce</hi> with the Ordnance belonging to it, were delivered to her for caution. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon their farther representations of the sad condition they were reduced to, and commiserating the doleful estate of so great a Branch of the reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, she at last resolves to take them into her Protection, promising to supply them with five Thousand Foot, and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse, under a sufficient General, and paying them during the War, upon condition, that they should by way of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52243:94"/>
Pledge, deliver to her <hi>Flushing,</hi> the Fort of <hi>Ramekin,</hi> and the <hi>Brill:</hi> And her <hi>Majesty</hi> immediately caused to be put forth a large Declaration in justification of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his her Conduct. And thereupon, that the War might not be brought to her own Doors by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> she sent Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> Admiral of her Fleet, and <hi>Christopher Carlile,</hi> General of her Land Forces into <hi>America,</hi> with a Fleet of Twenty one ships, wherein were two Thousand three Hundred Volunteers and Saylors, for to make a Division thereby, who after they had taken and plundered several places in those parts of the World, and lost seven hundred of their men, most of whom dyed of the Calenture, they returned home, with a Booty valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at six Thousand Pounds sterling, and two hundred and forty of the Enemies great Brass and Iron Guns; and with Tobacco, being the first time it was brought into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During these Transactions in <hi>America, John Davies,</hi> with two ships, set forth at the Charges of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> first discovered and found a passage by the Northern parts of <hi>America</hi> to the <hi>East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:52243:95"/>About this time, the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> was sent by the <hi>Queen,</hi> as General of her Forces into <hi>Holland,</hi> being accompanied by the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and several Persons of Quality, with a choice Band of five hundred Gentlemen. The Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>'s Reception was attended with all the Pomp and Magnificence imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And at his Arrival at the <hi>Hague,</hi> the chief Government and absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the confederated Provinces, was committed to him by Instrument in Writing, by the States General, <q>with the Title of Governour and Captain General of <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and the confederated Provinces.</q> Which he accepted of, and also the Title of excellency. All which severely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased the Queen, and she made both him and the States sensible of her anger by her Letters to them, desiring the latter to devest <hi>Leicester</hi> of that absolute Authority they had devolved upon him. The States let the Queen know how much they were grieved for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving incurred her displeasure by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving devolved that Authority upon the Earl, without her Previty, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52243:95"/>
desire her to be pacifyed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the necessity they were in so do.</p>
            <p>Upon these Letters and those of <hi>Leicester</hi>'s, that were Written with all the Submission, Respect, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance imaginable, the Queen was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and satisfyed. But <hi>Leicester</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arbitrary way of Government, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing new Customes upon Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, and introducing Martial Laws, quickly raised an Aversion to him in the People.</p>
            <p>His first Warlike Exploit was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to Relieve <hi>Grave,</hi> a Town in <hi>Brabant,</hi> then besieged by the Prince of <hi>Parma:</hi> but notwithstanding all the great Efforts of the <hi>English,</hi> the Town was at length taken, through the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice of the Governour, who was thereupon executed.</p>
            <p>After which, the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> laid Siege unto <hi>Venlo</hi> in <hi>Guelderland,</hi> where one <hi>Roger Williams</hi> a <hi>Welchman,</hi> performed great Service, yet the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> took that Town also, while the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> was beating the <hi>Spaniard</hi> out of the <hi>Betou,</hi> a River Island lying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:52243:96"/>
between the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Waul,</hi> and near the <hi>Tolhuis,</hi> built a strong Sconce. After which, the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Bergen-op-zoom,</hi> cut off the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Convoys, and took away their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions. And Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> with <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Son, took in <hi>Axill</hi> a Town in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and <hi>Doesburgh</hi> was likewise besieged, and taken by the Earl of <hi>Leicester.</hi> But in a Rencounter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Zutphen,</hi> was the renowned Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> slain, being the greatest Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Age he lived in: he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with an Epitaph by the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and both Universities celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Memory with Elegies, and his Funerals were solemniz'd with great Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in <hi>London.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> laid siege to <hi>Zutphen,</hi> but the Winter Season being far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he was forced to quit the farther Prosecution of it, leaving it only blocked up, and returned to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where the States entertained him with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of his Conduct, and the ill Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances he had thereby brought them into; whereupon, he took away the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the States Council, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52243:96"/>
of the Provinces, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time was concluded the League of strict Amity between the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and the King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly designed for the maintenance of the Reformed Religion. Shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conclusion of which League, was discovered a new dangerous Conspiracy against the Queen; one <hi>John Savage,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been perswaded by some Popish Priests, that it was a meritorious Work, to take away the Lives of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Princes. Hereupon was a Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of <hi>English</hi> Catholicks, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence held with the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> the Pope, the <hi>Guises,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the other Enemies of the <hi>Queen</hi> and the Protestant Religion; but was first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by one of the Plotters themselves, and confessed by the rest, both before and at their Executions: whereupon, long Debates and Consultations were held, what was to be done with the Queen of <hi>Scots:</hi> and at length those Voices prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that were for the bringing her to her Tryal: insomuch, that the <hi>Queen</hi> was perswaded to sign a Patent for the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52243:97"/>
the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the principal Officers of the Crown, the chief Nobility of the Kingdom, and the Privy Counsel her Commissioners, to hear and try that Queens Cause. But the <hi>Queen of Scots</hi> for some time, refused to plead, as being an absolute Princess, and therefore exempted from any Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But, at length consenting, she was charged with having been privy to all the fore-mentioned Conspiracies; consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Invasion of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Queens</hi> Destruction by the confession of her Secretaries, and the rest of the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and which were confirmed by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of her own hand writing: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little to say in her own Defence, the Commissioners pronounced Sentence against her in the Star Chamber. And, in a few days after, the Parliament being convened at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Lords peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the <hi>Queen,</hi> that the Sentence against the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> might be published: But the <hi>Queen</hi> made Answer, That she could wish that that Sentence might deterr the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> from such like Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances for the future, and that some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient might be found out, for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52243:97"/>
her Life, and yet secure <hi>England</hi> and it's <hi>Queen</hi> from further Attempts and Dangers of that kind. But, both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses replyed, That neither her Majesty, nor themselves, were safe, as long as the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> was living; and pressed her so hard, that the Sentence might be put in Execution, that Commissioners were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to admonish her to prepare for Death; which News, she received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any change of Countenance, or shew of Passion. And having that Night made her Will, she, with great Courage and Devotion, prepared her self to dye the next day, and was then accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, in the six and fortieth of her Age, and seventeenth year of her Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what most perswaded <hi>Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> to suffer the Sentence to be put in Execution, was the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Ambassadors finding their Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the behalf of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> to be to no purpose, the French Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador had hired and excited some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to kill <hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> but being discovered both by the Confession of the Parties, and the French Ambassadour
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52243:98"/>
himself, and several Rumours spread abroad, that the Spanish Fleet was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy arrived at <hi>Milford</hi> Haven; that the <hi>Scots</hi> were broken into <hi>England;</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was landed in <hi>Sussex,</hi> with a strong Army; that the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> was escaped out of Prison, and levyed an armed Power; that the Northern men had raised a Rebellion; that there was a new Conspiracy to kill the <hi>Queen,</hi> and set the City of <hi>London</hi> on Fire; nay, and that the <hi>Queen</hi> was dead. Insomuch, that some Change being apprehended, the <hi>Queen</hi> was, after much Importunity, prevailed with, to sign the Sentence of Death. And the <hi>Scots</hi> report, that one of the principal Perswaders was <hi>Patrick Grey,</hi> who was sent from the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> to perswade the <hi>Queen</hi> from putting his Mother to Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was so grieved when she received the News of her Death, that she commanded her Counsellors from her Presence, caused <hi>Davison</hi> to be cited in the Star-Chamber, and fined ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds. She likewise sent one to pacifie the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> assuring that it was done against her Meaning and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52243:98"/>
giving him reasons why he should not break out into the revenge he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and signed an instrument, attested with the Great Seal, and with the hands of all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> could in no wise prejudice his Right to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Queen had sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of <hi>France,</hi> with a great sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And for a Diversion to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> she sent Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> with four Men of War, where he chased six Galleys in the Port of <hi>Cales,</hi> took, sunk, and burnt, above a hundred ships, set upon their Forts, and compelled them to yield, took a vast rich Carrack, called the St. <hi>Philip. Thomas Cavendish,</hi> with three ships, ravaged the <hi>West Indies</hi> at the same time, took and pillaged nineteen great ships, burnt and plundred a great number of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Towns, and then returned home; after having been the third, after <hi>Magellan,</hi> that had sayled round the World.</p>
            <p>During these successes of the <hi>English,</hi> the Officers of the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52243:99"/>
having proved Treacherous in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral instances, the States accused the Earl to the Queen, who thereupon called him home, and he resigned the Government to the States, <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> Son to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> succeeding in his room at the Age of Twenty Years, and the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> was made General of the <hi>English</hi> Forces in the Low Countries, with orders from the Queen to reduce the <hi>English</hi> Factions into obedience of the States, which he accordingly performed, with the help of Prince <hi>Maurice:</hi> and was in the Year 1588, which by the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Chronologers was presaged to be the Climacterical Year of the World, and indeed the Rumours of War, and the extraordinary preparations that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were making for an Invasion of <hi>England</hi> by their Invincible Armado, seemed to justify their Predictions. At this time there was a Treaty of Peace held near <hi>Ostend,</hi> between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Commissioners, but designed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> only to lull the <hi>English</hi> asleep, till their Navy was arrived upon the Coast of <hi>England.</hi> This Invincible
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52243:99"/>
Armado consisted of one hundred and thirty ships, whereof Galleasses and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons seventy two, in which were nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Thousand two hundred and ninety Souldiers; eight Thousand and fifty Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; two Thousand and eighty Gally Slaves; and two Thousand six hundred and thirty Pieces of great Canon. Twelve of their main ships being christned with the Names of the Twelve Apostles; <hi>Alphorozo Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>z</hi> de <hi>Gusman,</hi> being made principal Commander thereof. Besides extraordinary Preparations were making in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> had orders to joyn them with fifty Thousand Men.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was preparing with all diligence, as good a Fleet as she could, making the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Effingham</hi> Admiral thereof, and Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> Vice Admiral. The Lord <hi>Henry Seymour,</hi> second Son to the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> was appointed to lie upon the Coasts of the Low Countries, with forty English and Dutch ships, for the hind'ring the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth with his Forces. At home along the Coasts were disposed twenty Tousand
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52243:100"/>
Men, and besides two Armies of the choicest and expertest Men were raised, the one under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> consisting of a Thousand Horse, and two and twenty Thousand Foot, which encamped at <hi>Tilbury;</hi> the Enemy being resolved to make their first Attack upon <hi>London;</hi> the other under the Conduct of the <hi>Lord Hunsdon,</hi> consisting of thirty four Thousand Foot, and two Thousand Horse, for the Guard of the Queens Person. A Council of War was likewise established of prudent and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Officers. All Sea Ports were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise fortified and provided with all things necessary, trusty and prudent Persons put into all Offices of Trust, the most suspected Papists committed to custody, the King of <hi>Scots</hi> perswaded to declare in favour of the Queen, which he accordingly did with great Alacrity. And now at length, after several false Rumours and Alarums, the two Fleets meet and engage, and after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days Fight, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defeated: Insomuch, that of one hundred thirty four ships that set Sayl out of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> only fifty three returned into <hi>Spain:</hi> Of the four Galleasses of <hi>Naples,</hi> but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52243:100"/>
one: of ninety one Gallions, and great Hulks from divers Provinces, only thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three returned, fifty eight being lost. In short, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lost in this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fourscore and one ships, thirteen thousand five hundred and odd Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Prisoners taken in <hi>Ireland, Zeland,</hi> and the Low Countries, were above two Thousand; insomuch, that there was no Famous or Noble Family in all <hi>Spain,</hi> but what lost a Son, Brother, or Kinsman in this Expedition.</p>
            <p>During these Transactions at Sea, the Queen went in Person to <hi>Tilbury,</hi> to view the Army and Camp there, which she did with a Leaders Truncheon in her hand; and with such a Resolution, that it strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly animated the Courages of them all. And thus was that Invincible Armado ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defeated, that so many Countries had been so many Years preparing, that had been sanctified and blessed by the Pope, with all the Superstitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and though Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> had likewise sent Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Man, into the Low Countries, and renewed the Bulls and Declarations of his Predecessours, excommunicating the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52243:101"/>
               <hi>Queen,</hi> dethroning her, absolving her Subjects from all Allegiance, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing his <hi>Croisado</hi> in Print, as against Heathens and Infidels, giving plenary Indulgences to all that should offer their Assistance. For this extraordinary Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Queen caused publick Thansgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings to be made to God throughout all <hi>England,</hi> assisting thereat her self with all Humility, Acknowledgment, and Ceremony imaginable. Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty likewise rewarded those who had signalized themselves in this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this Success, dyed the great Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> of a Fever; and the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> for the regaining again some of the Honour the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had lost in this Expedition, undertook the siege of <hi>Bergen-op-zoom;</hi> but that Place being garrison'd with English, he was beaten from before it, and forced to raise his siege.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was brought to his Tryal, for conspiring with the Pope, against the Queen; and was found guilty, and condemned by his Peers, but reprived by the <hi>Queen.</hi> In
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52243:101"/>
the mean time, Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> undertook an Expedition into <hi>Portugal,</hi> for the establishing <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> a natural Son of a King of that Realm, upon the Throne thereof; but, though they joyned with the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> who was put to Sea, without the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Leave, and advanced to the Gates of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> yet they returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having effected their Design.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Popish Princes of <hi>France</hi> entred into a new Combination, for the extirpating the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Kingdom, calling this their Association, the holy League. The Head of this League was the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who finding his Party much the strongest, and being above measure extolled by the Catholicks of all Parties, it inspired him with the Vanity of aiming at the Crown for himself; which the King being sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, caused him to be put to Death, at the Assembly of <hi>Blois,</hi> in the midst of all his Hopes. Hereupon, extraordinary Combustions and Distractions followed; and at length, the King himself was most impiously murdered by a Monk; after which, the Popish Faction proclaimed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52243:102"/>
the Cardinal of <hi>Bouillon</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> but the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> being the next Heir, proclaimed King at the same time by all true Subjects, and supplyed with Men and Money by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he not only maintained his Cause against his Enemies, but vanquished them upon all Occasions. It was now, that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> contracted Marriage with <hi>Ann</hi> Daughter of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> with Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Consent; and which was afterwards consummated by him in <hi>Norway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Queen conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued her Preparations against all Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of her Enemies; she likewise soon quashed and quieted the Commotions that were then in <hi>Ireland,</hi> composed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the Differences that were amongst the States of the Low Countries, took care to assist them against their Enemies; restrained Pyrates, and upon the Desire of the French King, sent the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> with an Army to his Assistance, wherein the English performed extraordinary things; and Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Nation, sent a Challenge to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to encounter two hundred
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52243:102"/>
Pike-men of the <hi>English,</hi> and a hundred Musqeteers, with as many <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in open Field; for which, and several other couragious Exploits, the French King highly extolled him, in his Letters to the Queen. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> and Prince of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> being under ill Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances with the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> implored Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Intercession in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; which she readily granted, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Peace for them upon very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Terms.</p>
            <p>At this time, <hi>Brian O Rorl,</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, was convicted at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and hanged for High Treason; as likewise, one <hi>Hacket,</hi> with his Adherents, for their blasphemous Carriage and Expressions. A new Proclamation came out likewise against the Papists, and for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. Sir <hi>John Perrot</hi> was likewise about this time, tryed and condemned for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but reprieved by the <hi>Queen.</hi> About this time, the Colledge of <hi>Dublin</hi> was constituted an University; and then broke out some new Troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> through the Instigations of the Lord <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> for which he was proclaimed a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52243:103"/>
In the mean time dyed the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> a Person of extraordinary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments, and admired by his very Enemies. Just before whose Death, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was recalled home out of <hi>France,</hi> after very great performances, and having challenged the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Roàn,</hi> one of the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords of <hi>France,</hi> who thought it not safe to answer him. In the mean while Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was sent into <hi>America,</hi> with a considerable Fleet, for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the <hi>Spanish</hi> Navy, but receiving intelligence, that it would not come out that Year, he divided his Fleet to see what other Prizes they could get, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon took a great <hi>Coraque,</hi> called, <hi>The Mother of God,</hi> the Prize being valued at above an hundred and fifty thousand Pounds sterling, besides what the Officers and Souldiers had pilfred for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>French</hi> King being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Catholick, and having by an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour acquainted Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with the necessity there was so for him to do, the Queen endeavoured to divert him from that resolution, and reduce him into

the Bosome of the true Church; Writing to him in these very Terms. <hi>Alas! what Grief, what Anxiety of Mind hath befallen me, since I heard this News? Was it possible that worldly respects should make you lay aside the Fear of God? Could you think that he who hath hitherto upheld and kept you, would now at the last leave you? It is a dangerous thing to do evil that good may come thereof. But I hope your mind may alter. In the mean while I will pray for you, and beg of</hi> God, <hi>that the hands of</hi> Esau <hi>may not hinder the Blessing of</hi> Jacob. To which that King replyed, <hi>That though he had done this of his own Person out of necessity, yet he would never be wanting to those of the reformed Religion, but would take them into his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Care and Protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, was executed one <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> for endeavouring to perswade the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> to take upon him the Title of <hi>England,</hi> in Right of Descent from a Daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, which the Earl refused to do, and likewise dyed shortly after.</p>
            <p>At this time broke out several fresh Rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly suppressed through the Queens
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52243:105"/>
Prudent Care and Conduct; as likewise several Questions were started about the Succession, some framing a Right in the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> others in the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> and Books were likewise printed in favour of their Titles, by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Party. During these Disputes, was born <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whom the <hi>Queen</hi> was Godmother; and now the Papists renew their Attempts against the <hi>Queens</hi> Life, having by a great Sum of Money perswaded one <hi>Roderick Lopez,</hi> a Jew, and Physician to the <hi>Queen,</hi> to Poyson her; and had likewise engaged several <hi>Portugals</hi> in the same Design; but this Plot of theirs being discovered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted Letters, and afterwards confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by their own Confessions, they were accordingly executed, as likewise one <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Cullen</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Man, who had been sent by the <hi>English</hi> Fugitives to kill the <hi>Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst other Expeditions and Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of the <hi>English</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> was that of <hi>James Lancaster,</hi> who returned home about this time, after having took nine and thirty <hi>Spanish</hi> ships, and loaded fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen more with the Wealth of an <hi>Indian Caraque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:52243:105"/>About this time, <hi>William Russel,</hi> young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Son of the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> was sent Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the room of Sir <hi>William Fitz Williams,</hi> who was called home; and this new Deputy quickly brought the Rebells there to submission. There was likewise a new, but false rumour, spread abroad, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were equipping a Fleet for the invading of <hi>England</hi> again. At which time two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists were executed for having designed the Death of the <hi>Queen.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> was now making Levies all over <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the joyning with <hi>Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> and resisting the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> being now under some Disgrace at Court, undertook a Voyage to <hi>Guyana,</hi> and though he did considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dammage to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet this Expedition was of little advantage to the <hi>English</hi> or himself. Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> and Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> with several others, went again into <hi>America,</hi> but not meeting with the success they had promised them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they dyed, what of Grief, what of sickness, and the Fleet returned home without having done any great Exploits. During these Expeditions abroad, the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52243:106"/>
Combustions in <hi>Ireland</hi> being grown to a considerable height, and those Rebells ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving craved the assistance of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> was sent over thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with new Forces to aid the Deputy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arch Duke</hi> and Cardinal of <hi>Austria</hi> being now made Governour of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Netherlands, he unexpectedly attacqued and took in <hi>Cales.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Queen</hi> sent supplies of Money to the <hi>French</hi> King, and gave order for the immediate raising a choice Army, whereof she made the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> General, and fitted out a Fleet under the Command of <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> Lord High Admiral of <hi>England:</hi> these Forces (amongst whom were several Volunteers of the Principal Nobility and Gentry) being put on Board the ships, they set Sail under the Conduct of the foresaid Lords, under Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> and other the Principal Commanders of the Realm, and arrived before <hi>Cales;</hi> and having before received intelligence that there lay at Anchor in that Haven, several Galleys, Men of War, and a number of Merchants, it was resolved in the Council of War, that they should be attacked. Whereupon the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52243:106"/>
Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> flung up his Hat for joy. The <hi>English</hi> thereupon first engaged the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships and Gallions, which they did with that Vehemence, that some were burnt by them, others by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> themselves, but the Gallies made their escape by creeping along the shoar. When the Sea engagement was at an end, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> landed with eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers at <hi>Puntal,</hi> about a League from the Town of <hi>Cales,</hi> and the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces that were there abouts, being drawn up between the Town and them, with design to have intercepted them, the <hi>English</hi> attacqued them with that fury, that they put them to rout, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, they thought fit to make a feigned Retreat, that the Fugitives might rally and joyn the Troops of <hi>Cales,</hi> which such a Stratagem was hoped might entice out of the Town. Which succeeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, they fell upon them again with that English Fury and Courage, that great numbers of them were slain, and the rest were forced to take refuge in the Town, where the English quickly overtook them; for the Gate being broke by Sir <hi>Francis</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:52243:107"/>
               <hi>Vere,</hi> and other parts of the Town scaled by the <hi>English,</hi> insomuch, that that weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Town was taken by Assault, and the Castle upon Condition, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants might depart with Cloaths on their Back, the rest left for Plunder; the Castle being to be redeemed for five hundred and fourscore thousand Duckets; forty of the Principal Cittizens being sent Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for the payment into <hi>England,</hi> a vast quantity of Money and Ammunition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in the Town. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewise proffered Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> two Millions of Duckets to exempt their ships from firing, which he would not hearken to; saying, That he <hi>was sent to destroy ships, not to dismiss them upon Composition.</hi> And it was generally calculated and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all People, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was damnified by this Expedition, twenty Millions of Duckets. The Fleet being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home after this Glorious Victory, the Queen made Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Briel,</hi> and rewarded all the rest according to their Deserts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the mean time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Honour he had lost at <hi>Cales,</hi> set forth a new great Fleet for the Invasion of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52243:107"/>
               <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but were most of them castaway by Storm, before the News of their fitting out came into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Queen fortify'd her Ports, and provided her self against any farther Attempts of that kind. She likewise entred into a League Offensive and Defensive, with the French King, hearing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a new Navy against <hi>Ireland.</hi> Whereupon, the Queen caused a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fleet, under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> to put forth to the Coast of <hi>Spain.</hi> After they had taken and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some Towns, and likewise, made a Prize of some of their <hi>India</hi> Ships, they returned home, but not with all the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess they had promised themselves at their setting out, by reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds and Tempests they had met with in their Voyage. <hi>Essex,</hi> at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Court, was something disgusted to find that some of his Competitors to the <hi>Queens</hi> Favours, had been raised to new Honours, Dignities and Places during his Absence; but was something pacified by the Queens creating him Earl Marshal of <hi>England.</hi> But, during these Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52243:108"/>
the <hi>English</hi> did extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances in <hi>France,</hi> in behalf of that King, which he acknowledged in his Letters to the Queen; and craved farther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Assistance from her Majesty, upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having gained some Advantage over him, which was accordingly granted. But the French, a while after, upon the Instigation of the Pope, concluded Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> notwithstanding the Instances that were made to him by the Queen and the States General, to the contrary. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed a Consultation, whether a Treaty of Peace was to be held with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> which being opposed by the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> was laid aside for som time; but then again revived, through the Mediation of the French, and the Commissioners met accordingly at <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loign;</hi> but upon Dispute of Precedency, was broken off altogether.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> breaking out into open Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having gained a greater Victory of the <hi>English</hi> than the Irish had ever done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after some debate, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was sent thither, with ample Authority; but not meeting with that Success he had
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52243:108"/>
promised, and having Intelligence, that his Conduct was become suspected at Court, he returns into <hi>England</hi> without the Queens Permission; whereupon, he was committed to Custody, and brought to a private Tryal; but, upon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Repentance, was again set at Liberty: yet, being reproached with pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity by some of his Cabal, he turned Male-content, used all means to gain the Peoples Love, resolves to sieze on the <hi>Queen;</hi> but being disappointed, he retired into the City, endeavouring to engage the Citizrns on his side; which not being able to effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he yielded himself up at length to the Lord Admiral, and was sent to the Tower, with his great Friend, the Earl of <hi>Southampton;</hi> both whom, being brought to their Tryal, were found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by their Peers; and <hi>Essex</hi> accordingly beheaded: but the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> the Queen was graciously pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve. But others of his Adherents, as Sir <hi>Charles Dorves,</hi> Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> one <hi>Cuffe</hi> and <hi>Merrick</hi> suffered likewise Death; the two former being beheaded, and the two latter executed at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:52243:109"/>In the mean time, happened the famous Battel of <hi>Newport,</hi> under the Conduct of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> where the Dutch gained a great Victory by the English Valour, who were led by Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Horatio;</hi> they slew nine thousand of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the English being but fifteen hundred, had eight hundred slain and mortally wounded, eight Captains killed, every man of the rest hurt.</p>
            <p>During these Occurrences, dyed <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> returned home from an Expedition he had undertook against the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> wherein he did great Dammage to them, but gained little profit to himself. About this time, was executed one <hi>Edward Squire</hi> for attempting to kill and poyson the Queen, and some of her chief Ministers, having been excited thereunto by the Jesuits and Popish Priests.
