         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Now let euery man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider with himſelf, how

This conſideration wyth himſelfe ſhall worke in
him much good effecte, and ſtand him in greate
ſteede, that in caſe his bodye be luſtie and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
hee maye in the ſame ſtate ſtil continue and
cheeriſh it wyth helpes and preſeruations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and not in ſo good caſe of ſoundnes as before it
was, then to ſeeke wayes and meanes how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
&amp; bring it againe to his former ſtate of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines.
For as humours are eaſely chaunged
one into another, and ſuffer mutuall tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
throughe moderate exerciſe, and ſuch conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient

And euen as wee ſee members fractured, burſte,
wrenched and diſlocated, to be brought into theyr
right places agayne: ſo may health (beinge em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred)
bee reſtored and reduced into his former
integritie. For the mindes and bodyes of men
be in a maner as it were yong Sproutes &amp; trees,

Contrarywyſe, if the huſbande be negligent &amp;

The like reaſon is to be yelded of the mindes of

towardly natures, which by vnthrifty compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and lewd education, do degenerate from their
good inclination of nature, and become altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rebellious, wilfull, lewde and barbarous.
Some againe, whoſe nature is proue and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to euill, yet by helpe of learninge and good
education are reclaymed and wonne from theyr
froward diſpoſition &amp; become worthy members,

therefore no man is to thincke or perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that an ill nature may not be altered, ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
rude wittes, not yet trayned to any diſcipline and

to learne any knowledge, and vertue, any
ciuilitye: and by artificiall inſtruction bee
trayned to conceyue Artes and behauiour both
comely and commendable. Thus likewyſe in
graffinge and planting (which is as wittie a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
&amp; as proper a feate as any) we ſee wild trees
to chaunge their olde nature, and to beare fruite
both holſome and toothſome. Amonge wyeld
Beaſtes alſo, we ſee how the dilligence, forecaſt,
wit and pollicie of man maketh them tame &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable.
An example hereof maye wee ſee in

               <p>But that perſons of Melancholique nature

may be altered and brought to a better ſtate, there
is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that needeth to doubt. For who doth
not plainly ſee, that ſtrong and very hoate wyne,

be alayed? Semblably againe, wyne that is ſmal,
myngled, and of watry relice, yet beinge put to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And ſo humours in a man being eyther of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

thinges,<note place="margin">The bodye conſiſteth in thre things.</note> in whoſe temperature and moderation,

vitall moyſture, naturall heate, &amp; Spirite, which

vertue &amp; nature, vnto them: our preſent purpoſe
being conſidered, we cannot by order chooſe, but
of neceſſity muſt preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſomwhat ſpeake therof.
Vitall moyſture is the nouriſhmente and matter
of naturall heate,<note place="margin">Humour.</note> whereupon it woorketh, and by
the benefite therof is maintayned and preſerued.
With this Humour or vitall moyſture, is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
heate fed and cheeriſhed, and from the ſame
receyueth continuall mayntenaunce,<note place="margin">Heate.</note> and from it
participateth vitall power, whereby all Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

Heate,<note place="margin">Spirite.</note> by whoſe helpe and myniſterye, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
and ſente by the conduites and paſſages of
the Arteryes, to euery ſeuerall part of the bodye.
Wherefore worthyly is this Spirite thought to
be the chiefe and principal Inſtrument, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth

               <p>Theſe three do vnſeperably cleaue together, &amp;

this cauſe, do wee thus in one definition expreſſe,

wythin one definition. Naturall heat is nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
els, but an originall humour, wyth vitall ſpirite
and heate totally moyſtened. But foraſmuch as
Spirite conteyneth vitall heate, and is of all the
faculties, ruler and directer, ſpredeth it ſelf moſt
ſwiftly throughoute the whole body, caryeth and
extendeth his powers into euery part thereof v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſally,
&amp; beſyde this, doth manifeſtly chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
and alter the ſtate both of body and minde: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

mingled wyth anye ſtraunge or forrayne quality,
it cauſeth tranquillity of minde, frameth maners
in good order &amp; faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and finally qualifyeth and
calmeth all affections.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The minde of man to honeſtie it frames,</l>

I will particularly ſet downe the procreation of
the Spirits, wyth theyr nature, power, differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and effectes: beginninge firſt at the powers and
faculties natural. For by theyr office is it brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
to paſſe, that the meate we eate is concocted &amp;
turned into the nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the body. Alſo ther
be foure vertues, whereby all lyuing Creatures
wyth meate receyued, are nouriſſhed &amp; encreaſed:
The firſt attractiue, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d retentiue,<note place="margin">Foure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral povvers.</note> the third
digeſtiue, and the fourth expulſiue. To
wich vertues or powers, appendant and belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb facs="tcp:23656:17"/>
to all the parts of the body, the firſt &amp; chiefe
originall of the Spirites oughte to be referred.
For firſt, aſſoone as the meate is mynced &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
wyth the teeth,<note place="margin">The office of digeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> it deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth into the ſtomack,
beinge thither attracted, then digeſted, and made
ſubſtantiall and turned to the proper nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and encreaſe of the member. And ſuch part or
porcion thereof, as ſerueth not to this vſe, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
and reiecteth. Here therefore the Spirite
hath his firſt beginning. And if nature be good
&amp; ſtronge in this office of digeſtion, it happeneth
thereby that the Spirites be made pure, cleare,
and ſyncere:<note place="margin">Howe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are cauſed.</note> but if concoction bee hindred, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other diſtemperatnes happen, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the meate
altered and chaunged into vaporous belchinge,
ſtinking fumes, and fulſome breathing, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
vp out of the ſtomack, diſturbe and hurt
the brayne and minde, inſomuche y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſuch perſons
are eaſely &amp; quicklye prouoked to brawlinge, chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ſtrife and diſſention. For when the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
be not ſufficiently and ynough concoted
and attenuate, vnpure Spirites proceede out of
them, enforcing a manifeſt alteration of the ſtate,
aſwell of the body as of the minde.<note place="margin">Cruditie hurtfull.</note> And therefore
in anye wyſe, cruditie is to be auoyded, becauſe it
maketh ill humours &amp; troubled Spirits, aſwell
of meates of good iuyce, as of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are bad:
albeit the diſeaſes engendred by want of concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of meates hurtfull, bee worſe and of more
daunger. For they cauſe loathſome ſmelles and
fulſome belchings, and make the body to breake
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23656:17"/>
oute illfauourably in euerye place wyth ſcabbes,
botches, blaynes, and mangmeſſe.</p>
               <p>For when there is aboundance of humours in
the body,<note place="margin">Oppilation and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, the original cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</note> it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but Agues muſt nedes
bee engendred of that continuall obſtruction and
putrefaction: and ſtoare of diſeaſes muſte needes
ſpring oute thereof, vnleſſe thoſe excrementes by
continual labour and conuenient exerciſe be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and the humours reduced into good bloud.
For then a ſweete pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſente proceding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
comforteth the head and tempereth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenientlye
moyſteneth the brayne. Otherwyſe,
if concoction be troubled, there do ſtrike vp into
the head, groſſe &amp; fumie vapours, ſuch as by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
we ſee greene woode to make, that is ſmered
and couered ouer wyth pitch and talowe. And
hereupon it happeneth that the minde ſometime
conceyueth ſtraunge and abſurde imaginations,
yea ſometimes falleth into dotage, rauing, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
phrenſie, melancholy, furie or ſome other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperaunce.</p>
               <p>But if the Stomacke do his parte and office
throughly, if concoction be not altogether hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and that the paſſages aboute the Lyuer, and
the other partes of the body, do giue free paſſge
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humours, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vaspours aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vp into
the head, are nothing ſo hurtfull, neyther do they
greatlye diſturbe and trouble the inward minde:
and yet is not a man altogether cleare and free
from affections: but they be ſuch (I ſaye) as hee
hath in his owne power, eaſely to qualifye, ſtay,
<pb facs="tcp:23656:18"/>
and inhibite. Naturall Spirite therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
made of the pureſt alimente in the Lyuer, is
the beginninge of the reſidue. For by it is the
vitall ſpirite and the animall alſo nouriſhed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that the power or facultie animall, vſeth
the ſpirit natural as an inſtrument to theſe great
affections and motions, whereunto (retec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>The conſideration wherof ought in y<hi rend="sup">s</hi> mindes

yet in order is it the later. For out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
which reſembleth vapour, and proceedeth
by vertue of the Lyuer, from bloud, it produceth
the vitall, whiche is of Aerye nature, and myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth
vnto it nouriſhment. And the vitall doth
procreate the Animall, which by reaſon of his
thinneſſe and ſubtility is ayrie. For it being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured,
prepared and made in the contexed net,
celles and cornerie ventricles of the brayne, is
greatly wyth ſweete ſmelles nouriſhed, and with
fragrant things refreſhed and cheriſhed. From
it is fetched and deryued al the power and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
which the ſoule hath, and from it do al actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
iſſue and proceede, making the ſame appliable to

animall ſpirite deemed the proper inſtrument of
the ſoule to all the ſences, for mayntenaunce of
mouinge and nimblenes, and for preſeruation of
the ſtrength, and firmitie of the Muſcles &amp; Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes:
for it tranſporteth and diffuſeth his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and powers (as the workemaiſters of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
into the Synewes that haue the power of
feeling and mouing.</p>
               <p>All the inſtruments therfore of the Senſes,
indued wyth this power and vertue of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
Animall, attayne thereby ſtablenes, for the
atchieuement of their functions and charges: as
for example, If the wayes and paſſages whereby
this ſpirite oughte to goe and haue paſſage, bee
<pb facs="tcp:23656:23"/>
ſtopped &amp; affected, the power of mouing and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is taken away, as we euidently note and ſee
to happen in the <hi>Apoplexie, Palſey, Tetanus,</hi> and
many diſeaſes moe. And this ſpirite Animall
is conueighed into the Synewes, euen like the

inſomuche that the ſome therewyth becommeth
ſofte and tractable: ſo dothe the Spirite that is
fineſt and thuineſt, ſlylte ſlyde into the Synewes.
All thinges therefore that neede feelinge, mouing
and agilitie, requyre the force, ayde and power of
the ſpyrite Animall: As thoſe that by nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

requyre the naturall and vitall faculties and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
Hee therefore that woulde preſerue his

keepe his body in right good plight and order.</p>
               <p>For as <hi>Galene</hi> witneſſeth: The keepinge of a

and helpe to conſerue the naturall faculties, and
to cheeriſhe the ſpirites. And as vnkindly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes

affect our bodyes, and not of men onely, but alſo

ſtate aſwel of body as of mind. For where the
Spirites be groſſe, thicke and cold, it happeneth
the minde to be ouerclowded &amp; (as the dymmed
Sunne) not to ſhyne brighte out. And this is
the reaſon, that perſons in this ſort affected haue
duller wittes, and blunter capacities. For
proofe wherof, we are to ſee and conſider, ſuch as

               <p>Seing therefore, the diuerſitie of ſpirits, and

of the condition and nature of the Place, Ayre,

in himſelf, which way he may beſt prouide for

ſuch thinges as may in any wiſe harme, annoye,

               <p>It is therefore moſt expediente to obſerue the

be folowed,<note place="margin">Good diet, &amp; holeſome Ayre.</note> and to liue in the holeſommeſt ayre.
For theſe be the things that reſtore health when
<pb facs="tcp:23656:27"/>
it is decayed or empaired, and which make the
Spirites moſt pure and ſyncere. For if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
do abounde and be full of ill humours, if the
Spirites bee vnpure, and the brayne ſtuffed full
of thicke fumes proceedinge of humours, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
and Soule conſequentlye cannot but ſuffer
hurte, and bee thereby likewiſe damnifyed.
Hence proceedeth (as from the verye cauſe) ſuch
rauing dotage, &amp; diſtraughtnes of righte witts,
hence iſſueth blockiſhnes, fooliſhnes, madnes,
and furie, in ſo much that they thinck ſometimes
to ſee thoſe thinges that are not before their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to ſee, and to heare ſuche woordes as no man
ſpeaketh. For imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in them is marred,
common ſenſe (which iudgeth and diſcerneth all

dymmed, their eyes dazelled, and all the faculties
of the Soule (that is to ſaye) all the naturall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
whereby it accompliſheth all his functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,

               <p>But if the Spirite animall be perfectly pure
&amp; ayrie, (ſuch as is the ſent of Bloud exactlye la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured)
not onely the ſight of their eyes is cleare

that the verye beginninges of mans nature and

and conteyne within them the qualityes aboue

whych is the Image of the mynde, in the

of the inward conceiptes: in the colour, linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,

<pb facs="tcp:23656:44"/>

an abſolute conſtruction and comely frame of al

hayre of fayre aburne or cheſten colour: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
ſmoth, cheerefull and vnwrynckled, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
wyth comely eyebrowes, and greatly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
wyth a paire of amyable eyes, not holow, but
delightfully ſtandinge out. The colour freſhe,
ſweete and pleaſaunte. The cheekes and the
balles therof ſteygned and dyed in a perfect hew
of whyte and redde, and that naturally, ſpeciallye
in the luſty yeares of Adoleſcencie. The porte &amp;

Whereby it happeneth that in the bodye

and the vſe and purpoſe for which hee was
ſent and giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs: yet is there nothing to the

that there was in him ſuch an excelling forme of
bodelye ſhape, as for ſuch a dignitye and maieſtie

yonge men, who maryinge to ſoone, and ere they

any children, for that they lacke manly ſtrength, &amp;
theyr ſeede to cold and thinne. It is therefore
by reaſon of heate, that men be hayrie and bolder
then women be. But if heate encreaſe in mans

that through Choler y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud be ſtyrred and too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

not for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they bee withoute nature: but for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
they be thinges that be not naturally within but
wythout vs: and for that, by theyr vſe and effect
and by the order of their qualitye and meaſure,
they do empaire and dainnyflte nature if they bee
not well and aptlye vſed. Of the which ſorte
are theſe: Ayre that enclooſeth vs, Meate and
Drincke, Exercyſe and Reſte, Sleepe &amp; Watch,
Euacuation and retention, and the Affections of

againe thence to diſpoſſeſſe them. Seing therfore,

my next ſpeach to diſcourſe vpon it, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
(if it be poſſible) it may be amended and brought
to a better caſe. For ſithens lyfe doth conſiſt in
a temperature of hoate &amp; moyſte, whereby bodies
encreaſe to their growth, and attaine to manlye
ſtrength and ſtature: worthelye and by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
may this be accompted of al others y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt,
for that, in euery point and reſpecte (that tendeth
to the furtheraunce of ſtrength &amp; mayntenaunce
<pb facs="tcp:23656:69"/>
of health) it helpeth no whit, neyther geeueth any
encreaſe thereto at all. For conſideringe that in
it there lacketh heate, and all the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
naturall, it is not able for the weakenes
of the Inſtrumentes and Organes, to attracte &amp;
digeſt that nouriſhment y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is moyſte, nor to make
it lyke and conſubſtantial witht he body and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.<note place="margin">Heate the ſtayer and maintener of lyfe.</note>
And euen as naturall heate of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in the bodye is ſtrongeſt to do his functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
ſo, Cold is cleane contrarye vnto it, and fit
for no function, ſpecially concerninge the Acte of

yet,<note place="margin">Cold cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled wyth heate.</note> in this quality (although it wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of integritye
and temperature) there is alwayes ſome heate,
but the ſame is very fainte, weake, and throughe
colde, blunte and feeble. For if heat ſhoulde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallye
fayle, or bee vtterlye extinguiſhed, life
coulde not continue. Therefore in this body,
heate is not altogether conſumed and waſted,
but cold is aboue it and ouercommeth it, and in
the mixture of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other qualityes,<note place="margin">In cold bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes heate doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lacke.</note> is more in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
and ſtronger then any other, and thereuppon
hath it his name to be termed, Cold. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo longe as lyfe remayneth in man, and anye

expedient by al wayes and meanes to ſtyrre vp &amp;

But if we be diſpoſed particulerly to marke &amp;
obſerue al the notes and tokens thereto incident,
we ſhall finde in the colde complexioned body, all
things contrary and diuerſe from the hoate. For
the bodye is pilde and ſmoth, the hayre looſe and
ſoft, of colour partakinge wyth redde and white,
and quickly ſhedding. The ſkinne in touching,
cold,<note place="margin">Idlenes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy fat and cold.</note> &amp; vnder it, ſome ſtore of fatnes. For when

which, as it much happeneth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feminine Sexe,
ſo alſo breedeth it in many others that liue ydle &amp;
at eaſe, withoute labour or exerciſe. And for this
cauſe through immoderate coldnes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
groſſe, fat, and corpulent: againe, by immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
heate, (which melteth awaye and diſſolueth
fat) the body is made leane and drye.</p>
               <p>For there be manye thinges not comminge to
man by nature, or from his natiuitye and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but accidentally and otherwiſe procured: as
eyther by chaunginge of the ordinary cuſtome of
life, or by alteration of diet, or by heate, labour,
ſlouth, ſolitarineſſe, lumpiſhnes, feare, ſorrowe,
care and ſondry others: many wayes chaunginge
the ſtate of the body: making it ſomtime ſlender &amp;
leane, ſometime fat &amp; corpulent. Which thinges

fayre or foule, good or badde, are of no leſſe force,

               <head>¶Of a Drye Complexion.
The ix. Chapter.</head>
               <p>FOraſmuche as that diſpoſition and habite of
bodye which is drye, is muche like to that
ſtate and complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is cold, yea next vnto
it: I will briefly declare, what I thincke thereof,
&amp; by what meanes it maye be expunged and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
Theſe ii. qualityes bee in a maner alike
diſtant from perfecte and good temperatenes, in
what age ſoeuer they happen: howbeit in Olde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
this drye diſtemperaunce, can hardelyer and
wyth much more adoe be qualefyed and vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
then in Youth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame ill habite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
through Sickenes or incontinencie of lyfe.
For as Oldmen by reaſon of theyr age and long
continuaunce of yeares haue bodyes drye, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyne
and forworne: So lykewyſe Yongmen by
diſſolute lyuing, vnſeaſonable watching, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Venerye, brynge their bodyes before
their due time to a cold and drye diſtemperaunce:
&amp; haſtening their owne deathes by waſting theyr
vitall humour, arryue to their laſt endes, and dye
by naturall death aſwell as Oldme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do, although
in deede ſooner then otherwyſe they might do.</p>
               <p>And it is called naturall, becauſe it is common
to all men alike, and not able by anye meanes to
be declyned. For Oldage or the laſte caſt of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
is not to be accompted naturall, in ſuch ſorte as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23656:74"/>
encreaſing &amp; nouriſhing be, which are the workes
of nature, and whereby the naturall facultye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
and maynteyneth it ſelfe: but becauſe it
ſo falleth oute neceſſarily and by the due courſe &amp;
right order of Nature. For this is natures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
order, that all thinges hauynge beginning,
muſt alſo haue endyng, and arryue to their finall
decaye: for otherwyſe death ſhould vnproperlye
and vnaptly be termed Naturall, conſideringe it
is rather againſt Nature, and a profeſſed enemye
to our life.</p>
               <p>For if Sickneſſe (which I accompt as a ſtep
or as a Summer to death) be an habite &amp; ſtate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof: how much more is Death
to be deemed a thing contrary to Nature, which
quight abolyſheth and vtterly deſpoyleth lyfe?</p>
               <p>For nothyng is more repugnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the lawes of
Nature, then to dye, &amp; to be depryued of this moſt
pleaſaunt light and breath. Which thing euerye
man maye trye, and in himſelfe fynde moſt true,
when ſoeuer hee calleth to mynde, and deepely
wyth himſelfe falleth into anye cogitacion of the
ſame:<note place="margin">Death dreadfull.</note> for it dryueth a certayne fearefulnes, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
&amp; dread into his mynde, that (were not his
mynde armed &amp; ſtrengthened wyth an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hope and expectation of an other better lyfe
hereafter) there could nothing be more miſerable
nor in worſe caſe, then mans life is. For what
thing could delyuer vs out of feare, carefulneſſe,
deſperation and diſtruſte, ſauinge onely a firme
<pb facs="tcp:23656:75"/>
truſt in Gods mercy, that our Soules after this
corporall diſſolution, ſhalbe tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſported to a place
of eternal ioy and felicitie? As for death, it was
not brought into the world by Nature: for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
face of Sinne,<note place="margin">Sinne the cauſe of ſick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes &amp; death</note> and the wilful tranſgreſſion of
Gods preceptes at the beginninge of the worlde
gaue vnto vs this deadly wounde, &amp; wrapped vs
in: all this myſery. Therfore death is called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
not in reſpecte of Nature, but of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
becauſe it hangeth indifferently ouer all
mens heads,<note place="margin">Sap. 2.</note> as common indifferently to all, and
ſparing none: yea all thinges be wythin the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
and reach thereof.</p>
               <p>Now foraſmuch as there be two ſorts of death,
the one Violente &amp; the other Natural:<note place="margin">2. Kindes of death.</note> that kind
of death is of Philoſophers &amp; Phyſitions called
naturall, which happeneth vnto Oldemen &amp; ſuch
as are in that bodely ſtate that Oldemen be: that
is to ſay Cold and Drye, wythout ſenſe or feeling
of any payne: for in them, their languiſhinge and
forſpent body forſaketh their Soule, and not the
Soule their body. Inſomuch that they dye in a
maner as though they fell ſoftly aſleepe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
others (dyinge by meanes of caſualty, ruine,
fyer, ſword, Squinſte, Pleuryſſe, Infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of
the Lunges or other diſeaſes happening to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in his fulneſſe of humours) dye a violent death,
ſtruggling painfully, and long languiſhing in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
agonies before they giue by the Ghoſt. So
that the Soule is perforce compelled to abando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and forſake the body, lyke a Gheſt that fleethout
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23656:75"/>

wryte,<note place="margin">De Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect.</note> that Yongmen and ſuche as bee in
their flouriſhinge and luſtye Age and full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
do dye and take their ende muche like as
when a great flaming fyer is ſodeinlye quenched
with great ſtoare of Water: Againe, he ſayth
that Oldmen deceaſe like fyer, that of it owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
quencheth and wythout anye other violence
goeth out. What a deale of ſmoake, what ſoote,
what ſparkles do we ſee fly vp into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayre? what
crackling &amp; noyſe doth the great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of ſparkes

to ſlecke a great heape of woode layed al vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
one fyer? Wherby we may coniecte, what
vehement and painefull ſtruggling, what ſharpe
conflicte, what raginge ſturre and ſtryuing is in
a Yonge bodye: when as throughe violence of
Sickneſſe or other deſtenie, the luſtyneſſe of his
Nature (being not yet ſpent) &amp; his warme heat,
and lyuely Spyrites be oppreſſed and ſtifled.</p>
               <p>To this ende, is that elegante and apt compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Cicero:</hi> For (ſayth hee) as rawe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rype
apples are not plucked from the Tree but
by violence and force: but beyng rype, fall downe
of theyr owne accord, or wyth little touchinge:
So lykewyſe the lyfe of Yonge men is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

For wee commonly ſee that thoſe perſons which
be groſſe, corpulent and moyſt of body, are for the

their power retentiue is not fyrme and ſtronge, &amp;
becauſe their pores and paſſages are made open
and wyde, for the humours to paſſe out.</p>
               <p>In Bodyes which be hoate and drye, al things
happen contrary, becauſe in them the power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue
is ſtrong, but the expulſyue (by meanes of
dryneſſe, and for that, the paſſages be empayred &amp;
decayed) is faint and weake: whereby it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that in their auoyding of excrements, going
to the ſtoole and ſkowringe theyr Entrailes, they
ſtrayne themſelues ſometime all in vaine wyth
Coughing, hawkinge &amp; vomytinge, &amp; yet be not
able by euacuation to eaſe themſelues.</p>
               <p>Thus the moyſt Complexion being aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the dry, hath all things and propertyes in a
maner from it contrary, euen as the caſe ſtandeth
betweene Children and Olde folke. For in
Childhoode, heate by litle and litle encreaſeth, &amp;
hauyng more ſtore of moyſtneſſe, groweth more &amp;
more, til they come to ful age and mans ſtrength.
But in Old age, this heate by litle and litle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth,
and when moyſture is all waſted a man
falleth into a cold and drye diſtemperaunce, and
finally thereby brought to his death. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For their veynes and arteryes being ſlender
and ſtreict, and alſo voyd of bloud and Spyrite,
theyr natural heate is quickly and for euery light
cauſe oppreſſed and ſtyfeled, which thing is ment
by <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> where he ſayth:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Aphor. 44.</note> They that be by
nature very porzy &amp; groſſe, liue as long as they

wyde, and their conceptacles of bloude large, ſo
that lightlye no outwarde or inwarde cauſes can
greatly hurte them. Which perſons althoughe

bring themſelues many times to this porzynes &amp;

whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any diſcraſie happeneth, as they that be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſame conſtitution and ſtate from their firſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning.
For although ſome which in their youth
were ſlender &amp; leane, happen afterward to be fat,
groſſe, and fleſhie: yet their veynes, Arteryes and
other paſſages and cunduites of their bodyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
ſtill large and wyde: which thing plainlye
appeareth, whenſoeuer they (feeling themſelues
not wel at eaſe) haue any occaſion to be let bloud.
For in this accidentall habite of body, althoughe
the party be fat and forgrowen, yet the veynes lye
not hid &amp; vnappearing, as in them that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be groſſe: but ſwel out and plainlye appeare to
the eye, offering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the Lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by inciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

keepeth away Oldage, &amp; ſuffereth not the body to
grow into dryneſſe: yet if it exceede toofarre, or
ſtand in the point of extremity, it is daungerous.
For when by reaſon of the veynes beinge ful, the
body ceaſſeth to be nouriſhed, and the faculties of
nature (which diſtribute nouriſhmente) intermit
their office and cannot worke, in this caſe needes
muſt the body go to wracke and incurre inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,

nature and condition of the Humours that rule

Bloud is partaker of Hoat and moyſte: Choler
of hoat and Dry: Phlegme of Cold and moyſte:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:23656:93"/>
and Melancholie of Cold and dry. Therefore
that Temperament which is Hoate and moyſt,
may very well be referred to a Sanguine man:
Hoat and dry, to a Cholerique: and ſo forth of the

holeſome humours, to the conſeruation of health

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23656:128"/>
Foraſmuch therefore as the vertue and power
Memoratiue, conſiſteth in a ſure, faythful, and
ſtedfaſt keeping and conſeruation of Images, it
foloweth, that the same in Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others as haue moyſt Braynes, is weak &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
retentiue.<note place="margin">Old folk, &amp; yonge Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue ill memories, but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the other.</note> Old folkes alſo haue the ſame
imbecillity and forgetfulnes, and the reaſon is,
becauſe their braynes be ſo cold and dry, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
is able to enter or fyrmelye to bee impryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
therein: and for theſe cauſes, both ſortes of
them be obliuious and nothinge Memoratyue.
For of this (as alſo of all the inward ſenſes) the
power and facultie is according to the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Brayne. For oute of the groſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of that part,<note place="margin">Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the braine, the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Memory.</note> or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Spyrits and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
therein be groſſe, thicke and wyth manye
vapours peſtered, proceedeth Obliuion, ſlownes
to vnderſtande, &amp; hardnes to conceyue. Againe,
of a moyſt Brayne, that is too liquide, commeth
forth a dul or blunt ſenſe, and a Memory nothing
retentyue but ſonne forgetting. And a dry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the Brayne maketh a very weake and
ill memory: by reaſon, that it wil not eaſely admit
anye impreſſion (euen like vnto a piece of Leade,
Yron or Steele, which will not eaſelye ſuffer the
poynte of anye engrauinge Toole to enter and
pearce into it.</p>
               <p>A good ſtedfaſt and fryme Memory therefore
is to be referred vnto the diſpoſition and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
of the Brayne: &amp; this power of the minde,
is aſcribed to the benefite of Nature: but yet ſo,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23656:128"/>
that it may be holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and maynteyned in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſtate by Arte,<note place="margin">Memory, the gifte of Nature, and is by Arte holpen and made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and if perhaps it decay or take
harme, yet through care &amp; induſtry, it may againe
be reſtored. And therfore ſpecial care muſt be em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ployed,
and great diligence taken, that the bodye
may in perfect health and ſound conſtitution be
preſerued: that moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both in life and diet be
vſed: always within the compaſſe of temperau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and frugality: that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meate be exactly concocted:
that the mynde be in peaceable tranquillitye, and
free from troubleſome affections: that no myſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe

and ſyncere, bee greate helpers &amp; moſt auayleable
preſeruatyues for the maintenaunce of Memory.</p>
               <p>For by theſe it happeneth that all the faculties
of the Soule (among which Memory is chiefe)
be freſh and perfect, that nothing of al that which
we eyther by view of eye, cogitation, witte, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or meditation conceyue, ſlippeth oute of our
remembraunce. Yea, many thinges that were
thought to be cleane forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and cancelled with
obliuion, be reuiued as freſh in Memory &amp; ſeeme
to the eye as plainly, as thinges but newly done:
in ſomuch, that although ſometimes wee forgette
what we did but yeſterday, yet perfectlye can wee
remember thinges done many yeares agoe, when
we were Children. The reaſon whereof I take
<pb facs="tcp:23656:129"/>
to be this,<note place="margin">The reaſon why childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber things long afore done.</note> for that, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der age and Childhode, gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,

ful of courage to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue what is put vnto them.
For whyſe the mynd is yet free from carking ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of the worlde, and not ouercharged or buſyed
with waighty matters and dealings, it retayneth
ſuerer and kepeth faſter in Memory thoſe things
which are inſtilled into it in childiſhe yeares,
their minds beinge yet free from al other cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
diſquietations.</p>
               <p>Now, although Memory and Remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

where the common witts or Senſes ſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth,

               <p>Wherefore it ſhalbe right good and expedient

anye choyſe and difference eyther neglect, or
retchleſſely forſlowe the due orders of both theſe

which a man would gladlye remember, it ſhal be
good for him to thincke vppon, and many times

For as by the corruption of our nature

we be a great deale readyer and apt to that which

then thinges of better importaunce and purpoſe:
ſo alſo thoſe that be ill, ſticke faſter in memory, &amp;
not eaſelye to be ſhaken of or abolyſhed, without

there be two ſortes and differences: the one
natural, the other beſyde nature. Natural Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
is the excrement of bloud concoct, bitter in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and in colour and effect fyerie. When the
heate of the Lyuer is moderate, then is it yealow
and ſhyninge: but when this viſcoſitye is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
enkindled, then doth Choler alſo boyle w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
heate, and is of colour darcke, Yelowiſh, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Pruſe Bier, called in Dutche <hi>Iopen Bier,</hi> or

of colour: whereby it commeth to paſſe that the

colour before Yelowe, chaungeth and is turned
into a ſadde blacke: which ſometime apparaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vttereth and ſheweth it ſelfe in the vtter parte
of the ſkinne, whenſoeuer this Cholerique Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
diffuſeth and diſperſeth it ſelfe into the
ſame ſkinne.</p>
               <p>Choler hath in the body two offices: for parte
of it being mixed wyth the bloud,<note place="margin">The office of Choler.</note> paſſeth into the
Veynes, to make the ſame more conuenientlye to
penetrate into euery one of the narow paſſages, &amp;
to bee conueighed to ſuch members as requyre &amp;
haue neede of the nouriſhment of Choler. The
other part, is ſente to the bladder of the Gall, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
and tyed to the nether ende of the Lyuer,
wherein the wonderfull prouidence of Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

               <p>For Choler is of that nature y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> yeldeth out a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

ſtirreth vp and ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeth our minds to haſty moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and furious rages.<note place="margin">Anger what it is.</note> And for this cauſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
is defined to be a heate and certaine boylinge
of the Bloud aboute the Heart, wherewith the
Braine alſo beinge excyted by Choler, is ſet in a
heate and teſtines, deſyrous of reueng, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any iniury is offered. And to the lower parts
<pb facs="tcp:23656:137"/>
prouoke and irrite the Guttes and Bowelles to
auoyde ſuperfluous excrementes: For which
purpoſe, Natures prouidence hath deuiſed and
framed ſundry paſſages needeful for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> purginge,
conueighaunce and euacuation of all ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Humours: to witte, the Kidneyes and the
Vryne Pypes, the empty or faſting Gutte called
<hi>Inteſtinum Ieiunum</hi> (which through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſowrenes
of Choler flowinge into it, continuallye dryueth

obſtructions ſhoulde happen, all the whole fylthy
maſſe of noyſome Humour, is thereby kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the body, and then geeueth violente aſſaulte to
ſome of the principall partes. So when the
bagge or Bladder of the Gall or Receptacle of
Choler, is not able to exonerate it ſelfe of that
baggage, droſſe and ſuperfluity, which it drewe
from the Lyuer: it emptyeth and caſteth it eyther
into the Uentricle, or els into the holowneſſe of
the Lyuer. And thus it commeth to paſſe, that
Choler being diffuſed and ſpred ouer all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
imperteth both his qualitye and colour to the
Bloud.</p>
               <p>Hereof commeth the Iaundice (named <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus

And if the ſmall and ſlender Gutts be therewith

               <p>This diſeaſe commeth either of an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

So if the vpper part of the Gutt be
affected, the meate is caſte vp: if the neither, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
auoydeth at the mouthe: by reaſon that the
Tuell or foundment is ſo cloſely ſhut, that not ſo
much as a poore fyeſt can paſſe or get out thence.
Manye affects beſyde, doth Choler engender, as

oughte not in any parte to be weakened, neyther

               <p>But there is an other kinde of Choler, ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

meane,<note place="margin">Yolkie Cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ler.</note> called of Phiſitions Yolkie Choler, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
his name of the yolke of an Egge, whoſe

For by meanes of his exceſſiue heate it is

which if it ſhould happen to putrefye and bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed,
it breedeth Agues moſt ardente and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Therefore forſomuch as this kinde of
Choler is ſhrunke and gone from mediocritye, it
ſhalbe expedient to frame a cleane contrary diet,
and to enſue an other maner of order, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
and dryuing away of this ſtraung quality.
For if a man ſhould ſtill cheeriſh and tender it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
his like nouriſhmentes, he ſhould do nothing elſe
but exaſperate the diſtemperaunce, &amp; encreaſe the
tyranny therof, and make it more vehement.</p>
               <p>There is alſo an other kinde of Choler, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Leekiſh,<note place="margin">Leekiſh or greeue Cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ler.</note> ſo named becauſe it is as grene as a

inſomuch that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other ſweete licour it is
hard to be gotten away and aboliſhed. Alſo this
noyſome Humour ſometime is engendred in the

with vehement inflammation of ſtraunge heate,

                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi>

               <p>Out of this proceedeth yet an other excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,

which is enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred of Leekiſh or greene Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

reſembleth the ruſt of Braſſe: which thinge wee
may plainly perceiue by hoat glowing things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
burnt in the fyer, whereunto the nature
of Choler maye verye aptly be compared. For
the force and vertue of fier, chaungeth the wood,
firſt into burning coales, then into blacke coales,
and laſt of all, when the fyer hath quite conſumed
all, and heate is ſlaked, into Aſhes. So likewyſe
