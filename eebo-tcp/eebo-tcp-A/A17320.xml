            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from you, euer since I first
entred into the sacred worke of
the Ministrie, first in Norfolke at
<pb facs="tcp:16213:3"/>
your house by Norwich, where
then you remayned, and many
times since, I doe heere (as dutie
bindeth mee) offer vnto your
VVorshipfull Patronage, this
short Treatise, of the <hi>Christians
heauenly Treasure,</hi> which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in some sort, the difference
betweene false goods and true
goods, betweene Heauen and
Earth, the riches of the one and
the riches (or penurie rather) of
the other, and the way how to
enioy the one without losse of
the other. Which is not to teach
you any thing that yet you know
not, for God bee praysed you
knew these things long agoe, but
<pb facs="tcp:16213:3"/>
(as S. <hi>Peter</hi> wrighteth) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme

Faith, which long since through
the mercy of God shined in you,
accompanied with true loue, the
handmaid of Faith, to the great
glory of God, the ioye of the
godly, and the comfort of the
Saints hearts. This Argument
doth of right belong vnto your
Worship, because the Lord hath
plentifully replenished your hart
with the loue of heauenly things
and true zeale vnto his glory, for
heauenly matters, onely in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
minds and sanctified harts
receiue kind entertainment, like

you may with holy <hi>Simeon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
in peace, and receiue with

the former part of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
condemned the fond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of Vaine-glory as
the onely bane and poyson of all good
actions, wherof he giueth three instances:

as a burning poyson that infecteth
and inflameth the inward parts, is to be
auoyded, yea, as a Theefe that robbeth

Greedy Couetousnesse or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
as Thrones that choke the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

quite away from God. To that ende
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 9</note> they that <hi>will bee rich,</hi>

out vnto him, or sound a Trumpet in
his Eare, and he heareth not, he feeleth
not: and so is it with a man whose hart
is drowned in the cares of this World,
and loue of riches. And yet those are in
greatest admiration, for the world doth
not onely desire to be hauing more still,
but doth admire those that haue world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Treasures. Therefore our Sauiour
Christ doth warne vs of that gnawing
Worme, and tels vs, that if wee bee so

finde Treasure there, but they that lay it
vp before they dye.</p>

for themselues, that they haue had great
losses, &amp;c. and therefore cannot giue any
thing to the poore, or other holy and
charitable vses, they must know that
they haue the more need to giue, and to
bee liberall, and to doe good with that
they haue, and so to lay vp in Heauen,
when the World goeth from them, or
else they will bee poore both here and
there too. Now if any man bee desirous
to know whether he hath any treasure

in heauen or no, let him take this course:
First, let him see what it is that doth
command his hart: and next what doth
most moue him, and touch him: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what hee taketh most delight in, and
what he beateth his braine about most:
and if the matters of Heauen and Gods
Kingdome doe most commaund his
heart, and occupy his head, and delight
his minde, then his Treasure is there, his
stuffe is sent before hand to the place
whether hee intendeth to remoue when
God calleth him, or else not: and this
is the summe of Christs words and holy
counsell in this place.</p>

which cannot bee expressed, because he
is infinite and incomprehensible.</p>
            <p>Of this latter it is not that hee speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
when hee saith <hi>Lay not vp for your

needes meane the former. But what?
doth the Lord Iesus meane that it is in
no wise lawfull for a Christian man to
get, or enioy the riches of this world?
not so, for in <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 4.<note place="margin">Pro. 2. 4.</note> it is said that we
must seeke for Wisedome as for golde:

country might by that meanes bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited

<pb facs="tcp:16213:10"/>
What then? doth hee meane that it is
vnlawfull to keepe any thing in store
for hereafter? Not so neither, for <hi>Ioseph</hi>
is commended for laying vp against the
time of famine,<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 35</note> yea, it is <hi>Iosephs</hi> counsell
that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> officers shall gather all
the foode of seauen plenteous yeeres,
and lay vp Corne for foode in the cities
to bee kept against the seauen yeeres of

that a man must take of earthly goods
onely so much as will serue his turne,
and cast away that which is left? Not so
neither, for in <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 12.</note> He commandeth

then? doth hee meane that wee must
not prouide for those that wee leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde

saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 14</note> 
               <hi>The Children ought not to lay

What then? doth hee meane that all
must bee common? Not so neither, for
then there could bee no breach of the
eight Commaundement if any man did
steale; and all exhortations and precepts
of distributing to the poore were in
vaine, if the poore might bee their owne
caruers of rich mens goods: yea, what
should then become of buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?

            <p>What then? doth hee mean that we

And better it is for a man to keepe his

            <p>What then? doth hee meane that a
man may liue idly, and then looke to
be maintained by others? Not so neither,
for the Apostle being ruled himselfe by

Labour not for the meate that perisheth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 27.</note>
yet his meaning is not to discharge men
of their honest labour, and following

that we must not labour so much for the

abideth to Eternall life, or that our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

            </p>
            <p>That wee may the better finde out
the Lords meaning we, are to know that
<hi>Treasure</hi> here, is put not onely for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
riches, and prouision for the time

was said before) wherein a man taketh
most delight, and whereupon hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
most, or which hee maketh his
felicitie; yea, and doth so lauish out his
loue vpon it, and torment himselfe with
careful thoughts for the same, as if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it hee should be vtterly vndone, and
could not possibly liue. In which maner
Worlldings gather riches, and Atheists
seeks after pleasure, the Ambitious man
hunts after Honour, euen with all their

            <p>Now all is made the Treasure that
the heart is set vpon, as for Example.</p>
            <p>Some men take more to heart the

               <hi>Canker corrupteth, and Theeues
dig through and steale.</hi> The summe of his
reason is this, that whatsouer this world
affordeth, is subiect to consumption, or
corruption, or both: if it bee in vse, it is
<pb facs="tcp:16213:15"/>
consumed with the vse, if it bee not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
then it corrupteth for want of vse.
The consuming and spending of these
worldly goods, is eyther by the owners
of them, or by Theeues that oftentimes
are pertakers of them to the hurt of the
owner. They are also consumed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yther
by sensible and liuing Creatures, as by
Mothes, Flyes, Mice, and Rats, and such
like: or else by insensible &amp; dead things,
as Rust, and Mould, and Fire, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and Ayre, and Age, &amp;c. Now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the matter, consult &amp; giue sentence.
What madnes is it to prouide for theeues
and Robbers? What inhumanitie to giue
that to Mothes and Mice, &amp;c. which is
better bestowed vpon thy selfe, vpon thy
familie, or vpon the poore? What va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
yea, what misery is this to bee a

Vermine, and rottennesse shall do.
minier ouer, and in a short time must
perish eyther in the vse, or for want of
vse? This doe not worldlings consider,
they locke vp, and lay vp, and put out
their Treasures to be kept for them, yet
can they not keep their garments from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16213:15"/>
Moths, nor their golde and siluer from
Rust, nor any thing they haue, from one
casualtie or another long. When they
haue gotten goods together, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
promise vnto themselues either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie
of them or securitie: And what
a misery is that? but either their goods
or themselues must weare away, and
their goods are in daunger for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
sake, and the owners are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for their goods sake.</p>
            <p>Neither are these all the discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
that thy Treasure is subiect vnto,
who knoweth not that the Fire may
consume them, as it hath done thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands?
or the Water may drowne them,
as it hath done thousands? or the Plague
may infect them as it hath done thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands?
or Time may weare them, as
it hath done millions of thousands?
or Death may fetch thee away, as it
hath done infinit millions of thousands?
Besides all this,<note place="margin">The mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of a worldling</note> consider how manie

Yet this is not all, for what restles
<pb facs="tcp:16213:16"/>
care doth teare thee in getting them?
what tormenting feare doth abate thy
comfort in keeping them? and what
hart breaking sorrow doth vexe thee
in loosing of them? Yet this is not all
neither, for here thou art praysed, there
thou art dispraysed, now thou art loued,
by and by thou art enuied, of some thou
art admired, of many thou art scorned,
and all for thy wealths sake.</p>
            <p>The worldling is like a Mill, driuen
violently by a maine streame, and great
prouision is made to feede in one place,
and to coole in another, the Sacke is
brought to feede the Mill, and the Mill
grindeth and weareth it selfe to fill the
Sacke againe, and still the Wheele is
where it was, for all his whirling about,
and as you finde it so you leaue it: so is
it with a worldly man and his goodes,
but this similitude applyeth it selfe, I
will therefore follow it no further.</p>
            <p>This wee all know, but how often,
or rather how seldome doe wee thinke
vpon it, or remember it, or make vse of
it, to stay vs from greedy coueting and
egar pursuing of the World, with the

that the Diuell concealeth; yea, he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

hee shewed Christ the glory and

of Beautie: hee sheweth
the commodities of Offices, but not the
discommodities of Offices: he sheweth
the wealth of such a Country, but not
the enuie &amp; misery of the same country.
And thus are the Fooles of this world
(as God himselfe calles them) deluded
and abused,<note place="margin">Luke. 12.</note> yea, and destroyed many

Then the fashion altereth, or the Ayre

Beleeue mee (good brethren) it will
stand vs in hand to looke lesse to our
earthly Treasure, and more after the
heauenly, least in the end wee loose
both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16213:32"/>
To conclude therefore this point:
seeing as the Christians heauenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which is both Christ himselfe and
all the riches of his Gospell bee so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
rare, and precious that nothing
may bee compared therewith; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the treasures of this his kingdome
of Grace (though they bee inestimable
and vnspeakable) are but a tast and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
of those treasures, which bee reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for the Saints in his kingdome of
glory. And lastly, seeing as they which
seeke after the heauenly Treasure, shall
also haue earthly blessings to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the same, as farre forth as God shall
see good for his children, let euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hart bee hereby moued and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to lay vp from henceforth Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in heauen, rather than on earth, sith
euery man desireth the best things.</p>
            <p>As the Christians heauenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is so bee preferred before all things,
for the Excellencie thereof, so also is it
here commended vnto vs by our blessed
Sauiour, for the Perpetuitie, and the
Securitie of the same. For their Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitie,
hee saith that neither Moth can
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16213:32"/>
eate it, nor Rust consume it. And for
their security the safe keeping, he tels thee
that they are where no Theefe can dig
through and steale them, meaning that
no enimie whether terrestiall or infern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
whether man or Diuell can possibly
deceiue thee or depriue thee of them.</p>
            <p>Now as touching the Perpetuitie
of the Christians heauenly Treasure,<note place="margin">Of their Perpetuity</note> it
is such and of so long continuance, that
euen in that respect it is to bee prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
beefore all earthly and transitorie
Commodities: for all earthly commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
and treasures they are ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ther vsed
or not vsed, if they bee put to any vse or
employment, they consume and weare:
if they be put to no vse, but lye by, then
they are corrupted, which corruption
also abateth not a little both of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and glory: But as for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Treasures of Gods grace and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
they are neyther consumed, nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
There is more vse of them then
of any earthly thing whatsoeuer, yet are
they not, neyther can they bee subiect
to any consumption: Nay, they are no
whit the worse, but much the better for
<pb facs="tcp:16213:33"/>
the vsing. Tell me, is there not a daylie
yse of Prayer, of Preaching, of Faith, of
Charitie, of Repentance, of Patience, of
Hope, of Humilitie, &amp;c. And are they
not through continuall vse encreased,
strengthened, and made easie? like the
fiue tallents, which being put forth to
aduantage, gained fiue more. And as
<hi>Milo</hi> that Tullie speakes of,<note place="margin">Milo.</note> by vsing
his strength day by day, in carrying of
a Calfe did so increase his strength, that
hee was able to beare it on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
when it was an Oxe: so doth the
Christian Soule by inuring his patience
and faith to beare smaller crosses, that in
time hee is able through daylie exercise
of the spirit, to beare greater crosses, and
to put vp mighty wrongs: Through
negligent slothfulnesse, cursed ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
&amp; prophane abusing of Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Graces, they may dye and decay
in thee, but the more they are vsed, the
more they are increased.</p>
            <p>The glorious Garment, and royall
Robe of Christ that Sonne of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,<note place="margin">Mal. 4. 2.</note>
wherewith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saw the
Church clothed, is neuer worne out,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16213:33"/>
nor shall euer be put off, vntill faith and
Hope bee abolished; their pure Gold
that they buy of him is neuer spent, and
their Sunne is neuer set, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
perhaps it may bee vnder a cloud.
The Oyle of gladnesse wherewith they
are annointed is like the widdows Oyle
of Sarepta, wherewith shee paid her
debts, maintained her selfe &amp; her house,
and yet her Cruse was still full.<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.</note> Nay,
Christ turneth the water of his seruants
(that loue to enuite him vnto their feasts)
into wine, and the oftner it is powred
forth the sweeter it is. One Helmet of
Hope, one Shield of Faith, one Sword
of the Spirit, &amp;c. shall last all thy life,
and saue thee in a thousand battailes of
temptations and spirituall conflicts, and
neuer bee worne: for whom the Lord
loueth, hee loueth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to the end, and his
mercies endure for euer. There is but
one Faith, one God, one Lord, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
one Word, one Spirit, and one
Hope, though there bee many misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes,
many Diuels, many falsehoods,
many doubts; there is but one supreame
goodnes, though many euils, &amp; that one
<pb facs="tcp:16213:34"/>
shall ouercome all, and remaine alwayes
the same, that we may still sing with the
Psalmist, <hi>The mercies of the Lord endure
for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Christians heauenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
doth excell for Perpetuitie,<note place="margin">Of their Security.</note> so also
for Securitie: for it is laid vp in heauen,
where the Lord himselfe dwelleth, and
from whence hee laugheth all Theeues
both infernall and terrestiall to scorne.</p>
            <p>Many lay vp their treasure in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of a ship, and the sea swalloweth
it vp; but what sea can deuoure those
Treasures that are layd vp in heauen?
Many put their treasure into other mens
hands, who spend it vainely, or runne
away secretly; but who can spend, or
runne away with that which is laid vp
in heauen? Many bestow their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
vpon their backe, belly, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
three such Bees as will sting the
land to death,<note place="margin">3 Bees.</note> if they be not taken heed
of, and all perish in the vse, by fire, or
by age, or by sicknesse, or by death; but
no such thing can happen to those trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
which are laid vp in heauen. Many
haue houses, and lands, and riches, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16213:34"/>
friends, to day in very good securitie
as the world thinketh, and by to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
they are gone, or sold, or wasted, or
stolne, or dead, or turned to another
minde, but they that haue once laid vp
the Treasures of a good life, and a good
Conscience in heauen, shall bee sure to
finde them there, and to enioy them for
euer: for they are so kept to his vse, that
no Theefe can euer steale them from
him.</p>
            <p>And howsoeuer some vaine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
Persons will not sticke
through greedinesse of gaine, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
(for a quantitie of money) to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a mans goods at sea, or at land, yet
considering the miserable vnquietnesse
that mans life is exposed vnto, and the
vniuersall disagreement and warre that
is betweene man and all the Creatures
in the world, yea, betweene the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
themselues, nay more, betweene
man and man in all estates and degrees:
nay more than that, between euery man
in himselfe. I see no reason, why any
man should be so vnwise, as to promise
vnto himselfe any secure enioying of
<pb facs="tcp:16213:35"/>
any worldly commoditie, or why ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should so confidently (or desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rather) vndertake to secure any mans
goods or estate, when as hee cannot se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himselfe one minute of an houre
to an end. And first, for the miserable

the substance of whose discourse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

the Childe abuseth such things as his

Father bestoweth vpon him, they are
taken from him and laid vp till another
time; and though the foolish Childe
would haue them still in his sight, yet
that may not bee, the wisedome of the
father will not suffer it: so God dealeth
with his Children, as touching the gifts
and graces of his Spirit, and the vse of
them. The similitude applyeth it selfe:
It sufficeth <hi>Iacob</hi> to heare that his sonne
<hi>Ioseph</hi> was a liue, though hee saw him
not: so it should much comfort vs, to

<pb facs="tcp:16213:46"/>
supply by sighes and grones.</p>
            <p>But if Gods spirit were in thee (thou
sayest) thou shouldest feele it working in
thee some heauenly and spirituall work.<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, and so hee doth, for euen
the sighes and grones of a troubled spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Answere.</note>
are the workes of Gods spirit, and
euen the hungring after righteousnesse,
is no lesse the work of Grace, then the
hauing of righteousnesse. And the work
of Gods Spirit is oftentimes more secret
in thee then thou art aware of: for could
God take a Rib out of <hi>Adams</hi> side
while hee slept, and neuer felt it, and
cannot God put his Spirit into thy hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and heauie Soule, and keepe it there
as a Liger, while thy Faith sleepeth,
and thou not feele it? God dealeth with
his Children as <hi>Ioseph</hi> dealt with his
Brethren, who knew them well enough,
but for a time would not bee knowne
of them, yea, and put their money into
their sacks more then they knew of, and
at last made himself knowen vnto them.
Gods spirit is called the Comforter, and
his words are the words of Comfort.
<hi>Sonne bee of good cheare, thy sinnes are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16213:46"/>
forgiuen thee,</hi> Hee hath thy pardon with
him in thee, and when thou hast most
neede, hee will deliuer it thee, and thou
shalt see it, with ioy and great gladnes.</p>
            <p>In thee meane time, that hee is in thee
know by this, that thou dost not hate
the Lord, but loue him and hast an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desire,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> with some earnest endeauour
to serue him, to liue honestly, and to
keepe a good Conscience in all things,
and art afraid of falling away. And surely
all good desires are of the Lord. Waite
the Lords leysure with Patience, seeke
for Peace, which though thou canst not
finde awhile, yet by Prayer thou must
wayte on the Lord, and say, Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is mercy with thee that thou
maist bee feared, I will wayte on thee,
euen as the eye of a Maid seruant wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
on the hand of her Mistresse, I will
condemne my selfe of folly, and say, O
my Soule, why art thou cast downe, wait
on God, for hee is thy present help and
thy God. And thus shalt thou bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to the ioy of thy Saluation. And
as <hi>Iob</hi> after his manifold tryals, had both
of Gods goodnesse, of Sathans malice,
<pb facs="tcp:16213:47"/>
his friends vncharitableness, and his
owne weakenesse, had all seauen folde
restored vnto him againe: So thou after
thy supposed losse of heauenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
shalt finde heauenly treasure plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
restored vnto thee againe. When
Christ stept aside from his earthly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother, to doe the businesse
of his heauenly Father, hee meant to
come againe, but in the meane time they
sought him with heauy hearts, and at the
last, they found him in the Temple, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
with the Doctors, to their great
ioy and astonishment: So Christ some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doth as it were step aside from
vs, to the end wee may seeke after him,
and wee may perhaps seeke him with
heauie harts, but yet at the last, we shall
finde him with great ioy, for they that
sowe in teares, shall surely reape in ioy.</p>
            <p>Thou hast heard what high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
are giuen of the Christians
heauenly Treasure; doest thou beleeue
it? then lay vp thy treasure in heauen,
say not as the buyer doth, it is naught,
it is naught, for if thou couldst obtaine
it, with the losse of all the world, thou
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16213:47"/>
mightst and wouldst brag of thy bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
But alas, how few regard this?

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 24</note> Christ
is the Treasure and Treasurer. And this
Treasure is in the ship of Christ, that
is his Church, and no where else. The

are the factours. Now in what roome to

In Ierusalem there were many chests,

            <p>These vessels haue a booke that will

            <p>The places then that wee must fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

the conuenticles of Schismatikes, who
haue seperated themselues from the

you bags which waxe not old. Luke</hi> 12. 33.<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 33</note>
to shew that when a man giueth almes

one purse and put it into another, out of
bags that waxe old, and put it into bags
that waxe not old, and in so doing saith
Christ, thou shalt finde treasure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,

               <note place="margin">Necessary encourage<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments, and why,</note> These
bee sweet encouragements and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
because poore people are vnable to
recompence the kindnesse of those that
bestow any thing vpon them; and as
they are vnable, so for the most part,
they are very ingratefull, and their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse
doth not a little discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
many, who would otherwise bee
more beneficiall then they are. And in
these respects, men had rather venture
their goods vpon any other thing, then
vpon the poore. For (say they) <hi>quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grato

and miserably vnable to repay thee, yet
if thou giuest them for Christ his sake,

thou shalt finde it againe in heauen.</p>
            <p>But it may bee, thou wilt be content

The second way to lay vp Treasure
in heauen,<note place="margin">The 2 way to lay vp, &amp;c.</note> is by suffring constantly and
patiently for Christ, when thou art
thereunto lawfully called and required,
and that two wayes: First, thou must
suffer the word of Christ which is the
sword of the Spirit, to hew and cut thy
sinnes, and bee content with patience,
to endure the sifting and fanning of the
Gospell,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.</note> for except the dead and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
branches be cut off, we can neuer
bring forth fruit in Christ. Secondly,
wee must resolue to endure all outward
crosses and losses, for the euerlasting
Truth of Christ, for hee that will <hi>saise
his life</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>shall loose it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note>

               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17</note> If wee belong to Christ, wee
must looke for tribulation, and anguish,<note place="margin">35</note>
and persecution, and famine, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
and perill, and sword, all which
will try their force, to see if they can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate

wee must looke for his sake,<note place="margin">36</note> to bee kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <hi>While wee looke not on
the things which are seene, but on the things
which are not seene.</hi> This point will bee
scarce welcommed, or well liked, of nice
and daintie professours of the Gospell,
which must neuer goe to Gods house,
but when the Sunne shineth, the waies
are faire, and no Winde is stirring, to
blow vpon them; and when they are
there, they must heare nothing but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
things, their sinnes must not bee
touched, much lesse can they endure to
haue the cutting knife of Gods law, laid
to the throat of their sinne. And if all
the world doth not applaud and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their zeale, and good deeds, they
soon are discouraged, &amp; stand stone stil,
like the winde mill that goeth no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

<pb facs="tcp:16213:57"/>
or reproach, no persecution or trouble
can they endure for the Truths sake,
what Treasure can these lay vp by their
daintinesse in heauen?</p>
            <p>The third way to lay vp Treasure
in heauen,<note place="margin">The third way to lay vp, &amp;c.</note> is while thou liuest here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, to grow in the powerfull and
liuely knowledge of Christ crucified, &amp;
by a liuely apprehensiue faith to make
thy selfe sure of all his benefits, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of whom, thou oughtst with the
blessed Apostle,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 10.</note> to esteeme all the world
but drosse and dung. Now to effect this,
we must consider the merite of Christ,
the vertue of Christ, and the example
of Christ, and what benefit wee haue
by euery one of them; as that worthie
man of God M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> hath both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
&amp; heauenly declared, the somme
whereof, I will breefly recall into thy
minde.</p>
            <p>Christ is to bee considered, as the
common Treasurie and store-house of
Gods Church, for God <hi>hath blessed vs
with all spirituall blessings in Christ.</hi> Eph.
1. 4.<note place="margin">Ephe. 1. 4.</note> And in him are all the Treasures of

And of his fulnesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wee all recei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for grace.<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. So that all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of God without exception are
conuayed vnto vs from the Father by
Christ, and so must they bee receiued
and no otherwise. But concerning the
benefits of Christ wee are to learne fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two things: first, what they are:
Secondly, how or in what manner to
vse them. His benefits are three: Merit,
Vertue, and Example.</p>
            <p>The Merit of Christ is the value of
his death and passion, whereby he hath
obtained to vs Reconciliation And this
Reconciliation hath two parts: first,
Remission of sinnes, Secondly, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to eternall life, and both for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ imputed. This benefit must
bee knowen not by conceipt, nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
presumption, but by the inward testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of gods Spirit. To attaine to the
infallible assurance of this benefite we
must call to minde the promises of the
Gospell touching remission of sins, and
the gift of eternall life to the Faithfull.
Secondly, wee must endeuour by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of Faith to apply them to our
<pb facs="tcp:16213:58"/>
owne hearts. And thirdly, wee must vse
often exercises of Inuocation and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
for by our crying to God for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
commeth the assuraunce
thereof. And if it so fall out that a man
in temptation, feele nothing but the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wrath of God, yet euen then against
all reason and feeling, hee must hold to
the merit of Christ, and know that God
is a most louing father to them that haue
a care to serue him, euen at that instant
when he sheweth himselfe a most fierce
and terrible enimie, which <hi>Iob</hi> knew
right well when hee said,<note place="margin">Iob. 13. 15</note> 
               <hi>If the Lord
should kill mee, yet I will trust in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the benefite of Reconciliation
proceede foure benefites. First, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
peace of God, which passeth all
Vnderstanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. And that hath
sixe parts: first, peace with the Trinitie,
for <hi>being Iustified by Faith, we haue peace
with God. Rom.</hi> 5. 1. Secondly, Peace
with Angles, who do <hi>ascend and descend
vpon the Sonne of man. Iohn.</hi> 1. 51. and
all for the good of Gods Church. For
the Angels doe incampe about those
that feare the Lord. <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. And like
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16213:58"/>
Nurses doe beare them in their armes.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 12. that they hurt not their foot
against a stone. All this seruice which
the Angels performe vnto the faithfull,
proceedes of this, that the faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Christ, are pertakers of his merit.
Thirdly, peace with the Faithfull, for,
<hi>the Wolfe shall dwell with the Lambe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and
the Leopard shall lye with the Kid, and
the Calfe and the Lyon, and the fat beasts
together, and a little child shall lead them.
Esay.</hi> 11. 6. Fourthly, peace with a mans
selfe, and that is: first, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
washed in the bloud of Christ,
ceaseth to accuse a man: secondly, when
the will and affections are obedient to
the minde, enlightened by the Word
and Spirit of God, and this is that which
the Apostle meaneth, when hee saith,
<hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts.
Col.</hi> 3. 15. Fiftly, Peace with our enimies,
and that two wayes: first, in seeking
Peace with all, hurting none, but doing
good to all:<note place="margin">Dan. 1. 9.</note> secondly, in that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth
their mallice &amp; inclineth their
hearts to peace. Sixtly, Peace with the
Creatures. <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 13.<note place="margin">Psal 91. 13</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt walk
<pb facs="tcp:16213:59"/>
vpon the Lyon and the Dragon, &amp;c. And in
that day</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>I will make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enant
for them, with the wild Beasts, and
with the foules of the heauen, &amp; with that
that creepeth vpon the earth, &amp;c. Hos.</hi> 2. 18<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 18.</note>
If therefore wee see God against vs, our
owne Conscience against vs, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
against vs, the Faithfull against vs,
the wicked against vs, the Creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs, let vs examine this point, of
Reconciliation, and if all bee with vs, let
vs know that it is the benefit of Christs
merit.</p>
            <p>The second benefit of Christs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,<note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d benefite.</note>
is recouery of that right, which man
hath to all the Creatures, the which
<hi>Adam</hi> lost to himselfe &amp; all his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
1. <hi>Cor. 3. 22. Whether it be the world,
or life, or death, or things present, or things
to come, all are yours, and you Christs.</hi>
The right way of knowing this benefit
is this, when God giueth meat &amp; drinck,
&amp;c. we must not barely consider them,
as blessings of God, for that very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
men can doe, which know not
Christ, but as proceeding from the loue
of God in Christ. And so often as wee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16213:59"/>
vse the Creatures, this point must come
to minde, for blessings conceiued a part
from Christ, are misconceiued. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they are in themselues, they are
no blessings to vs, but in and by Christs
Merits: for this cause it is not sufficient
generally to know Christ to be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
but wee must learne to see him
and acknowledge him in euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
gift &amp; blessing of God. If men when
they behold their meates and drincks,
could by faith behold in them the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christs passion, there would not
bee so much gluttony and drunkennes
as there is. If the like in their houses and
lands, their would not bee so much fraud
and deceipt, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ustice and oppression.
Also noble birth, without new birth is
but vanitie. The like is to bee saide of
phisicke, sleepe, health, libertie, recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and very breathing it self. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is meete, that with our earthly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
wee ioyne spirituall medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation
of the death of Christ, then would there
not bee so many vnlawfull sports and
delights, and so much abuse of lawfull
Recreations as there is, and this wee
<pb facs="tcp:16213:60"/>
ought to do, for, <hi>Christ is all in all things.
Col.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
            <p>The third benefit<note place="margin">The third benefice.</note> of Reconciliation,
is that all crosses, and afflictions cease
to bee curses and punishments to them
that are in Christ, and are onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
&amp; trials, because Christs death
hath taken away all, and euery part of
the curse of the law. In all crosses Christ
is to bee knowne on this manner, iudge
of them as chastisements or tryals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
not from a reuenging Iudge,
but from the hand of a louing father,
and therefore they must be taken in and
with the merit of Christ, as meanes sent
of God, to keepe vs from being damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the wicked world, if otherwise,
wee take them as curses, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And hence it followeth, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
to the crosse, or hand of God in
all crosses, is a marke of the true church
of Christ.</p>
            <p>The fourth benefit<note place="margin">The 4 benefite,</note> of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is, that Death is properly no death,
but a rest, or sleep. Death therefore is
to bee considered not as it is set forth
in the Law, but as it is altred by the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16213:60"/>
death of Christ, and when death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
wee must looke vpon it through
Christs death as through a glasse, and
thus it will appeare to bee but a passing
from this life to euerlasting life.</p>
            <p>The second benefit of Christ,<note place="margin">Of Christs Vertue.</note> is the
benefit of his Vertue. The Vertue of
Christ, is the power of his Godhead,
whereby hee createth new ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts in all
that beleeue in him. This Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tue is
double: First, the power of his death.
Secondly, the power of his resurrection:
by the first, hee freed himselfe from the
punishment and imputation of our sins.
By the second, hee raised himselfe from
Death to Life. The benefit of Christs
diuine power is great to all the faithfull:
for, the same power which freed him
from the punishment and imputation of
our sins, setueth also to mortifie and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
the corruptions of our wils, mindes
and affections. And the same which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him from death to life, serueth also
to raise those that belong to Christ, first
from their sinnes in this life, secondly,
from the graue, in the day of iudgement.

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Our conformitie with Christ is,
first in the framing of our inward life:
secondly, in the practise of outward and
morrall dueties. Conformitie in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
life, is not by doing that which Christ
did vpon the crosse, and afterward, but a
doing of the like by a certaine kinde
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16213:61"/>
of imitation, and it hath foure parts.
First, a spirituall Oblation, for as hee by
prayer resigned himselfe vp to bee a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to the iustice of his father. So we
in prayer must resigne our selues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Seruice of God. Secondly, a
spirituall crucifying of our selues, for as
hee bare his owne Crosse, so must wee
denie our selues, and take vp all crosses
that come euery day. Againe, as hee
crucified his flesh, so must wee crucifie
the body of sinne. <hi>Gal. 5. 24. They which
are Christs, haue crucified the flesh with
the lusts and affections.</hi> He with a speare
was wounded, we with the sword of the
spirit must wound sinne to death, and
labour by experience to feele the very
death of it, and bury it. Thirdly, a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Resurrection: for as he came out
of his graue, so wee must come out of
our sinnes, as out of a most loathsome
graue, to liue to God. This worke can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee done at once but by degrees, as
God shall giue grace. Fourthly, a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
ascention, by a continuall eleuation
of the heart and minde to Christ, sitting
at the right hand of God. <hi>If yee be risen
<pb facs="tcp:16213:62"/>

Law without grudging, submitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to his fathers will in all things: So
must wee, and the more wee follow him
herein, the more wee are like him in his
Death and Refurrection.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in his Humilitie,<note place="margin">Humility.</note> for being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
God, hee became man for vs, and of a
man a worme, that is troden vnder foot,
that hee might saue man. <hi>Phil. 2. 5. Let
the same mind be in you, that was in Christ,
who being equall with God, tooke vpon
him the shape of a Seruant, and humbled
himselfe euen to the death of the Crosse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is to be obserued, that the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Christ hath something more in it
then any other hath, or can haue, for it
doth not onely shew vs what wee ought
to doe, but it is both a remedie against
many vices, as also a motiue to many
good Dueties: as for example, the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
consideration that the very Sonne of
God himselfe suffered all the wrath of
God, and curse of the Law for our sins,
is the most effectuall meanes to stir vp
<pb facs="tcp:16213:63"/>
our hearts to a godly sorrow for them,
to which end, euery man must bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that hee was the man that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Christ, that hee is to bee blamed
as well as <hi>Herod, Pilate,</hi> and the Iewes,
and that his sinnes were the nayles and
speares that pearced Christ. Againe, if
Christ for our sinnes shed his bloud, and
if our sinnes made him sweate drops of
bloud, why should not wee shed bitter
teares for our sinnes? Hee that findeth
himselfe so dull and hardened, that the
passion of Christ doth not humble him,
is in a lamentable case. Againe, when
thou art sicke and in paine, thinke how
light these are, being compared to the
Agony and bloudy Sweate, the Thorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and Nayles which Christ endured:
when thou art wronged &amp; abused, turne
thy eie to the crosse, consider how meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christ bare it, and prayed for them
that put him to death: When thou art
tempted with Pride and Vaine-glory,
consider how for thy sinnes, Christ was
mocked, despised and condemned: when
thou art moued with anger and desire of
reuenge, think how Christ gaue himselfe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16213:63"/>
to death to saue his enimies, when they
most cruelly set themselues against him,
and these meditations being mingled
with faith, will ease thy minde.</p>
            <p>And hence ariseth (sayth M. <hi>Perk.</hi>)
a three-fold knowledge: first, of God:
secondly, of our neighbour: thirdly, of
our selues. Of God, for if wee would
know him to our Saluation, wee must
know him in Christ crucified, for God
of his owne nature is inuisible, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
to vs onely in Christ, in whom
hee sets foorth his Iustice, Wisedome,
Goodnesse, and Prouidence. <hi>Heb. 1. 3.
Col.</hi> 1. 3. whatsoeuer out of Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to vs in the name of God, is a flat
Idoll of mans braine.</p>
            <p>The second knowledge that ariseth
from the former meditations, is of our
neighbours, that is, those that are of gods
Church. They are to bee knowen of vs
in this manner. When wee are to do any
Duetie to them, wee are not barely to
respect their persons, but Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in them,<note place="margin">Acts. 9.</note> and them in Christ, <hi>Saul,
Saul why, &amp;c.</hi> when the poore come for
reliefe, it is Christ, that commeth to our
<pb facs="tcp:16213:64"/>
dores, and saith I am hungry, therefore
let our compassion bee towards them as
towards Christ.</p>
            <p>The third knowledge is of our selues,
and the right knowledge of our selues,
ariseth of Christ crucified, in whom and
by whom wee come to the knowledge
of fiue speciall things: First, the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousnesse
of our sinnes, and our miserie
in regard of them, for if wee consider
our offences in our selues, wee may bee
deceiued, because our conscience being
corrupt often erreth in giuing testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and so it seemes but little, but if sinne
bee considered in the death and passion
of Christ, whereof it was the cause, and
the vilenesse thereof measured by the
vnspeakable torments endured by him,
the least sinne will appeare to be a most
grieuous sinne indeed. Secondly, by this
wee know that men beleeuing in Christ,
are not their owne, but wholly both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and soule belong to Christ. Thirdly,
that euery true beleeuer hath this being
from Christ, not as hee is a man, but as
hee is a new man. Fourthly, that all good
works done of vs, proceede from the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16213:64"/>
vertue, and merit of Christ crucified.
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 2. Fiftly, that we owe vnto Christ
an endlesse debt, for hee was crucified
onely as our suertie and pledge, and in
the spectacle of his passion, wee must
consider our selues as the chiefe debters,
we owe him all our selues for the paines
that hee endured, to set vs most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bankroupts at libertie, from Hell,
Death, and the Diuell, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when
doe wee beginne to pay it?</p>
            <p>Thus wee see what benefits we haue
by Christ crucified, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
wee ought to vse them, but alas, but
few haue treasured vp this knowledge
of Christ, as they ought, for herein faile
both the Papist, and the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant.
The Popish Churches though
in word they confesse him, yet doe they
not know him as they ought, for in their
Sermons they vse the passion, as a means
onely to stirre vp pittie and compassion
towards Christ, and hatred of <hi>Pilate,</hi>
the Iewes, and <hi>Iudas,</hi> &amp;c. But the seruice
of God which in that Church, stands
now in force, by the <hi>Cannons</hi> of the
Counsell of Trent, defaceth Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
<pb facs="tcp:16213:65"/>
in that first the Passions of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
are made meritorious; secondly, the
very word and signe of the Crosse, is
their onely refuge and help; thirdly, the
Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> is made the Queene of
heauen, and a mother of Mercy, who
may commaund her Sonne; fourthly,
they giue religious adoration to dumbe
stocks, &amp; Crucifixes made by the hands
of men. The common Protestant also
commeth short, for three causes, for first
though in Word they confesse him
to bee a Sauiour, that hath redeemed
them, yet indeede they make him a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of their sinnes: Secondly, they take
knowledge of his merit, but little regard
the vertue of his death, and resurrection,
in mortifying of their sinfull lusts and
affections: thirdly, they vsually content
themselues generally and confusedly to
know Christ to be their redeemer, neuer
once seeking in euery perticuler estate
of life, and blessing of God, to feele the
benefit of his passion. What is the cause
of all the securitie in the world, and that
men are not touched for their sins? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they did neuer yet seriouslie
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16213:65"/>
consider that Christ in the Garden, lay
groueling vpon the earth, sweating of
bloud, &amp;c. for their offences. Againe
oppressours of the poore, neuer knew
that their sinnes drew out the hart bloud
of Christ. Againe proud persons puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
vp with strange atire, neuer consider
that Christ was not crucified in gay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
but naked, that hee might beare
the whole shame and curse of the Law
for vs. These and such like, whatsoeuer
they say in word, if we respect the tenor
of their liues, are flat enimies of the crosse
of Christ, and tread his precious bloud
vnder their feete. So farre <hi>Perkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if thou wilt haue the Treasures
of Christ in heauen, thus thou must
learne to know and feele Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and the benefits of his Merit, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Example, and thus must thou
come to the knowledge of God, of thy
neighbour, and of thy selfe, in Christ
crucified, euen whiles thou art here vpon
earth; which feeling knowledge is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
knowledge, euen an excellent por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of heauenly Treasure, imparted to
the true Christian in this life, and is a
<pb facs="tcp:16213:66"/>
pledge of endlesse and infinite treasure
prouided for him in the life to come, and
so much for the wayes and meanes of
laying vp treasute in heauen, which are
by giuing to the poore Members of
Christ, by suffering patiently for the
truth of Christ, and by growing in the
sauing knowledge of Christ crucified.</p>
            <p>In laying vp Treasure after this sort,
we shal prooue good Alcumists. An Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumist
they say can turne lead into gold,
or out of Lead or other mettals extract
Golde, which many haue practised to
their vtter vndoing. The Pope is the
cunningest Alcumist it is thought that
the world hath, for hee can of a pound
of Lead, make an hundred pound of
Gold, for all his Buls and Pardons are
sealed with lead, but what fooles are they
that turne their Gold into Lead, or what
calues rather that buy his Buls so deare?
But lay vp Treasure as hath beene shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee before,<note place="margin">A true Christian a good Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumist.</note> and thou shalt turne
earth into heauen, corruption into incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
Gold into godlinesse which is

ioy, pouertie into riches, and thy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16213:66"/>
cottage into a kingdome, euen the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the reasons of Christs
Commandement,<note place="margin">Verse. 21. The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the reason of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> 
               <hi>For where your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is there will your heart bee also.</hi> A
Reason of great force as if hee should
say, for this cause chiefly you ought to
lay vp your treasure in heauen, that God
may haue your heart, which cannot bee
vnlesse you lay vp your Treasure in
heauen, for our hearts will bee where
wholy their Treasure is. Here wee are
taught, that no man can loue the Lord
with his heart, that seeketh and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
his happinesse in earthly things,
but onely those whose ioy and felicitie
is in heauen, and the heauenly graces of
the Lord Iesus Christ. Worldlings
make no doubt but that they may, and
doe serue God, and loue God with their
heart, yea, and haue as good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hart to
God as any whatsoeuer, though they
follow the world, &amp; heare not sermons,
although they keepe not the Sabboth
so precisely as others do, which will not
worke or play then, though they neuer
meddle with the Scriptures, but bee
<pb facs="tcp:16213:67"/>
vtterly ignorant of the wayes and will
of God. But Christ here sheweth that
they are al deceiued, by a general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that neuer faileth. <hi>Wher the treasure
is there will be the hart, and wher the hart
is, there is the Treasure of the hart,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it followeth that they doe wholy
renounce heauen, that do seeke for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
here below, and if they set their
harts vpon heauenly things, it cannot be
that they should esteeme of them no
better, or frequent them no oftner, then
they doe. The Philosophers haue most
exactly (so much as the Star-light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would giue them leaue) disputed of
the happines or chiefe wel-fare of man.<note place="margin">Summu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bonum.</note>
And no meruaile, for who doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to bee happy, and to win that hold,
are all mens Sences, and Wits mustred
and marshalled, because it is the onely
true treasure, <hi>For where the Treasure is,
there will the hart be,</hi> but most men doe
mistake the matter, while they seeke for
happinesse in the flesh, which is not to
be found but in the spirit, &amp; while they
confesse that it is in God, yet runne after
the Diuell for it. When some seeke for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16213:67"/>
it in Honour, Ambition is made gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of the field, and doth commaund the
minde: while others seeke it in worldly
profite, Couetousnesse doth inuade the
soule, taking vp euery roome for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desires, and noysome lusts, which doe
eat out the heart with cares, and drowne
men in perdition: others seeking for it in
carnall pleasure and sensualitie, cry one
to another, come let vs eate and drinck,
and bee merry, for to morrow wee shall
dye: and in the meane time the brute
beast in that regard is more happy then
such Epicures, for that more freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any shame or feare hee enioyeth the
pleasure of carnall sensualitie, then they
doe.</p>
            <p>But if we were once soundly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of our happines in heauen, it would
bee an easie matter to tread the World
vnder foote, and to haue our mindes
mounted vp to heauen. If the loue of
God bee our Treasure, and through the
spectacles of a liuely faith, wee can read
our names regestred in the booke of life,
and descry our happinesse to be hidden
in Christ; if the spirit of Adoption doth
<pb facs="tcp:16213:68"/>
certifie our spirits that God is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and wee are his children, and with
the same certificate shall deliuer vs a
discharge against sinne, death and hell,
then will our harts feede vpon heauenly
meditations, and our soules hunger and
thirst after righteousnesse, wee will then
account all but dung, that wee might
winne the Lord Iesus Christ. And then
as the Hart brayeth for the riuers of
water, so will our soules long for the
presence of the Lord: And then the
Word of God will bee the ioy of our
harts, and wee will desire to bee dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
and to bee with Christ, for <hi>where
the Treasure is, there will the hart bee
also:</hi> And vntill then wee shall sauour
nothing but earthly vanities. Therefore
when S. <hi>Paul</hi> would draw the faithfull
to the studie of a heauenly life, he doth
propound Christ vnto them, in whom
onely all true felicitie is to bee sought,
<hi>If yee bee risen with Christ</hi> (saith hee)
<hi>set your minds on things aboue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and not on
things which are below,</hi> as if hee should
haue said, it is an absurd and base thing
for christians to haue their mindes grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16213:68"/>
on the earth, whose Treasure is hid
in heauen, and that is his reason, for
<hi>yee are dead</hi> (saith hee) <hi>and your life is
hid with Christ in God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may further learne, in what
a miserable case they are, whose harts
are set vpon earthly things, which are
subiect to Mothes, and Theeues, Rust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and other such manifold mischiefes. A
cousening match it is of the diuels owne
making, hee is subtill, and sheweth men
the world and the glory of it, the Court
and the brauery of it, Honour and the
fame of it, iniquitie and the profit of it,
sinne and the pleasure of it, as it were
his daughters with their dowrie. On the
other side, wee are simple and beleeue
him, presently our hart is a match, for
them, and happy hee thincks himselfe
that can get one of them, and to breake
it off is a hard matter. Their affections
are fixed vpon a liking, they haue taken,
and although God himselfe forbid the
banes, yet it is to no purpose, for they
haue made a vowe, they haue spoken
the word, and their harts are setled, and
there is no remouing of them. And thus

               <p>It is not for a Noble mans sonne to

                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. therfore it seemeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> though
a man hath a religious heart, yet hee may
fall away, &amp; consequently one cannot tell

               <p>But that ioy that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> speakes
of,<note place="margin">Answere.</note> is rather a liking or wondring at the
heauenly doctrine, as at some strange and
excellent thing, then any sound or setled
reioycing in God who speaketh in his
word And ioy is to be distinguished, for
it is eyther carnall and temporary, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and permanent. A carnall man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth
many times at a Sermon, for the
preachers rare inuention, or his varietie of
phrases, or the sharpnes of his wit, or the
artificiall conuaiance of the matter, or his
excellent gift of vtterance and boldnes, or
because hee heard some touched that hee
was not friends withall, but not for the
simplicitie and euidence of the truth; nor
for any reformation that he felt wrought
in himselfe; nor for any hatred of sinne; or
loue of righteusnes, that the word wrought
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16213:82"/>
in him; for commonly such kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycers
or admirers of men, goe presently
from the Sermon with the dog to eat vp
their vomit, and Swine-like to tumble in
their mire again. Such were many of <hi>Iohns</hi>
auditours, such were many of Christs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
such were most of <hi>Ezechiels</hi> audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours:
and such are too many of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours,
which flock at the first to a man
for nouelties sake, to see whether they
shall be clawed with a curry-combe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
smoothed with a slik-stone. Such are they
that haue the word of God in respect of
persons: and such are those fantasticks, that
will buy a booke onely for the merry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
that are in it, and not for the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
like children which ioy in a booke with a
faire couer, and reioyce more at the gaies
or gawdy letters, then any thing else in the
booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be it neuer so good. The spirituall
man reioyceth, for that God hath found
out his sinne, and feeleth the hand of God
reforming his heart; he reioyceth for that
he perceiueth Sathan dispossessed and his
life amended, his soule hee findeth hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and his affections bridled, himselfe
won to God and his familie with him, and
<pb facs="tcp:16213:83"/>
for this hee reioyceth like the conuerted
Iaylor,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 34</note> who reioyced for that he and all
his houshold beleeued in God.</p>
               <p>But now the afflicted soule is to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied

               <p>But for answere we say,<note place="margin">Answere.</note> that there is an
earnest penny &amp; pawne of Gods loue in
that hart, though as it were, sealed vp in a
bag, and in time it shall be opened, and
perceiued: for first, the very seeking after
the loue of God is a speciall fauour of
God, and an euident token that the spirit
of God is there, for that proceedeth not
of flesh and bloud,<note place="margin">Psal. 27. 8.</note>

vpon him while he is nigh at hand:</hi> to shew
that God is sought for by inuocation or
calling vpon his name, long before hee is
found, or felt gracious vnto vs, but euen
then he is nigh at hand, or else we could
not call vpon him: for it is euen his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that sends forth our prayers, and helps
them with sighes and grones, and if hee
did not help and heaue vp our dull and
drowsie spirits, we should neuer once flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
towards heauen, but euen lye like dead
blocks, sencelessely groueling vpon the
ground. Again,<note place="margin">2</note> Christ is in the hart of the
troubled spirit, for asmuch as the loue of
Christ is there, for the saith, <hi>whom my soule

of God.<note place="margin">3</note> Againe, thou desirest to feele the

bestowed vpon thee, or to make it come
