            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For the wrath of God in heauen is reuealed, &amp; made manifeſt againſt the gods on earth by ſundrie ſignes and tokens of Gods wrath, both in the heauens aboue, and in the earth beneath. For euen of late dayes amongſt vs the often eclypſes of the Sunne and the Moone, the diuerſe Cometes and blazing ſtarres, the ſundrie ſights and lights in the aire, the riſe reſemblances of fire and bloud in the clouds, the maine monſtruous &amp; ſtrange birthes (though ſome ſeeme to render ſome naturall reaſons for them) yet are they vnnaturall, and the wrath of God is reuealed by them. As for the late earthquake amongſt vs, that was ſoone forgotten of vs, becauſe it paſſed away ſo ſoone, and did ſo litle hurt amongſt vs. Yet the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 7.</note> The earth trembled and quaked, the verie foundations of the hilles ſhooke, and were moued, becauſe God is wroth. The prophet telleth plainly, that the trembling and quaking of the earth, is a ſure ſigne and token of the wrath of God in heauen. And that the late earthquake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, did paſſe ſo ſoone away from vs, and with ſo litle hurt among vs, is an argument, that the wrath of God againſt vs, is yet mixed with much mercie towards vs, threatning vs ſo terribly, and yet ſparing vs ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>Thus then by ſundrie ſignes &amp; tokens it is euident and plaine, that the God of heauen is angry with the gods on earth for want of dutie.</p>
               <p>For ſome being aduanced by God to be gods, do liue without God, that is, without the knowledge and feare of God, and become <hi>Dauids</hi> fooles, and ſaye in their<note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 1.</note> hearts, There is no God.

               <p>Therefore they offer ſacrifice to their nets (ſayth the<note place="margin">Habac. 1. 16.</note> Lord by the Prophet) and burne incenſe to their yarne, becauſe by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their portion is made fat, that is, they boaſt of their birth, they vaunt of their value, their wiſedome, and their worth, becauſe by them they thinke they haue whatſoeuer they haue.

Theſe two diſciples haue a long time bene in bringing, and haue not yet brought neither the old aſles nor the yoong colts to Chriſt, becauſe they do not go togither to bring them; diſciple Doctrine faine would bring them, but diſciple Diſcipline is verie ſlacke to go with him: the one ſeekes means by counſell to bring them to Chriſt, the other makes means manie times by countenaunce to ſtaie them from Chriſt.

               <p>Surely, <hi>Dominus his opus habet,</hi> that is, The Lord hath<note place="margin">Matt. 21. 3.</note> need of them.</p>
               <p>Now therfore I moſt humblie beſeech your Maieſtie euen for Chriſt his ſake, and on Chriſts behalfe, to giue a new and a ſtraight charge to theſe two diſciples, to go togither ſpeedilie, and to ioine togither effectuallie, to bring both the old ſtubborne aſſes, and the yoong wild colts to Chriſt, that is, to the preaching and teaching of the goſpell of Chriſt, to the ſaluation of their ſoules through faith in Chriſt.

               <p>For ſome being aduaunced of God to be gods, do countenaunce ſuch as ſeeke to diſcountenaunce the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and preachers of the word of God: both the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers at their liues, and the catchers at their liuings.

               <p>To be ſhort and plaine, Gods word and religion is contemned by Atheiſts, condemned by Papiſts, ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſchiſmatikes, hindered by too many, not faithfully furthered by anie.

               <p>1 For ſo the voice of the Lord commanded the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to crie, That all fleſh is graſſe, and all the godlineſſe<note place="margin">Eſa. 40. 6.</note> thereof is but a flower of the field: man is but graſſe, to day freſh and greene, to morrow cut downe and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>So ſayth S. <hi>Paul,</hi> As by a man death came to men: euen<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 21.</note>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:19523:12"/>
ſo by a man came the riſing againe from death to men. For as by <hi>Adam</hi> all men ſhall die, euen ſo by Chriſt, all men ſhall riſe againe from death.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the reſurrection and the life, whoſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 26.</note> in him ſhall neuer die.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayd of himſelfe: I ſhall<note place="margin">Pſal. 117. 17. Pſal. 26. 13.</note> not die but liue: and ſhall ſee the goodneſſe of God in the land of the liuing.</p>
               <p>And good <hi>Iob</hi> ſayd of himſelfe: I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer<note place="margin">Iob. 19. 25.</note> liueth, and that I ſhall riſe againe in the laſt day, and ſhall be couered againe with my skin, and ſhall ſee God in my fleſh, and I my ſelfe ſhall behold him, not with other, but with theſe ſame eies.</p>
               <p>And our ſauiour Chriſt ſayth of the dead Damoſell:<note place="margin">Matt. 9. 24.</note> She is not dead, but ſleepeth.</p>
               <p>And the ſcriptures of God do often teſtifie of the dead, that they ſleepe: for that euen as they that ſleepe, do wake<note place="margin">Iohn 11. 11. 1. Cor. 15. 18. 1.

As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as die in Chriſt, ſhall be partakers of the reſurrection vnto ſaluation: and as many as die without Chriſt, ſhall riſe againe to condemnation.</p>
               <p>But what need I ſtand to prooue the reſurrection of the dead?</p>
               <p>The ſect of the Sadduces, that beleeue no reſurrection<note place="margin">Act. 23. 23.</note> of the dead, neither angell, nor ſpirit, is ſufficiently confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our ſauiour Chriſt in the goſpell.</p>
               <p>And that godleſſe ſort that ſay: Our life is but a breath<note place="margin">Sap. 2. 2.</note> in our noſthrils, and our bodies ſhall returne to duſt and aſhes, and our ſoules ſhall vaniſh into the ſoftaire, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie condemned by the wiſe man.</p>
               <p>To ſpend ſpeech then in that point, it needs not, or it boots not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:19523:13"/>Therefore to conclude, I haue ſayd, Ye are gods, but ye ſhall die like men, and your bodies ſhall returne to the earth from whence they came, and your ſoules ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to God that gaue them, there to render an account to the God of heauen for your earthy godhead, and to receiue the iudgement, either to the ioy that neuer ſhall haue end, or els to the paine that neuer ſhall haue end.</p>
               <p>So ſayth S. <hi>Paul,</hi> All muſt appeare before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 10.</note> ſeat of Chriſt, that euerie one may yeeld vnto God an account of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>For all in this life are but the Lord his ſtewards, and<note place="margin">Luc. 16. 1.</note> when Death the Lord his bailiffe, ſhall arreſt you with his writ, <hi>Non amplius villicabere,</hi> then muſt you appeare before the great iudge, and render an account euerie one of his ſtewardſhip.</p>
               <p>Then, then (O man, whatſoeuer thou art) then ſhalt thou ſee vpon thy right hand, thine owne ſinnes accuſing thee: vpon thy left hand infinit leagions of diuels plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt thee: aboue thee, the terrible countinance of the iuſt iudge againſt thee: vnderneath thee, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping gulfe of hell fire to deuoure thee: within thee, thine owne conſcience condemning thee. <hi>Miſer homo, quid tum facies? i.</hi> O miſerable man, what wilt thou then do? <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere impoſsibile, apparere intollerabile, i.</hi> To hide thee then it is not poſſible, to ſhew thy ſelfe then is a thing intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>For then the Lord ſhall trie out thy workes, &amp; ſearch<note place="margin">Sap. 6. 3.</note> out thine imaginations, and all thy ſecret thoughts, ſhall be layd open before thee, And the heauens ſhall bewraie<note place="margin">Iob. 20. 27.</note> thine iniquities, and the earth ſhall riſe vp againſt thee, and all thy ſinnes ſhall lie at thy doore, and all thy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 3.</note> ſhall be rife in thy remembrance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:19523:13"/>Then they, that now account it but a ſport to ſinne, and take great pleaſure in the workes of wickedneſſe, ſhall then houle and crie in the anguiſh of their owne ſoules, and ſay: O we haue ſinned, we haue dealt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we haue forſaken the wayes of the Lord, and haue followed the paths of perdition in ſinne.
