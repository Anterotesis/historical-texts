            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Papists most impudently bragge and boast, that they maintaine, keepe and defend that faith and doctrine which S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> deliuered to the

Romans, that neither their Pope, nor their Church can erre, that their Church, and none but their Church, is able to shew and truly to proue a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vninterrupted succession of their Bishops and Priests: that the written word of God containeth not all things necessary to be beleeued vnto saluation, for that it sheweth not the holy Bible to be canonical and that originall sinne remaineth only materially in the bodies of the regenerate, and not formally in their mindes, wils, and hearts. All these points, and euery of them (though most difficult and intricate) I haue taken in hand to confute, relying vpon Gods holy assistance, who neuer forsaketh the truth.

The Pope vtterly disliking Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> opinion, and déeming it repugnant to Christs Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, did for that end conuocate all the cleargie men of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, that the controuersie might be derided, and the truth thereof made manifest to the world.

And it skilleth not, if one say, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell cannot erre, because Christ prayed for his Church, that it should not faile: for I say, that although a generall Councell represent the whole vniuersall Church: yet in truth, there is not truly the vniuersall Church, but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatiuely: For the vniuersall Church (which is it that

or any one finally: for whom, and in respect of whom, the Church is rightly called the piller of truth: this is onely it, in which they vary; which is no true variance indéede, but séemeth so in shew of words: for that Councell which<note place="margin">Marke wel this point.</note> sufficiently (marke the word) doth represent the whole congregation of the faithfull, (when and where such a one can be had,) may truely be called the Catholike Church militant here on earth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that that Church<note place="margin">The body of Christ, which the wicked are not. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. v. 22 23.</note> which cannot erre, is not the visible company of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests, Pastors, and Doctors; but the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the predestinate, which are effectually called to the knowledge of the truth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourtly, that it is the society and congregation of the faithfull, which the Apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the piller of truth: and neither the Pope, nor his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, nor yet the Church of Rome, albeit (<hi>M.

This mine answere thus explicated, I proue by two eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstrations: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because Christ himselfe doth<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. v. 16.</note> so expound himselfe, in these words following: (<hi>He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance which I haue told you</hi>), Which assertion must be<note place="margin">It is the selfe same doctrine, but more plainely declared.</note> well noted, because the latter words are a plaine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the former: as if Christ had said, all things which the holy Ghost shall teach the Apostles after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are no new doctrine, but the very same things which they heard afore of me.

                     <p>I answere: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that albeit Gods will be one, as himselfe is one, willing, by his owne essence, and by<note place="margin">Gods will is his es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> one eternall and immutable act whatsoeuer hee willeth; yet is his will said to be manifold, aswell of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as of the Schoole-doctors: and this is done for two speciall considerations. The former is, by reason of the variety of the things which God willeth. The latter, for the variety of the manner by which God séemeth to will things. Here vpon arise many divisions of Gods will, assigned by the learned for explication sake. Some deuide Gods will into antecedent and consequent. Some others deuide it into the will of signe, and will of good pleasure. Others, into the will reuealed, and will secret or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed. Others into the will absolute and will conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and the like. Secondly, that though Gods will consequent, and will of good pleasure, be euer accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1554:35"/>
vndoubtedly; yet is his will antecedent, and will of signe, oftentimes neglected and left vndone. Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer will, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet speaketh thus: <hi>Whatsoeuer pleased the Lord, that did he in heauen, and in earth, in the Sea<note place="margin">Psa. 46 80.

God would<note place="margin">Exo. 4. 22. 23 Mat. 23 v. 37.</note> haue gathered the Iewes together, euen as the Hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth her Chickens vnder her wings, but they would not haue it so. God would haue all men saued, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apostle witnesseth; and yet we know by the holy Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that the greater part shall be damned. Thirdly, that Gods will now obiected, is onely <hi>Voluntas signi</hi> (his<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. v. 4. Mat. 20. v. 16.</note> will of signe) and not <hi>voluntas beneplaciti</hi> (his will of good pleasure) and therefore it can neuer bee effectually concluded out of this Scripture, that the Pastors of the visible Church doe alwaies teach the truth, and neuer swarue from the same: for the Apostle speaketh indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and indifferently of all Teachers, and of all hearers, of all shepheards and of all shéepe, neither excepting one nor other; and yet both you know, and I know, that many Preachers preach false doctrine, and that many hearers embrace the same: whereupon it followeth of necessity, that if the Apostle should meane as you would haue him to meane; then should Christs intent and purpose bée frustrate in very déed, which for all that, is it that your selues impugne.

               <p>Well, there must be Bishops and Priests, or Pastors and Teachers, (as the Apostle termeth them) euen to the consummation of Saints, and end of the world. Now sir, you are not able (say our Doctors, our Iesuits, our Cardinals, our Popes) to shew or name any Church in the world, but the Church of Rome, which hath alwaies had in it these Pastors and Doctors from Christs visible depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to this day.</p>

               <p>I answere, that succession is of two sorts, to wit, materiall and formall. Materiall is of the persons and the places: formal of the faith and doctrine. Touching the succession formal (which is the principall, and from whence the denomination must bée deriued) the Church of Rome cannot chalenge it, as it is already proued: for,<note place="margin">The Church of Rome wan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> teth formal succession.</note> (if yée remember) I haue proued both soundly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that many Bishops of Rome, haue taught false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and that not onely as priuate men, but euen as publike persons in their iudiciall definitions and decrées: and consequently that the true, proper, and formall succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, can no way bée truly verified of the Church of Rome.</p>

Out of which discourse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> two things of great moment are to bée obserued.

               <p>Two no small absurdities doe perforce arise from hence. The one, that the succession of the Popes of Rome (whereof they glory somuch) is very doubtfull and vncertaine.

               <p>I answere: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that an argument, <hi>ab autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate, negatiué,</hi> is not holden good in your Schooles; and yourselues do roundly condemne in others that manner of dispute. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that if these famous writers had not béene fully perswaded of the truth of the story, they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1554:39"/>
would neuer haue published it to the world: and hereof this double reason may be yéelded. First, for that the Popes déere friends, were, no doubt, very loathto reueale the shame and turpitude of their holy fathers, saue onely then and so much, when and how much the very force of truth compelled them to do. Againe, because they being very learned, could not be ignorant, that it was a great damnable sinne to defame so great a man. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the sayd Authors write of this matter, euen as they do of other things. <hi>Palmerius</hi> and <hi>Sigibertus,</hi> both haue these<note place="margin">Palmer. &amp; Sigeber. in Chron.</note> expresse words: <hi>Fama est, hunc Iohannem faeminam fuis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I cannot indeed but remember the same, it is so frequent and vsual in euery learned Papists mouth. But alas alas, the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thereof, doth this day wound me at the very heart: for hitherto I haue beene taught to hold it for a constant truth, that the Catholike Church, the Church of Rome, and the Popes holinesse, were all as one, that is to say, that the Popes faith, was the faith of the Church of Rome, and the faith of the Church of Rome, the faith of the Catholike Church militant heere on earth.</p>

Romish Maxime confirmeth the same: for when the Pope and his Popelings tell vs, that the Church cannot erre, then do they meane that the Pope cannot erre: and when they speake of the Catholike Church, then they euer<note place="margin">Mark this.

               <p>Out of this doctrine of this famous papists, I gather to the confusion of the late Bishops of Rome, their Iesuits, and all Iesuited papists, these three euidents, gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1554:48"/>
and most necessary corollaries. First, that the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and common sort of people are grosly deceiued, when they terme popery the old religion, and repute them for the auncient Catholikes: for, we are indeede the true and<note place="margin">Corollari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For, this <hi>Benedict</hi> the second could not be made<note place="margin">A. D. 684.</note> Bishop of Rome, 684. yeeres after Christs sacred aduent, without the Emperours letters Patents: so then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours<note place="margin">Lo, Popery is the new religion.</note> had the soueraignty ouer the Bishops of Rome, for the space almost of seuen hundren yeeres after Christ, &amp; so long the Popes acknowledged the Emperours for their soueraigne Lords, as without whose letters Patents they could haue no iurisdiction in the Church. I adde as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sectary hereunto, that as in ciuill causes many are debarred from their lawfull inheritance, through the violent dealing of mighty men, euen so we, the true reformed Catholikes, haue beene many yeeres excluded from the free vse of our owne Church and Sacraments, by the force, violence, and tyrannie, of the blood-thirsty Romish Bishops, and partly by remissenes of sundry Emperours, who vpon a blind zeale not grounded vpon Gods word, yeelded vp their soueraigne rights vnto them: and as temporal men are in time restored to their auncient right, by zealous and godly Magistrates: euen so were we and are we (God make vs thankefull for it) by the goodnesse of God and most Christian Princes, (King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the sixt, Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King IAMES our most gratious soueraigne now happily regnant ouer vs) restored to the old Christian, Catholike, and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like religion, and with all Christian freedome placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in our owne Churches, the spirituall birth-right of our selues and our ancestors.

Secondly, thath our Bishops in England are made and<note place="margin">Corollary. 2.</note> consecrated, according to the auncient, Christian, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, Apostolike, and old Roman maner, that is to say,<note place="margin">Corollary. 3</note> by the letters Patents of the Prince. Thirdly, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of Constantinople, for the space of 200. yeares and odde after the dissolution of the Empire in the west, had still the soueraignty ouer the Bishop of Rome: for the west Empire was dissolued in Anno 471, and <hi>Benedict</hi> the second obteined of the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> in Anno 684, that the Bishops of Rome might from thenceforth be chosen, confirmed, and enioy their iurisdiction, without the commandement and letters Patents of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

Rome vpon a fond zeale without knowledge, opened the window to all antichristian tyrannie: for in short time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Romish Bishops became so arrogant and Lordly, that they tooke vpon them to dispose Royall scepters, and to translate them to their pleasures.</p>

               <p>It is a memorable obseruation, I shall keep it in remembrance: but let me still reason for the Papists, as if I were one of them; for when all difficulties are answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I shall be the stronger in the truth. The Church of God cannot be without Bishops and Priests, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 11.</note> recordeth, and your selfe graunteth: but so it is, that when he first reformed the Church, as you terme it, yee neither had any Bishops, nor any Priests of your owne, neither could ye finde any in any other place, but onely with vs and in our Church, when <hi>Martin Luther</hi> went out from vs: our Church therefore and none but ours, is the true Church of God; as which onely hath the true succession Apostolicall.</p>

               <speaker>Remig.</speaker>
               <p>I answere first, that our succession in the Church of England, is farre better then theirs of Rome: for theirs of Rome, (as we haue heard and séene) is most doubtfull and vncertain: but ours of England so constant and so assured, as no deniall can be made thereof: I proue it, because in Anno, 596. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great<note place="margin">A.

For as Rome was the chiefe seate of the Emperour, and therefore called <hi>Caput mundi;</hi> so was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop there for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor &amp; dignity of the Empire, (to which all the world paid tribute in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>) reputed the chéefest Bishop of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Luke. 2. 1.</note> Church. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the Bishop of Romes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was so farre from being superiour to the Emperours (who was euer called the Emperour of Rome) that no Bishop there for the space of 684. yeares, could haue and enioy any iurisdiction, vnlesse the same Bishop were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the letters pattents of the Emperour.

Marke well, what I shall relate, for it is a wonderment of the new world. The Papists tell vs (and it is a speciall article of late po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish faith) that if a popish Priest come into a great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, where there is great store of wheate-bread, though a thousand or moe loaues in number, and then, and there looking on the same bread, shall pronounce these<note place="margin">This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> words (<hi>hoc est corpus meum,</hi> this is my body) with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to consecrate the same: then forthwith euery loafe of the sayd wheat-bread, is made Christs body, and <hi>per concomitantiam</hi> as their Schooles terme it) God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; so as the people are bound by popish faith and lawes to adore the same loaues, euery loafe as the sonne of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing God: trial here of was once made a Rome as my self being in Rome, heard from the mouth of a Iesuite.

designed to dye for his homely qualities, as he passed in the stréete by a bakers shop, beheld a great quantity of wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, and recited these words (<hi>hoc est corpus meum</hi>) and then told the people that he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated the same bread;<note place="margin">Behold here a great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> so desiring once to be auenged of the Pope, and his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Popelings: Wherupon consultation was had out of hand among the learned there, and sentence resolutely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In these words the holy Prophet sheweth plainely, that he was regenerate, and yet not frée from sinne: for in that he desireth his heart to be purified, and his spirit to be renued, he giueth vs to vnderstand, that his soule is not frée from sinne, nor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe perfectly regenerate. On the other side, in that he prayeth God not to take away his holy spirit from him, nor to cast him away from his presence; he sheweth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to the indifferent reader, that he is regenerate, though not wholly, yet in part. The second text confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the same, in these words: though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed daily. The third<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. v. 16. Ephes. 4. 23 Col. 3. 9.</note> text is yet plainer, in these words: be renewed in the spirit of your minde, and put on the new man, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God is created in righteousnesse and true holines. The fourth text is as plaine, in these words: séeing yée haue put off the old man with his works, and haue put on the new, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him. The fifth text doth further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the same, in these words: night and day praying excéedingly that we might sée your face, and might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish<note place="margin">1 Thes. 3. v. 10. 1 Cor. 13 v 12.</note> that which is lacking in your faith. By al which texts it is very cléere and euident, that the regenerate man is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1554:67"/>
not wholly renewed in his souls: for which respect, Saint<note place="margin">Apoc. 22. v. 11. Rom. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> exhoedeth him that is iustified, to be iustified more: <hi>Qui iustus est, iustificetur adhuc</hi> Yea, S. <hi>Paul</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a whole chapter, doth in effect intend no other thing, but onely to demonstrate by many arguments, that mans regeneration is vnperfect aswell in the soule as in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: two verses onely will suffice, for the cléering of our question. The former verse is conteined in those words:<note place="margin">v. 14. v. 18.</note> for we know that the law is spirituall, but I am carnall, fold vnder sinne. The latter verse, in these words: for I know, that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing, for to will is present with me, but I find no meanes to performe that which is good. Out of which verses, I obserue these memorable doctrines. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that by the word (flesh) must néedes be vnderstoode the whole man, as he is corrupt and not regenerate: I proue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostle saith, (in me) and expoundeth it by his flesh. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that the word (flesh) cannot determine the word (me) vnlesse it signifie the corrupt parts both of body and soule: for the words (I and (me) do connotate his person, not barely any one part of his soule or body. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that he saith, no good dwelled in him: albeit he confesseth both in this chapter, &amp; in sundry other places, that the grace of God and the holy Ghost dwelleth in him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10. 1 Cor. 6 v. 19. Rom. 8. 9. 1 Cor. 13. 12</note> and consequently, that when he saith, no good dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in him, he meaneth of the parts vnregenerate, which he nameth his flesh, saying, in me, that is, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. Fourthly, that the holy vessell of our Lord Iesus, affirmeth himselfe to be sold vnder sinne, and to be carnall, and consequently, that sinne is in him formally throughout all his vnregenerate parts, and not onely in his body materially, as our Pope and Iesuits would enforce vs to beéeue: for though the regenerate be spirituall in the greater part, yet are they in part carnal; as the holy Apostle here auoucheth of himselfe,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1554:68"/>
and S. <hi>Iames</hi> of himselfe and all the rest: howbeit, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Iames</hi> were as spirituall as any this day li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, if not more: yet the best liuers of all haue not so put on the new man, but the reliques of the old man still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine<note place="margin">

For (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle teacheth vs) no man euer yet hated his owne fleshe, but nourisheth and cherisheth the same, euen as Christ doth his Church: and it is confirmed, because the flesh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. v. 29.</note> nothing without the soule.

               <p>You haue so soundly proued that mans regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is vnperfect, and that originall concupiscence still remaineth euen formally in the vnregenerate, not onely in

man, in whom there is much good continually. I proue it many wayes: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because in the very next chapter, the<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 1.</note> spirit of God pronounceth <hi>Noah</hi> righteous in his sight.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because holy writ affirmeth constantly that <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi>

               <p>The best workes of the regenerate are vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and consequently the regenerate man sinneth in the best worke he doth?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Remig.</speaker>
               <p>Your consequence doth not hold, the reason is at hand, viz. because euery imperfection, neither doth nor can make a good act euill: for although imperfection be so linked and chained with sinne in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> regenerate, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be found, there is sinne also in the same subiect; yet is not that sin in the act well done, but either in some other act euill done, or else in the omission of that which ought to be done. Let vs take an example for the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth and question now in hand; and let vs suppose, that <hi>S. R</hi> hath lent 40. pounds vnto <hi>T.

Howbeit, he doth not wrong the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in bringing him 30. pounds, but the iniury is done in not bringing more.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>He wrongeth his creditor by his vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in that he doth not bring him the iust summe which he borrowed.</p>

                  <p>True that is, and I desire no more: the holy<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 25.</note> Apostle decideth the controuersie, in these golden words: I my selfe in my mind serue the law of God, but in my flesh the law of sinne: here the chosen vessell of God doth plainely expresse, and liuely lay open before our eyes, that himselfe both did good workes, and also sinned while he did the same, though not in the same respect: for, to serue

the law of God, is a right good worke, but to serue the law of sinne, is a great offence: yet both these the Apostle did at the same time, though not in the same respect: for, as he was regenerate, he serued God truly; but in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate parts both of body &amp; soule, or flesh and mind, (which with the Apostle are all one) he sinned damnably.</p>

The words are very emphaticall, (for I<note place="margin">Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are kept in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> am carnall) S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of himselfe, being the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate child of God, and for all that fréely acknowledgeth himselfe to be carnall, and sold vnder sinne.
