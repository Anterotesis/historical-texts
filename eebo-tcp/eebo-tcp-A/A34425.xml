         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe your Excellency,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>DID I not very well know your great
Underſtanding in, and Love to the
Subject of the enſuing Diſcourſe, I durſt
<pb facs="tcp:54356:3"/>
not aſſume the Boldneſs to implore your
Honours Patronage of it; But being well
aſſured, that you have not been onely a
Spectator, but an Actor in moſt of what
is treated of in the enſuing Lines; for,
to your Eternal Prayſe be it ſpoken, there
is many a fine Tree which you have
Nurſed up from Seeds ſown by your
own hands, and many thouſands more
which you have commanded me to
raiſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore, my Lord, I humbly crave
your Pardon for the Preſumption and
Imperfection of the Pen-man; and though
your Excellency knows full well how to
prune young Trees, yet I hope you will
paſs by the impertinent and ſuperfluous
Lines in this my Plantation; which,
though I have endeavoured to keep as
well pruned from Errors, and as clean
from Weeds as I could, yet 'tis poſsible
there may be ſome things in it, which
<pb facs="tcp:54356:3"/>
ſome may term as ill: But to You all
things in it are ſo well known, that I
hope both it and I ſhall find ſuch ſhelter
and ſupport by your favourable Aſpect,
as that we need not to fear the Storms of
the ignorant or negligent Planters.</p>
            <p>And my Lord, ſince the Art of Raiſing
and Improving of Trees, hath ever been
eſteemed amongſt the truly Noble, Wiſe,
Ingenious and moſt refined Spirits of the
World from Age to Age, and chiefly
maintained and practiſed by them; and
ſince this Property is Naturally inherent
in You, (you being not onely a great
Lover of this Art, but alſo moſt skilfull
in it) I humbly preſume to Dedicate theſe
my Obſervations to your Lordſhip; not
being ignorant, that he who is moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any thing, is the beſt able to judge
of the ſame; and that this my Opinion,
of your Honours Ability and Prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

<pb facs="tcp:54356:4"/>
of <hi>Forreſt-trees,</hi> is ſurely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

            <head>TO
The Courteous READER.</head>
            <p>AMongſt the many Books that are ſent into the world
in this Age, I have adventured to increaſe the
Number by this one. I know there be many Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
prodigious Hiſtories and Romances, invented by
mens Fancies, which abuſe many Noble Spirits, in reading
of which they ſpend their time in vain, and dull their Wits:
Which Books are more fit for Women than Men. For they
will furniſh them with ſtrange Stories, and a few fine words.
Alſo there be many Books of Diſputes in Divinity, which
tend more to make our Differences the greater, than any
wayes to edifie or unite us: therefore if your Genius leads
you to read ſuch Books, this is not for your Fancy.</p>
            <p>But if you take delight in Planting or Gardening, or to
raiſe and improve Forreſt-trees, or to make Walks, Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
or Lawns; to plant or improve your Woods, Hedges,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to meaſure moſt ſorts of ſuperficial or ſolid Figures,
either by Arithmetick or Geometry, with ſeveral other
Rules of the ſame Nature, as the Titles of each Chapter,
(but eſpecially the Chapters themſelves) will more fully
inform you; then I hope this Book will be of good uſe to
you: For here are ſeveral Rules, approved of by ſeveral
Noble and Ingenious Men, which are as faithfully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
as they are really intended for the good of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:54356:5"/>
and all thoſe that will put them in practice; which
if you pleaſe to doe, you will employ your time ſo well,
that you will never have cauſe to ſay, it is ill ſpent; and
if once you do but ſtep forward one ſtep, and ſee but any
ſucceſs of your Labours, you will need then no Logicians
Arguments, nor no Rhetoricians Eloquence to perſwade
you to proceed. And for your better Encouragement
know, that it hath been and is the Delight and Practice
of Kings, Princes, Philoſophers, and all Noble ſpirited and
wiſe Men: For have not many of them quitted their great
Employs, and taken upon them this pleaſing Art of Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Gardening, as is proved by ſeveral? See the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
of <hi>Perkinſon</hi>'s, <hi>Gerard</hi>'s, the Curate of <hi>Henonville</hi>'s,
and ſeveral others. For Almighty God hath Imprinted in
the Hearts of moſt wiſe men ſuch a Love to Plants in part,
as their Father <hi>Adam</hi> had in his ſtate of Innocency; that
thoſe noble and uſefull Works, which the Almighty made
for the uſe of Man, and his Glory, ſhould be the more
common for their excellent uſe to the Sons of Men; and
that they ſhould take care of thoſe which are tender, and
want the more care, leſt they ſhould be loſt; and alſo
that both their Vertues and their Beauties ſhould be known
in ſeveral parts of the World, that he might be the more
Admired and Glorified.</p>
            <p>For I do believe that the Bleſſing of God is much Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
to thoſe who Love and endeavour to Improve and
Preſerve his Works; for God's Works and his Word are
no ſuch different things; and alſo it hath been and is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that thoſe that are Waſters and wilfull Spoylers
of Trees and Plants without juſt Reaſon ſo to doe, have
ſeldom proſpered in this World. See this confirmed by
Eſquire <hi>Evelyn,</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Diſcourſe of Forreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees.</hi>
Therefore, you that are Lovers of Trees and Plants,
if once you have them, let your Love be ſhewed in the
Care you take of them, to keep them from Cattel and
<pb facs="tcp:54356:5"/>
other Inconveniencies, then will you not onely have Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and Profit of them, but others, by being defended
from the malignant and ſharp Air by their Heads and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and alſo ſhaded from the violent Heats, and their
ſweet Flowers, and their refreſhing Fruit will be uſefull
to ſeveral men.</p>
            <p>Alſo Planting and Gardening addes much to the Health
and Content of Man; and theſe two Jewels, no man that
well underſtands himſelf, would willingly be without:
For it is not onely ſet down for a certain Truth by many
wiſe Men, but confirmed by Experience. The Learned
Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> commends the following of the Plough in freſh
Ground, to be very healthful for Man; but more the
Digging in Gardens, ſaying, <hi>It is beſt to take the Air of the
Earth new turned up by Digging with the Spade, or ſtanding
by him that diggeth:</hi> He tells you alſo that he knew a
great Man, that lived long, who had a clean Clod of Earth
brought to him every Morning as he ſate in his Bed, and
would hold his Head over it a good pretty while, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
See <hi>pag.</hi> 203. of his <hi>Natural Hiſtory.</hi> For though the Earth
be two-fold, External or Viſible, and Internal or Inviſible;
the External is not the Element, but the Body of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which is the Sulphur, Mercury and Salt; for the
Element of the Earth is Life and Spirit, wherein lies the
<hi>Aſtra</hi>'s of the Earth which bring forth all growing things;
for it hath in it ſelf the Seeds and ſeminal Vertues of all
things; for as it is made fruitfull by all the other Elements,
ſo it bringeth forth all things out of it ſelf, as Trees, Herbs
and Flowers; and every one of theſe is again the <hi>Aſtrum</hi>
and Seed: See <hi>Philoſophy Reformed,</hi> p. 38. Thus is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Earth hath in it the Virtues of all Herbs;
it muſt then be alſo healthful as they be: But for that
part of the Earth that is neer the Surface, the Plants ſuck
moſt of its Virtue into them; therefore that which lieth
deeper may be the more healthfull for Man to ſmell of
<pb facs="tcp:54356:6"/>
for Conſumption, Loſs of Appetite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Trees do
not onely catch the Mildew and other offenſive Dews
with their Leaves, but ſcreen the Aire of other bad ones,
and makes it much the healthfuller for Man. Therefore,
you that live neer to Fenns, Moors, and other unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
places, plant your Seats round with Trees, and ſome
of thoſe that yield healthfull ſmells: For it is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
what the aforeſaid Learned Author ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 204.
<hi>That Odours do Nouriſh;</hi> for he ſaith, he knew a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that would faſt three or four dayes, without Meat,
Bread or Drink, by onely ſmelling to a great wiſp of
Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>p.</hi> 44. in the Hiſtory of his Life and
Death, ſaith, <hi>That Odours are eſpecially profitable for the
Comforting of the Heart:</hi> And further he ſaith, <hi>We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
above all other Odours, that of Plants growing and not
plucked, taken in the open Aire, as Violets, Gilly-flowers, Pinks,
Bean-flowers, Line-tree Bloſſoms, Hony-ſuckles, Wall-flowers,
Roſes, Mints, Lavender,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Orange-trees, Citron, Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Therefore to walk or ſit neer the breath of theſe
Plants, would not be neglected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee this Learned man takes notice of the
Line-tree; and if the ſimple Water that is diſtilled from
the Flowers, be good againſt the Plague, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
Diſeaſes, as certain it is, then ſure the ſmell from
the Bloſſoms themſelves muſt be very good; therefore
excellent to plant neer your Houſes: And (as I have
heard) a wiſe Mans Opinion was, That the Line-trees in
the Cities in <hi>Holland</hi> adde much to the Health of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants;
and it is my belief. I have hinted at the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of one Lime or Line-tree, in the enſuing lines, and
ſhall here ſhew you, for your further encouragement to
plant and preſerve Trees, the Content of one Tree, as I
had it from the Honourable Sir <hi>Henry Capell</hi> as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

think that putting ſeeds into ſuch things will ſtupifie
them and deſtroy them; but if they ſhould unite in one
ſhoot, that ſhoot that groweth the faſteſt would lead all the
ſap into its Head, and ſo ſtrain it through its Pores, that
it would make no more Alteration of a Fruit, that ſuch
a ſhoot would Naturally have had, than a Graft doth by
being grafted on ſeveral ſtocks.</p>
            <p>For what Alteration there is of Plants, it is from their
Seed, and is ſtamped in them at their firſt Conception and
<pb facs="tcp:54356:7"/>
Nativity, which the Art of Man helpeth and may improve
ſomewhat, but never to alter the Kind, by Budding, Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

following Errors; but if you be not ſatisfied with my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are ſo, I ſhall anſwer them when you deſire me,
as well as I can: So I ſhall onely name them, and ſhew you
them as I have found them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Error:</hi> To water Seeds with coloured water; or
Plants, to make them produce what coloured Flowers or
Fruit you pleaſe; It is in vain to think ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Er.</hi> To graft or bud Stone-Fruit, or Kernels, or
Nuts, or to bud ſuch Fruit as beareth Kernels on ſuch as
beareth Nuts or Stones; or to bud Fruits-trees on Forreſt,
and the contrary; or to graft or bud Figs on Peaches, or
Apricocks; or to bud any ſort of Trees on Coleworts;
or to bud Peaches on the Mulberry-tree to have them
Early; or to bud Damſons on Gooſeberry, Mulberry or
Cherries, to have them Ripe all Summer; or by budding
Cherries on theſe Stocks, and to wet them in Honey and
Cloves, makes them taſte ſweet and ſpicy; or by budding
or grafting, to make a Fruit taſte half an Apple and half
a Pear, or half a Pippin and half a Pearmain; or an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
half-ſweet, half-ſoure; or to graft a Roſe on a Holly;
or to graft Cherries on other Stone-fruit to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Stones; or to graft a Vine on a Cherry; or to take
the Pith out of two Grafts, and then joyn them together
and graft them, brings a Fruit without Kernels, ſo they
may when both grow; or to graft a Cyon with the ſmall
End downward, will make it bring a Fruit without Core:
Theſe, and the like, are great Errors, and very falſe in
Grafting and Budding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth Er.</hi> To ſet a whole Apple or Pear, the Pippins
will come forth in one ſhoot; or to ſet any ſort of Fruit
with the fleſhy part on; are alſo great Errors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54356:7"/>
               <hi>Fifth Er.</hi> To bore holes in Trees, and to put Honey or
other ſweet things into them, to make them bear more and
ſweet Fruit; is alſo a great Fallacy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth Er.</hi> To think that the Sap of Trees at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Winter falleth from the Head into the Root, is
a groſs miſtake. Many more there are which I could count
up; but theſe are too many, either to be written or kept
in Memory.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewed you ſome Errors, I here beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for mine own that are in this Book. I know I have
committed Tautology; the Reaſon is, I have been long
in taking true Obſervations: but I hope that which is ſo
uſefull, cannot be too often repeated. I have uſed Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick
the more, becauſe it is ſo uſefull to the ingenious
Planter; for I have not laboured to pleaſe my ſelf onely,
but for all thoſe that ſeek Wiſdom: For the Gifts of God
are improved by communicating, and Knowledge thriveth
as Ingenuity is improved and communicated: for Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath theſe Properties of Memory and Charity, the more
you uſe it, the better it is; and the more you give of it,
the more you ſhall have.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall ſhew you how I did proceed in that
which I was born to, not made: I alwayes took Notes
of what I did ſet or ſow, the Time, and on what Ground,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when it proved well, I noted it ſo; but when
ill, I did endeavouras much as I could to know the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
which when once I found, I noted it well: I alſo
alwayes was very wary of taking things upon truſt; for
many Learned men have abuſed their Works by ſo doing;
and if any man told me any thing, unleſs he had ſufficient
Experience of it, or could give very good Reaſons why
it was ſo, I alwayes was incredulous of it, unleſs my
Judgement told me it were poſſible, or he by Diſcourſe
made it plain to me: For no man ought to deprive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:54356:8"/>
of the Liberty of Humane Ingenuity, that hath Light
of Nature to diſcern and judge by.</p>
            <p>I have often been blamed by Noble-Men, for not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to the Opinion of ſome of their Favourites; for
when their Notions were not grounded on Reaſon, or had
not been proved by Experience, (though never ſo new)
I could not well entertain them. So if you find any thing
in theſe few Lines, that hath not Reaſon in it, prove by
Experience whether it is true or not: And do not ſay, It
is ſo or ſo, becauſe I ſay it; but as you find it. And let
me be plain with you further; alwayes when I undertook
any difficult buſineſs, I was as carefull as I could be, to
elect a fit time to begin that buſineſs in: And to the prayſe
of God I ſpeak it, I alwayes had the greateſt ſucceſs in my
greateſt undertakings, though many times I have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
Ignorant in them; and many times failed in ſmall
things, when I thought of the leaſt danger. I know ſome
will ſmile at this Truth, but let them laugh that win; I
never loſt by it. The wiſeſt man that ever was, tells you,
<hi>There is a Time for all things;</hi> and certainly there is in
Sowing, Grafting and Gardening: For it ſhall be my
Opinion,
<q>
                  <l>To think and judge as cauſe I find,</l>
                  <l>My Rule is not anothers Mind.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Or as the ingenious Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> hath it from the Learned
<hi>Dubartas:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Senſeleſs is he who (without bluſh) denies,</l>
                  <l>What to ſound Senſes moſt Apparent lies;</l>
                  <l>And 'gainſt Experience he that ſpits Fallacians,</l>
                  <l>Is to be hiſs'd from Learned Diſputations;</l>
                  <l>And ſuch is he that doth affirm the Stars</l>
                  <l>To have no force on theſe Inferiours.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54356:8"/>
But to conclude; I have here ſhewed you ſome Rules
how to prune Forreſt-trees, which well done adds much to
their ſhape, growth, and long life; Every one that makes
any Obſervation of Trees ſeeth this truth confirmed in their
ſſhape; and though many are againſt pruning of Forreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,
yet it adds much to their growth; and if done by a
skilful hand and at fit times, it adds much to the goodneſs
of the Timber, though ſeveral (it's poſſible) will tell you
to the contrary, for it is the borrower that things of truſt,
that is Truth's greateſt greateſt Oppoſer: But to confirm the
growth by pruning, take this Example: There grew a
young Oak near the Orange-houſe at <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> about
nine inches Diameter, with many young Boughs on the ſides,
which robbed the Head ſo much, that it did ſhoot but
little, having more boughs than the Roots could well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
I took off the ſide-boughs in the year 1669; and in
the year 1675, My Lord ordered me to fell it, it ſtanding
too near a Walk we had made. My Lord being at <hi>Caſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and diſcourſing of pruning Forreſt-trees with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Artiſts Sir <hi>Samuel Moreland</hi> and <hi>Hugh May</hi> Eſquire, I
ſhewd them the Truth confirmed in this Tree; for that year
it was pruned it did grow ⅖ of an Inch, which was near as
it had grown in five years before; It continued that
growth very near for the ſix years after, as did plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by Annual Circles to them and me. And as good
Pruning doth help the growth of Trees, ſo alſo it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
their Life: For it is well known that the pruning of
ſome Annual Plants will make them live more years than
one; for good Pruning may take off that which ill prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath left, or the wind, which otherwiſe would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Tree in little time. And as I have ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this Book of Pruning Forreſt-trees, ſo I wiſh ſome
able man would ſhew ſome Rules, or his Judgement of
Pruning all ſorts of Fruit-trees and Plants that bear Fruit,
that there might be ſome light for a man to ſee to ground
<pb facs="tcp:54356:9"/>
his Reaſons on; for we are much to ſeek both in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how, and the Time when to Prune our Fruit-trees, both
to Improve them and their Fruit.</p>
            <p>I alſo have ſhewed you ſeveral Rules of Artificial Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick
by the Canon of Logarithms, and ſeveral Rules
of the Line of Numbers or <hi>Gunters</hi> Line; which for their
excellent uſes cannot be made too common, or too well
known to the Ingenious.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, I have not buſhelled my Light, but have ſet
it to the Publick view; which if it enlighten thee in the
good and true way which I intend, to thy benefit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
it's poſsible I ſhall doe thee, if the Lord permit,
ſome other piece of ſervice, farther to direct thee in the
Truth.</p>
            <p>My requeſt to thee is to Correct the miſpointing, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
for my buſineſs is ſuch, that I cannot ſee it Corrected
my ſelf, but truſting in your goodneſs ſhall conclude:

            <head type="sub">Of the ſeveral Wayes of Raiſing Trees: The beſt for Forreſt-trees
is by their Seeds, Keyes, or Nuts, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>YOu may raiſe moſt ſorts of Trees by Laying; the Aſh being one
of the worſt, of any I have experienced: but it will take by Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
if you be an obſerver of the growth of the Aſh, you then
may read the Reaſon plainly, if that you keep but the eyes of your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
open, which I take to be this: Of all the Trees that I know,
an Aſh ſhoots with the ſtraighteſt ſhot from his Seed, and ſo continues till
it comes to a great heighth, unleſs by accident; therefore ſeldom touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ground by its own growth: But if it ſhould, it having no Arms
to defend it againſt Cattel, and they being great lovers of the tops and
leaves, prevent its natural Increaſe that way, finding it ſelf rarely or
never encreaſed by this kind of propagation, it being not accuſtomed
to Laying, therefore the harder to grow.</p>
            <p>Your Oak will grow of Laying, ſo will your Elm very frequently, as
I have ſeen in ſeveral Hedges, without any thing of Art: As you may
ſee the great leaved Elm thrive well of a Layer on a bank by the Road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
from <hi>Ware</hi> to the Right Woſhipfull Sir <hi>Thomas Leventhorps</hi> houſe
called <hi>Blacks-Ware.</hi> It is worth your noting, to increaſe this uſefull wood
in your Hedges; as alſo other ſorts of Wood, which will be much for
your profit, and alſo a great improvement to your Fence, though it be
at preſent altogether neglected. Of the manner and ſeveral wayes of
Laying, ſee the <hi>Fifth Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Several ſorts of Trees will grow of Cuttings; the Manner and
Time I ſhall ſhew in the ſucceeding Chapter. But let me now invite you
when you fell your Woods, to give ſome of theſe Cuttings Quarters in
the Naked places, and you ſhall find them afterwards to pay you well
for their Board: Remember your Hedges alſo where they want Gueſts
to furniſh them.</p>
            <p>You may raiſe many ſorts of Trees by the Roots, or part of Roots
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54356:10"/>
of other Trees: The Kinds and Manner are ſhewed hereafter, which if
you love your Woods and your ſelf, you may take notice of.</p>
            <p>3. Many ſorts of Trees may be increaſed on other Stocks by Budding
or Grafting, but this is more proper for Fruit-trees than for your Foreſt:
For take it for granted, that it hinders the aſpiring growth of Trees, and
makes them bear more. I know my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> tells you of Budding
the Elm, and it will have greater leaves than ordinary: It is likely, if you
bud the great-leaved Elm upon the ſmall-leaved whileſt it is young and
full of ſap, it will have larger leaves, eſpecially than an old tree; but
that I judge ſignifies little.</p>
            <p>Enquiry may be made, whether by budding the Elm and alſo the Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
if it would not make their ſeeds keep better than they do many
years with us: I wiſh it were tryed. As for the manner of Budding and
Grafting, I referre you to other ſubjects, for there are many have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
largely thereof.</p>
            <p>4. The laſt and beſt way to raiſe your Forreſt-trees, is by their Seeds;
and how to do that, I ſhall ſhew you in every particular Chapter, by me
experienced. I wiſh every Noble-man or Gentleman that takes delight
in theſe ſtately Monuments, would follow the Example of the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and very much knowing in theſe Lines, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who
hath now ſeveral thouſands of my Raiſing.</p>
            <p>Let me be bold to tell you, that one Aſh-tree raiſed in a Nurſery, and
ordered as is hereafter ſhewed, is worth five taken out of a VVood.
For there you ſhall have them grow taper and ſtrong, ſo that when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them, cut but off ſome of the ſide-boughs, and ſet them with great
hopes of a ſtately Timber-tree. But if you take them out of a VVood,
then will they be not ſo well rooted, nor taper, but top-heavy; therefore
you muſt be forc'd to take off the Heads before you ſet them, and then
expect at beſt but a good Pollard; and it is poſſible you may wait
long before you get him to thrive: For the head being taken off, leaves
ſuch a wound which is long a curing; which you muſt doe, or elſe his
Roots will not maintain that Head. Ever let me adviſe you to be as
ſparing in taking off the leading top-ſhot of an Aſh or VValnut as you
can poſſible.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed the ſeveral wayes to raiſe Trees; for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of the ſame, read hereafter; and this is certain, that a few of your
Trees raiſed in a Nurſery, are much better than thoſe you take out of
VVoods. My Lord was a little before I came to him at ſome Charge
more than ordinary to raiſe ſome Oaks: Their way was to fence in a
great Oak in the Park, and then digged the ground; and when the
Acorns were moſt of them down, then they raked them in: By this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54356:10"/>
Husbandry, my Lord had got eight young Oaks about ſix year old: I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
his Honour to take up his Fence, ſatisfying him we ſhould raiſe
them at a much cheaper lay. He therefore ordered me to take up theſe
Oaks very carefully: I having two Men then at work with me, I bid
the elder goe and take up theſe Oaks, but could not get him to goe by no
means; he alſo had poſſeſt the other with ſuch a tragical ſtory, that I could
not perſwade him; which was, that there were few which took up an Oak,
but either they or it dyed in a little time after. I told them that it was
poſſible the Oaks might die in a ſhort time, but they never the ſooner.
The Reaſon may be the ſame with that before, of raiſing an Aſh by laying:
It being not uſed to be removed, makes them the more difficult to grow
when they are. But I went and took up my eight Trees, and loſt Six
of them the Winter following. Had they been taken up at two years
growth, and the tap-root cut, you afterwards might remove them with
little danger. I judge, if you can, it will not be amiſs to ſave your Acorns
or ſeeds of this Tree that hath been removed.</p>

            <head type="sub">How to obſerve and know the Nature of Seeds, ſo as the better to
raiſe them.</head>
            <p>I Ever obſerved the ſhape, taſte, skin or ſhell, that my Keyes, Nuts,
Stones, Kernels, or Seeds had; and if I found by their ſhape, they
were pory, and by feeling ſpongy, taſting little or very mild; I then
did conclude to ſowe theſe ſorts of Seeds as ſoon as they were ripe, or as
ſoon at leaſt as I received them; which if they were kept but a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the time of their being ripe, I then expected but little ſucceſs of thoſe
Seeds. To give you a taſte of this Novelty, obſerve but theſe few among
many more, that is, the Elm, Sallow, Popler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Angelico, Paſpere,
or Garden Samphire, Scoſanara, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know 'tis a Tradition, that the Elm and Sallow have no ſeeds: Then
how could I raiſe ſeveral of them of Seeds, as I have done? But if you
will not believe me, I pray you aſk the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or ſeveral others
therefore.</p>
            <q>

Truth with Experience through this Nation</l>
               <l>Shall Sainted be by a right Obſervation.</l>
               <l>Leave room Aſtrologers for Truth, and ſee</l>
               <l>You write it next year in your Diary.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now thoſe Seeds that are of Taſte mild, Skin or Shell cloſe, you may
keep them till the Spring approach, and longer, if temperately dryed;
and dry, keep as your Acorns, and your Cheſnuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Spring
after they be gathered is a ſure ſeaſon to ſow them, therefore deferre no
longer.</p>
            <p>But as for your Seeds that are of a hot or bitter taſte, or have cloſe skins
or ſhells, you may keep them till the Autumn following after they be
gathered, if occaſion be, if they be ripe gathered and dry kept, ſo the
fleſhy part be clean taken off when that is ripe: Though I know an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
perſon did hold, that to ſow them with their fleſh on, (as Peaches
or Cherries,) they would grow as well, as he ſaid; but that was his
miſtake: For the fleſhy part was ordained by the Almighty for the uſe of
Man, Beaſts or Birds, and tends nothing to the growth of the Seed or
Stone, but rather to its diſſolution, by ſtupefying it, as I have tryed by
ſowing the Kernels of rotten Pears and Apples, which would not grow
though but a little time rotten. There be many Stones, Keyes and Seeds
which be of a hot and bitter taſte, as your Aſh, Peaches, Almonds, the
Mizerion, Muſtard-ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet though I ſay they may be kept long,
yet I adviſe you not to neglect your ſeaſon; for many of theſe Seeds and
others will lie near two years in the Ground before they come up: if
you ſowe them in <hi>October,</hi> it will be the Spring come Twelve-months
before they come up; and if you ſow them Early in the Spring, they then
will come up the next Spring.</p>
            <p>Another way whereby you may know Seed of this Nature, is, by their
long hanging on the trees: for there, Nature finding it ſelf ſtrong, taketh
the leſs care to ſeek out early to preſerve its kind, and alſo Almighty
God hath made theſe very uſefull for the Creatures in this world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath ordered it thus by his Divine Providence. The Aſh, Holly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
hang long on the tree, and lie long in the ground, the Elm, Sallow, Syca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
fall ſoon, and come up ſoon.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Shape of Seeds and their Weight do Inform you how to ſet
them.</head>
            <p>THe very Form and Shape of Seeds hath inſtructed me how to
ſet them: as an Acorn falls to the ground moſt with its ſmall
End downwards: Thus if they fall upon Mold or Moſs, you
may obſerve the moſt of them to be on one ſide, with the ſmall end tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moſt to the Earth. And I ſuppoſe that this poſture is the beſt for to
ſet any Stone or Nut, if you will be curious: For if you obſerve any
Seed, of what Tree ſoever it be that grows in <hi>England,</hi> firſt it puts forth
a Root at the ſmall End, and when that Root hath laid hold of the Ground,
then it puts forth the ſhot for the tree at the very ſame place where the
Root came. Then ſeeing that both Root and ſhoot put out at the ſmall
End, if ſet with the ſmall End downwards, the Body of the Stone or Seed
may hinder the ſhoot; ſo that it is the beſt way to lay them on their
ſides in the Ground: if they be heavy ſeeds you may ſow them the
deeper, as Acorn, Peach, Apricock, Walnut, Cheſnut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> about two
or three Inches deep.</p>
            <p>If light Seed, then cover them with but little Mold, as the Elm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as ½ an Inch deep.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, lay the flatteſt ſide of your Seed downwards; as
if it be a Peach ſtone, ſet it as it will lye on a Table, or the like, and it
will lie with the Crack where the ſhell parts uppermoſt, and the other
crack lowermoſt to let out the water, as I judge; for Kernels in Stones
or Shells do not love too much water at firſt.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed you the ſeveral wayes to raiſe Trees: That is,
how they may be raiſed, and how to know the time, at leaſt to aſſiſt you
to know the time to ſet them by their ſhapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo how to ſet
them the beſt way by their Form and Weight, which may be ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
to you, if you meet with far-Countrey ſeeds.</p>
            <p>My Lord had thirteen ſorts of ſtrange ſeeds ſent him, as I remember
from <hi>Goa:</hi> I never ſaw the like, nor none that ſaw them here. By the
help of thoſe aforeſaid Reaſons, I raiſed ten of the thirteen ſorts, though
ſome of them lay almoſt a year in the ground: But I alſo muſt tell you
I loſt all my ten ſorts the firſt Winter, but one ſort, and that the ſecond,
for want of a Green-houſe: ſome of them I ſuppoſe were Annuels. I

            <head type="sub">Obſervations of all ſorts of Keyes and Seeds.</head>
            <p>LEt your Keyes be through-ripe, or when you find them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to fall much, which is a ſure ſign of any Fruit or ſeeds Ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
(unleſs by accident) gather them off ſome young, ſtraight,
thriving tree: My reaſon of gathering them from off a young thriving
tree, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then will your Keyes or ſeed be the larger and ſolider; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by conſequence they be the abler and likelier to ſhoot the ſtronger,
and to maintain themſelves the better: And I know by Experience, that
the ſeeds gathered of old Plants or Trees, or old ſeeds, ſo the ſeeds be
perfect, will come up ſomewhat ſooner than the ſeed of young Trees:
my aforeſaid Reaſon doth this ſomewhat demonſtrate; or take it thus,
Nature finding her ſelf weak in theſe Seeds, doth (like a provident Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
ſeek the ſooner to provide for her weak Children; as a great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
and Naturaliſt ſaith, That Nature is one in divers things, and
various in one thing. See <hi>Parad.</hi> pag. 90. <hi>of the Tree of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to gather them off a ſtraight and thriving tree, 'tis likelier they
will run more up, and grow ſtraighter than thoſe which be gathered of
Pollards. This I know, that Nature doth delight very much in Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in Plants and Trees like doth endeavour to produce its like:
though I know, that by the ſcituation, or ground, or grafting of ſome ſort
of Stocks, that by any of theſe the trees may and will alter ſomething,
both in growth and largeneſs of Fruit, and earlyer, or the contrary, but
the <hi>ſpecies</hi> will be ſtill the ſame. To which I adde, good keeping or dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of any tree, doth much improve its growth, and largeneſs of Fruit
or Seeds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54356:12"/>
Now the Seed being that part of the Plant which is endowed with a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Faculty to bring forth its like, it contains potentially the whole Plant
in it, therefore it may and is the more to be obſerved: Or as a learned
Phyſitian hath it, ſpeaking of Man and the World; The Chaos or firſt
Matter was made a World, and of this World was made Man: ſo a
Tree groweth from the Seed, the Seed is the beginning of the Tree, and
in every grain or ſeed of a Tree there lies hid another three. See <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
Reformed,</hi> page 58.</p>
            <p>The Induſtrious Farmer or Yeoman will take care that the Grain
which he ſoweth be of the beſt Kind for Largeneſs and Goodneſs in every
particular, and hath oft found by Experience to his loſs, that the Corn
which is taken to ſowe from that which was your ſmooted or mill dew'd,
doth oft produce ſmooted or black Corn again; he knowing alſo that
this black Corn which is like duſt within, will not grow: Then what ſhould
be the Reaſon that that which growes in the ſame Ear will oft-times
produce black ſmooted Corn, that hath nothing but a little black duſt in
it, or a black flinty Kernel of little or no uſe, but harmfull to the reſt,
though that which you ſowe ſeem ſound, and a very likely berryed Corn?
When I have found by Experience, that Wheat which hath not been ſo
likely to the Eye as that which was freer from ſmooted Corn, hath brought
or produced clearer Corn by much than the others. Now I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
with ſome which would not ſpare to ſay poſitively, that your
ſmooted or black Wheat would grow, and ſo produce black Wheat
again, which is a great Miſtake: But this I know, that your Wheat which
is like black duſt within, will not grow at all; nor ſome of your black
flinty Wheat, but ſome of it will produce blades, ſome ſtalks, with ears,
but no ſound grain; ſome with good and bad in one ear, and ſo the
nearer it is to perfect ſound grain, the nearer it produceth its like: Yet
though this may and will produce ſome good and ſome bad, as I ſay,
yet no black ſmooted grain (unleſs meeting with ſome accidental Cauſe, if
the Grain be perfect ſound) but according to its defect ſo may be the
ſucceſs of your Crop.</p>
            <p>Now this which I call the Accidental Cauſe, is the Mildew, which may
well be ſo called, becauſe of its Malignity, eſpecially to Wheat and Hops,
becauſe in them moſt perfected though many other Plants ſuffer as
much: This Maldew or Mildew, is a Dew which is drawn from the Earth
and Herbs in a drye and calm time, and when Herbs are in their prime,
by the Sun; and wanting wind to fan off their groſneſs, and alſo being
drawn from Herbs, which make it thick and ſweet, and not ſo active to
aſpire: 'tis moſt in your incloſed Grounds and Valleys: and to thoſe
grounds which lie tending to the Oriental part of the Heavens, as all Blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
winds are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54356:13"/>
Now I ſuppoſe theſe may be the Reaſons your Valleyes do afford
more moyſture than your Hills, as is oft ſeen by your Miſts which
are more frequent in them than on Hills: this being drawn up by
the Sun in the Day-time, and wanting wind to aſſiſt its Motion (as
I ſaid before) doth hang in the lower Region, and when the Sun ſets,
it falls upon your Plants with its thick clammy ſubſtance; and in thoſe
whoſe bark is tender and young, and pores open with the heat of the
ſeaſon, hinders the ſap of the Plant or Tree to aſcend to nouriſh his
flowers or ſhoot. 'Tis obſerved, that when your Wheat doth ſhoot up
to Ear and flower, it doth it ſuddenly, and likewiſe your Hops, and
then this Clammy or Mildew coming upon it before the Air hath hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it, to reſiſt it; For the Air being warm, Nature doth not ſo much
as dream of this unkind Enemy: And if it falls on Wheat when the Ear
is new formed, then there is the black ſmooty Wheat; but if the Ear
hath blown even when or before it comes, or that the whole ſtalk be
not ſurrounded with it, then you ſhall have ſome of your grains good,
and ſome bad, according as they were in ſetting, or find Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I have oft obſerved in your black Heart, white Heart, and other great-leaved
Cherries, this Dew to fall upon them at the top, juſt at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>Midſommer</hi> ſhoot, and hath ſo ſtopped the ſhoot, that it hath
ſhot forth in other places below; and on the top of the ſhoots you may
ſee many little Flies feeding on this Dew; and on the Leaves of Oak
and Maple, 'tis plainly to be ſeen and taſted; and though deſtructive
to Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it is mighty Relief to the induſtrious Bees.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why thoſe grounds which hang from the Horizon to the
Eaſt, are moſt ſubject to this Dew, and to Blaſting, as it is termed, may
be (as I judge) the Suns drawing theſe vapours towards it; juſt as a great
Fire draweth the Air in a Room to it ſo the Sun having ſet theſe in Motion,
yet not having ſtrength enough to draw them into the middle Region,
to form them into a Cloud, doth yet draw them till he is below our
Horizon, then theſe Dews tend to the Earth from whence they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and in motion to the Weſt do as it were fall upon that Ground
which hangs Eaſtward at right Angles, therefore offenſive to them
moſt.</p>
            <p>But ſince I am ſpeaking of this uſefull Grain Wheat, I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that which I know is uſed with good ſucceſs: They take their
Seed-wheat, and ſteep it twenty or twenty four hours in water and Salt,
which is found by experience to do good to the Wheat againſt the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and helps it in its growth; the Reaſons I conceive are theſe: The
ſteeping it prepares it for its ſpearing, and makes it take root the ſooner;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54356:13"/>
therefore if late in ſowing, ſteep the longer; if early, not ſo long: And
if there be any Grain that is not perfect ſound, this will either kill or
cure it. And I ſuppoſe that Brine to Wheat, is as Sack to a young
Child, a little doth a great deal of good; but have a care you do not
let it lie too long in a ſtrong Brine, leſt you ſtupifie it, or kill it with too
much Kindneſs. I do adviſe my Countrey-men, if late in ſowing any of
their Grains, to ſteep eſpecially Barley, as well as Wheat; if your Grain
be ſpear'd, it is never the worſe, provided you ſow it before the ſpear
be chill'd or dryed; therefore commit it to the Ground, and cover it as
you can. Your Wheat, Oats, and Barley differ much in their growth from
other ſeeds; for they put forth their roots at the great end, and then
one blade or long leaf at the ſmall end, which comes between the skin
and the body of the ſeed. Your Beans and Peaſe put forth their Root
at the ſide, and then the ſame ſort of Leaf, at the ſame place where the
Root came out, that grows on the ſtalks.</p>
            <p>So doth your Walnut, Cheſnut, Horſe-Cheſnut, Peaches, Almonds,
Apricocks, Plumbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the onely difference from Beans and Peaſe,
is, that theſe Stone-fruits put forth at the ſmall ends, and the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
at the ſides.</p>
            <p>In like manner there be ſeveral ſorts of Trees, and moſt ſorts of Plants
that be ſmall, which put forth Root at the ſmall end; and as ſoon as
that Root hath laid hold of the ground, they then ſend out two falſe
Leaves, nothing like thoſe that grow on the Tree or Plant, which two
falſe Leaves are the ſeed, which divides into two parts, and ſo ſtand ſome
ſmall time on the top of the ground: and then between theſe two falſe
Leaves comes forth a Shoot, which produceth leaves like thoſe of the
Tree or Plant from whence it came. Of this way of growth, there be
an infinite number both of Trees and Plants, as the Elm, Aſh, Sycamore,
Maple, Pear, Apple, Quince, and the moſt ſorts of the ſeeds of Trees
which are not environed by Stones or Shells: of ſeeds, the Melon,
Parſnip, Carrot, Carduus, Angelica, and indeed moſt ſorts of ſeeds.</p>

            <p>THoſe ſorts of Trees which will grow of Cuttings, are the eaſieſt
to raiſe by Layings, ſome of which ſorts you may ſee in the next
Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54356:14"/>
Now touching the beſt time for laying your Layers of Trees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obſerve,
that if they be Trees that hold their Leaf all Winter, as Firres, Pines,
Holly, Yew, Box, Bayes, Lawrels, Elix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let ſuch be laid about the
latter end of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if they be ſuch as ſhed their Leaf in Winter, as Oak, Elm, Line,
Sycamore, Apple, Pear, Mulberry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let ſuch be laid about the middle
of <hi>October.</hi> I do grant that you may lay at any time of the Year, but
theſe times I take to be the beſt; for then they have the whole VVinter
and Summer to prepare and draw Root in, at that time of the year the
Sun having ſo much power on the ſap of the Tree, as to feed the Leaf
and Bud, but not to make a ſhoot: and if that little ſap that riſes, be
hindred, as it is by ſome of the following wayes of laying, the Leaves
and Buds yet gently craving of the Layer, makes the Layer prepare for
Root, or put forth root a little to maintain it ſelf, being it finds it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have it from the Mother-plant: and being it wants but little Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
at that time of the Year, I think it is better to lay Layers of
Trees, and to ſet Cuttings, than at other times: In Summer when the
ſap is much abounding, or in VVinter when the ſap ſtirres little, or in the
Spring when the ſap begins to riſe; for then it comes too ſuddenly to
draw ſap from the Layer before it hath drawn or prepared for root: for
Nature muſt be courted gently; though I know in ſmall Plants, the
Spring or Summer doth very well, for they being ſhort-lived, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the quicker in drawing root: and beſides that, Trees are many times
laid, as they are not.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe Trees that are apt to grow of Cuttings, take but ſome of
the boughs, and lay them into the Ground, covering them about half a
foot with freſh fine Mould, leaving them with the end of your Layer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one foot, or a foot and a half out of the ground, keeping them moiſt
in Summer; and in Twelve Months time you may remove them if root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if not, let them lie longer.</p>
            <p>Another way is, take a Bough you intend to lay, and cut it half way
through right croſs the wood, then ſlit it up towards the end, half a
foot, or according as your Layer is in bigneſs, lay the ſlitted place into
the ground, and you ſhall find that ſlitted place take root, if laid as the
former, and ſo ordered. This way you may encreaſe many fine Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and ſmall Plants, but they being out of my Element at this time,
I ſhall not ſpeak of the ordering them, for fear I ſeem tedious to
ſome.</p>
            <p>Another way to lay a Layer of a Tree, is, take a piece of VVyer,
and tie it hard round the bark of the place you intend to lay into the
ground, twiſting the ends of the VVier that it may not untie: prick the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54356:14"/>
place above the VVier thorough the bark with an Aul in ſeveral places,
then lay it into the ground as the firſt.</p>
            <p>A fourth way of Laying of trees, is, Cut a place round, about one
Inch or two, where you find it moſt convenient to lay into the ground,
and ſo proceed as is ſhewed in the firſt way of Laying.</p>
            <p>A Fifth way to lay ſome ſorts of Trees, is, to twiſt the place you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to lay into the ground as you do a withe, and lay it as is ſhewed in
the firſt way of Laying; by this way and the firſt, you may furniſh your
Woods and Hedges: For they being eaſie, any ordinary man will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the ſame. Thus you may from one Stub, as a Sallow, or the like,
between one Fall and another of your VVood, for a Rod ſquare of
Ground and more, (if that one Stub produce but ſtrong ſhoots) fill it
well with Wood: For when the Stub hath got two or three years ſhoot,
then lay round it, as before at large is ſhewed, there letting them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to produce new Stubs.</p>
            <p>But if you would increaſe by laying ſome young Trees from an high
Standard, whence you cannot bend the boughs down to the ground, then
you muſt prepare either Box, Basket, or Pot, and fill them full of fine
ſifted Mould, putting a little rotten VVillow-duſt with this Earth, for
that keeps Moyſture to help the Layer to draw root; then ſet the Pot
or Box thus fill'd with Earth, upon ſome Treſſel or Poſt, as your Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
will direct you, then lay your Bough by the ſecond, third, or fourth
way of Laying, leaving not too much head out, becauſe the wind will
offend it if you doe; and by its own motion be likely to rub off the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
young Root; and thus lay your Hops this way. Theſe things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
you may raiſe many choyſe Trees, as Mulberry, Horſ-Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Rules may inſtruct you ſufficiently concerning the propagation
of Trees by Laying; but let me tell you, it is hard to raiſe a fine ſtraight
Tree by a Layer, or Cutting: I have hinted at the Reaſons before.</p>
            <p>Note, the ſmaller your Boughs be, Set them the leſs out of the ground,
and keep them clean from VVeeds, that they ſpoyl not your Layers.</p>
            <p>Alſonote, that the harder the VVood is, then the young VVood will
take root beſt, laid in the ground; but if a ſoft VVood, then older boughs
will take Root beſt: Now you that be Lovers of wood, make uſe of theſe
ſure Directions, and if you repent, then blame me.</p>

            <p>IF your Ground be moiſt you may Set with ſucceſs any ſort of Willow,
Sallow, or Oſier, Alder, Water-Poplers, any ſort of Apple that hath
a black burry Knot breaking out of the Boughs; that Knot, if ſet a Foot
deep in good Ground, and the top a Foot out, is apt to grow: Some ſorts
of Wildings, Codlings, Gennitings, ſome Sweetings, the ſmiling Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
Quinces, Tamarisk, Lawrel, Firr, Box, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time that I have ſpoke on for Laying your Layers, is alſo the very
beſt time for Setting of Cuttings, which you may ſee in the fore-going
Chapter, to be in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> for thoſe ſorts of Trees that hold their Leaves;
and <hi>October</hi> for thoſe Trees that caſt their Leaves in Winter.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ſorts of Trees that do grow of Cuttings are common, therefore
you may take your choice the better for the bigneſs of your Cuttings;
which I Adviſe you to let be from half an Inch to one Inch Diameter: If
they be leſs than half an Inch Diameter, then they will be weak, with a
great Pith, which Pith will take wet, and be likely to Kill your Cutting:
And beſides, when your Cuttings be ſo ſmall, they be not prepared with
thoſe pores, (as at preſent I name them) that is, little black ſpecks on the
Bark where the Root breaks out, I ſuppoſe, if Set in the Ground; or
elſe Almighty God, for a Sign to ſhew Man that thoſe that have that Mark
upon them, will grow as your Elder, Alder, Sallow, Water-Poplers <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
hath; and alſo if they be Young, they then have not that burry Knot,
which is very apt to take Root, as your Codlings, and ſome ſorts of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
have; in hard Wood, the Younger the better: But if they be greater
than one Inch Diameter, then the top of your Cutting will be long in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
over, therefore may ſomewhat decay your Cutting by the wet ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Head ſo much.</p>
            <p>But you may Set your Willow and Water-Popler of a greater ſize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they be Set for Pollard, where Cattle come, therefore they muſt
be great and high, to be out of their harming the ſooner; but the other
ſize is moſt proper for your Hedges and VVoods.</p>
            <p>If you ſet them by a Crow of Iron, or by an Inſtrument which they have
about <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that bores a hole in the Earth, ſomewhat like to an
Auger; Let the Foot be free from cracks, cut ſmooth at bottom, and the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54356:15"/>
top of your Cutting the like, but let your top be ſlanted off; take care
you do not rub up the Bark when you ſet your Cuttings; therefore make
your holes large when you ſet them, and ram or tread the Earth cloſe to
them, keeping them moiſt the firſt Summer; and let the ſlant cut off the
Head hang downward, and if your Cutting be choiſe, put a little ſoft
VVax on the Head and Foot to keep out Air and VVet.</p>
            <p>VVhen you ſet any Tree or Trees in your VVoods or Hedges, be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

to do it, but well ſpent, as I have often proved.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of ſuch ſorts of Trees as may be Raiſed by the Roots of another
Tree; and how to Raiſe them.</head>
            <p>AS for ſuch ſorts of Trees which may be Raiſed onely from part of a
Root of another Tree, there be many; but of thoſe that I have
made Experience, I ſhall in this place give an Account.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let the Tree be a thriving Tree, but not too Young, nor an Old
Tree: For if it be too Young, then the Roots will be too ſmall for this
purpoſe; if too Old, 'tis poſſible the Roots may be a decaying, and then
not fit for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Let the Roots be from a quarter of an Inch, to an Inch and a half Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
and from ſome Young thriving Tree is the beſt, for in them the Sap
is plentiful, and therefore will put forth the greater ſhoot: then in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of <hi>February,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> digg round the Trees
you intend to increaſe from, till you find ſuch Roots as before are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and taking your Knife, cut them three or four Inches from the great
Root, ſmooth at the place you cut off; then Raiſe up that end, putting
in the Earth to keep it up, that when your Ground is levelled again, the
end of this Root ſo cut off, may be two or three Inches above Ground.</p>
            <p>I do Judge the fore-ſaid time of the Year to be the beſt, for then the Sun
haſtning to the Vernal Equinoctial, or rather this Star of the Earth, to <hi>Libra,</hi>
the Sun having heat, and a ſtronger drawing faculty on the Head of the
Tree, draweth by its ſecret influence on the ſeveral Branches on the
Head, and the Head from the Body, and both Head and Body from the
Roots; and the Roots being furniſhed with Sap from the Earth, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Body and the Head, is then the fitter to produce with that Sap a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54356:16"/>
new Tree, likelier than when 'tis in its full Sap, <hi>viz.</hi> in Summer; for then
the abundance of Sap will rather choak a Bud, than produce one out of the
Root, if the Root be of ſuch ſort as will produce Trees from part of the
Roots; and then the Weather is ſo hot, that it ſuffocates a new Bud that
will be ſo full of Sap, as that will be, if any: and as to the opening of
the Roots at that Seaſon, how unnatural 'tis to the roots of the Mother-Tree,
you may eaſily Judge.</p>
            <p>And then, to do this in Winter, though there is a continual Motion and
Aſcending of the Sap from the Roots (unleſs Accidentally hindred by
Froſts) all the Year long (for Nature is no Sluggard) yet to cut the
Roots then, and to expoſe them thus cut, as afore-ſaid, to the extremity
of the Weather, which then uſually is great, the Froſt and VVet pierce
that new wound ſo much, that 'tis more likelier to Ruine, than to Increaſe
its Kind; but if it doth Live, the Spring is the time when it will Bud;
therefore by Conſequence the beſt. My Reaſon for cutting the Root two
or three Inches off from the great Root is (then) that two or three Inches
of the Root will put forth many Roots at the end, eſpecially if ſmooth
cut off, and ſo the better for the Tree from whence you take the Roots.
Thus much for the manner of Raiſing by part of Roots; the Kinds which
may be thus Raiſed, are theſe that follow, <hi>viz.</hi> Elm, Maple, Poplar,
Aſpen, Abete, Cherry, Crab-tree, Plumb, VVhite buſh, Serves,

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54356:16"/>
them ſo much to a Yearly decay, that the Seeds of them will
lay hold of the firſt Opportunity, and put forward for their Journey, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Spring, Summer, Autumn, or Winter; according as they meet with
Proviſion for their Progreſs, till they have Accompliſhed that which was
done for them, <hi>viz.</hi> produced Seeds.</p>
            <p>When your Forreſt-Tree knoweth its continuance to be long, and that
Naturally it hath many Years to produce its like, it will not be much forced
by Art or Artificial means; for who can by the beſt Art or Care that can
be uſed, force the Keys of an Aſh to come up in a Year, or to grow but
one Inch? For it will lie a Year or more before before it will begin to
ſhoot; when as ſeveral ſorts of Annuals will at any time of the Year come
up in three or four days, if their Entertainment be accordingly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neither your Forreſt-trees not their Seeds require much Dung, but
love a ground Trenched deep with ſome Addition of freſh Earth, ſuch as
they delight in; as if your Ground be a ſtrong Clay, then trench it deep,
and mix it with fat Sand, Rubbiſh of Buildings, Sea-coal-aſhes, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-Earth
that hath drift Sand in it, or ſmall Gravel-Lime, or Lime-Rubbiſh,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if your Ground be a Gravel or Sand, then trench it and mix it with
Loom-clay, the turf and upper part of each is very good, digging the
Ground deep, and mixing it well: But if it be for an Orchard, you may
add to any ſort of Ground; ſome rotten dung of Horſe or Cow, &amp;c. will
do very well, ſo it be not where your Root is; but ſet the Roots of any
ſort of Trees in freſh fine Mould.</p>
            <p>In ſtiff Ground it is good to trench it with Straw, Thatch, Litter,
VVoodſtack-Earth, or ſmall wood, but let not your Roots ſtand upon
theſe by no means, nor upon no dung or turf, but let them be at leaſt one
Inch or two from every Root; and then in a Year or two, when the Roots
of your Tree comes to this Dung, or Soyl, the Ground will then have
made it rotten and fit to lead your Root along in the Veins as it lieth for
them, to find their Nouriſhment the better.</p>
            <p>Note, that thoſe Trees whoſe Roots run ſhallow, do moſt delight
in light Ground, as on a Gravel your Beech, Cherry, Aſh; if mixed with
Loom, the Elm or any; on a Brick Earth the Oak, Elm, Pear, &amp;c. But
for theſe I ſhall refer you to each particular Chapter of their Kinds.</p>
            <p>Of all ſorts of Ground for Trees, or moſt ſorts of Plants, I take your
Clays to be the worſt: that is, your ſtrong blue, ſtrong white, or ſtrong
red; but if any of theſe have ſome ſtones Naturally in them, they make
them the better; and the nearer they turn to a mixture of Loom, they be
ſo much the better: So likewiſe Gravelly or Sandy Ground, the nearer a
Loom the better; for a Loom, that is, a light Brick-Earth, is the moſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54356:17"/>
Natural Ground for Gardens or Plantations that is.</p>
            <p>Your ſtrong Grounds are worſe for Trees than your light, eſpecially
for their Seeds; for they be more ſubject to great Weeds, as Couch-graſs,
Thiſtles, Nettles, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When your Gravelly Ground hath in moſt places a ſhort Graſs, or
Mother of Thyme, or Moſs, commonly the greateſt Plant is Fern, which
is very Natural to Seeds of Trees, and to the Roots of Trees: You may
often ſee ſeveral Young Trees come up in Fern, which Naturally grows
on your light Ground, therefore is moſt Natural for the increaſe of wood:
But your ſtrong Ground doth moſt commonly produce the greateſt Oak,
and your Gravelly or ſhallow Ground the fineſt Grain; that is, when Trees
are on ſuch Ground as they do Naturally Love to grow on, they then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the greateſt Grain, for then are their Annual Circles the greater;
therefore ſuch Trees are your ſtrongeſt and tougheſt Timber. But when
a Tree grows on a Ground it Naturally doth not like, then the Annual
Circles being ſmall, the Grain of ſuch a Tree muſt by conſequence be
finer, and the Wood not ſo tough; ſo that theſe ſtately Trees do not
love ſuch great variety as your Annuals: For if they be in a Ground which
they do not very well like, if you give them but room by deep and often
digging, they will then ſearch the further from home, and provide ſuch
Nouriſhment as will make them thrive, and be ſtately.</p>
            <p>When as your Annual Plants, and others that be not very long Lived,
they will deſire better, and more variety of Dung than your Forreſt-trees.
I have often admired what ſhould be the Reaſon that ſome Plants will not
come to their perfection, unleſs they ſtand on Dung, or that which will
give a great heat; which would kill the Seeds of ſeveral others, did they
but ſtand there one day: But as for the Reaſon of the heat that ſuch Plants
deſire, it is becauſe they were made for hot Countries, and therefore if
we would have them to come to Maturity in our cold one, we muſt give
them warm Lodging, eſpecially in the Spring, which is too cold with us
for them: but what is it then that Plant does feed on?</p>
            <p>But then to conſider well this, why the heat of Graſs or green Weeds
ſhould bring them forward as well as dung of Horſes, provided you can
keep it but as temperate (for 'tis ſubject to be too hot) and as long laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for it will not keep its heat long: where is then the ſalt, Sulphur and
Mercury or Spirit in the Dung more than in the Graſs to feed theſe Plants?
Alſo I have Obſerved, that if you take Rich Mould, half or more of it
rotten dung, and cover one end of your Bed with; the other end cover
the ſame thickneſs with poor hungry Mould, provided you make it fine
and fit for the Roots to run in, this laſt ſhall do as well, and many times
better for any ſeeds on a hot bed, than the Rich Mould: Where is then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54356:17"/>
the ſalt Sulphur, or Mercury in the rich Mold, more than in the hungry,
as moſt do hold, that the richer the mould, the more of them, and
that all Plants draw their Nouriſhment from theſe matters; when I
know that the ſeeds (moſt we ſow on hot beds) could well digeſt that
matter in the rich Mould, if it were there more than in the pore, and
come on much forwarder in theſe Molds, each, if not on a hot-bed: the
rich Mould would bring on Plants much ſtronger than the poor, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the ſeeds be of ſuch Plants that are quick of digeſtion.</p>
            <p>Pidgeons dung ſown thin upon cold Land, and early in the Spring, is
very good for Barley: But if ſown late, and on dry hot ground, it will
then do more harm than good, for it will burn up your ſeeds or plants:
this dung is too hot and quick for the ſeeds of Trees; for 'tis the nature
of Pidgeons to eat Salt, and to go to the ſea-ſide early in the Mornings,
and there to pick up Salt, which the heat of the Sun makes by drying
up the ſalt water, and then leaving the ſalt upon the ſand. Now this
Fowl feeding ſo much upon ſalt, the dung of it is hotter and ſalter than
any Fowl I know: Now the Reaſons why it is good for cold Lands,
and withall to ſow it Early, are theſe: Every one knowes that 'tis the
Nature of ſalt, that the dryer and hotter 'tis kept, the more it keeps its
own Body, and doth not turn to water: And when it ſtands in a cold
and moyſt place, it then diſſolves in a little time to water; and when
'tis turned into this Element of VVater, then is it fit for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and feeding of ſeeds, eſpecially Annuals: For they be alwayes
prepared to ſet forward in their Journey, provided they meet but
with ſuitable Entertainment. But the ſeeds of moſt Forreſt-trees,
they will ſtay the time that their and our great God hath allotted
them.</p>
            <p>But then why Salt ſhould be a feeder of Plants or Seeds, I take the
Reaſon to be this, namely, Salt-water; (yet I do not mean of Salt in a
great quantity, and in meet places that will turn it into water.) I have
oft obſerved, that Salt if fallen upon a Board or other place, it will be
long a drying; and if Heat have made it drye, then Dews or Rain make
it moyſt again, then it ſteams forth, and that it is which nouriſheth all
Plants: VVhen if on a hot and dry ground, and late in the Spring, if
dry weather come, then it doth not nor cannot yield its ſteam or fume,
as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his Philoſophy to the <hi>Athenians, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 57. ſaith:
Every Body or tangible ſubſtance is nothing but a curdled fume; whence
(ſaith he) we may conclude, that there is a manifold Coagulation, one
of VVood, another of Stones, a third of Mettals, but the Body is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Fume, ſmoaking out of the Matter or Matrix in which it is.
So that which groweth out of the Earth, is a fume, riſing out of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54356:18"/>
Moyſture of Mercury, which is various, and ſendeth forth ſeveral fumes
for Hearbs, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do remember when I was a Boy, about fourteen years of Age, the
Sea brake a bank into a Marſh of my Fathers, in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> and
did over-flow that Marſh and ſome others with ſalt Sea-water; the
next Summer proving dry, all our Graſs was clearly burnt up, ſo that
I was very much concerned for ſome particular Reaſons, thinking that
all our Graſs had been quite killed, and indeed ſo it appeared: The
next Summer proved wet, ſo that towards the latter end we had ſome
Graſs again, and the third Summer we had Graſs enough, but the fourth
and many after in abundance. So that it appears, the ground was ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with too much Kindneſs at firſt, but after the Rain had allayed the
too much ſtrength of the Salt water, then the Graſs could well digeſt
the gentle Fume: I would have thoſe that lay Salt on their Gravel-walks
to kill their weeds, obſerve if in a few years more they do not
produce more weeds than ſome other that had not Salt laid on them
at all.</p>
            <p>Sea-ſand is a very good Compoſt for Ground, eſpecially for ſtiffe
Ground, for there it doth the too main parts to plants, or any ſeed or
tree; that is, it makes way for the tree or ſeed to root in ſtiffe ground,
and makes a Fume to feed it: but this is too nimble for the ſeeds of trees,
(unleſs a very little) obſerve the Reaſons before.</p>
            <p>Mault-duſt is a moſt excellent Compoſt in a ſmall quantity, for many
ſorts of Annual ſeeds, as I have oft tried with good ſucceſs; but the
Reaſons are ſtill the ſame: for this being a ſmall part of the roots of the
Barley, and being very dry, drinks in the Element of water, which is the
principal and firſt matter of all things, (as a learned Author hath it, in
the <hi>Genealogy of Minerals, p.</hi> 44) So wonderfully hath God created
VVater, the firſt Matter of Nature, which though it be ſo tender and
feeble a ſubſtance, yet from thence is created the moſt ſolid and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Fruit: that is, from the fume of an Oyly, Earthy water, is the
Life of all Plants. The parts of the duſt being thus filled, upon the Suns
attracting that and the Plant, the Root embraces this Fume: This little
root, it having not life to grow, turns to Earth, and its Grave is a
room to lead the root of another Plant in: it will give good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to its own Kind.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, the Deſtruction of one is the increaſe of another: A
little of this is good for ſome ſeed of Forreſt-trees; but ſow it not too
thick, for any thing, leſt it mold, or turn Muſty.</p>
            <p>Note, that the place which is beſt for the root to be in, when the
Tree or Plant is growing, is, the place that bringeth it ſooneſt to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54356:18"/>
when dead, and contrary: for a Tree cannot live in water,
or alwayes dry, and thoſe preſerve the Timber longeſt when the Tree
is dead. This may be further improved by ingenuity.</p>
            <p>Note alſo, that the place which is beſt to keep the Fruit of a
Tree in, is the very worſt for a Tree or Plant to grow in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Old Rags of Woollen Cloth, as is found by Experience by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
Farmer, cut into ſmall pieces, are a good Compoſt for their
Ground: they draw the Dew and Rain to them, and keep it till Sol's
preſence makes it fit for the Roots of the Plant: I judge them to be beſt
for a pure dry ſoyl, becauſe they hold their Moyſture long, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
'tis a ſoyl that is laſting; for Wooll will not rot with wet ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.
A little of this for the Trees or Seed on a dry Ground, will do
good to them, as appears by the aforeſaid Reaſons: For Annuals
better.</p>
            <p>Conny-clippings are of the ſame nature (but I do ſuppoſe they will
not laſt ſo long) and are better for a ſtiffe ground.</p>
            <p>Saw-duſt, if well rotten, and of ſoft woods, is very gratefull to the
tender Roots or Seeds of any ſort; 'tis good for dry ground, for it holds
water, and makes way for the Roots of Trees very well, and is as good
as moſt Preparers are.</p>
            <p>Rotten-duſt out of hollow Trees, eſpecially thoſe of ſoft wood, is a
rich Leader of tender young Roots: the Reaſon is ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>Soot is good to kill Moſs, for its heat kills the Roots, for they lye on
the top of the Earth: and good alſo to keep worms from doing harm to
your Seeds.</p>
            <p>Sea-coal Aſhes are very good in cold ſtiffe ground, either for Trees,
or any other Plant, to make that ground work well, and to keep it
hollow for the Roots to run in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rubbiſh of Buildings, that is, broken Bricks, and Stones and Lime
is very good for the Roots of Trees in a ſtiffe cold Ground, the Reaſon
is told you.</p>
            <p>Chalk broken ſmall into pieces, is a very good Compoſt for ſtiffe
cold grounds. There is much difference in Chalk, but that which is
ſoft, fat Chalk, is good for ſuch Ground as aforeſaid, and for ground
that is not very ſtiffe. Let your Reaſon inſtruct you further.</p>
            <p>Lime is a very rare Compoſt for cold Grounds, and ſtiffe Clayes,
for its heat cauſeth a fume, and its tenderneſs makes way for the Roots,
to fetch home their Nouriſhment, and its heat is great at firſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lay not on too much on no ground; and let that be ſlacked. If your
dry ground be it your Tree delight to grow in, and you are forced
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54356:19"/>
to ſet them on wet, then adde ſome of this Lime among your Earth.</p>
            <p>Clay, eſpecially that ſort which is a light Brick-Earth, is very good
for ſuch Land that is a light ſhovey Gravel, or hath too much ſand in
it: Such grounds as theſe, they do not retain the ſpirit of Plants: for
when Nature hath by the two Lovers, Star-Fire and VVater, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
their Babe, ſuch ground as this doth drink down too faſt, and
again doth drye too haſtily; ſo that the water cannot have time to
leave nor to prepare its ſlime; which is the Mercury that makes that
fume which feeds all Plants and their ſeeds: But this Clay muſt not
be digged too deep, for then it wanteth of that which feedeth Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have taken the green Slime that is common in ſtanding waters, (I
do not mean the Frogs Spawn, which is caſt many times into this) and
have dryed it and beat it into fine duſt, and then have mixed it with
good freſh Earth, and have found very good ſucceſs in raiſing ſeveral
ſorts of Flower-ſeeds and others: Though I have Notes of them, yet
it is out of my Road to ſpeak of them now, being I am Writing of
the ſtately Forreſt-trees. However, I may (its poſſible) write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of them, if the Lord permits, and according as I find theſe few
Lines Accepted of by ſome of the Royal Oaks of this our Age.</p>
            <p>For I do ſuppoſe that there is not one thing in Gardening yet well
known: For (as a Learned Author hath it,) <hi>he that knows a thing well,
muſt know what it was, is, and ſhall be;</hi> Therefore all humane Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is but a ſhadow of ſuperficial Learning reflecting upon mans Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
but not the leaſt thing comprehended ſubſtantially.</p>
            <p>But to the buſineſs in hand, take Clay or Loom, and lay it on your
Ground, not too thick, the beginning of Winter, and there let it be
till the Froſt hath made it fall into Mould, then in ſome dry open time
harrow it all over: and if it be Ground you plow, then plow it in
a drye time, but if it be Ground you trench for Forreſt or Fruit-trees,
obſerve to order it ſo: for by thus doing the Clay will mix with
the Sand or Gravel much the better: The better that any man chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Meat, it is certainly the eaſier to digeſt; and the dryer you
put it into your ground (provided it hath but time to water it ſelf well
before your trees be ſet) 'tis the better; for then it draws the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and ſtores it up till the Roots have occaſion for it: for 'tis quickly
exhaled out of ſand: but the Clay holds his ſtore till a time of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and then contributes to the Roots, that is, in drye weather:
and the ſmaller you make it to mix with your ground, the likelier the
ſmall Roots (as well as the great) are to meet with it.</p>
            <p>Note further, that the ſmaller your Plants be, the finer muſt your
Earth be made, by skreening, fifting, beating, turning, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54356:19"/>
I know by good ſucceſs this to be true: for the Right Honourable
my Lord (and the more to be honoured becauſe a great Planter, and
as great a Lover thereof) gave me order to make three Walks of
Line-trees, from the New Garden to the New Bowling-green, and
withall to make them deſcend towards the Houſe, as neer as we could;
which to doe, I was forced to cut through one Hill thirty Rod, moſt
of the Hill two foot-deep, into a ſharp Gravel, and the greateſt part
of all the length of the Walks was the ſame; they being Trees that I
raiſed of Seeds, moſt of them, and the reſt of Layers, at <hi>Hadham-Hail,</hi>
they being with my Lord ever ſince their Minority, and he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times their Barber, engaged him to have the more particular Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for them, therefore he ordered me to doe what I thought good in
preparing the ground for them: which I did as followeth.</p>
            <p>Firſt I levelled the Hill, and when I had brought the Ground neer
to the Level concluded on, I ſtaked out my ground where every Tree
ſhould ſtand, and then ordered my holes to be made for my Trees,
each hole three foot-deep, and four foot-wide, being the ground was
ſo bad: This I did neer a Year before I ſet my Trees, and having the
convenience of Brick-Earth near, I got near a Load to every hole, and
mixed this with the Earth digged out of the Holes, turning it over
twice, and in dry weather throwing out the greateſt Stones, but the
Turf I did throw into each Hole (the graſs-ſide downward) as ſoon as
they were made; but the Hill of Gravel I trenched that with Loom,
Cow-dung, and the Litter under the Cow-racks, two Spade deep, and
five foot on each ſide every row of Trees.</p>
            <p>Thus having prepared my ground, and the ſeaſon of the year come,
about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> 1672. I had the Trees taken up
with good help, as carefully as I could, and carried to <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> the
place of their now Abode; and then having good ſtore of help, and
good Mould prepared, of the ſmalleſt and fineſt, I ſet the Trees with
the upper part of the Roots of each Tree level with the top of the
Ground, making a round hill half a foot high about every tree, and the
Compaſs of the Hole.</p>
            <p>Having prun'd the heads of each Tree, and cut off the bruiſed Roots,
and the Ends of ſuch roots as were broken, I ſorted the Trees, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
this Method in placing them, namely; I ſet the higheſt next the
Bowling-green, and ſo ſhorter and ſhorter till the loweſt were next to
the Garden; which I did for theſe Reaſons: Next the Green was the
worſt Ground, and the Trees more in danger of being ſpoyled, by
reaſon of a Market-path that goeth croſs that end of the VValks to
<hi>Watford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:54356:20"/>
Thus having ſet my Trees ſtreight in their Rows, and trod the
Earth cloſe to their Roots, and made my Hills, I then laid round every
Tree, upon thoſe Hills, wet Litter taken off from the Dung-hill, a good
Barrow-full to every Tree, and covered that with a little Mould, leaving
them to take their reſt for a time; but early in the Spring I found them
to begin their Progreſs, and that Summer they had ſuch Heads ſhot
forth, that I was forced to cut off ſome of their Heads (that is, the ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boughs)
to keep the Wind from breaking them: There is in theſe four
rows of Trees 296. and of theſe I loſt not one Tree the firſt Year, but
they did grow and ſhoot ſo well, that there were ſeveral Noble Men
that ſaw them, did think, as they ſaid, that they were not removed the
Year before; but the year after we had three ſpoyled by ſome baſe
Men or Boys.</p>
            <p>Of the very ſame parcel of Trees my Lord gave Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>
thirty of the beſt of them, which he himſelf ſaw choſen out; they were
Set at Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Sheen,</hi> a much better Natur'd Ground
than ours, yet they loſt all but ſix of them the firſt Year: I ſaw a
walk of Line-trees (but I think they were the Baſtard-kind, which
we have growing in many of our Woods in <hi>England)</hi> ſet at <hi>Debden-hall,</hi>
the Right Worſhipful Sir <hi>Richard Brown</hi>'s Houſe; the Natural ground
was not bad for them, but how they were Ordered I do not know, for
they had the firſt year not above one in ten that did grow any thing
conſiderably.</p>
            <p>I ſaw the like (or worſe) ſpoyl of the ſame Trees at my Lord
Chief Baron <hi>Turnor</hi>'s near <hi>Startford,</hi> where the ground might eaſily
have been made very good for them. I onely write this, to perſwade
Noble Men, and others that are Lovers of Planting, to remember the
old ſaying, <hi>viz. A thing once well done, is twice done:</hi> And thoſe
that are reſolved to Plant, that they make their Ground fit for thoſe
Trees before they ſet them, and not bury them in a hole like a dead dog,
as too too many do. Let me then beg that they may have good and
freſh Lodgings ſutable to their Quality, and good attendance alſo,
to preſerve them from their Enemies, till they be able to encounter
with them; they that will not do this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let them never reſolve to Plant
Trees; for why ſhould they ſpoil the leaſt of thoſe ſtately Monuments,
and in ſo doing throw away their Monies? For let ſuch note that Nature
beſtows not her gifts but where ſhe finds ſutable Convenience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
order your Ground well, and then you may ſee a good ſucceſs, as
my Lord hath had in ſeveral of his Plantations, though as bad ground
as moſt is to Plant on. One Night (me thoughts) walking up one of

have informed your Judgment ſo much, that you will Reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with me, that the preparing of Ground for Trees is, onely to mix
Ground ſo together, that there may be convenient room for the Roots
to ſearch for their Nouriſhment; and to humour the Tree ſo, that there
may be a good part of the Natural Ground which each Tree delights
to grow in. I know that if your Ground be a ſtiff Clay, then to trench
and mix it with fat Sand, drift-ſand, Lime, Rubbiſh, or Chalk and
Lime, are great helps to ſuch Ground, either for Trees, or Corn, or
Graſs; and more laſting than Dung, and for Forreſt-Trees full as good
as Dung: For it doth not onely give leave, and make way for the roots
to run in the Earth, but takes away that over-moiſtneſs in the cold ſtiff
Ground, which hinders Conception, by letting the water down into the
Earth, and by keeping it from Cracking, and ſo Nouriſheth the Spirit
of the Earth, and alſo keeps it from ſpending it too haſtily.</p>
            <p>Horſe-dung is the beſt to make your hot beds with, for ſuch Plants
as are commonly raiſed of them be Annual Plants, but it is too haſty
for the Seeds of Trees, unleſs it be rotten, and well mixed with Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Mould: It is beſt for your ſtiff cold Lands, and if you lay it upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54356:21"/>
Plowed Ground (which 'tis beſt for) then Plow it in as ſoon as you can,
for if it lies there to dry, there will a great part of the Oily ſubſtance,
which makes the fume for nouriſhment of Plants, be exhaled out by the
Sun: Let no ſort of dung lie long on the top of your Ground unplowed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
but plow or dig it in as ſoon as you can; for by lying ſo, it doth not
onely loſe a great part of its goodneſs by the Sun (eſpecially if it lies
thin) but where your Dung-hill lies every ſhower will waſh the ſtrength
of the dung into the Ground, ſo that if you take the dung off from that
place as clean as you can, yet you ſhall have that place bear Ranker
Corn than where you thought the dung had lain much thicker, if it lies
long in a place. The Obſervation of this taught me many good Uſes;
as firſt, to lay dung about the Roots of Trees is much better than ſtones,
as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> Adviſes in his Natural Hiſtory; for this keeps moiſt
the Ground better than they, and Rain waſhes the ſtrength to the Roots,
as is aforeſaid: and if you dig in this when the ſtrength is gone, and
your Trees ſtrong, it then prepares way for the Roots, and there is a
great benefit to your Trees. Or if it is not digged-in, but lies on the
top, and there turns to Earth, it then feeds the Roots on the top, and
leads them upward.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing where Dung lies, the Ground is ſo much improved by
the waſhing-in of the ſtrength of the Dung, it may well inform you
that Dung ſteeped in Water is very good, eſpecially if you uſe Dung,
in Quantity according to the Nature of your Plants, and ſtrength of
your Ground; the weaker your Ground, make your Water the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
There is in ſome places in Farmers Yards, a Water that waſheth
from their Dung-hills, a Load of which is not inferiour to a Load of
Dung, yet by them totally Neglected; but of Waters I ſhall ſpeak
more in the next Chapter.</p>
            <p>Thus having hinted of theſe two Uſeful and Common Dungs, Cow
and Horſe, in the Example of theſe Line-trees; onely Obſerve this,
and then I ſhall proceed: Horſe-dung is beſt for Plants that are quick
of Digeſtion and Growth, and for Trees or Plants that ſhoot much in a
year; for it yields a great Fume, and ſuch Plants can well diſpoſe of
it.</p>
            <p>Cow-dung is a good Soyl for moſt Trees or Plants of hot Ground,
and better for durable Plants than it is for Annuals: It is Excellent for
many ſorts of rare Flowers, if firſt it be thorow-rotten, and then dryed
and beaten to duſt, and ſome freſh fine Earth then mixed well with
it.</p>
            <p>Deers-dung is much of the Nature of Cows, or Bullocks; but 'tis
more proper for tender and ſmaller Plants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:54356:21"/>
Sheeps-dung is alſo of the ſame Nature, but more agreeable to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and ſmall Seeds and Plants: By this our Yeomen and Farmers find
good profit, by Folding their Sheep every Night on their own Lands;
for there they find a far certain benefit on their Ground by the Dung and
Urine which the Sheep make in one Night; though it is not long laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet 'tis a ſure help for the firſt Crop, and a good Addition to the
ſecond.</p>
            <p>This may teach you that a thin ſprinkling of dung is more ſure moſt
years for your Corn-Land than greater Quantities; and alſo that to
break your dung ſmall is beſt; for the ſmaller the better, eſpecially if
you have laid it on your Ground not long before you ſow, eſpecially
for your Summer-crops, from this I do Adviſe my Ingenuous Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of theſe few Rules which are ſpoken before:</p>
            <p>To well Obſerve the Nature of your Land, and by ſo doing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
it with ſuch Soyl and Dung as is moſt Natural to the Ground, and
to the Seeds you intend to ſow on it; and to lay it on your Ground at
the moſt convenient times.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as to the Ground, I have hinted at many uſeful Compoſts,
and alſo that ſeveral of them are far more proper for ſome Grounds
than they are for others, though there be many more ſorts that may be
and are made uſe of to very good Effect, yet I ſhall not trouble my
ſelf nor you with the naming any more, knowing that he that Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
to Number to 20 in Arithmetick, may ſoon count to a 100.</p>
            <p>Now, as to the Seed you intend to ſow, whether it be of Trees,
Plants, or any ſort of Grain, the ſmaller your Seed is, make the ground
the finer; the quicker your Seeds be of growth, and the more they run
into ſtalks or leaves, your dung may then be the newer and ſtronger,
and the more in Quantity, according to the Digeſtion of your Plants.
But if for Trees or Plants of long laſting, then let the dung be the more
rotten; and the more they be apt to ſhoot great ſhoots, the more you
may allow them; but let them be ſure of ſome ſuch Ground as they
Naturally delight to grow in, and alſo to allow them room that is large
enough; for High and Lofty Spirits do not love to be Confined to little
and ſmall Cottages.</p>
            <p>And as for laying it on your Ground, if the time be the Spring, that
is moſt proper to ſow your Seed, then lay ſuch dung as is hot and dry
early on your Ground; and rather erre in too little than too much, ſuch
dungs as be your Pigeons, Hens, Sea-coal-aſhes, &amp;c. But if they
be hot and moiſt, ſuch as Horſe-dung, Horſe-litter, or Green graſs,
Hay, &amp;c. theſe be moſt proper for Annuals, and it is not good to be
too ſparing toward theſe tender Plants; rather erre in keeping your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54356:22"/>
dung too dry than too wet, for in ſo doing you ſhall keep its heat the
longer, and have the more Command to keep it ſo: But if you have
occaſion to lay dung on Ground to help ſuch Trees or Plants as are not
Annual, but more ſlow in their progreſs, then mix ſuch dung thin, and
not too near the Roots; but if it be the Autumn Seaſon that you have
occaſion to lay it on your Land, then lay it ſomething thicker; for the
Winter will qualifie the ſtrength and heat of it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if you are to lay dung on Land that you are to ſow with
Seed that doth not run much into ſtalks, and is but ſlow in growing, then
do as our Farmers do, let it be rotten and mixed well with Mould before
you lay it on your Land, and then your Grain or Seed will the better
agree with it, or elſe you may find on your Land ſtrong great Weeds,
ſuch as the Ground is moſt inclined to; for ſtrong Land will produce the
ſtronger Weeds, and the other contrary.</p>
            <p>Therefore if your Dung be too rank and new for the Seed you intend
to Sow your Ground with, then mix it with ſome other Compoſt as is
moſt proper for your Land, and moſt convenient to be had: and if your
Land be ſtiff, then mix it with Chalk, Light Sandy Ground, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the like Nature; laying a good quantity of Earth firſt, then
your Dung, and then Earth to cover your Dung all over; by ſo doing
you will ſave that Oyly water which will ſoak from the Dung by ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Rain into the Earth under the dung: and by covering your dung
with Earth it will keep the Sun from drying out that moiſture; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Fumes ariſe, the Earth on the top will receive: be ſure you let it
not grow with Weeds on the top, but when you find them to appear,
take them off, and ſuffer none to grow on your Compoſt; or turn it
over, and mix it with your Earth below, however let it be mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before you lay it on your Land: Thus do with New Horſe-dung
and Litter, but if it be any other dung, lay it on your Land as ſoon as
Opportunity ſerveth; for the longer you let it lie, the more it loſeth
of its ſtrength, therefore lay it on rather too thin, and in dry weather,
and early.</p>
            <q>
               <l>To aſſiſt Nature do thou not neglect;</l>
               <l>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe her not Roughly, leſt there be defect.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus much may ſerve for Trees, but if it be for Flowers, or other
fine and tender Plants, you then muſt be more Curious, and mix your
Earth better; but they be out of my Road at this time. The main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
is to prepare your Ground ſo, that there may be room for the
roots to run in, to fetch their Nouriſhment. As for Trees and Plants
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54356:22"/>
that root deep, trench your Ground accordingly, &amp;c. Now, for to
pleaſe the Tree or Plant with ſuch Earth as it delights to be in, add ſuch
a quantity of dung as may be ſutable to the growth of your Tree or
Plant, thereby to make a fume to feed it; for let this fume be made of
what it will, for-my part, I ſhall not contend whether it be Salt, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
or Mercury; or as ſome affirm, that 'tis Salt, Sulphur, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
and Spirit: All, or any one of theſe that feeds the Plants of this
Terreſtrial Globe; or if it be Fire, Earth, Water, or Air, as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
the Opinion of the Learned; for Sulphur or Brimſtone may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to Fire, Salt to the Earth, Mercury to Water, Spirit to Air.</p>
            <p>For 'tis certain, that Plants have Salt, Sulphur, Mercury, and Spirit
in them; ſome more than others, according to their Heat or Coldneſs,
but that they feed on theſe is not certain to me: But it is as I conceive
the Fume, Steam, or more properly the Spirit of the Earth that they
feed on; for the Earth is full of Spirit, which is the cauſe of the vaſt
many productions of Plants, and Inſects which are produced every
year, and from no ſeed or ſperm, but according to the fit Matrix of
the Earth; and the Star-fire, and Virgin Mercury: their Dame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is then buſie to make ſome Plant or Inſect according as ſhe hath
provided a Breaſt to ſuckle and feed them.</p>
            <p>The Earth is then but onely a Lodging-place, and ſimple Water is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
its Garment; for ſimple crude Water feeds nothing, but is rather De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive,
as is ſeen by Water that runs forth on a Gravel, and the
ſtream quick, there is feldome good Meadows by ſuch Rivers, unleſs
there be ſome Town that waſheth it ſelf into the River, or good Rich
Land, or Lanes, or the like. Your Spring-water, unleſs it have ſome
aſſiſtance, is the like; but of Water, ſee more in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall give you an Example of Earth, by which you may
well perceive that Plants do not feed on ſimple Earth, nor crude Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
My Lord was the Author that told me this, and as ſoon as the
Seaſon of the year did permit me, I then did try the Experiment, which
was thus performed. I took out of a Hill of good Rich freſh Earth
(which I had prepared for other things) ſome of the dryeſt, ſomewhat
above a good large Flower-pot full; this I carried into a little Room,
which I had at <hi>Hadham-Hall,</hi> it joyned upon the Bake-houſe; there
I ſpread this Earth thin upon the ſhelves, now and then turning it till it
was as dry as duſt, and as I thought, as dry as it well could be, provided
it were not burned: having thus prepared my Earth, I filled a Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot
with it, which pot and Earth thus filled, weighed as exactly as
I could weigh it juſt eighteen pounds and a half.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54356:23"/>
               <hi>March</hi> approaching, in the year 1666, I put this pot into a hot bed,
to ſecure the ſeeds, and withall to help forward my deſign to preſerve
them: the ſeeds were Purſlain which I ſowed in it, the quantity was
very ſmall: I kept this pot in hot Beds till the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and
then I ſet it under a South Wall, where it ſtood till that Moneth was
out, and then I ſet it in the ſhade from the Meridian Sun: there it ſtood
till the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and then finding my Plants full of ſeed and
at a ſtand, I then cut up the Purſlain cloſe to the ground, at Noon-time,
when it was very dry, and weighed the Purſlain as exactly as I could,
and it weighed juſt ſix pound two ounces. Then I took the pot of Earth
and ſet it in a South Window in a Banqueting Houſe to dry, turning the
Earth to the Sun, to dry out ſome of the moiſture, for the Earth was
wet, for I had kept this pot with watering all the Summer, as occaſion
ſerved: then I took this pot of Earth, and carried it into the little
Room to dry the Earth as I did before, and putting ſome of the Earth
into a Box, and the reſt in the pot, I made it as dry as it well could be,
or at leaſt as dry as it was when I ſowed my ſeeds in it: and then putting
all my Earth into the pot again, I weighed it as exactly as I had done
before, and then the pot and the Earth weighted juſt eighteen pound and
ſeven ounces; there was, I confeſs, the roots of the Purſlain, but when
they were dryed, I do believe they did not weigh one ounce; and this
one ounce that it loſt of weight might be Earth daſhed over with
Rains.</p>
            <p>Now, theſe Plants weighing ſo much, and the Earth waſted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
in its weight ſo little, doth plainly ſhew that Plants do not feed
onely on Earth; for I do believe this, that the earth that was waſted,
was daſhed out of the pot by haſty watering, and by ſudden ſhowers of
Rain, or perchance ſome might go out of the holes of the pot with the
Water.</p>
            <p>Now, though Plants do not feed on earth, yet Earth is the Nurſe
and receptacle of moſt things, and the Earth is ſpongy and porous, fit
to receive the ſeveral Influences of the Heavens, of Heat, Rains, and
Dews; and ſtores them up for the Conſervation of her products: and
when the ſeed or plant deſire it, is put into Motion by the Coeleſtial
heat the earth freely gives out of her ſtore, according as the Plant can
diſpoſe of it.</p>
            <p>And if there be no Plants to feed on this Spirit of the Earth, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times Nature makes ſome which do; for the earth will produce ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Plants of its ſelf, without ſeed or root, but they be Plants of no
long laſting, and when they die, they then turn to Air and Spirit, as all
things do; for there is nothing that is at a certain ſtay, for all things
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54356:23"/>
have their time of increaſing, and their time of decaying, till they be
turned to that of which they were made.</p>
            <p>No man can ſee Trees grow, yet all men know that they doe: It is
plain to ſee when a Trees is decaying, yet to know how long it will be
before it is of its own decaying turned to Earth or Duſt, is hard to
know: Though it is Reported, that an Oak is a hundred years a growing,
a hundred years ſtands at a ſtay, and a hundred years decaying, yet
this is very erroneous; for on ſhallow Grounds an Oak will not grow
ſo long, and on deep ground much longer, and neither it nor any thing
elſe ſtands at a ſtay, but when it doth begin to decay, it keeps on, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it meets with Accidents, till it comes to duſt.</p>

            <p>I Have oft obſerved your Ciſterns and other places, that are onely
filled with Rain-water, that that water will in a Summers time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſeveral ſorts of Inſects, and ſome ſort of Water-plants; and alſo
that it will leave a green ſlime not much unlike to Plants, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
(or ſlime as I tearm it) would certainly be ſpent into Plants,
were there but ſome quantity of Aquatick Plants put into this water;
ſuch as Mints of any ſort, yellow Water-flagge, Flower-de-luce, Crabs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claws,
or water Sen-green, Brook-lime, Ducks-meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I once made an Experiment to trye this, which I have here inſerted,
and thus it was: I took two water-pots, and filled them full of water,
out of a Fountain which had been filled by Snow and Rain the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before, and which was made clean the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> before: I ſet
theſe two pots, thus filled, in the open Air, but in the ſhade, and put
into one of them a good handfull of Mints, the Runners, which I put
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54356:24"/>
in the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> 1664. where I let them continue till the firſt of
<hi>April</hi> next, and then put in a freſh handfull, and let that continue for
one Moneth more, and ſo I did both <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June:</hi> I poured out
this Water about the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> to obſerve which of thoſe
Pots had the moſt of this ſlime: whereupon I found, that pot that had
no Mints put into it, had twice as much, and being forced too to fill up
that pot that had the Mints with the ſame water often, and that pot
that had no Herbs in it, the ſlime of it was green; the other pots ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
that was in it, was black, and of an Earthy colour: I did intend
to have proſecuted this further, as to have filled two pots of freſh
Earth, and not too rich, and to have ſown in them ſeveral Seeds, and
to have kept them from all water but this, and then to have noted well
the ſucceſs, with more like Fancies which I thought on; but I was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
by one of the Drones of this Age, and did not know whether
I ſhould ſtay or not.</p>
            <p>A Stone lying in water gets a kind of ſlime about it; and if you put
into water ſeeds that be quick of growth, (as moſt of your Annuals are)
keep it but temperately hot, and they will in a little time ſpear out,
and then if you put them into fine Mould, temperately moyſt and
warm, you may (if you pull up one of them and obſerve) ſee the
Roots feeding upon a white ſubſtance, which I have often obſerved;
for in water is the ſeed of all things. Likewiſe put ſeed into Earth, and
if it be very dry, then though it be kept never ſo temperately hot, it
will rather keep the ſeeds from growing than haſten them.</p>
            <p>But water diſſolves, then Life followeth the diſſolution; for water
opens the parts of the Seed, and makes them ſwell, then they draw
the Spirit of the water to them, (for the World is full of Spirit) ſo the
Seeds they have been ſo long in water till the body of them cracks,
which is as ſoon as it hath filled it ſelf with enough to make a Root,
then that ſeed if once dryed, and a ſtop put to its proceedings, the Art
of Man cannot make it grow again. I have heard ſome affirm, that
Malt will grow, but 'tis falſe, unleſs they mean ſome Barley-corns which
never ſpeared.</p>
            <p>Therefore if you have once watered Seed, keep them with water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if the Earth require; and if your Earth be poor, and your ſeeds
great growers, then water with rich dunged water, and often, but let
it not touch the Leaves; and if you think your ground be too Rich for
the Nature of your ſeed, then water your ſeed with water not very
Rich; but if your ſeeds be ſlow growers, for ſuch keep your ground
only moyſt, and no more; for, though it be Earth that ſtores up the
Spirit that ſeeds Plants, yet it is water that ſets it on motion, and water
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54356:24"/>
is full of Spirit alſo, but without Heat both theſe lie ſtill: for Heat
draws out firſt the crude water, and ſends it into the Aire: Therefore,
unleſs it be for Aquatick Plants, or Plants that grow much, and the
weather be warm and drying, do not water too much, keep your
Earth juſt moyſt; for when ground is full of water, the Coeleſtial Fire
heats firſt the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the Earth, and puts that into a fume, but
the Roots which are deeper in the ground being covered with water,
there is no fume riſeth there till moſt of the water be drawn up by the
Sun, or ſettled into the Earth: Therefore if your Ground be ſubject
to be wet, keep it looſe and open, by deep trenching, and Earth to
drein away water; for it is oft ſeen, that good Land that lies low in a
wet Spring hath no great burden, becauſe it is over preſſed with wet;
and dunged Land in a wet year bears the worſt Corn, eſpecially if it
be low ſtiffe Land; for Dung then holdeth the Moyſture, and the
ground being wet withall, commonly doth produce great weeds, which
can digeſt the ſpirit of the Earth and Water better than Corn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they grow much quicker, and ſo they ſpoyl the Corn: For the
greateſt good that Dung doth to Land, is, to hold the water in the
ground, and to keep the ground hollow, for the Roots to fetch their
Nouriſhment. For 'tis the nature of Dung to draw water to it, to fill
it ſelf like a Sponge; and when dry weather comes, then it ſpends it
ſelf in fume, and ſo it waſtes it ſelf, and feeds Plants by its decay.
Thus you may ſee and admire the Order of the great God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the Deſtruction of one ſhould be the Preſervation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>This you may obſerve in rotten Wood, Malt-duſt, Wool, woollen
Rags, Horn-ſhavings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how full they will be with every little Dew,
and keep that longer than a Clod of Earth twice as big, thus will they
doe till they be turn'd to a very little Earth: By this you may inform
your ſelf what ſort of Dung will laſt longeſt.</p>
            <p>Some ſorts of Dung there be, that if they be not over-preſſed with
Water, will waſte themſelves by their own heat; Witneſs your Hot-beds,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet notwithſtanding, this heat is very Natural to Annual
Plants.</p>
            <p>Dung ſteeped in Water, or water ſtrained thorow Dung, doth take
a great part of the ſubſtance and ſtrength of the Dung with it, and that
water when dryed up in the ground, and evaporated, when Rain or
Dew falls on that place, it there leaveth ſuch an Oily or ſlimy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
as catcheth the Water or Dew, and hindereth it from running
deep into the Earth, and then the Over-plus which the Plants receive
not, is rarified into Air, till it hath ſpent it ſelf as it were to nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54356:25"/>
After dry weather in Summer, if there comes a good ſhower, and
a warm day after, you may ſee this Fume hang in the Aire, ſometimes
low, cloſe to the ground, as if it were loth to part with the Earth, and
toward the latter end of Summer, if great Rain and warm VVeather
happen, then this Fume being great, and the Nights ſomething cold,
it will ſpend it ſelf in Muſhromes, Puffes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as old Trees and rotten
VVood will doe, where there is a great decay, and nothing to feed
on.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if you fear dry VVeather, do not deferre too long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you water your Trees and Seeds, but water while your ground
is yet moyſt: for believe me, I would not have you ſtay too long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you water, if you be minded to water at all: And alſo when you
do water, do it well; Conſider the depth of your Roots, and thoſe
that root deepeſt, water moſt; and alſo when you begin to water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it as long as you find occaſion: water Trees well, and Seeds and
ſmall Plants often: uſe not VVell-water, eſpecially for tender Plants,
for it is ſo ſtrained thorow the Earth that it hath little ſpirit to mak Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
in it for Plants. Rivers that run quick and long on ſharp
gravel are little better; therefore if you muſt uſe ſuch, let them ſtand
ſome time in the Sun, in Tubs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mixed with Dung.</p>
            <p>Let the Quantity and Quality of your Dung be according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of your Plants; as, if your Plants be great growers, and require
heat, then put Horſe-dung<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the water.</p>
            <p>If your Plants be fine and tender, then put Sheeps Dung, or Cows-dung,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the water, remembring, that if you think your ground
be bad, you muſt adde the more Dung.</p>
            <p>If your VVater be bad (as is aforeſaid) and that you put Dung into
it to help it, let it then ſtand in the Sun and open Aire uncovered.</p>
            <p>Take care you water no Plants with ſtanding ſtinking Ditch water,
nor no water that ſtinketh: for ſweet water not too clear, and freſh
Mould, not muſty or tainted by ſtinking weeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is as proper for
tender Plants, as ſweet and good Food, and warm and clean Lodging is
to a tender fine-bred man.</p>
            <p>Rain-water I take to be very good, if not too long kept; yet if
your Veſſel be large, the oftner you ſtirre it, the longer it will keep
ſweet.</p>
            <p>Large and Navigable Rivers, (ſuch as our <hi>Thames)</hi> that receive
much Soyl by the waſhing of Streets, and the many Sinks that run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and which by its own motion doth cleanſe it ſelf from that which
is noxious both to Man and Plants; is a moſt excellent Water for all ſorts
of Plants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54356:25"/>
The larger that Ponds be, the better their water is for Plants; and
if they have the ſhoot of ſome Stable-yard into them, it addes much
to their goodneſs; the opener they be to the Sun, the better; and the
more of motion they have, as by Horſes waſhing in them, or Geeſe
or Ducks ſwimming in them, 'tis ſo much the better: for the ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Ducks in Summer in your ſmall Ponds will keep the Water
from ſmelling.</p>
            <p>Now having ſhewed you ſeveral wayes of raiſing Forreſt-trees,
with ſome other hints of their Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of Compoſt for them,
and of VVater, and VVatering them, I now ſhall ſhew you the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how to raiſe them of Seed, which is to be preferred before all
others, though ſome of the aforeſaid wayes for ſome Trees are much
eaſier and quicker.</p>
            <p>Good Aire for Plants (as well as Men) is much aſſiſting to their
Health and Life, for without this nothing can live; and that which
is moſt healthfull for tender Men, is alſo the beſt for tender Plants.
Aire takes up the earthy Exhalations of all ſorts, and there mingles
them together, and being touched with Coeleſtial Fire, it reduceth
them into general Principles, for great uſes. I ſhall ſay no more of
Aire, for it is an Hermaphrodite, and is incloſed in Water, therefore
near a-kin to it.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Oaks Raiſing and Improving.</head>
            <p>I Shall not trouble you with the ſeveral kinds there be; though
the Learned <hi>J. Evelyn,</hi> Eſq; Reduceth them to four, in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Foreſt-Trees, but if they were diſtinguiſhed by ſeveral
Names, as we do our Pears, you might find as many varieties, onely
according to the ſhape and taſte of the Acorn: for as we know by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that ſeveral of our Pear-Trees grow Pyramid-like, as the Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-berry,
and Bordon-Musk-Pears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſome likewiſe grow
much ſpreading, as the Winter-Bonchriſtian, the back Pear of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
&amp;c. Even ſo do ſome of your Oaks; therefore if you deſire
aſpiring Trees, take care to gather your Acorns off from ſuch Trees,
or rather gather them from under ſome ſuch Trees, when fallen, and
in a dry time if you can.</p>
            <p>When you have ſo done, lay your Acorns thin in ſome open Room
to dry, and when they be dry, keep them in ſome dry place till the
latter end of <hi>January,</hi> and having prepared ſome good freſh Loomy
Ground, by digging and keeping it clean before-hand, ſow them, and
let them be covered about an Inch and a half, or two Inches deep; by
ſowing them at this time, you ſhall ſave a great many, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would have been ſpoyled by Mice or other Vermin; but if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be a wet time when they fall, then will they begin to ſpear out in
a ſhort time after: And then ſo ſoon as you ſee them ſhoot forth a little
bud at the ſmall ends, commit them to their Spouſe as ſoon as may be;
for when they be come to the time that the Almighty hath alotted them,
and be ſed and made luſty by the dews and ſhowers of the Heavens,
then the Star-fire impregnats the Moyſture in the ſeed, and then the
ſeed throws off, or endeavours to do it, and then takes his Lodging in
the Earth, where he prepares a room for his Off-ſpring; that is, as ſoon
as the ſeed hath imbibed himſelf in the Water, and received heat, (for
without both theſe no ſeeds can produce its kinds) the Body of the
Acorn cracks, and the ſpear ſhoots into the Earth, and as ſoon as it hath
got Entertainment there, and the Seaſon of the year agreeable, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the ſeed either turns into leaves, or ſpends it ſelf into leaves, and
that little ſmall part of the ſeed, the ſpear, that ſhoots forth Root, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54356:26"/>
then ſhot and leaves; ſo that if the Acorn hath had a convenient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of heat and moiſture (but if too much of either of theſe, that is
deadly to all ſeeds) then the ſeed ſpears forth, and if it be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Ground before it be dryed, and the ſpear withered, then
for certain that Seed, Acorn, Nut, or Stone will never grow. For
Nature, if once ſet on Motion, will rather ceaſe to be, than alter its
courſe; for Nature hates violence, neither can the ſeed receive this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſperm without theſe two, Father and Mother; and theſe two muſt
have a ſutable Agreement between them: for though one Veſſel be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to perfect the Infant in the Womb, yet Nature hath not been
wanting to provide ſeveral Breaſts to Nouriſh it. Therefore if your
Acorns have taken wet, and the heat hath made them ſpear, you muſt ſow
them as ſoon as you can, and venture them a whole Winter in the
Ground; remembring to keep ſome Traps ſet to catch the Mice.</p>
            <p>In the Spring following they will come up, keep them clean from
Weeds, and let them ſtand two or three years on their firſt bed, then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
prepared a piece of good freſh Ground, by adding ſome rotten
dung to it, if poor; or good freſh Rich Ground (which is better than
dung) cut the tap-root, and the ſide-boughs, and ſet them as you do
other Trees in your Nurſeries, keep your Ground with digging, and
the Trees with pruning up every year; thus Order them till you find
them fit to Remove, and you will then find no ſuch hazard in the Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, as if they were never Tranſplanted before; for there is a
great deal of Reaſon to be given that the oftner you Remove a Tree,
the likelier 'tis to grow when it is Removed again, provided it be not
too great. Beſides, Experience doth plainly ſhew the ſame, for I have
often found that a Walnut-Tree ſet of a Nut, and never-removed in its
Minority, but ſtill keeping his place of Situation, till it is ſix or ſeven
Foot high, that in Removing ſuch a Tree, you ſhall find near as much
hazard in the growing of that Tree, as in Removing an Oak of the ſame
ſtature, provided the Oak hath had his Abode in open Air, and not been
tenderly Nurſed up in a Wood; for ſuch Trees, let them be of what
kind you will, are nice to be removed out of their warm Habitation:
But at this I have hinted before. Now, to ſhew you ſome Reaſon why
any Tree being Removed before, is the likelier to grow when removed
again, Obſerve theſe few Rules:</p>
            <p>Firſt, 'Tis the Nature of all Trees to put forth one Root firſt, and then
ſome ſide-roots, according to the Kind and Nature of the Ground; and
this moſt ſtately Tree doth commonly run to the bottom of the Soyl
that is fit for his Nouriſhment, before it puts forth many ſide-roots, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a looſe, hollow Ground, and then at the end of the tap-root
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54356:27"/>
it puts forth feeding Roots, and when this Tree comes to be pretty
big, it having few feeding Roots near home, the Tree can hardly be
taken up well, without loſing moſt of them, which will be a great hazard
to the loſs of your Tree.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But when a Tree is taken up young, as at one, two, or
three years old, then there is but ſmall head, ſo that a little Root will
maintain that, and then this little Root lying not deep, and in a little
compaſs of Ground, may be taken up with leſs loſs, to the proportion
of the Head, than a greater.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When you have taken up theſe young Trees, in cutting off
the end of the tap-root, and the ends of the greateſt of the others, thoſe
very ends ſo cut off with the ſlope lowermoſt, will at that place put forth
many ſmall Roots, which lying near to the Body of the Tree, are the
eaſier to be taken up with the Tree when 'tis Removed again.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Cuſtom in Removing of Trees tends ſomewhat to their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
being Removed; for I ſanſie, that if you could get ſome Acorns of
an Oak, that had (with his Fore-Fathers) been accuſtomed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving,
as our Apple-ſtocks are, I do Judge it would be then as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of changing his Habitation as they. From that which hath been
ſaid I hope you will conclude with me, that 'tis beſt to Remove, either
Foreſt-Trees, or others, when young; for if you Remove them when
they be older, the better the Ground is, the more the Tree runs down
with a tap-root; therefore if never Removed before, the worſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
off from ſuch a Ground.</p>
            <p>Thus having Ordered theſe Young Trees till you have Nurſed them
up to the ſtature of ſix or ſeven Foot high, you may afterwards Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
them into your Walks, Wood, or where elſe your Fancy pleaſeth,
onely in Tranſplanting Obſerve this:</p>
            <p>Make your holes four Foot wide, and two Spade deep at leaſt; half
a year, or a quarter at leaſt before the time of Planting (if it be a year
'tis the better, provided you keep that Mould which you threw out
of the holes clean from Weeds and Graſs, by turning it over as Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
requires) and if you think your Ground be poor, or of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Soyl to what your Tree Naturally delights to grow in, mix it with
ſome ſuch like Earth as your Tree doth beſt delight to grow in; as for
an Oak, if your Ground be Gravelly, mix it then with the upper
Spade of Ground that is a Brick-Earth, turning theſe together with the
Earth you did throw out of the holes; if Clay, mix it then with a light
Loom, or a fat Sand, or ſmall Gravel; and if the Ground be poor, a
little laying of rotten dung in the bottom of your holes, but let none be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54356:27"/>
among your Earth when you ſet your Trees, that is, to touch the roots
of them.</p>
            <p>Having thus prepared your holes for your Tree, and your Earth,
if your Ground be a dry Soyl, then begin as ſoon as you find the Leaf
to fall, that is in <hi>October:</hi> 'Tis not the Hill or Valley, North or South
Situation which makes the finer or tougher Grain; but if there be a
ſeeding Ground on the top of an Hill, or on the North ſide, more than
there is in the Valley or South-ſide, there then will be the tougheſt Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
for where a Tree grows moſt in a year, that Oak is the tougheſt
Timber, and there that Tree ſhall have the moſt ſap, as on a deep
Loomy Ground: But let it be Hill or Valley, if it be a ſhallow ground,
and the bottom Gravel, and not mixed with Loom or Clay, there Oaks
will grow ſlow, and the Annual Circles being cloſe together, the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
muſt then be the finer Grained: and the ſap of ſuch Oaks is little, as
I have many times Obſerved: Experience and Reaſon (which I have
alwayes hitherto taken with me as Guides in my Travel and Search after
Nature) have confirmed me in this: A light Brick-Earth, or a
Loomy-Clay produce the ſtatelieſt Oaks, ſooneſt, and tougheſt Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
for there they grow quickeſt,</p>
            <p>Your Clays produce great Oaks, for that is a holding Ground; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they grow ſometimes ſlow, yet they laſt long.</p>
            <p>Your Gravel produceth many Oaks, and ſtreight, they grow ſlow,
the Timber is fine, and they decay while they be young; the Reaſons
of this I have told you before.</p>
            <p>Having made Ready your Holes, and taken up your Trees well, I
Adviſe you to open the Earth well round your Tree, keeping the ſide
of your Spade to the Body of your Tree, to prevent Cutting the Roots
when you take them up; and alſo to digg deep round the Tree, that
when you come to pull up your Tree, it may come up eaſily, which
will prevent thoſe Roots which grow Elbow-like, which if they do not
break off in pulling up, by ſtraining them to pull up, they will crack
ſo in the Elbow, that they will never grow, nor put forth Roots below
that place; therefore for ſuch Trees as be tickliſh to Remove, take
the more time, leſt you verifie the Old Proverb, which ſaith,
<q>
                  <l>Too much haſte</l>
                  <l>Oft makes waſte.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Such Roots as you find Bruiſed, or much Cracked, cut them
off, till you come at firm ſound Root. Such Trees as are ſlow-growers,
as the Oak is, you may prune up to the ſmaller Head; as, if your
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54356:28"/>
Tree be taper and ſtreight, you may prune up ſuch a Tree to one ſhoot;
but if your Tree be not taper, then leave two ſide-boughs, or more,
to receive ſome of the Sap, which will make the ſhoot that you intend
ſhall lead to make the body of the Tree, the ſmaller, and ſo your Tree
will be taper; but top your ſhoots, all but your leading-ſhoot, which
will make the Body of your Tree ſwell the more, and hinder them from
equalling the leading-ſhoot, and by topping the other it will grow the
ſtronger: I need not tell you which ſhoot you ſhould leave to be the
leading-ſhoot for your Tree, not Queſtioning but Sence and Reaſon will
teach you to leave that which grows ſtreighteſt and ſtrongeſt; if you
do leave any ſhoots, as moſt often it is neceſſary, leave them not right
againſt one another, for that will make the Tree grow too ſuddenly
thick in that place, but leave them one above another, ſo will your Tree
grow the more taper, for it will be leſs and leſs upward, between the
ſhoots, which ſhoots you muſt take off Year after Year, as your Tree
runs up in height, minding ſtill, now and then to leave ſome ſide-boughs
to keep the Tree taper, or elſe you will want your height of Timber;
or your Tree may grow top heavy, and ſo Crooked: I ſpeak of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-trees,
or the ways to Order Trees for Timber, (for I wiſh all Oaks
were fit for Timber) but if your leading-ſhoot be much Crooked, then
top it underneath a bud that tends upward, ſo low as if that bud lead
away, it may grow near ſtreight up; or cut off the leading-ſhoot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
another that grows more upright, Ordering it to be the leading-ſhoot
ſo, as your Tree grows, mind to lead it up every Year, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as you ſee Cauſe, taking care to keep off the Suckers, eſpecially
the firſt Year, unleſs you find the Head grow too great for the Body,
then leave ſome ſide-boughs to receive ſome Sap, and to make your
Tree taper, but this you ſhall hardly find in Oaks in their firſt Years
growth, namely, to grow too much in Head.</p>
            <p>Thus endeavouring to keep your Tree, (of what ſort ſoever it be,
if it be for Timber) with no great Head, ſtill keep the leading-ſhoot
uppermoſt, by ſometimes heading the other ſide-boughs, about a Foot
or more from the Body, or elſe they will be ready ſometimes to make
your Tree top-heavy, therefore keep your Tree till you have got it to
the height you intend, by keeping it as is above-ſaid; and if you find
it is not taper by theſe means, then in the Moneth <hi>February</hi> ſlit the Bark
quite thorow on three or four ſides, according to the bigneſs of your
Tree; but if ſmall, but one or two: ſo if the Tree be three yards high
to the Head, then let three ſlits go up one yard, two ſlits two yards
high, and one to the top: But if it be a ſtreight Tree, and taper, as you
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54356:28"/>
would have it, if the Bark be bound, ſlit it on one or two ſides, from
the Ground to the top.</p>
            <p>If your tree be young, though thriving, it will do it no harm, but
much good, for you may ſee in many thriving trees the Bark part of
it ſelf, telling you that it wants your help, therefore obſerve Nature,
and aſſiſt her in all your undertakings; for Wiſdom ſtandeth, not onely
in the Streets, but in the Woods, calling to you to learn of her.</p>
            <p>Note alſo, if you find any tree Crooked, ſlit it in the ham at the
afore-ſaid time, and take off ſome of the lower ſide of his Head, and
you will help the crook of the tree, whether it be great or ſmall; and
in time, by ſo doing, it will grow ſtreight: for by ſlitting the Bark in
the ham it makes the tree ſwell there, and ſo ſets the tree ſtreight; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
make two or three ſlits in the ham, according to the bigneſs of the
tree and crook; but if the tree be pretty great, then take your Bill
and cut the Bark thorow in the ham in ſeveral places, about two or three
Inches aſunder, let the Cut be cut ſlanting upward, a little croſs the
Diameter of the tree; by ſo doing you will ſtop the Sap in that place,
the Bark will dilate, and the place grow greater, and ſo the tree will
grow ſtreighter.</p>
            <p>Sometimes if your tree be not taper, in Summer when it ſhoots much,
the weight of the Head will draw the Body crooked, and the Head will
incline to the Ground; in ſuch trees Leave ſhoots on the Body, to check
and receive the Sap, and to keep it from abounding too much in the
Head; but when you find your tree grown crooked by the Head, in
Summer, with Leaves and Boughs weighing it down, as ſoon as you
find it begin to leane, take off ſome of the Boughs on the leaning ſide,
and top ſome according as you ſee cauſe: By this Summer-pruning you
may keep your tree ſtreight, therefore Obſerve it. I have found good
ſucceſs on Walnut-trees and Lines by it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though Oaks grow Crooked, it is not often by their great ſhoots,
for on moſt Grounds it grows ſlowly, but ſometimes their Head, or
leading ſhoot being cropped off by Cattel, it then breaks out on the ſides
into ſeveral leading ſhoots, and one leads one way, and another another;
and ſo diſtributeth the Sap, which makes the tree not onely grow crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but ſlowly; and ſometimes the early ſhooting of the leading-ſhoot
in the Spring cauſeth the ſame: For Froſt coming upon the tender leaves
and leading-bud, kills them, and then it is forc'd to break out a new on
the ſides; this happens often-times to young ſeedling Oaks in long Graſs,
which would gladly be more in the open Air, but by making too much
haſte many times they loſe their Heads for it. Now in ſuch Caſes you
muſt take off ſome, and cut ſome half a Foot off from the leading-ſhoot,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54356:29"/>
preſerving that which is moſt likelie for the leading ſhoot, which
though it be crooked, deſpair not, for Naturally it will grow ſtreighter,
and if you uſe pruning, and the afore-ſaid Rules, it will be ſtreight
much the ſooner. But in caſe you find your Young Oak very much
ſtubbed near the Ground, and never a ſhoot that is fit to lead to make
a Tree, in ſuch a young Tree you muſt cut it off cloſe at
the Ground, in the Spring-time, ſo ſhall you have one fine ſhoot or
more, but be ſure take off all but one, and then you ſhall find that ſhoot
thrive very much, till it hath got ſuch a Head in bigneſs as the Head
was before, and the Bark being then fine, it will enlarge it ſelf for the
growth of the ſhoot, and give good way for the Sap to run into the
Head, and ſo make a fine Tree; therefore if your Tree be ſtunned, or
much Crooked, then take this courſe, to head them cloſe at the ground,
and the Summer following neglect not to take off all the ſhoots but one,
for at Midſomer it is as good, nay, better to prune ſome Trees than
in the Spring, for then the Sap will ſoon cover round that wounded place,
and if not heal it quite, it will preſerve it from much harm, till the
Spring following, and at that time ſhoots will not break out much into
the head, to make it top-heavy: You may ſafely cut off ſmall branches,
and prune ſmall Trees at this Summer-ſeaſon. And for ſuch Trees as
have a great Pith, as the Aſh and Walnut, I take it to be the beſt time
for them. And whereas ſome ſay to the contrary, yet if the Reader
will be Adviſed by me, let him prune ſuch in Summer. But in the midſt
of Winter forbear to prune moſt Trees, eſpecially great Boughs, or
ſuch Trees as have a great Pith, or tender, for then the wound lyeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the open Air and Wet, and Froſt coming upon the Wet, and
piercing ſo far into the wounded place as the wet hath gone, kills the
Wood, and makes a hole in that place, and that hole holding Water
many times, Kills many a good Tree, eſpecially where great Boughs
are taken off, for they be long a covering over; and never will be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
if the Tree be Old.</p>
            <p>Therefore if your Tree be Old, forbear to cut off great Boughs;
but if for ſome Reaſons you are forced to do it, then cut off ſuch Boughs
two Foot, or a Yard from the Body of your Timber-tree; and let the
place where you cut off ſuch a Limb be perpendicular to the Horizon,
rather inclining to the <hi>Nadir,</hi> than the <hi>Zenith;</hi> by ſo doing, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will not lie on ſuch a place, and then the Tree will receive no harm.</p>
            <p>But if your Tree be young and thriving, then cut off the Boughs as
cloſe as you can, keeping the wounded place perpendicular to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
and be ſure not to leave Elbows to receive the wet, as too many
of our Husband-men do; for, the cloſer you cut off a Bough to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54356:29"/>
Body, the ſooner the bark covereth that place, therefore cut off the
ſide-boughs of young Timber-trees cloſe and ſmooth.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I could perſwade all Lovers of handſome Timber-trees, at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fall of their Woods to prune up all the Timber-trees; but then the
Wood muſt not ſtand too long before it be fell'd. You may prune off
boughs of ten years growth very well, and ſo every ten years; or oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
if it be in Hedg-rowes, prune up your Trees till you have got them
to ſuch a height as you find moſt convenient, <hi>viz.</hi> to fifty or ſixty foot
high: For I have many times obſerved Trees, of Oak, Aſh, Elm and
Beech, to have leading ſhoots ſixty foot high and more, when they
have had not above ten foot of good Timber; for Boughs have broke
out at that height, and have ſo diſtributed the ſap, that they were little
worth, but for the Fire; when, if they had been pruned up as is before
directed, you might have had the ſame height of good Timber; which,
how much more profitable it would be, and alſo beautifull, I leave to
any mans Judgement.</p>
            <p>The Aſh and Beech cover the wounded place over ſoon, and ſeldom
break out many ſide-boughs: The Elm very frequently breaks out
ſide-boughs, yet will arrive to a great height of good Timber: the
Oak is a little ſubject to break out ſide-boughs, and though a ſlow
grower, yet by its own hardneſs of his Wood he preſerves himſelf
well till it hath over-grown the wounded place, which it will in a few
years doe, if your Tree be young and thriving, and the boughs, not
very great; for if the boughs be great, that place when they be cut
off is ſuch a Damm to the ſap, that it forceth it to break out with many
ſmall boughs there; eſpecially in ſuch Trees as have a thick and rugged
bark, as the Elm and Oak have when old.</p>
            <p>But if the Tree be young and thriving, then is the Bark thin and looſe,
and will more readily give way to the ſap to aſcend into the Head, and
not break out into ſide-boughs; but if ſome few do break out, often
pruning them cloſe off will prevent that: But if you would be at a little
more trouble, note this which I have found to be true, and your Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſhall pay you well for your pains.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Midſommer,</hi> after you have pruned up your Trees, take off all
the ſmall ſhoots that are broke out on the ſide of your Trees, cloſe to
the body of the Tree; do thus two or three years together, and you
will find every year the ſide-boughs to be fewer and fewer, till you
have a clear body, beautifull to behold, and profitable for as good Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
thirty or forty foot or more, which otherwiſe would not have been
a quarter ſo high. Thus may you make an Elm (which is a Tree moſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54356:30"/>
ſubject to break out ſide-boughs) as clear from boughs forty or fifty
foot high, as they be.</p>
            <p>Your Oak that is young you may eaſily maſter, and bring it to a
clear body; though it is ſome what troubleſome in Woods, yet in Hedg-Rowes
it may be practiſed with eaſe, or in Walks, or on ſingle Oaks:
But our Yeomen and Farmers are too much ſubject to ſpoyl ſuch Trees
as would make our beſt Oaks, by heading them, and making them
Pollards. I wiſh there were as ſtrict a Law as could be made, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
thoſe that do preſume to head an Oak, the King of Woods, though
it be on their own Land.</p>
            <p>By this means we ſhould have the Farmer that is ſcanted in Wood,
by often pruning off the ſide-boughs make many finer Trees than now
there are; for in ſuch places there is great food to make him a great
Tree; and then in Coppices, if you let a Tree ſtand to be very great,
it ſpoyls many a young one, and alſo your under-wood.</p>
            <p>But methinks I hear ſome oppoſing me, ſaying, that by ſo pruning
up of Trees, they do not prove ſo well for the Joyner, Carpenter,
Wheeler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they ſay, if the Tree doth over-grow the Knot, when
they come to cleave ſuch a Tree, that place proves faulty within, and
the Timber is not ſo good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They ſay, that cutting off the ſide-boughs, makes Trees
more knotty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they ſay, that it makes a Tree decay ſooner.</p>
            <p>To theſe three Objections I ſhall anſwer, and then haſten to conclude,
and ſo leave my beloved Oak.</p>
            <p>I do grant, that if the Knots be great, though the Trees be young
and thriving, and have covered the place over well, if you come to ſaw
out ſuch Trees for Plank, Board, or VVainſcot, that there may be
ſome Defect there where great boughs were cut off; but ſuppoſe there
be, you have ſtill the ſame length clear Timber at the lower end as you
would have had if theſe boughs had not been cut off; and then by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up your Trees, they grow ſtraighter, and your Tree carries a
greater length of Timber, uſefull for Beams, Summers, Raiſing, VVall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plats,
Rafters, Joyce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how much Timber theſe ſpend more
than the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Board and VVainſcot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I leave you to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
But my Advice is, not to let your boughs be great, but take
them off from ſuch Trees whileſt young, and then the boughs will be
young and ſmall, and ſuch Trees will cover ſuch places in a little time,
and theſe ſmall Knots will not be perceived then, in caſe the Tree be
ſawn for VVainſcot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:54356:30"/>
Again, as to the firſt Objection, this ſeems to me a full Anſwer; as
firſt, for ſuch Trees as ſtand abroad ſingle, you ſhall find them to have
a clear body, of ſix, ſeven, eight or ten foot high, I only ask my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,
whether ſuch a length of Timber had Knots on it or no? I hope
they will grant it had; well then, how comes it to be ſo clear without
Knots? Now I tell you, 'tis Cattle that crop off the boughs whileſt
they be young, and that makes it clear from boughs, and the ſap mounts
up higher, and there breaks out, which if it were but taken off as
it is below, it then would be as clear ſixty foot as it is at ſix, and as
ſtraight.</p>
            <p>This very Reaſon poſſeſs'd me ſo much, that it told me, an Elm
(which is the moſt ſubject of any Tree to break out ſide-boughs) might
be made clear Timber ſixty foot high, as well as ordinarily they be ſix,
by early, often, and Summer-pruning. This my Experience hath
proved true.</p>
            <p>Again, a Thorn or VVhite-buſh growing in a Park, and kept under
by Dear cropping of it, for eight, ten or more years, ſo that it hath
got a hundred little boughs, if it once get but a leading ſhoot, and that
out of the Dears reach, all ſhall unite in that one, and that ſhall come
to be a ſtraight body, and ſtraight-grained, notwithſtanding it was ſo
crooked below; for the lower ones will all die by the Dear cropping
them, and the ſaps free aſcending into the leading ſhoot.</p>
            <p>But as to the ſecond Objection, I grant, that ſometimes cutting off
boughs, (eſpecially great ones, and of Old trees) makes more, but
then they be ſmall; for the more a River is divided into ſmall Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
the eaſier thoſe little ones are ſtopped and brought into one; for
a great River muſt have a great Damme, and taking off a great bough
is a great Damme to the ſap; for the Tree falling ſuddenly narrow
upwards, and the ſap being uſed to ſpend it ſelf there, and having free
paſſage thither, when it is got into that place it breaks out on each ſide
of the Knot, into many little boughs; but if you take off theſe little
boughs that <hi>Midſommer,</hi> the Summer after there will be but a ſmall
quantity in compariſon of the Spring-ſap: And the bark being then
looſe, it makes the eaſier way for the Sap to aſcend into the head, and
not to break out into Boughs; and ſo having prepared the way by the
Sap, that <hi>Midſommer</hi>-ſhoot will not be at a ſtand ſo much the Spring
following.</p>
            <p>Or if the Spring after you have taken off the Boughs, you take off
the little ones that were ſhot out the year before, and ſlit the bark
above each Knot, that is, ſomewhat great down to the Knot; by ſo
doing you may bring your Tree to have a clear Body, by a few years
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54356:31"/>
pruning; for I have Obſerved it uſual in many Trees the Year
they have been pruned up, for the Bark to have cracked an Inch or
more; which tells you moſt plainly, that the pruning of Trees doth
make them ſwell in Body, therefore help the pent places by ſlitting the
Bark: you may often ſee this on your Aſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray you, how comes it, that in your Coppices you ſhall have Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-trees
ten or twelve Foot high, clear, without Bough, and then the
Tree break out all into head? It is (I am confident) the under-wood
which ſmothers, and beats off the ſide-boughs as high as that grows, and
ſo makes the Timber clear ſo high; alſo if you mark where high Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-trees
are, that have clear Bodies a great height, they do, or did
ſtand thick together, and ſo one draws up another, ſmothering the
ſide-boughs, and beating them off (ſometimes) by their Motion in
great Winds.</p>
            <p>Thus by what has been ſaid of Cattels Cropping, Trees ſtanding
in Coppices, and by Trees ſtanding thick together, you may Learn
that you may do the ſame, and have Timber, by pruning, as clear from
Knots, as it is by thoſe Accidents.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whereas they ſay it makes a tree decay ſooner; I grant
this, that to prune off great Boughs from an Old tree, makes it decay
ſooner; for the Wounded place being great, and the Tree ſlow of
growth, is a long time covering over that place (if it can be done at
laſt) and that takes wet and Air, and decays the Tree; therefore I do
not Adviſe you to take great Boughs off from any tree.</p>
            <p>But ſmall Boughs cut off ſmooth, and cloſe, from an Old tree or
Young, cauſeth the tree to laſt longer, and to be clearer Timber: For
when ſmall Boughs are taken off from the ſide of your Tree, though
Old, the Tree then not drawing much Sap, that little Sap doth moſt of
it then aſcend into the Head, and ſo makes the Head continue freſh and
thriving the longer; and taking off the ſide-boughs makes the Tree to
ſwell, and grow ſooner into a great Body.</p>
            <p>For the Boughs that break out of the ſide have not ſuch deep Root
in the Body of the Tree, (I mean thoſe that come forth after the Tree
hath been once pruned) for every bough that breaks out, breaks out
through the Bark, and hath its Root between the Bark and Tree that
Year, and as the Tree increaſeth, ſo that knot is deeper and deeper in
the Body of the Tree: thus taking off the ſmall Boughs often, keepeth
the Tree clearer from great knots within the Timber, and the little knots
do cover over ſo ſoon before the out-ſide of the knot be dead, that they
become as clear Timber.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed you, that all ſorts of Trees come to have clear
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54356:31"/>
Bodies by pruning, either Natural or Artificial; that is by Cattel crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
by under-wood beating off the ſide-boughs, or by ſtanding cloſe
one to another, and ſo drawing up one another, and ſmothering the
ſide-boughs by ſtanding ſo thick, or by pruning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed in part how to Raiſe and Order the Oak from the
Acorn, till it is thirty or forty Years old. There is one thing more to
be known, which is, how to Remove an Oak that is large (or other
Tree) and that was never Removed before; I ſhall borrow part of it
from the Learned Eſquire <hi>Evelin</hi>'s Diſcourſe of Foreſt-trees, <hi>p.</hi> 13.
Chooſe a Tree as big as your Thigh, ſaith he, (but if leſs, the better
to grow) Remove the Earth from about him, cut through all the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
Roots, till with a Competent ſtrength you can inforce him down
upon one ſide, ſo as to come with your Ax at the tap root; cut that
off, and cut all the Roots ſmooth on the under-ſide, re-dreſs your Tree,
and ſo let it ſtand, covered about with the Mould you looſened from it,
till the next Year, or rather longer, then take it up at a fit Seaſon, and
you will find it will (at thoſe ends where the Roots were cut off) have
drawn many tender young Roots, apt to take, and ſufficient for the
Tree whereſoever you ſhall tranſplant him: further to facilitate the
Removal of ſuch great Trees, or ſmall ones that are tickliſh to Remove,
for the Adornment of ſome particular place, or the rarity of the Plant,
there is this Expedient: A little before the hard Froſts ſurpriſe you,
make a Trench about your Tree, at ſuch diſtance from the ſtemme as
you judge ſufficient for the Roots; dig this ſo deep till you come lower
than the ſide-roots, if your Ground be a dry Ground, water the Hill
of Earth, the Froſts will lay hold on it the more, but commonly in
Winter before Froſts we have ſhowers ſaves you that Labour; then lay
ſome Litter in the bottom of your Trench, which will keep that part
from freezing, in caſe you have Occaſion to undermine it more to
looſen it when you take it up, as is very likely you will: Thus let it
ſtand till ſome hard Froſt do bind the Earth firmly to the Roots, and
then convey it to the Pit or Hole prepared for its new ſtation, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
covered the Earth by with ſome Horſe-Litter to keep that Earth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54356:32"/>
from freezing, which Mould will then be ready to cover that clod
round the Root of the Tree, and the ends of the Roots, and ſo ſecure
it the better; and that Litter will do well to lay round the Tree on the
top of the Ground.</p>
            <p>But in caſe the Tree be very great, and the Mould about the Roots
be ſo ponderous as not to be removed by an ordinary force, you muſt
then have a Gin or Crane, ſuch a one as they have to Load Timber with;
and by that you may weigh it out of its place, and place the whole upon
a Trundle or Sledge, to convey it to the place you deſire; and by the
afore-ſaid Engine you may take it off from the Trundle, and ſet it in its
hole at your pleaſure. By this Addreſs you may tranſplant trees of a
great ſtature without the leaſt Diſorder, and by taking off the leſs of
their Heads, which is of great Importance where this is practiſed, to
ſupply a Defect, or remove a Curioſity.</p>
            <p>I do ſuppoſe that one of theſe ſmall Cranes or Gins would be very
uſeful to thoſe that have a great many pretty big trees to take up in their
Nurſeries, eſpecially ſuch as have ſtrong and tough Roots; for if the
Ground were but well looſened round the Roots, and a Rope well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
a little above the Ground to the ſtemme of the tree, I dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
that this way one Man with a Lever ſhall draw up more than ten
Men: And beſides, this will draw upright, which is better than draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on one ſide, as many are forced to do. You muſt have on the lower
end of the three Legs, pieces of Plank, to keep it from ſinking too far
into the looſe Ground: I have now one a making, and hereafter I ſhall
be able to give you a better Account of it than now; the onely Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
I think of at preſent, is, in faſtening the Rope about the Tree
ſo, that it may not ſlide, or gall the tree; but a piece of good Leather,
about four or five Inches broad, with three or four Straps to come
through ſo many holes, when it is faſtened to the Rope they may all be
ſtrained alike; this I ſuppoſe will do your work. The afore-ſaid Learned
Author Adviſeth you, before you take up trees, to mark them all on
one ſide, the better to place that ſide to point to the ſame Aſpect it did
before: For, Oaks growing on the North ſide of an Hill, are more
Moſſie than thoſe that grow on the South-ſide: this I grant, becauſe
that ſide is Colder and Wetter; for it is Cold and Wet Ground that
breeds Moſs moſt, and that gets from the Ground upon the Trees: Alſo
he ſays, that Apple-trees ſtanding in a Hedge-row, after the Hedge
was taken away, the Apple-trees did not thrive ſo well as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for want of the ſhelter of the Hedge. I ſay, that if the Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
had drawn up the Apple-trees ſo as to make them top-heavy, they
might not thrive ſo well; but if they were not, the ſhelter being taken
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54356:32"/>
away, they would thrive the better: unleſs by thriving he means grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in height: <hi>See Lord</hi> Bacon's <hi>Natural Hiſtory,</hi> p. 113. For a
tree pent up cannot ſpread.</p>
            <p>But as for placing the South-ſide of a tree South again, this is not to
the purpoſe; for the greateſt time that Trees grow in, is from the Suns
entring into <hi>Aries</hi> to his entring into <hi>Libra;</hi> and all that time (that
is, half a Year) the Tree hath the Sun on the North-ſide both Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Evening, and the North ſide hath the benefit of warming it ſelf
later in the Evening, and earlier in the Morning, having two hours
time earlier, and two later in the height of Summer, more than the
South-ſide: Again, you ſhall have the Cold be as much on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of a Wall or Tree in the Night, as on the North, if the Wind blow
on the South-ſide; therefore I do Judge that to place a Tree the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
South again, ſignifieth little, though the ſame Author ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 88.
and the Author of the Book, Called <hi>[Mathematical Recreations]</hi>
p. 75. ſaith, That a Tree groweth more on the South-ſide than on the
North; I have oft Obſerved the Annual Circles, and have found as
many, nay more, to the contrary; for thus I have always found, on
a Tree near the Ground the Annual Circles have been the greateſt on
that ſide from which moſt of the great Roots came: As if a Tree grow
on the South-ſide of a Bank, you ſhall find the Circles on that Tree to
be greateſt on the North-ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but higher on a Tree the Circles
are ever greateſt on that ſide the Tree where there is a great Bough
breaks out, for the Sap has great recourſe thither; many times by
ſudden cold ſome is ſtayed by the way, and ſo increaſeth that ſide of the
Tree moſt.</p>
            <p>For I take the Sap of a Tree, if the Weather be open (that is, of
thoſe Trees that ſhed their Leaves) to be ſtill aſcending into the Head,
though it be Mid-winter; though there do not riſe enough to keep the
Leaves on, nor to make it bud forth, yet it is plain that it keeps the
buds full and freſh, and increaſeth the growth of the Tree, for that ſame
pory ſubſtance of the Tree which is between every Annual Circle that
is made by the Winter-ſap; and the milder the Winter is, the greater
you ſhall find this to be, as is viſible in Aſh, Oak, Elm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
other, which is more hard and clear, is increaſed by the Sap in Summer;
and the more feeding the Summer is by ſhowers, the more ſhall the
Circles increaſe on dry Ground; and according to the Nature of the
Ground that the Tree Loves, and the depth of the Soyl, ſo doth the
Tree increaſe in theſe Circles and growth in all parts.</p>
            <p>Between theſe Annual Circles doth ſome Sap riſe, as is plain in a
tree that is Barked round, for that tree ſhall put forth Leaves and increaſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54356:33"/>
in Body, but produce little or no ſhoot, and the more porous the tree
is between theſe Annual Circles, the longer that tree will Live, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
I have had it Experimented on Walnut-trees, Aſhes, &amp;c.
And they have continued ſometimes two years, and ſometimes near
three before they have dyed, when they have been barked quite round
the ſtemme, a Foot or more; and by way of Experiment I cut off the
Bark from a Holly-tree and a Box-tree about half a Foot clean, quite
round the ſtemme or body of each tree, and the tops of both did die in
leſs than one years time, which informed my Reaſon, as much as though
I had Learned it out of the moſt Learned Author, that the Sap of thoſe
trees that ſhed their Leaves, doth in a ſmall quantity aſcend between
the Annual Circles, in that pory place: for trees that hold their leaves,
their Wood is cloſe, and Compact between the Annual Circles, and
that is the Reaſon that they die ſoon, being barked round: Alſo their
Sap being of a Turpentine and Clammy Subſtance, is the Reaſon they
hold their Leaves all Winter, being as it were glued on by that Subſtance;
and the Sap of ſuch Trees as hold their Leaves, being once ſet by cold,
requires a pretty deal of heat to make it thin, and ſet it on Motion: As
Comparatively, a little Cold will ſet or make ſtiff Pitch or Turpentine;
but it muſt be Froſt that ſets or ſtays the Motion of Water.</p>
            <p>Alſo thoſe Trees which hold their Leaves will grow much better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the dropping of other great Trees, than thoſe that ſhed their Leaves;
for their Turpentine-ſap ſhoots off the drops, ſo that they have little
or no harm by ſuch a Scituation,</p>
            <p>But in caſe you ſhould have a Tree Barked round by Accident, and
would willingly preſerve it, your beſt way is to get a ſhoot below the
wounded place, and if your Tree be Young, you ſhall then have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
break out a little above the Root, if you find they ſhoot ſtrong,
preſerve two of the ſtrongeſt, and ſee that the Barked place be near the
Ground; but if your Tree be Barked high from the Ground, or that it
ſhoot up ſlowly, then leave but one ſhoot, keeping all other that ſhoot
out clean taken off, as ſoon as ever you ſee them break out; ſo Nouriſh
up the two ſhoots or ſhoot till you have got them higher than the
wounded place; then cut a long ſlit in the Bark, above the wound, and
joyn in that ſhoot exactly, making it fit the ſlit, the in-ſide of one bark
right againſt the in-ſide of the other; tie it cloſe in, and Loom it over
with good and well tempered Loom, to keep the Air and wet out; or
better with ſoft Wax. The Spring is the beſt Seaſon, but if you fear
your Tree to decay, defer not, but do it as ſoon as your ſhoots be ſhot
long enough.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of raiſing and Ordering the Elm.</head>
            <p>THere are ſeveral ſorts of Elm, but the beſt ſort (becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the greateſt Trees, and ſooneſt comes to perfection) is
that which hath its Leaves not much leſs than Line, or Lime-tree leaves,
and ſhoots with a ſhoot not much leſs than a Sallow when it is lopped:
it is called by ſome the Trench-Elm, by others the Marſh-Elm. Some
other ſorts there are that are not much inferiour to this for producing
high and good Timber. One ſort there is that hath on the young ſhoots
great pieces like Cork, ſubject to ſpread in head much, and grow crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
this is not very good to make high Trees, but makes good Pollards:
Another ſort there is which I ſee in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the ſides are ſubject to have
Wenns thick on them, which makes the Body hard to cleave: this is not
very good to make a high Tree, but good Pollards.</p>
            <p>All ſorts of Elms doe increaſe from the roots much of themſelves;
and the more you take, the more they will give, provided you keep
them from being taken from you; that is, from being ſpoyled by Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
and though they be ſo kind of themſelves, yet there are ſeveral
wayes to increaſe them, but the way to have of the beſt Kinds, and to
make the fineſt Trees, is by raiſing them of ſeeds.</p>
            <p>Therefore about the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> or about the tenth, you
ſhall find the broad things like Hops begin to fall, which have the ſeed
in them; when you find theſe begin to fall, in a dry day (if conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
you can) gather what quantity you pleaſe to ſow, then lay them
thin in ſome place where they may drye four or five dayes, and then
having prepared a Bed (in bigneſs according to the quantity of your

not well rake in; let them be covered about half an Inch thick; if the

up: About the midſt of <hi>September</hi> ſift a little richer Mould all over the
Bed, but not ſo much as to cover them, thus doe the next Summer,
and take off the ſide <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> boughs though young, and when they have ſtood
two years on that Bed, then plant them on beds in your Nurſery,
keeping them with digging and pruning up yearly, till you have got
them to the ſtature you think convenient to plant abroad. In ſetting
this or any ſort of Tree forget not to top the ends of the tap-root<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
other long ones, and alſo not to leave a bruiſed End uncut off. You
may ſet them in ſtreight lines in your Nurſery, about a yard one Row
from another, and about a foot and a half one Tree from another, in
the Rowes; mind the Natural depth it firſt did grow at, and ſet it ſo
when you remove it; have a care of ſetting any Tree too deep, and
alſo keep not this Tree nor a Walnut long out of the ground, for their
ſpongy Roots will in a little time grow Mouldy and be ſpoyled: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you cannot ſet them, let them be covered with Earth, and then
you ſhall find this Tree as patient in removing, and as certain to grow
as any Tree I know.</p>
            <p>The ground they like beſt is a light Brick-earth or Loom, as I ſaid
before; that they diſlike moſt is, a rocky ground, or a ſtiffe clay;
but if one have a mixture of Brick-earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the other of
ſmall Gravel, Drift-ſand, Sand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then there they will do pretty
well.</p>
            <p>They naturally increaſe very much of themſelves, and the more
where they meet with natural ground: if you fell a thriving Tree, and
fence in the place, you then may have a ſtore to furniſh your Woods
and Hedge-rows with the worſt; and the ſtraighteſt to nurſe up in your
Nurſeries, for to make VValks, Avenues, Glades, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with; for
there is no tree more proper for the certainty of its growing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if you make good large and deep holes, and where the ground
is not natural, there help it by ſome that is, and then you may hope
for a ſtately high growing Tree, if you take care in pruning it up, as
is before ſhewed of the Oak. You need not much fear its growing
top-heavy; for it having ſuch a thick bark, the ſap is ſubject to lodge
in it, and break out many ſide-boughs, and the Roots apt to break out
with ſuckers, the more when pruned, therefore prune it up high, and
often, but let the ſeaſon be <hi>February,</hi> for then its fine dark, green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured
Leaf, and long hanging on it, is the more ornamental, and fit
for walks.</p>
            <p>As for the way to increaſe it from the Roots of another Tree, I doe
referre you to the <hi>ſeventh Chapter,</hi> which will ſhew you fully how to
perform the ſame; obſerving but them Rules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may raiſe many fine
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54356:35"/>
young Trees from the Roots of another, much better than naturally they
will be produced from the Roots.</p>
            <p>I adviſe you where you find your ground Natural in your Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
there to plant ſome of this moſt uſefull wood; for it will run
in the Banks, and thicken your Hedges with wood, and is very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
to other ſorts of wood growing by it.</p>
            <p>Do not let ignorant Tradition poſſeſs you that it will grow of the
Chips, or of Truncheons ſet, like Sallowes, though the Author of the
<hi>Commons Complaint</hi> ſaith it will, for I aſſure you it neither doth nor
will.</p>
            <p>In Lopping of this, be carefull to cut your boughs cloſe and ſmooth
off, minding to keep them perpendicular to the Horizon, the better
to ſhoot off the wet,</p>
            <p>It will grow well of Laying, (as is before noted and alſo directed in
the <hi>Chapt.</hi> of Laying) in which if you take but a little labour more
than ordinary, from one Tree you may have (in a few years) many in
your Hedge-rowes or elſewhere; therefore deferre not, but put this
in practice, eſpecially the great Kind: My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> adviſeth to bud
it, to make the Leaves the larger, but that is needleſs.</p>
            <p>Part of theſe Rules I wrote ſome years agoe, at the requeſt, and for
the uſe of the truely ingenious Planter, and Lover thereof, Sir <hi>Henry
Capell;</hi> and I ſhall give you the ſame Concluſion now, that I did then
to him, which take as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Since Gard'ning was the firſt and beſt Vocation,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Adam</hi> (whoſe all are by Procreation)</l>

            <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of Raiſing and Ordering the Aſh.</head>
            <p>AND as for Raiſing the Aſh, I ſhall give you the ſame Rules as I
did to the aforeſaid Honourable Perſon the ſame time, before the
Diſcourſe of Forreſt-trees was written.</p>
            <p>Let your Keyes be thorow ripe, which will be about the middle or
end of <hi>October,</hi> or <hi>November:</hi> When you have gathered them, lay
them thin to dry, but gather them off from a young ſtraight thriving
Tree: My Reaſon to gather them off a young thriving tree, is, becauſe
there will the Keyes, or ſeeds in the Keyes, be the larger and ſolider,
therefore by conſequence they are the abler to ſhoot the ſtronger, and
to maintain themſelves the better and longer: Though I know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that the ſeeds of ſome old Plants will come up ſooner (ſo the
ſeed be perfect) than the ſeed of young Plants; and alſo that old ſeed,
(ſo it will but grow) will come up ſooner than new Seed. My afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Reaſons do in part demonſtrate this: Or thus, Nature finding her
ſelf weak, doth (like a provident Mother) ſeek the ſooner to provide
for her weak Children: for Nature is one in divers things, and yet va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in one thing.</p>
            <p>Now if you gather them off from a ſtraight tree, 'tis the likelier
they will run more up, and grow ſtraighter than thoſe which be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
off a Pollard or crooked tree: for it is well known, and might be
proved by many Inſtances, that Nature doth delight in Imitation, and
the Defects of Nature may be helped by Art; for the great Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which many times we find viſible in many Vegetables of the ſame
<hi>ſpecies,</hi> they all proceed either from the Earth, the Water, or the
Heavenly Influences; but the laſt is the greateſt Author of Alteration,
both in Senſibles, Vegetables and Animals. However, Like ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
its Like; and ſince there is ſuch plenty of Forreſt-trees that
bear ſeed, you may as well gather all ſorts of Keyes and Seeds off or
under ſuch Trees, as not.</p>
            <p>As for the time of ſowing them, let it be any time between the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of <hi>October,</hi> and the laſt of <hi>January;</hi> for they will lie till Spring
come twelve Months before they appear: if your ground be not very
ſubject to great weeds, you may ſow them with Oats, if you be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54356:36"/>
minded to make a Wood of it; and in your VVoods on the top of
your Ground; but if they be prepared before-hand, they will be much
more certain of growing: therefore if you would be ſure to raiſe good
ſtore of them for to make VValks, or furniſh your VVoods with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
having gathered your Keyes, and ordered them as is aforeſaid, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
ſome ſifted Earth, or Sand, which is better by keeping an equal
warmth and moyſture, to prepare them for ſpearing. Having prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
your ſand, and a houſe to lay them in, where the Air may freely
come, then in this Houſe lay one Laying of Sand and a Laying of Keyes,
parting your Keyes well; ſo doe till you have (Laying after Laying)
covered all your Keyes in the Couch, any time in VVinter, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
directed: Let your Sand be pretty moyſt, and ſo keep it all that
year; and having prepared your Ground by often digging, and a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Soyl, (which the Aſh loves) then about the latter end of <hi>January</hi>
ſowe them on this Bed, covering them about one Inch, or an Inch and
a half thick: Do not let them lie too long uncovered when you take
them out of their Couch; for then they will be ſpeared, and if they
lie too long in the Aire, it will ſpoyl them: Do not ſowe them in
froſty weather; but if Froſts be, ſtay till they be over.</p>
            <p>Mind to keep them clean from weeds the firſt year, for they will
ſhoot but little the firſt year, but the ſecond they will ſhoot ſtrongly:
the VVinter after you may tranſplant them upon Beds, pruning the
little ſide-ſhoots, and topping the tap-root. Keep them with digging
and pruning every year on theſe Beds, and in few years they will be
fit for Walks, Woods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and one of theſe thus ordered, ſhall be
worth ten taken out of VVoods, for they will be taper and fine trees.
VVhen you remove an Aſh, take not off his head, if he be not too
top-heavy, that you can poſſibly help it; for an Aſh and a VValnut
are two of the worſt Trees I know to head, they having ſuch a great
Pith: but the ſide-boughs you may be bold to take off, provided you
take them off cloſe, and the Boughs not very great. It is not very
apt to break much into ſide-boughs, and heals over the wound as well
as any tree except the Beech; then why will you have low Timber-trees
of Aſhes, when you may as well have high ones? Therefore
prune up your young Aſh-trees well and often: And if you follow
but theſe Rules, you may raiſe them as eaſily as Barley, and as
thick.</p>
            <p>As touching the ſeveral Kinds, ſome Authors will have two ſorts,
the Male and Female: but there is no ſuch thing as Male and Female
among Plants, though ſome Plants are ſo called; for what Act of
either do any two Plants communicate to each other? The greateſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54356:36"/>
difference that ever I obſerved in young Aſhes, among the many
thouſands that I have raiſed, was in their Bark; for I have had ſome
that have had blackiſh Bark, ſome reddiſh, the Leaves alike, but
what difference there will be in the Keyes and Timber, I yet know
not.</p>
            <p>The Aſh is not fit to be ſet near fine Gardens, for the Leaves turn
to ſoyl ſuddenly, and ſo ſpoyl your VValks; alſo the Roots run ſo
ſhallow that they will rob your Borders, and ſpoyl your Fruit-trees:
They are as bad by your plow'd Ground, for the Roots will ſo draw
the ſtrength of the Ground from the Corn, that it will languiſh and
pine away. And this I have obſerved, that the Summer after a Tree
is lopped, it ſhall rob the Corn more than another bigger ſtanding
by it, as may be viſible by the growth of the Corn: I have wilfully
experienc'd it, and I conceive the Reaſon to be this; the Sap riſeth
into the head of the Pollard (as uſually it did) and ſo into the Boughs,
but finding the Boughs cut off, it filleth the Head ſo full, that it cauſeth
it to ſwell in the Spring; and this is the reaſon Pollard-heads are
bigger than any other part of the body of the Tree; the head being
ſo full that it can contain the ſap no longer, it then breaketh out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
abundance of young ſhoots, and when they ſet once a growing
they grow apace, and ſo the Bark of them being thin and open for
the Sap to run in, they receive as much as the Roots can poſſibly
provide for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and endeavour to enlarge the Head to that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
as it was at before.</p>
            <p>But though the Aſh doth harm to grow near or upon plowed
Ground, yet it is the uſefulleſt wood that growes, for the Plough
and other uſes belonging to the Plough-man. It is a quick-growing
wood, and will grow pretty well on moſt ſorts of Grounds, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they be not too wet, or very ſhallow: It grows beſt on ſuch
Grounds as have their ſurface of a looſe Nature, ſo that it be not too
ſhallow. It produceth excellent Timber for ſeveral uſes, and is ſuch
a quick-grower, that from a Key, in Forty years, one Aſh was ſold
for Thirty pounds ſterling, as witneſſeth the ingenious Author of the
<hi>Diſcourſe of Forreſt-trees,</hi> pag. 22. And this I can tell, which my
Lord and I meaſured, of the ſhoot of an Aſh that ſtood between the
Wood-yard at <hi>Hadham-Hall,</hi> and a place where I uſed to raiſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
plants; that the ſecond years ſhoot was Eight foot within two
Inches; which had it ſhot but a few years at this rate, it would ſoon
have been a very great Tree, and worth a like price.</p>
            <p>Of all the VVood that I know, there is none burns ſo well green
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54356:37"/>
as the Aſh; and that is one Reaſon that many a fine Pollard is ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
For your bad Husbands (as they are tearmed) are as unkind to
Trees as they are to themſelves: For their want of Wood early in
the VVinter, makes them flie to the Aſh, whence they hack off the
Boughs, and thus leave him all Winter; in which time the wood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not very hard, that drinks in the wet at theſe wounded places,
and before the Spring comes to heal it over, decayes, and ſo by that
means every Winter receiveth the wet more and more, till it hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
Root, Body and Branch.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, there are ſome which will not lop their Trees till
they bear very great Boughs; and then lop off them, (ſmooth and
well cut off) though it be in the Spring; yet in ſuch great wounds,
before the Sap can cover the place, the wet makes a hole in ſome or
many of theſe places; and ſo you loſe both Body and Lops in a few
years. Beſides the lopping of Trees young, that is, at ten or twelve
years at the moſt, by ſo doing you keep your Tree much the longer
alive; and you ſhall have ſhoots of Trees at firſt felling, grow more
into wood in one year, than they do when old Lops in two or three,
and in all Reſpects are as uſefull for the Fire: Then I intreat you be
not ſo wilfull, as to make you and yours poor, and alſo ſpoyl your
trees.</p>
            <p>Therefore in lopping of Pollards, eſpecially ſoft wood, let it be
towards the Spring, and let not your Lops grow ſo great, as to
ſpoyl your trees and loſe the uſe of your Money. If once you find
your Pollard grow much hollow at the Head, down with it as ſoon
as may be, for it then decayes more in the Body than the Lop comes
to; and if your Timber-trees be dead-topt, or moſt of the Head dead,
or that you find Wood-peckers, or Nihills make holes in them, then
fell them as ſoon as the ſeaſon is, (which is from <hi>October</hi> to <hi>February)</hi>
for when they begin to decay, they decay apace.</p>
            <p>I know it is the Opinion of moſt men, that theſe Birds ſpoyl their
Trees; but let me tell you, they rarely make holes in ſound Timber,
therefore Learn of them, and fell the trees of which they give you
warning by making holes in them: the ſooner the leſs Timber loſt.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Raiſing and Ordering the Beech.</head>
            <p>OF the Kinds of Beech I know but one, though ſome ſay there
be more.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>September</hi> you will find the Maſt begin to fall
apace, then gather what Quantity you think good to ſow, and as
ſoon as your ſeeds be drye, make a Couch of Sand, as you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
directed for the Aſh, and ſowe them before the Moneth <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
be paſt; Keep them in the Couch moderately moyſt (not ſo wet
as you keep the Aſh) untill the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> then ſowe them
in a bed of light gravelly Earth, made on purpoſe: Or if you fancy to
ſowe them in your Woods, that is the beſt time; or you may ſowe
them in the Month <hi>September</hi> in your Woods: But if you keep them
in the Houſe all Winter, and ſowe them at the firſt Riſe of the Spring,
you will preſerve them from Mice and other Vermine the better;
they affect a gravelly light Soyl, and will not thrive on Clayes: If
you would make a Nurſery of them, your Ground muſt be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
or elſe they will thrive but badly with you.</p>
            <p>Of all VVoods that are, this may the beſt be pruned up; for it
growes over the place in little time, and is not ſubject to break out
ſide-boughs: It is fitting for Walks where the Ground is Natural
for it, but it is ſo nice in its ground, that I do think there are few
VValks of any great Length, but have ſome Veins of Ground it
doth not like.</p>

            <p>BEfore we come to Raiſe this Tree, or Gather the Nuts, there may
be theſe Enquiries made.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you will deſire to know what kind of Nut is likelieſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the beſt Fruit; and to know what Kinds will alter from that Kind
to a better (as moſt Kinds of Fruit will degenerate, ſome for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſome near the ſame, and ſome worſe) as alſo to know the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nut, or Nuts, and other ſorts of Fruits which will do ſo.</p>
            <p>As for the Kinds that are likelieſt to produce the beſt Fruit, and the
moſt likely to produce better, Obſerve to gather your Nuts, Stones,
or Kernels off from ſome young thriving Tree, that is in its Prime of
bearing, and hath the Kernels plump, large, and full, and of the beſt
ſorts; and if it be of Fruit that is too ſubject to Ripe late with us, then
let it be of the earlieſt Kinds, and as for the lateſt Kind, preſerve them
for Stocks onely: alſo if it may be, make choice of ſuch Fruit as is
lately produced from ſome other good Kind, and is better than the Kind
it came of; for you cannot expect to have as good an Apple produced
from the Kernel of a Crab, as you may have from the Kernel of a good
Pippin: for if the one bring you a good Wilding, and the other an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
either more large, or more beautiful, and as good, if not better,
and of different taſte, this is as much as can be well expected: for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth not run her Journey all at once, but makes ſeveral ſmall ones,
and many times more backward than forward, the better to encourage
Ingenious Men to try and obſerve her ways: but to thoſe that are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
ſhe often drops her bleſſings, and requites them well for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
And if you would obtain a bleſſing in you Works by Nature,
you muſt frequently be begging it of the great God of Nature, and by
his aſſiſtance and your diligence, you need not doubt accompliſhing
you Lawful deſires: Of this Truth doubt not.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his Natural Hiſtory, tells you of an Old Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that boughs of the Oak put into the Earth, will put forth
Wild Vines. I wiſh all ſuch Old Traditions were buried in the Earth in
room of the Oak-boughs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54356:38"/>
He tells us alſo of an Old Beech-tree cut down, the Root whereof
put forth a Birch, See <hi>p.</hi> 111.</p>
            <p>This moſt Learned Man, in his next page lays down ſix Rules
(though all, as he confeſſeth, untried by him) concerning the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
of Plants.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, if you would have one Plant turn into another, you
muſt have the Nouriſhment over-rule the Seed.</p>
            <p>The Second is, to bury ſome few Seeds of the Plant you would
change, among other Seeds.</p>
            <p>The Third is, to make ſome Medley or mixture of Earth with ſome
other Plants bruiſed, or ſhaven, either Leaf or Root.</p>
            <p>The Fourth is, to mark what Herbs ſome Earth does put forth of its
ſelf, and to ſow ſome contrary Seed in that Earth.</p>
            <p>The Fifth is, to make an Herb grow contrary to its Nature.</p>
            <p>The Sixth is, to make Plants grow out of the Sun, or open Air; as
in the bottom of a Pond, or in ſome great hollow tree.</p>
            <p>I might and could Anſwer to all theſe, but I think it would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious;
for I do verily believe, that to ſow Seeds any way that can be
deviſed by Man, will not in the leaſt cauſe them to be quite another
kind of Plant; for if you find any alteration, in any Plant that is, it is
from the Conception and Nativity of the Seed; for there is no real al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
but by Seed. I know that Plants or Trees may bring fairer,
or ſmaller Flowers, or Fruits according to the Ordering and Natural
Situation of the Ground, and the contrary: For it is in vain to think,
that the Kernels of an Apple will bring forth a Pear, or a Pear an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
or that Cherry-ſtones will produce a Plumb, or Plumb-ſtones a
Cherry: But if you ſow the Kernels of good Pears or Apples, &amp;c.
then you may expect good Fruit, and of different taſte, ſhape, or big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as is afore-ſaid; for I do believe all our ſorts of Pippins come from
one: the Burry-pear from the Green-field, the Pettit Rouſelet from the
Katharine, &amp;c. And ſo of Walnuts, or other Fruit; and what ſhould
be the Reaſon then we do not Raiſe as many new ſorts of Fruit as the
<hi>French?</hi> And though I do deviate a little from my intended Diſcourſe,
I ſhall ſhew you that we can do it as well as they, and I ſuppoſe better,
though we do it not; but before I proceed to give you further Judgment
of it, I will in ſome meaſure Anſwer my Querie, which was, to know
the very particular Fruit that will alter for the beſt: I do not affirm it as
true as the Goſpel, but onely conclude according to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is known by Experience in Flowers to be true; that ſuch
Flowers as differ in number of Leaves, in ſhape, in Colours, the Seeds
of ſuch will produce Flowers much different from the Ordinary Kind
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54356:39"/>
of Flowers, though produced all of one Flower but a Year or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
nay, a particular Flower among many others, of one Plant, ſhall
bring more double ones than twenty others that are not ſo qualified as
it: this is apparently known to all that take delight in Raiſing of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that the Stock-gilly-flower that hath Flowers of 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9
Leaves, that the Seed of ſuch a particular Flower or Flowers will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
more double ones than thoſe Plants that bring forth but four leaves,
Quantity for Quantity of Seed, twenty for one: You may know theſe
Flowers before they blow out in the bud; I confeſs this Flower doth
ſhew this by its Leaves more than any other I know; for this Flower
having no thrum in the middle, as the moſt of Flowers have, Nature
hath given it this Sign to inform Man, that thoſe that have a Leaf or
Leaves added to them more than their uſual kind, will bring forth
thoſe with many Leaves, and make a fine double Flower; which when
it hath attained to, it then is come to the bounds of Nature, which the
Almighty hath alotted it, ſaying, <hi>Thus far ſhalt thou go, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
for when it is thus a double flower, it never beareth Seed more,
but by endeavouring blows it ſelf to Death.</p>
            <p>If you be Curious, you may obſerve the ſame Rule in ſeveral other
flowers that have no thrum in the middle, as Auriculoes, Prim-Roſe,
Wall-flowers, Campians, and ſeveral others; and when you find on
Leaf or Leaves more than the ordinary number, you may conclude
there, Nature hath ſet one ſtep forward in altering from the ordinary
Kind; therefore if you be a Lover of Plants, or a Servant of Nature,
be diligent, and whenſoever you ſee your Miſtreſs ſtep out of Door,
then do you wait upon her to her Journeys end, for 'tis on the Diligent
ſhe beſtows her Favours.</p>
            <p>Alſo thoſe flowers which bear Seed when double, as the Gilly-flower,
<hi>Affrican,</hi> &amp;c. Sowing the Seed of ſuch double flowers, they will bring
you more and better flowers a hundred for one than ſingle ones; and in
ſowing the Seed of ſuch, you ſhall have ſeveral Varieties, but moſt
marked with the colour the Mother-plant was of; and ſome of theſe will,
as it were, run beyond the limits of Nature, and then they will break,
or have pods in the middle, and then never bear Seed more. Gilly-flowers
have their ſign, which will bear Seed, and which not: Thoſe
that will bring Seed (if Weather or other Accidents hinder not) have
their Hornes in the middle of the Flower.</p>
            <p>It is alſo obſerved in the marking of flowers, that the Seed of thoſe
that be ſtriped ſhall bring the moſt ſtriped ones, and ſome of different
Colours and ſtripes, their Seed all alike. But it may be Anſwered, that
this may be true in flowers, for none can deny it, but that ſuch flowers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54356:39"/>
will alter, and bring forth ſuch flowers as afore-ſaid: but can the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Fruit be known by the flower?</p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer, that you have not onely the Leaves of the flower,
but the thrum and the Fruit it ſelf, to inform you which will alter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the Shape, Colour, or Thrum in the Flower, you may know
which fruits will alter, and it is poſſible, which will alter for the beſt; for
it is commonly known, that fruit will alter from the fruit they come of,
by ſowing the Nuts, Kernels, or Seeds.</p>
            <p>Now, when you have made choice of your Seeds, Stones, Nuts,
Raiſe them as is Directed in each Chapter of the Kind, in good freſh
Ground, and by Midſomer that Year they will have ſhot ſo ſtrong, that
you may take off Buds of ſome ſorts, and of all ſorts the next Year,
having in readineſs ſome fine thriving ſtock againſt ſome good Wall, for
that will make the fruit ſet the ſooner when it comes to blow: At a fit
Seaſon bud theſe Stocks, if Pears on Quince-ſtocks; if Peaches, Nectrons,
or Plumb, on ſome large white Plumb-ſtocks, &amp;c. If they be Apples
or Walnuts, they may be from the Wall: bud your Apples or Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,
or Apple of Paradice (which is a ſort of Dwarf-ſweeting, and
will grow of Cuttings; if Walnuts, on a fine Young Walnut-tree, bud
it five or ſix foot high; this doth not onely alter the Property of the
Wild Kind, but it makes the Tree more Naturally bear fruit much ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and better, if well Ordered; your Pears, Plumbs, and Peaches will
bear in three or four years after, your Apples and Walnuts in five or
ſix years after.</p>
            <p>I know my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> tells you, that Peaches come beſt of Stones,
unbudded, but I adviſe you to bud all you Raiſe of Stones, Seeds, &amp;c.
though it be to take a bud off from the ſame ſtock, and to bud it on that,
as I have often done.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have great Grounds to look to, and good Ingenuity, let
them but put this in Practice, and I am confident they will find great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
therein, and in a little time Raiſe many new ſorts of fruit.</p>
            <p>Now, the Reaſon why in <hi>France</hi> they Raiſe more Varieties of fruit
and flowers than we do, is this: there are many Ingenious Men in their
Monaſteries, and there they being Seated as long as they Live, there
they Raiſe many fine fruits and flowers,</p>
            <p>Now, if our Noble Men that take delight in Gardens, as all that are
Ingenious do, would provide themſelves of good Ingenious Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and allow them good Encouragement, with aſſurance of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
in their Service ſo long as they carry themſelves carefully in their
Employ, and are faithful in their Place; this would certainly cauſe them
to improve their Places, much for their Maſters good and Profit, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54356:40"/>
their own Credit, or give them Patents for their Places, as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
does to the Gardiners he keeps, for which I hope none better ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
A good Cook can Dreſs you ſeveral Diſhes of Meat very well
in half a day, and if one miſcarry, they can in a little time make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but the Gardiner muſt have ſeveral Moneths or Years, to bring
ſome things to Perfection; and if He miſcarry, he cannot begin again
when he will, but he muſt wait his time with Patience; therefore he
ought the more to be careful.</p>
            <p>But for this Digreſſion I muſt crave your Pardon; and thus I have
ſhewed you, that it is not the mixing of Earth with other Plants, that
will make them change into ſuch Plants as you mix the Earth with, or
make the Plant alter to any purpoſe; for the main alteration of all Plants
is from their Seed; though it may be, mixing ſuch Plants or Shavings
with the Earth you ſow Seed in, may cauſe them to have ſome quality
of the Phyſical uſe of the Plant in them; as is the Opinion of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Miſceltoe on the Oak, and Polipody of the Oak, and Elder
on the Willow, &amp;c. do partake of the Phyſical uſes of thoſe Plants on
which they grow: for in Nature you may find, that many Bodies do
not onely by their Qualities Affect their Adjacents, but alſo infuſe their
Virtue into them, and endue them with the ſame faculty; as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
doth not onely attract Iron, but Communicates its Virtue to it,
and makes it Magnetical by touching, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall leave the Stones, and return to the Walnut-tree. Let
your Nuts be very Ripe, and when they begin to fall, then beat the
reſt off from the Tree, and lay them by, that the outward Husk may
Crack, then peel them, but do not waſh them, for wet doth make the
Kernel Crack, and Mould, and ſpoyls it: When you have taken off
the Husk, lay them thin to dry in ſome dry open Room, turn them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with a Broom.</p>
            <p>When they have ſweat, and are dry, about the beginning of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
put them into Sand a little moyſt, making it a little wetter about
<hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> for then they will begin to ſpear, and then will digeſt it:
Sow them not in their Husks, neither ſteep them, as ſome Adviſe. Set
or Sow them about the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> or beginning of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
in good freſh Ground, minding the aforeſaid Rules, and you ſhall
not loſe one in a hundred; and cover them about an Inch and a half, or
two Inches; keep them well Weeded on their firſt bed, and when they
have ſtood two Summers, then Remove them into other beds, ſetting
them about a yard aſunder, one Row from another, and about a foot
and a half one from another in the Rows: Cut the Tap-root and all
bruiſed Roots off, and the ſide-boughs, but cut not off the Head of a
Walnut-tree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:54356:40"/>
Keep them with digging, and hoing, and pruning up, till you have
got them five or ſix foot high, then bud them, it will make them bear
ſooner, and then you are certain of a good Kind; for I preſume you
will not bud them with a bad Kind, if you know it.</p>
            <p>If you do not bud them, let them Head about ſix foot high a year or
two, and then Remove them; but keep them not long in the open Air,
for the Roots being of a ſpongy Nature, will take in the Air ſo faſt,
that they will ſoon Mould, and Kill your Tree, therefore ſet them as
ſoon as you can, when once taken up.</p>
            <p>Remove them young off from the Seed-bed, as is before Adviſed;
for if you let them ſtand to be great on the place where they were firſt
ſowed, they will be much more dangerous to Remove, and not ſo likely
to thrive.</p>
            <p>The Ground they Love is a deep Soyl, and of a dry Nature, on a
ſharp Gravel, if the Ground be ſhallow, they will not proſper, but
if the Gravel be mixed with Loom, they will do well: They Love not
a ſtiff Clay, but if it be mixed Naturally with ſtones or Chalk, and not
too ſhallow, then they will thrive on it.</p>
            <p>It is a proper Tree to ſet in Woods, for it will run up (if the ſide-boughs
be taken off) to a great height, and yield very good Timber
for many Uſes.</p>

            <p>TOuching the Kinds of this Nut, there may be ſeveral, but I know

Increaſed.</p>
            <p>For the time of Gathering, Obſerve the ſame as before is ſaid of
the Walnut: When you have gathered them, and taken the Husks
off, lay them to dry and ſweat, but not too thick.</p>
            <p>Do not ſteep them in Water, as ſome Adviſe you, for it is not good
to ſteep any ſort of Seed, unleſs ſome Annuals, and to ſteep them is
good, eſpecially if lated in ſowing; but to ſteep Stones, Nuts, or Seeds
that are not of quick growth, watering them may Kill them, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Kernel ſwell too haſtily, and ſo crack it before the ſpear cauſeth

            <p>You muſt put your Cheſnuts (then) in Sand, a little moiſt, about

the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> and at the latter end or beginning of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>

ſet them by a Line, as you ſet Beans, or you may ſow them in drills,
as Beans, or you may ſow them where you intend they ſhall ſtand;
and in any of theſe ways or places keep them clean from Weeds the
firſt or ſecond year, then you may Remove them into your Nurſery off
from the Seed-bed: prune off the ſide-boughs and Roots.</p>
            <p>They are Subject to put forth many ſide-boughs near the Ground,
whereby they may be increaſed by Laying very eaſily, to do which,
ſee Chap. 5. But the beſt way is to Raiſe them of Nuts.</p>
            <p>Set them in Rows in your Nurſery, and Order them as is ſhewed of

            <p>The Soyl they Love is ſuch as the Walnut takes delight to grow
in.</p>
            <p>They be Excellent to ſet in Coppices or Woods; the Timber is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Uſeful, and they will grow to be large for under-wood; if the Tree
be much crooked, fell it, it will yield great ſtore of ſtrong ſhoots from

            <p>AS for the Kinds of the Sarvice, they may be many; there is one
whoſe Fruit is much better than the other, but whether it is the
Ground makes it ſo I cannot poſitively ſay. We have them grow at

            <p>I Know many will ſay, that it is not proper to rank this among For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt-trees;
but if ſuch did but ſee the fine ſtately Trees that we
have growing in the Woods at <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> they would then conclude
it proper for Woods; and if for Woods then for Forreſts.</p>
            <p>Where they like the ground, they make a glorious ſhew in the
Spring, their white Bloſſoms ſhewing at a diſtance as though they
were cloathed with fine white Linnen; their Bloſſoms are a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to the induſtrious Bees at that ſeaſon: the way to raiſe and order
them is as followeth.</p>
            <p>And firſt you muſt know, that the beſt way to raiſe them, is of Stones.
Let your Cherries be very ripe, for the riper your Cherry is, (or any
other Fruit) the plumper and better is the Kernel.</p>
            <p>The time they be Ripe is according to the kind, but it is the black
Cherry which growes common in Woods and Hedges about <hi>Caſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
which is the Tree fitting for VVoods, and therefore how to
Raiſe it I ſhall ſhew, though there be much difference in theſe alſo;
for we have ſome full as large and good as the <hi>Corowne,</hi> and at a place
called <hi>Red-heath,</hi> at one Mr. <hi>Baldwins,</hi> they have ſome ſorts not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the black <hi>Orleance,</hi> which are produced naturally from the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54356:42"/>
Stones, without Budding or Grafting, or any other help but the
Nature of the Ground, which indeed is very natural to them.</p>
            <p>They are ripe in <hi>July,</hi> and the largeſt ſorts are ripe lateſt; the
Fowls of the Aire will give you notice of their time of being Ripe, by
their viſiting them, which are as ſo many Meſſengers to awaken the
induſtrious to take care in time to preſerve them; and to the careleſs
man and Sluggard, to take that away from him which he will not take
care of: For, as the wiſeſt of men ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. <hi>The Sluggard will
not plow by reaſon of cold, therefore ſhall he beg in Harveſt;</hi> ſo he that
will not take care in time, ſhall want when others have. But we have
ſuch ſtore, that what the Jack-dawes, Jayes, Mag-pies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eat, they
are not miſſed with us; and though the Fowls do begin to eat them
as ſoon as they turn blackiſh, yet Nature hath tied them on ſo faſt to
the ſtalk, that they can but take off part of the fleſh, and leave the
Stone and reſt to feed the Kernel; for the wonderfull wiſe God hath
ordered moſt ſorts of Fruit ſo, that ſome by their bitter, ſower, or
other taſtes, are ſo well defended, that neither Bird nor Beaſt will
touch them till the Kernels be ripe, or near it, and then the fleſhy part
and Kernels alſo are pleaſing to their Pallats.</p>
            <p>When the Fruit is Ripe gather them, and have the fleſhy part
eaten off, or taken off, by rolling them in Sand that is drye, with ſome
heavy Plank upon them, drawing it too and again to take off the fleſh;
when you have ſo done, drye them for three or four dayes, then put
them into pretty moiſt Sand, and ſo keep them till the beginning of
<hi>February</hi> in houſe, and then ſowe them in a Bed of light gravelly
Mould; if your Bed be not naturally ſo, make it ſo; keep them clean
from weeds for two years, and then you may plant them in Woods,
Coppices, Hedge-rowes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in your Nurſery, to raiſe other Kinds
of, or there to ſtand till they be fit for walks; for where the Ground
is Natural, they be very proper for walks. The ground they like, is a
dry Soil, the bottom Gravel, the ſurface mixed with Loom.</p>
            <p>Or you may ſowe them on Beds as ſoon as you have taken the
fleſh off, and they will do very well, and come up the Spring fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
and then you may plant them at two years ſhoot, where
you pleaſe; but if you keep them too long out of the Ground before
you ſowe them, they will lie two Winters in the ground before they
come up.</p>
            <p>Note this, that all ſorts of Stone-fruit would be committed to the
Earth as ſoon as the Fruit is Ripe, the Fleſh taken off, and the Stones
a little drye: for all ſorts of Stone-fruit, if well kept, and ſown or ſet
in time, will come up the Spring after, but if you keep them too long
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54356:42"/>
out of the Ground, they then will ſtay till the ſecond Spring, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
never come up at all.</p>
            <p>At any time when you Remove a young Cherry-tree, you may
prune off his head cloſe, if you pleaſe, to one ſhoot; for they Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
grow taper and ſtraight: They are ſubject to increaſe from the
Roots of another Tree, but if you would help Nature in Raiſing of them
that way, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>It is a good wood to plant in Coppices, for it produceth a ſtrong
ſhoot, and it is (like the Elm) apt to put forth ſeveral young Trees
from the Roots of other Trees; but eſpecially if you fell a tree that
is not too Old, and it be in a light Ground: for then it will bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from the Roots of one tree, and ſo thicken your wood much. It
produceth great Trees in a light ground, that being the Soil it liketh;
but in a ſtiffe cold Ground it is not ſo ready to grow, nor bring ſuch
fine high taper-trees, nor increaſe ſo from the Roots, as it will on
light ground. Once I meaſured a Cherry-tree in <hi>Caſhiobury</hi> Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk,
firſt by the Quadrant, and ſo I found it 85 foot high; but for
more Exactneſs (being the Tree leant, by reaſon of another which was
blown upon it by a high wind,) I ſaw it meaſured by a Line let from
the top-ſhoot to the Ground, and it was 85 foot five Inches, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I think ſuch trees as this might well be accompted among Forreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees.</p>
            <p>When you tranſplant young Cherrie trees, do not ſet them too
deep; nor indeed no other ſort of tree, but eſpecially thoſe that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
run ſhallow, as all ſorts do that be ſubject to put forth young
Trees from their Roots, ſuch is the Elm, Abele, Sarvice, Cherry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This tree is wanting in ſeveral parts of this Land: But you that want
it, I would counſel you to get it as ſoon as your Ground is convenient
for it.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Raiſing and Ordering the Line-tree.</head>
            <p>THis Tree is called by moſt Herbals the Line-tree; or Linden, but
vulgarly the Lime-tree: But call it which you pleaſe, for I ſhall
not trouble my ſelf with the Etymology of the Name.</p>
            <p>Of this Tree there are but two Kinds, that I know, one of which is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54356:43"/>
the broad-leaved, and this ſhoots with a ſtronger ſhoot than the other;
the broad-leaved one is much to be preferred before the other, for the
aforeſaid Reaſons, and ſeveral others: of the broad-leaved Line we
have had, of late years, ſeveral trees from <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have raiſed ſeveral hundreds of Seeds of this ſort. The narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaved
Line growes plentifully in ſeveral places of this Land, as in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of my Lords Woods in <hi>Eſſex:</hi> This latter is harder to remove
with good ſucceſs than the former: the Reaſon is, becauſe it hath not
been ſo much uſed to be tranſplanted, therefore not ſo certain to grow
as the great-leaved; according to our old Proverb, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe makes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Authors tell you, that they are Male and Female, but there is
no ſuch thing in Plants; for both theſe Kinds bear ſeed, but it ripens
not every year with us in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may raiſe this fine Tree by Seed or by Laying, either way with
great facility, and great Increaſe: But of this, as of all other Trees,
to raiſe them of Seed is the beſt way: For my Honourable Lord, and
the Honourable Sir <hi>Henry Capel,</hi> have ſeen ſuch difference between
thoſe raiſed of Seed, and thoſe of Layers, that when they were Trees
of eight or ten years growth, they have often told me which was
raiſed from Seed, and which from a Layer; for that raiſed from ſeed,
much out-growes the other, and keeps its Taper-ſhape for ſeveral
years after they be planted out in Walks: The taperneſs of the Seed-tree
makes it grow as ſtraight as an Arrow; but this I adviſe you, that
when you gather the Seed, you mind to gather it off from ſome of the
broad-leaved Line-trees, and of thoſe that ſhoot with a ſtrong ſhoot:
But as I told you before, the Seeds do not ripen every year with us;
but you may know that, by cracking the husk or ſhell of the ſeed:
for if the Seed be good, it will lie plump and full under the husk, the
body white, if you bite it in two. But if the year be not kind for the
Seed, moſt of the Husks or Seed-veſſels will have nothing but a little
chaffie ſubſtance in them, and ſome few will have ſome ſmall lank ſeeds
in them.</p>
            <p>But to our Purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to raiſe them of Seeds, let your Seed be very
Ripe, which will be in <hi>October,</hi> gather it in a drye day, and after
you have dryed it about a week in an open Room, then put it in a
Couch of Sand, indifferent moiſt, ſo let it be kept till about the middle
of <hi>February,</hi> then ſow it under ſome Wall, on the North or Weſt-ſide,
in ſome good, freſh, Loomy ground, rather ſtrong than light; if there
come a drye Spring or Summer, keep them indifferent moiſt, and
ſtick ſome Boughs over them, to ſhade them from the ſcorching Sun,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54356:43"/>
eſpecially if they be much expoſed to it; keep them clean from weeds
there let them ſtand two Summers, and afterwards you may tranſplan
them into your Nurſery, and ſet them in Rowes, as you are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Walnut and other Trees before. Prune them up to one
ſhoot, unleſs you find ſome ſhoot or ſhoots that are fit to Lay, and
then, if you would increaſe a Stock, Lay them. This tree is very apt
to put forth ſhoots a little above the ground, and Suckers a little
within, ſo that it is very readily increaſed by Laying: Lay your Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
betimes, any time between <hi>Midſommer</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> as they
be ſtrong and fit to Lay: And in a Twelve-months time or little more,
they will have drawn Root fit to be tranſplanted into a Nurſery: Thus
by ſeed and Layers you may in a little time encreaſe enough for a
County, which when you come to have great ſtore, you may plant
ſome of your crookedeſt Layers in your Woods; they will produce
a large Stub, ſtrong ſhoots, grow well almoſt of any Ground, and are
very good Fire-wood.</p>
            <p>It is a Tree that loves pruning up well, for it naturally growes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
eſpecially thoſe which come of Seed; but if it ſhoot much, and
thrives apace in your Nurſery, then leave ſome ſide-boughs to check
the Sap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt by forcing it all into the Head, it ſhoot out ſo much
there, that it make the head too big for the Body, and ſo (being top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heavy)
make the Tree crooked: Now if ever you ſee your Trees in
ſuch a Condition, then immediately cut off the leaning ſide of the Head,
which when it is lightned of its heavineſs, and hath not long ſtood
crooked, it will then come ſtraight again; <hi>Midſommer</hi> time is the
time of this pruning, but do not force the Sap too much into the head,
leſt by high winds you have many of your Heads broke off. But of
this I have ſpoken before.</p>
            <p>My ingenious Lord was once too free in pruning up a parcel of thoſe
Trees; which I the rather acquaint you with, that you hereafter may
avoid the like; for the Ground was freſh and good, ſo that ſome by
their great Heads loſt them, and ſome grew crooked: But deſpair not,
for if you obſerve what I have ſaid before to make a crooked Tree
ſtraight, you may eaſily bring them to be ſtraight again, for they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
delight to grow as ſtraight as moſt trees doe; and if the Head
ſhould be broken off, (as very ſeldom it is, becauſe the Bark is ſo tough)
they will yet ſhoot with ſuch a ſtrong ſhoot, that they will in a little
time make a fine Tree again.</p>
            <p>You may (if occaſion be) tranſplant them pretty large, as big as
your Legge, but the ſureſt ſize is about two Inches Diameter, and
eight or ten foot high.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:54356:44"/>
But if the Tree was never Removed from the place where it was firſt
ſowed, then Remove it the ſooner; for if it be great, there's the more
danger in Removing it, and the topping of the Roots when removed
young, makes it break out near home, with many young feeding Roots
like a Maple: Therefore my advice to you that take delight to raiſe
Trees, is, to tranſplant any ſort of Tree while young, and to top the
Roots a very little; they will be much the better, and certainer to
grow when they are again removed, and will come forward much the
better: They that take this Advice, will find the profit of it in Trees,
which will the better encourage the practice of it.</p>
            <p>They will grow as well on any ſort of Ground, as any Tree I know,
but they like beſt a feeding Loomy Ground, which is not too wet, as
is before ſaid in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. where I have ſpoke ſomewhat of this fine
Tree, for Walks, Avenues or Lawns; This being a Tree I fancy for
the aforeſaid uſes, before any Tree we have in <hi>England,</hi> though I
know many do not love it that are Planters, becauſe it is not good Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and I grant it is not, but to vindicate what I have ſaid of it for
Walks, I ſhall lay down theſe following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. I doe ſuppoſe with my ſelf, that whoſoever is a Lover of
VValks, will not fell the Timber-trees in a ſtately VValk, while the
Timber is in its prime; for moſt Trees will continue many years very
Ornamental, after they be in their prime, even while they be fit for
no uſe but Fire wood; and why not the Line then for VValks as well
as any ſort of Timber trees?</p>
            <p>2. It will grow as well on different Grounds as any Tree I know,
which is a conſiderable encouragement to the ingenious Planters, to ſee
their Labours proſper.</p>
            <p>3. It will grow as great and as high, if kept with pruning up, as
moſt Trees we have: For the Greatneſs of it, I ſhall borrow the
words of the Learned <hi>Dr. Brown,</hi> which he writ to Eſquire <hi>Evelyn,</hi> as
he hath it in his <hi>Diſcourſe of Forreſt-trees:</hi> Chap. 29. pag. 82. His
words are theſe: <hi>An extraordinary Large and Stately</hi> Tilia, Linden
<hi>or</hi> Line-tree <hi>there groweth at</hi> Depenham <hi>in</hi> Norfolk, <hi>ten miles from</hi>
Norwich, <hi>whoſe Meaſure is this: The Compaſs in the leaſt part of
the Trunk or Body, about two yards from the Ground, is at leaſt eight
yards and a half; about the Root nigh the Earth, ſixteen yards in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
the heighth to the uppermoſt Boughs about thirty yards,</hi> &amp;c. This
is one of the Broad-leaved Lines, which how great and ſtately they
grow, you may obſerve out of this wiſe and learned Doctors Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
who commends this Tree with the Epithets of <hi>Large</hi> and
<hi>Stately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:54356:44"/>
4. It will laſt ſound long, as appeareth by the Greatneſs of its
growing.</p>
            <p>5. It is a Tree will ſoon grow over the places where you cut off
ſide boughs, and is not ſubject to put forth many.</p>
            <p>6. It is a Tree that naturally groweth taper and ſtraight.</p>
            <p>7. No Tree keeps ſuch a conſtant Pyramid-ſhape as this; the Heads
of other Trees growing of ſeveral ſhapes and Forms, though all of one
Kind, this keeps its Head as if it were cut, and the Body ſtraight.</p>
            <p>8. For Shade few better, having a thick Head, and large Leaves,
only it droppeth his Leaves too ſoon.</p>
            <p>9. The Bark of this Tree being tough, keeps its Head from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off by great Winds.</p>
            <p>10. It's a Tree that as ſeldom blowes aſide as any Tree whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
for it's matted Root and Taper-body preſerve him upright all
his Life-time.</p>
            <p>11. The Flowers are beautifull, the ſcent counted healthfull, and
breaketh out ſtrangely on the ſide of the Leaves, much different from
other Flowers of Trees or Plants.</p>
            <p>12. The ſhoots being of a fine red gloſſie colour, are very pleaſing
to behold in the Winter-ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>13. It is a Tree that ſeldom grows hollow in the Body, for it ſoon
overgroweth the wound, and ſo keeps himſelf ſound, both Body and
Limb.</p>
            <p>14. It is the beſt wood for Carving that is known.</p>
            <p>15. At laſt when he is dead, his Bark will make you Mattes and
Ropes, uſefull for ſeveral things.</p>
            <p>16. And laſtly, its Wood is a good, ſweet, free-burning Fire-wood:
the Charcoal made of it, is commended before all others for Gunpowder.</p>
            <p>Now put all theſe together, and judge if this be not a fine Tree for
VValks; but if you would have them ſhape themſelves finely, ſet them
two rod aſunder; if for a ſhady walk, what diſtance you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I fancy that a ſingle Rowe, to bound a Lawn round, ſet two or three
Rod aſunder, would be mighty obliging to the Nobleſt Senſe, for then
they would ſhew themſelves more clearly than when ſet in double Rows
to make VValks; or they would ſhew mighty well ſet thin on the ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a Hill, one topping another, with their curious natural ſhapes. And
ſo adieu my beloved Line-trees.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Raiſing and Ordering the Maple.</head>
            <p>THE Maple-tree is very plentifull in moſt places of <hi>England</hi>
where there are any Hedges or VVoods; but as for the Kinds,
I know but one ſort, though Authors tell you of more.</p>
            <p>It is increaſed, and doth increaſe it ſelf by Seed and Layers, and
from the Roots of Mother Old Trees, and by Suckers, which makes
it ſo plentifull.</p>
            <p>The Seeds will lie a year in Ground before they come up, therefore
you may order them as is before ſaid of the Aſh; you may increaſe
it by Laying (as is directed in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.) for to thicken your VVoods
or Hedges; but if you let it grow into Trees, it deſtroyes the VVood
under it; for it receives a clammy Honey-dew on its Leaves, which
when it is waſhed off by Rains, and falls upon the Buds of thoſe Trees
under it, its Clammineſs keeps thoſe Buds from opening, and ſo by
degrees kills all the wood under it: therefore ſuffer not high Trees or
Pollards to grow in your Hedges, but fell them cloſe to the ground,
and ſo it will thicken your Hedge, and not ſpoyl its Neighbours ſo
much.</p>
            <p>You may increaſe it from the Roots of an older Tree, as is ſhewed
in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. It is a good VVood to plant for under-wood in Coppices
and VVoods, for it produceth a good ſhoot, and thickens your VVoods.
it loves a dry Ground or Bank beſt.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Raiſing and Ordering the Sycamore.</head>
            <p>THis fine Tree is much out of Favour with a great many, for theſe
Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the Leaves falling upon their Walks, turn
into Soyl ſoon, and ſo ſpoyl them, breeding Graſs, and Weeds.</p>
            <p>And alſo that notwithſtanding its fine ſhade, it is not good to plant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54356:45"/>
them near Dwelling-houſes; for the Leaves in Summer-time being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to catch and hold the Honey-dew, do draw together ſeveral ſorts
of Flies, and (ſome ſay) amongſt them the Moth: if ſo, they be not
fit to be planted near Houſes and Gardens: the ſame fault hath the
King of Trees, the never enough admired Oak, and the Maple and
others.</p>
            <p>But granting this, yet let me deſire thoſe that have Woods and
Coppices in Parks, where Deer are eſpecially, to ſet ſome of this
Tree every Fall, in the open places, and that for theſe Reaſons: Firſt,
it is a wood the Deer will not ſoon harm, then it is a wood that bears
Keyes ſoon, and many, which will fall Early and come up the next
Spring; and being armed with a large Leaf, the weeds will not ſoon
choak them: On ſome Grounds that are dry and light, it groweth
faſt: It produceth tall, tough and good Timber for ſeveral uſes: It
groweth apace from a Stub, and is good Fire-wood.</p>
            <p>It may be raiſed of Seed, which is beſt, or by Laying, or by Roots:
Sow the Seed (not on too wet or ſtiffe Ground) as ſoon as it is Ripe,
and the next Spring it will come up; whereby on a little Ground you
may raiſe a great many Plants to ſet in your Nurſery; keeping them
clean from weeds by digging and pruning up every year, till you have
got them big enough for Walks, VVoods, or what you pleaſe. Thus
much at this time of the Sycamore, onely remember (as I ſaid before)
that it is a good wood to plant in Coppices and Woods.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Raiſing and Ordering the Hornbeam.</head>
            <p>I Told you but now of the Sycamore being fit to be ſet in Parks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Deer do not often Bark them; but of all Trees that I know
for that purpoſe, this is the beſt; for a Deer will ſterve before he will
ſo much as taſte the Bark of the Hornbeam, they do not love much the
very ſmall tops.</p>
            <p>This Tree may be raiſed of Seed, or by Laying; but by Seed is beſt,
though the young Seedlings be tender. The Seeds may be ſown at the time
directed for the Aſh; for it lieth a year in the Ground before it comes
up, and then you muſt look to keep it well ſhaded, or elſe it will ſooner
be gone than you think for: It naturally loveth to grow on ſtiffe ground,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54356:46"/>
where it will grow, and bring great Lops to the Owner, when the Tree
is but a very Shell, as indeed moſt Old Trees are hollow within; which
I judge not to be the Nature of the Tree ſo to grow, but the fault of
thoſe that look to them; for they have too many Maſters which be bad
Husbands, and no Friends to this Tree and many others, as the Elm,
Aſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who let the Lops be great before they lop them, perſwade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves that they have more great wood, which is moſt uſefull,
never conſidering that great lops do endanger the Life of the Tree, or
at beſt wound it ſo much, that many Trees decay more yearly in their
Bodies, than the yearly lops come to; and ſo indeed they do provide
themſelves with more great wood, though it be much to the Owners
loſs; though this Tree will bear great Lops when there is nothing but
a ſhell of a Tree ſtanding, yet the Aſh (if once come to take wet much
at the Head) it rarely bears more Lop after that the Body of the Tree
decayes: Therefore if once a Tree decayes much at the middle, it will
ſoon be little worth elſe but for the Fire: But in caſe you find a Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
tree decay (as is aforeſaid) down with it in time, for fear you loſe
your Timber, and alſo the Fire-wood be ſpoyled; but of this I have
ſpoken before, and would alſo ſpeak more, could I with words but
perſwade men out of this great Error: But our ordinary Husband-men
will vindicate Their Countrey-Husbandry to be better than the next, for
indeed Countreys do differ much in the ordering of Trees and Hedges,
and they as much condemn ours: for it is as hard to perſwade them out
of their ſelf-conceited Opinion and Tradition, as it is to make a <hi>Jew</hi>
turn <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This tree makes the very beſt Hedges of any Tree we have in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that ſheds the leaves, (I mean for Ornament:) for you may keep it
in what form you pleaſe, and it will grow very thick to the very Ground;
Therefore to make a private Walk, or to ſence in Avenues, at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
diſtance, without the bound-Range of Trees, or Walks; or
to hedge in Ridings, Cauſewayes, or to make cloſe Walks or Arbours,
this Tree is much to be commended; eſpecially on ſuch ground which
it likes: You may be better ſatisfied about this Tree at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
in his Majeſties Garden, which is kept by the ingenious Artiſt
and my good Friend Mr. <hi>Tobias Gatts:</hi> It is good Fire-wood, and
yieldeth good Increaſe both from Stubs and Pollards.</p>
            <p>It encreaſeth much by ſowing it ſelf, therefore you that love planting
get a few into your Plantations, and try whether they will thrive with
you or not; which doubtleſs it will on many Grounds where now it
is not, and ſo would many other Trees doe mighty well in VVoods
and Coppices, to thicken them, and make them the more beautifull,

eſpecially thoſe that increaſe from the running Roots, as the Noble

if you have them not, as Aſh, Sycamore, Line, Hornbeam, Maple,

of Forreſt-trees, <hi>pag.</hi> 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> with a Chizzel and a Mallet cut a
ſlit, almoſt as deep as the very Pith, under ſome Bough or Branch of
a well-ſpreading Birch: Cut it oblique, and not long-wayes, inſerting
a ſmall Stone or Chip to keep the Lips of the Wound a little open;
faſten thereto a Bottle, or ſome other convenient Veſſel appendant;
out of this Aperture will extill a limphid and clear water, retaining an
obſcure ſmack both of the Taſte and Odour of the Tree: thus may
you obtain this water. I will preſent you a Receipt how to make it,
as it was ſent me by a fair Lady (ſaith he.)</p>
            <p>To every Gallon of Birch-water put a quart of Honey well ſtilled
together, then boyl it almoſt an hour with a few Cloves, and a little
Limon-peel, keeping it well ſcumm'd; when it is ſufficiently boyled,
and become cold; adde to it three or four Spoonfulls of good Ale, to
make it work, which it will do like New Ale, and when the Yeaſt
begins to ſettle, bottle it up as you do other winey Liquors, it will in a
competent time become a moſt brisk and ſpirituous Drink, which is a
very powerfull Opener. This Wine may (if you pleaſe) be made as
ſucceſſefully with Sugar inſtead of Honey, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. to each Gallon of

of it. I know not whether the Quantity of the ſweet Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
might not be ſomwhat Reduced, and the Operation improved, but
I give it as Received.</p>
            <p>For Diſtempers in Man it is good for Cure of the Ptyſick, moſt

The Second is a ſort much like to this, both in Leaf and Shoot, which
grows in many places of this Land, and is in moſt places called the
white Popler.</p>
            <p>The Third is a ſort that hath the leaves and ſhoots more ſmall, and
not ſo white; it groweth in many places, and in moſt of them is called
the Aſpen or Aſp-tree: Theſe three ſorts are to be ordered all as one:
the other differs much both in the Nature of growing and ordering:
therefore a word or two of theſe.</p>
            <p>I never yet did Raiſe any of them of Seed, but I do believe they
have a Seed in that downy ſubſtance they ſhed in the Spring; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
naturally very much from the Roots, but they may be help'd
much by the Rules in the Chapter before, which ſheweth you how to
raiſe Trees from the Roots of another Tree; by which Rules, from
two of the <hi>Abele</hi> Trees my Lord had from <hi>Holland,</hi> I have raiſed above
a hundred: But if you fence in a place round the Tree, to keep Cattel
off, and keep down the great weeds a little, they will put forth many
young Trees from the Roots of an old one, eſpecially if you prune up,
or thin the Heads of any of theſe ſorts, they will then yield the more;
but if you do not value your Mother-tree, but deſire to get a great
ſtock of young ones, then you may fell the Mother-tree at the ground:
and if it be not very young, or old, the Roots will put forth in young
Trees, the Quantity of the Body and Head of that Tree: and ſo will
the Elm, Cherry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then how uſefull ſuch Trees are to ſet in the places
of VVoods that be thin, I leave you to judge.</p>
            <p>Though this Tree is none of the beſt of VVoods, beſides the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Properties, I can ſatisfie you it will grow and increaſe on the very
worſt of your grounds, as well drye as wet.</p>
            <p>You muſt forbear to head any of theſe three ſorts, unleſs young, or
that you leave ſome young ſhoots to draw up the ſap; except you are
minded to deſtroy the old one you head; for if the Lops be very great
it many times kills, or makes the Tree hollow; therefore lop young.
Some will tell you they grow of Chips, but that is falſe, they rarely will
grow of Cuttings.</p>
            <p>They are beſt in VVoods, though ſome adviſe you to plant them in
VValks; but they be not good for walks, for the Suckers they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from the Roots, will be troubleſome: The greater ſorts are proper
to ſet on the Eaſt, VVeſt, or North Proſpect, at a diſtance, in or by
the ſide of a wood; for their white Leaves ſhew finely when the Sun
ſhines upon them, and make fine variety with other Trees that have
dark green leaves. I commend them to you for to plant in woods of
barren ground; for there they increaſe much, and yield much wood:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54356:48"/>
And ſo I leave them, and come to the other, which differeth from theſe
both in Leaf and Shoot, and manner of growing.</p>
            <p>This laſt kind is in moſt places called the water-Popler; its Leaf is
a pale Green, ſhaped ſomething like the other, but it is not white be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
the ſhoot is of a yellowiſh green, this loves to grow by Rivers
ſides, or in Ground that is wet, or ſuch as holds water much: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you that have ſuch Grounds, get ſome of this Tree to ſet in them:
It will grow of Truncheons from two foot long to eight: the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the beſt to ſet for Stubs, the other you may make Pollards of,
for it is a good profitable wood, bringing a good Lop in few years,
and that on ſome Grounds better than the Willow.</p>
            <p>For your inſtruction in ſetting the ſmall ſetts, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. and for
ſetting thoſe of ſix, ſeven, eight or nine foot long, for to make Pollard-trees,
keep the lower end of your ſet, and alſo the upper, free from
cracks, and cut each ſloaping off; as for the bigneſs, let it be about
two or three Inches Diameter: If you make your hole with an Iron
Crow, make it big enough, that you do not thruſt up the Bark when
you thruſt them into the hole; or if you make them with a Stake, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the ſame; but if you fear the Bark to part from the wood, tie it
about the lower end with a piece of Wier, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet them about one
foot and a half deep; if great, deeper; or if you have a quantity to ſet,
and would ſet them well, then have an Auger made, ſomewhat like to
a Pumps, a little bigger than your ſets, ſo may you ſet your ſets in, and
ram the Earth cloſe to them; but however you ſet them, be ſure to
Ramme the Earth cloſe to them: I preferre the beginning of Winter
for the beſt ſeaſon, unleſs your Ground be very wet, then deferre it till
<hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you have ground that is wet and barren, and that you are
minded to plant, make Dreins two ſpade-deep, and a yard wide, and
at every two yards aſunder caſt up the Earth upon the two yards of
ground you left, and ſow it the firſt year with Oats, to mellow the
Ground, which may pay a good part of your Charge, if not all; the
next Winter ſet it with theſe ſorts of woods, Water-popler and others,
Alder, Willow, Withy, Sallows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in four or five years after
you may have a good Fall of wood, ſo may you have every five or ſix
year after, for many years.</p>
            <p>To encourage you, Eſquire <hi>Evelin</hi> tells you of an Abele that did
ſhoot in one year ſeventeen foot in length, and as thick as your VVriſt;
and alſo informs you of ſome VVillowes that have ſhot no leſs than
twelve foot in one year. Therefore to thoſe Gentlemen that have
wet or mooriſh Ground, which is bad and will not graſe well, do I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54356:49"/>
this good Husbandry, eſpecially where wood is ſcarce, and fells
well: The Charge to do this will not be great; and to ſatisfie you the
more, I ſhall here ſhew you, if you dig two ſpade deep, then there
will be but one third part of ground to dig; that is, to dig your Trenches
one yard wide, and leave two yards there to lay the Earth, and to
ſow one year, or to ſet the ſets as ſoon as you have made the ground
ready.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Raiſing the Withy, Willowes, Sallow, Oziers.</head>
            <p>THE Withy doth beſt grow on ground that is not very moyſt, but
yet the moyſture muſt not be far from him; as on the weeping ſide
of a Hill, where ſome Spring breaks out, or on Banks by Rivers or
Ditches ſides, or on Banks in your Mooriſh ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The VVillow loves to grow on ſuch like ground; both this and the
former are ſet in ſuch places as the Water-popler is, and of ſuch ſets
as it is; to make Pollard trees, ſee the Chapt. before of the Water-popler,
and Chap. 6. which teacheth how to ſet all ſorts of Cuttings;
Remember to keep them well fenced for two or three years, and to
cut off all the ſide-ſhoots, which they will be ſubject to put out below
the Head, and thin the head as you ſee it convenient, leaving not above
ſix or eight for Arms; ſo doing will make the body of your Tree ſwell,
and lay hold on the Ground the better.</p>
            <p>And as for the variety of Kinds of theſe and the following, I ſhall
not trouble my ſelf to inquire after; for I intend only to ſhew you how
to Raiſe them, not to deſcribe them, and if you know how to raiſe
ſome, you may then ſoon be able to raiſe them all: But there is one ſort
more which is called the ſmelling VVillow, which deſerves to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of; it ſhoots a great ſhoot, bears fine, broad, ſhining, green
Leaves, and will grow on moſt Grounds that are not too drye. It
bears a ſweet beautifull Flower, and worthy to be ſet in Orchards:
You that have Rivers run by your Orchards plant ſome of this, if you
have not, yet if your ground be moiſt, and pretty good, it will grow
mightily, and yield Ornament and Profit.</p>
            <p>It is eaſily increaſed of Cuttings, which if ſet as is ſhewed in <hi>Chap.</hi>
6. will grow every one: Only mind if your Ground have a dry Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
then ſet them on the North ſide of a wall; beſide the Beauty and
Smell, the induſtrious Bees love it much: It is as eaſily increaſed as
any Sallow, and bears as good a Lop, then endeavour to make it as
common. From one ſmall Plant I have Raiſed ſome hundreds, and
have ſet ſeveral in our VVood-walks at <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> where they grow
well notwithſtanding our dry Ground, but they were Rooted before
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54356:50"/>
I ſet them there: I commend the like Husbandry to the Lovers of
Planting: And to thoſe that are Lovers of that buſie Martial Creature,
for it's an Early Relief to them. It may alſo be very plentifully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by Laying, for if it be but covered with ground, it will
Root.</p>
            <p>Of Sallows there be three common ſorts; all of them love a moiſt
Ground, but that with the Round Leaf will grow on Banks, as in
Hedges; for if you ſet them for Stakes they will take root: And though
they be no very good Fence, yet they will yield good Profit: The
two other grow beſt on Mooriſh ground, and there will yield great
ſhoots, they will grow of Cuttings much, and may be increaſed well
by Laying; both which wayes you may thicken your VVoods very
much: but then you muſt keep out Cattel, eſpecially all Deer, for
two or three years and above. They may be raiſed by ſeed, as the
Elm is, ſome years, for the ſeed is not all years good with us, no more
is the Elm and Line: I have raiſed many of them of ſeeds in the
downy ſubſtance, but they be ſo eaſily increaſed by Cuttings and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that you need not trouble your ſelf to raiſe them of ſeed. It is
as profitable a wood for under-wood in Woods, as any you can ſet in
them for Fire, producing ſtrong and great ſhoots: Therefore, where
you ſtock up Trees in your Woods, ſet two or three Sallow Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons
with ſome other VVood that is ſubject to run, as Elm, Cherry,
Abele, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo may you have a thin wood made a thick good wood; or
if you have a Ground that is Mooriſh, and will not yield good Graſs,
then plant (as is before ſhewed) of the Water-popler, and it will yield
you quick and great Profit.</p>
            <p>If you would ſee more largely of theſe Sallowes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee Eſquire
<hi>Evelyns</hi> 19<hi>th</hi> Chapt. He tells you, you may graft Figs and Mulberries
on them, and that they will thrive exceedingly: The firſt is true, you
may graft on them; but you had beſt trye the other, for I fear 'tis bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from <hi>Pliny,</hi> &amp;c. but I forbear.</p>
            <p>Of Oziers there are ſeveral ſorts, and are all raiſed of Truncheons, as
the Sallow: They love a moiſter and more Mooriſh ground than the
Sallow or Willow. The Basket-makers know beſt the time to fell
them, which may be done any time in Winter, they muſt be kept well
fenced from Cattel, and thus I ſhall conclude of the Aquatick Trees.</p>
            <p>Only let me deſire all thoſe that have Mooriſh ground, and ſuch as
yields little Profit, (eſpecially where wood is ſcarce,) but to make
uſe of theſe ſure Directions, and I do engage you a great and certain
Profit.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Pine, Firre, Pinaſter, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THeſe ſtately Trees want more Reſpect with us than they have:
And there are three things which make it ſo: The firſt is Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in planting them; and that is, they miſs the right Time or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Year to ſet them, planting them when other Trees are
planted, as from <hi>November</hi> to <hi>March,</hi> which is the very worſt time
in the Year; but the beſt time to Remove theſe or moſt ſorts of Greens,
is, from mid-<hi>March</hi> to the latter end, or from mid-<hi>Auguſt</hi> to the
laſt, which are the very beſt times, unleſs for tender Greens, and I
ſhall not ſo much as name any of them.</p>
            <p>As to the Ground, they love not Dung, but a freſh gravelly Soyl
mixed with Loom, alſo mind but the Roots, and they will tell you,
that theſe ſorts of Trees muſt not be ſet too deep, therefore take heed
you commit not that fault to them; for if you look into <hi>Gerrards</hi>
Herbal, with <hi>Johnſons</hi> Additions to it, <hi>pag.</hi> 1364. you are there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by that laborious Author, that Firres grow on the tops of
Rocks in great plenty, and alſo large Trees in the cold Countreys of
<hi>Norway,</hi> &amp;c. and of Pines that grow in the cold Countreys beyond
<hi>Denmark,</hi> as in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> &amp;c. then certainly they may and will grow
here in <hi>England</hi> very well, if you will but mind to ſet and preſerve
them.</p>
            <p>Then a ſecond Reaſon why men do raiſe but few of theſe, and
plant but few, may be becauſe they love them not; and it is with other
men, becauſe they many times die, or do not grow well with them,
and this makes them not fancy them: But ſuch Men want good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and I hope I ſhall give them ſome that will make them again
in Charity with theſe fine Trees; but others there be that have ground
and fit places to plant Trees in, but mind them not; theſe men do not
love Trees, no nor themſelves, nor their Poſterity.</p>
            <p>The third great hinderance of planting theſe and other Trees is, there
are many men that love planting and improving of Trees, but are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by not having ground of their own convenient to plant in, and
if they Nurſe up or plant Trees for their Landlords, they many times
meet with but ſmall encouragement for ſo doing; for many times they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54356:51"/>
be turned out of their Farm before they come to perfection, or if there
be any that are come to be fit to fell, many times another man ſhall
have them as cheap as he that Nurſed them up in his Hedge-Rows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
or his Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>But I could and do wiſh that Owners would encourage their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
by allowing them ſo much Money for every Fruit-tree, and ſo
much for every Forreſt-tree they plant in their Grounds, and look to
them well till they be paſt Cattles ſpoyling them; this would help both
the Owner and his Tenant, and many a good Tree might be in waſte
places where now none is; this would make the Farm much better,
and pleaſanter, and ſo we might have more plenty of Fruit and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and Knowledge in Planting would be greatly improved.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe you ſhould plant on good Land, and in open Fields,
you would be no Loſer by it: As if you ſhould plant Oak, Aſh, or
Elm, in Paſture-ground, at three or four Rod aſunder, they would do
your Land no harm, nor would you loſe any ground, ſave only juſt
where the Trees ſtand; now it muſt be a good Tree that takes up
one yard ſquare, nay the Leaves and Shade may do your Cattel as
much good as may countervail the loſs of that Land; as if your Land
be worth 20 <hi>s.</hi> an Acre, that is not a Penny a Yard, as here I ſhall
ſhew; 160 Rod ſquare makes an Acre, and five yards and a half ſquare

            <p>But to our buſineſs, <hi>Johnſon</hi> tells you of ſome ten ſorts of Pines,
but I know but two or three in <hi>England;</hi> one is common, and is raiſed
of the Seed ſown in good ground, and in the ſhade, in the Month of
<hi>February:</hi> If it be froſty put it into Earth or Sand, and keep it in the
houſe till the weather be ſeaſonable; they will not grow of Cuttings,
nor Laying, well; they be bad to be Removed when old, becauſe the
Roots run far from the Body in few years, and if broke or cut off, they
will not readily break out at ſides and ends; therefore Remove them
young, at two or three years old, and at the times beforeſaid, and then
you may expect glorious ſtately Trees. None of all our green Trees
in <hi>England</hi> may compare with them: Prune them as the Firre: They
be fine to ſet round a Garden, or Bowling-green, for the Leaves will
not do any harm.</p>
            <p>Of Firre-trees we have two ſorts, they be eaſily Raiſed of Seeds
ſown as the Pine; one ſort will grow of Laying, or of Slips ſet about
<hi>Bartholomewtide;</hi> but then you muſt cut them one Inch or two from
the Body, and cut that Stump cloſe off the <hi>March</hi> following; and cut
all other Boughts that be needfull at that time, and you need not fear hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Tree, though my <hi>French</hi> Curate be againſt it.</p>
            <p>The beſt way to keep them is in Stories, about a yard between one
another, but do not cut their Ends as ſome doe, neither let them grow
thick on a heap, but if you keep them in Stories they will grow taper,
and you may take off ſome when you ſee Cauſe, and ſo help them up
to a great height, and ſtraight as an Arrow, for they naturally grow
in a good ſhape.</p>
            <p>Lay the Clogs before the fire, and they will gape, ſo may you take
out the Seeds the better. <hi>Pliny</hi> calls one ſort of Pine, the Pinaſter;

them on a Bed; the ground not too ſtiffe, keep them clean, and prick
them out of that Bed into your Nurſery, when they have ſtood two
or three years there, you may bring them to what ſhape you pleaſe: It
is a fine Tree and worthy to be more increaſed.</p>
            <p>Holly may be raiſed of the Berries, as the Yew, or by Laying; it
loves a Gravelly-ground, as moſt of our Forreſt-greens doe; it is a
curious Tree for Hedges, and will grow under the dropping of great
Trees: It well deſerves your love, yet is ſomewhat tickliſh to remove,
but the beſt time is before <hi>Michaelmas;</hi> if your Ground be ſtiffe and
cold, mix it with Gravel, but no Dung.</p>
            <p>Box the Engliſh and Edged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do grow well of Slips, ſet about the
latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or in <hi>March:</hi> It is very pleaſant in green Groves,
and in Wilderneſſes, though it hath a bad ſmell after Snow.</p>
            <p>Juniper is raiſed of the Berries; it is tickliſh to Remove, it is a
pretty Plant for the aforeſaid places; the Berries are very wholſome;
the Wood burnt yields a wholſome and pleaſant Perſume, ſo doth the
Plant in the Spring.</p>
            <p>Bayes is increaſed plentifully of Suckers; or you may raiſe them
of their Berries: They love the ſhade, and are fit to be ſet in green
Groves.</p>
            <p>Laurel, or Cherry-bay is increaſed by Cuttings ſet about <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewtide,</hi>
and in the ſhade beſt, or by the Cherries. It is a glorious
Tree for Standards on moſt Grounds, but on our coldeſt and openeſt
it holds out our hard Winters beſt: It may be kept with a clear ſtem
two or three foot high, and let the Head be kept round, ſo that if you
have a Row of them, the Trees all of a height and bigneſs, and the
Heads all of a ſhape, no Tree is more pleaſant: It is fit for Groves,
Wilderneſſes, Hedges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It will grow well on any ground, threfore

            <head type="sub">General Rules for planting Forreſt-trees in Avenues, Walks,
or Orchards, as in a Natural Ground.</head>
            <p>FIrſt as to the Ground, your Ground that hath been fed for many
years, Winter and Summer, as your common Paſture-ground, or
the like, ſuch Ground (if it be any thing good) is the Beſt: The next
is your Meadow-ground; and then your plowed Land, if your Land
be of Soyl alike. Thus I preferre them. Several Reaſons might be
given for this, but I ſhall inſtance onely in theſe few:</p>
            <p>As namely, your Ground that is conſtantly fed, hath likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
a ſupply of Cattels Dung and Urine, with the variety of Kinds,
which addes much to the ſtrength of the ground: and likewiſe your
Paſture-ground, though it abound with great variety of Herbs or Graſs,
according to the Nature of the Ground, as alſo your Meadow-ground
doth; yet your Paſture-ground hath not only a conſtant ſupply of Soyl
by one ſort of Cattel or other, but the Graſs which growes on it, doth
ſeldom run to flower or ſeed; which when they doe, they draw forth
much more of the Salt or Spirit or ſtrength of the Earth, as we find the
Herbs or Graſs on Meadow-grounds moſt commonly doe. Therefore
I judge your Commons the beſt; and both common Field Ground and
Meadow better than conſtant plowed Land; for that being kept with
plowing to prevent what naturally it would produce, this makes the
Ground the Better; for 'tis certain, that where your Houſes ſtand,
or High-wayes are, there the Earth is full of Salt and Spirit, or the
Life of Plants; not only becauſe there is often ſome Aſſiſtance of Soyl,
which I confeſs makes it much Richer, but alſo becauſe it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
thoſe Plants which naturally it would, were it not Reſtrained;
For ſtill it receives a conſtant ſupply from Nature, and as the Holy
Scripture ſaith, the Almighty <hi>cauſeth the Sun to ſhine on the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt as
well as the Juſt,</hi> ſo alſo hath the foreſaid Earth the ſecret Influence of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54356:53"/>
the Heavens, as well as any other, unleſs Accidentally prevented; but
this by the way.</p>
            <p>Now as for your plowed Land, 'tis granted to be much better for
plowing; but this being ſowen with Annual Grain, very much draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out the ſtrength of the Earth; for I judge that your Annuals are
much more drawing Plants than thoſe which will laſt ſeveral years, it
being in my Judgement with your Annual Plants, as it is with a man
which hireth a Houſe for a Year, when his year is out, he knowing
he muſt remove, cleareth the Houſe, eſpecially of his own; when as
your Durable Vegetable, (like a man whoſe houſe is his own) is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to its ſituation, having a kind of ſecret Knowledge (as I may
ſay) that there they and theirs may continue many years.</p>
            <p>If this be underſtood, I hope you then will ſay with me, that your
common Paſture is beſt to plant on; next to that, Meadow, then
plowed Land; that is, if all three be of equal goodneſs and ſoyl.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of planting Forreſt-trees to make Woods, or to fill up Naked
places in Woods, where they want.</head>
            <p>TO tell ſome men of planting of Woods, is very needleſs; for there
are too many men more inclined to ſtock up than to plant them;
but I ſuppoſe the greater ſort of Men, and I am ſure the beſt ſort, are
more inclined to preſerve and plant, than to deſtroy and ſtock them up.
To thoſe then that love either their Countrey or themſelves, or eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
their Poſterity, and have any kindneſs for ſtately Forreſt-trees,
do I give this Advice.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let the Ground be of what Soyl ſoever, be ſure to plant moſt
of ſuch Trees as will grow beſt on that Soyl; As if it be Gravel, then
Beech, Holly, Haſel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if mixt with Loom, then Oak, Aſh, or
Elm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if ſtiffe, then Aſh, Hornbeam, Sycomore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if a light Loom,
then moſt ſorts; and withall, have an eye to the adjacent Trees, and
which ſort ſoever you ſee thrive beſt, be ſure to furniſh your Ground
with ſtore of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If your Ground be moyſt, then ſet in good ſtore of the
Cuttings of Alder, Willow, Sallow, eſpecially the two laſt on any
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54356:54"/>
Ground; for if there comes a wet Spring, or a moyſt Summer, many
of them will grow, and produce good under-wood, if ſet as is directed
in the 26<hi>th.</hi> or 27<hi>th.</hi> Chapters. Though the Ground be drye, and a
Gravel-Bottom, yet they will thrive and produce good ſhoots in a
little time, as I have found true at <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you be minded to ſow ſeeds, then you muſt prepare
your Ground with a good Tillage before you ſow your ſeed, as much
as you doe for ſowing of Barley; and having all your Seeds ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
(by being kept ſome time in a Houſe till they be fit to ſpear, or
ſpeared a little) then about the beginning of <hi>February</hi> ſow them: The
particular Chapter of each Kind will tell you how long it is before they
will ſpear: If you plow your Ground into great Ridges, it will make
the Earth lie the thicker on the top of each Ridge, and there the Roots
will have the more depth to ſearch for Nouriſhment, and the Furrowes
will in little time be filled up with Leaves, which when rotten, will
lead the Roots from one Ridge to another.</p>
            <p>If your Ground be very drye, then plow your Ridges croſs the
deſcent of the Hills, not to drayn the water off, but to keep it on your
Ground; and if your Ground be very wet, then the contrary.</p>
            <p>But be mindfull to ſow moſt of thoſe ſeeds your Ground is moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
for. The moſt of theſe ſeeds following may be ſown on your
Ground: Oaks, Aſh, Beech, Sycomore, Hornbeam, Crab or Apple,
Cherry, Walnuts, Cheſnuts, Holly, Haſel-nuts, Maple, Sarvice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Which of theſe you find are not Natural for your Ground, neglect
them. Some do ſow their Seeds with a Crop of Barley, but the ſeaſon
of ſowing of Barley is too late for your ſeeds, if they be prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand;
but if you will be ſo ſaving as to have a Crop of that
Tillage, then ſow your ſeeds with Oats, for they may be ſown with the
ſeaſon of your ſeeds: Do not ſow your Oats too thick, and they may
do well; but the beſt way for your ſeeds, is to ſow them without any
Crop of Corn.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you are minded to have a Wood ſoon, then plant it
with Setts, and if your Ground be a good Natural Ground for Trees,
then you may make only holes two foot wide, and as much deep, and
about half a Rod aſunder, ſo there will be four holes in every Rod
ſquare. But for fear my Reader ſhould be at a ſtand here, and ask me
how four Trees may ſtand in a Rod ſquare, or four holes made in a
Rod ſquare, and yet the Middles be each half a Rod, or eight foot and
¼ aſunder, I ſhall here ſatisfie him by Example; and it ſhall be of a
ſuppoſed piece of Ground three Rod ſquare, you may make your holes
ſquare if you pleaſe. <hi>(See Figure 1.)</hi>

Foot ſquare, or half a ſquare Foot, moſt? When as I
have heard ſome ſay, they were both alike, but it was
their Miſtake.</p>
            <p>For, ½ a Foot ſquare is only 6 Inches every way, that is,
6 times 6 is 36, and 6 times 36 is 216 Inches; when as
half a ſquare Foot is the half of a Cubical ſquare foot, the
number being 12 the ſquare Root is 144, for 12 times 12
makes 144, and 12 times 144 makes 1728, the Cube,
Now the half of 1728 is 864, which is half of a ſquare
Foot, then if you divide 864 by 216, you will
find 4 for the Quotient, ſo that half a Foot
ſquare is but ¼ of half a ſquare foot. This I
have demonſtrated as plain as I can, that I
might be underſtood by every Countrey-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
            <p>Now if you were to plant one Acre of Ground after the aforeſaid
manner, the Charge would be as followeth: If it be a good digging
ground, you may have 20 holes made for 12 <hi>d.</hi> two foot wide,
and two foot deep; ſo there would be four times 160
holes, which is 640 holes, at 20 for 12 <hi>d.</hi> that is 32 <hi>s.</hi> and<!-- <LIST>

            <p>So that the Charge of one Acre of Ground planted this way, will coſt
you about 2 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> where Work-men and Sets may be had at ſuch a
price; the Spring after, I adviſe to ſow Acorns, Sycamore-Keyes,
Apple and Crab-ſtampings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let this ſowing be done ſo oft as you
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54356:55"/>
find Stampings and Keyes to be had, till you find your Wood very
thick. I did ſow all the Stampings of Apples and Crabs at <hi>Caſhiobury</hi>
among our young Woods which I had ſet, and the Ground not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
a ſtrong Graſs to choak them, they came up thick, and did
well: But take care you let them not lye too thick long, for if you
doe, the ſtampings will heat, and kill the Kernels; ſow them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as ſoon as they be preſſed, or elſe lay them thin, or keep them
parted with dry ſtraw.</p>
            <p>But if your ground be bad, and a ſhallow Soyl, or that you would
help an indifferent ground, and are willing to be at ſome more Charge
to do it, then do thus, which in ſmall time will pay you or yours well
for your Charges.</p>
            <p>Obſerve which is the Beſt way to lay out your ground, and then
divide it into four yards diſtance at both ends, by little ſtakes, and
make Rowes of ſtakes by ſetting up ſome few between the two at each
end, which are only to direct you to lay your work ſtraight, by plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one yard of each ſide your Stakes: If your Ground be Green-ſorde,
then plow it as is aforeſaid, which will make the better for the
Roots of your Trees to run in.</p>
            <p>Thus having plowed two yards, and left two yards unplowed all
over your Ground, a little before the ſeaſon for planting, and when
the ſeaſon for ſetting is come, (that is, as ſoon as moſt of the Leaves
are off,) having prepared Sets and Work-men, let them dig up the
two yards that are unplow'd, laying one half of that Earth upon one
of the plowed pieces, and the other half upon the other; and as you
lay up that Earth upon the plowed pieces, there ſet your Setts about
a yard one from another, with ſtore of Sallow-Cuttings with them,
digging that ground which you lay on your plow'd Ground a good ſpade-deep,
and then it will be near a foot thick to ſet your Setts in. Thus
goe from open (that is, unplow'd) to open, untill you have ſet all the
plow'd pieces in your Ground: One man having the Setts ready, will
ſet them as faſt as four men ſhall dig, that is, two men on each ſide
the Beds or Ridges, one a little before the other, ſo finiſh Bed after
Bed till you have gone over and finiſhed the whole Ground which you
deſigned to plant that Winter; and endeavour to get all your planting
done by the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> or beginning of <hi>February;</hi> for this
Reaſon, that is, having provided Keyes, Nuts and Seeds, as is before
directed, (and is in each particular Chapter more fully diſcorſed)
about that time ſow them, <hi>Viz.</hi> about the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be a Froſty ſeaſon, for then you muſt ſtay a little longer; ſo ſow
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54356:55"/>
all your Beds over with ſeed, and cover them a little with the ſhovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of ſome neighbouring Ditch.</p>
            <p>In doing thus, you may be certain of a good thriving Wood in a
little time, though the ground you plant on be (almoſt) never ſo bad.
This I doe ſuppoſe to be as good a way as moſt are for planting of
Woods.</p>
            <p>Therefore, according to the Latine Proverb, <hi>Serere ne dubites,</hi>
Doubt not to plant; and I wiſh I could perſwade Noble-men and
Gentlemen that have Ground that is not very good for Corn or Graſs,
to plant it with Wood; eſpecially in thoſe Countreys where wood is
ſcarce: I dare inſure them, that it would be to them or their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
a very great benefit, and alſo a great Ornament to their Naked
Grounds.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall endeavour as near as I can, to give you an Accompt what
the Charge of this may be; which, did I but know your Ground, and
what wages your Work-men in ſuch places have for one dayes work,
I could then do more exactly.</p>
            <p>But we will ſuppoſe the Ground to be a good digging Ground, that
may be afforded to be digged and laid up for 4 <hi>d.</hi> the Rod-ſquare,
and our Example ſhall be of one Acre of Ground, of which you may
well perceive by what is before ſhewed, there will be but one half
plowed, and that half planted.</p>

Thus have I ſhewed ſome wayes for the planting of Woods, and
alſo what Charge it will coſt you, though I have ſpoke of the loweſt
Rates that good digging Ground can be done at; and where men work
for 10<hi>d. per</hi> day, yet if you love planting, and your Ground be a
bad Ground to dig, (as a Gravel or ſtiffe Clay,) and that your Sets be
ſcarce, or that you be minded to plant more in your Ground (which
will be the better) then if you allow as much more to each Acre, the
Charge may be computed accordingly, and you will find it not to be
great.</p>
            <p>There are more wayes to plant Woods, but theſe I take to be the
beſt; or thus, inſtead of making your Holes Round, you may make
them a long ſquare, and the holes will be the eaſier to make after this
way. <hi>(See Fig.</hi> 2.)</p>
            <p>This that hath been ſaid, I hope will be ſome ſatisfaction to thoſe
that love planting of Woods, and are to ſeek in the wayes; which if
it be, I then ſhall be well ſatisfied, for my deſign is a General more
than a Particular Good.</p>
            <p>Now having finiſhed your Wood, take care to keep it well fenced
from Cattel of all ſorts, and when it is about ſeven or eight years
growth, then fell it, pruning up thoſe to a head you are minded to
leave for Standards, leaving half as many more as need to ſtand, for
Timber-trees, as Oak, Aſh, Elm, Beech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> felling the reſt at the
Ground, not flat off, but well ſloped up; And if you have Popler,
Abele, Cherry, Elm, Sarvice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will ſpring much from the Roots,
and thicken your Woods; if not, ſet ſome in.</p>

Ornament and Profit, and ſome for Ornament, Profit and a Fence.
Juniper I take to be one of the beſt for to make a low Hedge, of any
Plant or Tree we have growing in <hi>England;</hi> for it growes naturally
very thick, is a ſlow grower, and hath alwayes a fine freſh green
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54356:57"/>
Colour, and the ſevereſt of our hard Winters will not make it change
his Countenance; I confeſs it is ſomething tickliſh to be Removed,
for its being not uſed to ſtirre far from home makes it many times
loſe its way, and its Life too, if led far from its native place, at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
times, or by an ignorant Guide, and put into ſuch an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
as is not ſuitable for it to Live in. I have with good ſucceſs
removed it above Thirty miles, namely, from beyond <hi>Caſhiobury</hi> to
<hi>Little-Hadham;</hi> there I made my Ground (notwithſtanding it was
naturally a ſtiffe Clay) by mixing it well with Gravel and Sand: I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
it a little after <hi>Bartholomewtide,</hi> and I did not loſe one Plant
in ten, but they do flouriſh in two little Hedges moſt gallantly.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpeak of that moſt healthfull Aromatick Seed which it
beareth, nor of the uſe of this Cedar; but if you would be further
ſatisfied, ſee Eſquire <hi>Evelins</hi> Diſcourſe of <hi>Forreſt-trees,</hi> or any Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.
I have not as yet raiſed any of it of Seed, but I am now making
a tryal, which if they once come to endure Removing while young, I
doubt not but then they will be better to Remove when old.</p>
            <p>Holly makes a moſt ſtately and beautifull Hedge; and had we but
ſtore of the White-berried Holly to mix in the Hedge with the Red,
it would make it the more Ornamental. Its Ground that it moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to grow on, is, drye and gravelly: See more in the <hi>Chapter</hi> of
Holly: Or had we but ſtore of the ſtrip't to make Hedges with, it
would be very Noble indeed.</p>
            <p>Hornbeam may be kept in a good ſhape for a high Hedge, and very
thick, even to the ground. It is (alone) one of the very beſt home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
natural Forreſt-trees that ſhed the Leaf, to make a Hedge of;
and is ſenceable, unleſs againſt the rudeſt ſort of Cattel.</p>
            <p>Box maketh a good Hedge, and laſting; I mean the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though
the others are pretty for Hedges, both the Gilded, and the Dwarf;
but theſe two being not proper to name, or to diſcourſe of among
Forreſt-trees: I ſhall only name them and many other ſorts, and ſo
paſs forward.</p>
            <p>Laurel, (as we call it,) or Bay-Cherry, makes a good Hedge, and
if well kept, very fine Standards. Hard Winters do pierce it on ſome
Grounds, but on moſt it is durable; it is eaſie to increaſe, and will
grow well on moſt Grounds; Keep it but down, and it will grow ſtrong
below, and thick, and then make a very fine Hedge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arbutus,</hi> or Strawberry-tree is a Curious Plant for a Hedge, onely
it is very tender, eſpecially while young; for, the Leaves being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
whileſt Life laſteth, and of a fair Green, finely dented about the
Edges, and its pretty white Flower in Summer, with its Strawberry
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54356:57"/>
on, the beginning of Winter, all together adde a great deal of grace
to this Plant.</p>
            <p>Cypreſs would make fine Hedges, but for two faults; for firſt, in
in ſome Grounds it is tender, and will not abide our hard Winters.
And Secondly, it doth not love to be headed, for that makes it ſtill more
tender: Cut it not late in Summer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mezereon</hi> or <hi>Dwarf-bay,</hi> both the Red and White together
make a pretty low Hedge, and ſhew very beautifully Early in the
Spring.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alaternus</hi> or Ever green Privet makes a fine thick green hedge, it
would be ſupported with a Frame, eſpecially while 'tis young.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pyracantha</hi> or prickly Corall makes a good thick Hedge, and a
very fine ſhew when it is full of its fine Red berryes, which appear
like Beads of Red Corall among the dark green Leaves. It likes our
Entertainment ſo well, that it will grow well on moſt Grounds; our
Winters diſturb it not, and 'tis very eaſie to be multiplyed or increaſed
by Laying or Cuttings.</p>
            <p>They that have ſtore of Ground, and are Lovers of Plants, I hope
will not be without theſe few named, and many more that will be very
acceptable; but they be not ſome of them ſo proper for Hedges: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more there be that would make very fine Hedges for pleaſure, if
well kept, as the double-bloſſom Cherry, the <hi>Laurus, Tinus</hi> or wild
Bay, Primme, Savin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe few are only for Ornament, and make (any of them) fine
Hedges alone, or you may mix them with Judgement, and they will
then be very pleaſant.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew you a few of thoſe that are for profit and Ornament;
ſuch are the Summer-Pears on Quince-ſtocks; for that makes them
the more Dwarfiſh; Cherries make a fine Hedge, but eſpecially the
ſmall-leaved, as the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> great Bearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Plumbs, Quinces, Codlins, Barberries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe make fine
Hedges, but muſt have Supporters: In the three laſt there is this fault,
that the better they be kept, I mean the handſomer, the worſe they
will bear. But I am got two ſteps too far into the Garden, and now
I ſhall give you an Accompt of ſuch as are proper to fence in your
VVoods, Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the ſcope of my Diſcourſe; for
ſuch are both profitable and pleaſant, though not ſo Ornamental as the
other before; and if you would make a Fence of one particular ſort of
Wood, the very beſt is your White-buſh, or White-thorn.</p>
            <p>Your Crab-ſtocks make alſo a ſtout ſtrong Fence; and if you leave
at every twenty foot one to run up, keeping it with pruning till it is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54356:58"/>
five or ſix foot high, and then graft it with Red ſtrakes or other good
Syder-fruit, ſuch a Hedge would be very pleaſant and profitable: You
may ſo order your Stock and Tree whileſt they be young, that by
pruning you may have the head of your Tree to hang into your Ground,
a little over your Hedge: Let me deſire you to make ſuch a Hedge
where you have occaſion to make one: As for your Stocks they are as
eaſie to raiſe as Barley, and they are as certain to grow on moſt ſorts
of Ground, as any one wood I know.</p>
            <p>For common and publick Fences there is none to compare with
theſe two, for certainty of growing, for a thick, ſtrong, and an armed
Fence.</p>
            <p>Black-buſh makes a good ſtrong Fence, but it hath one Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that is, it will not keep within its bounds, but will run very
much into your ground, and there be very troubleſome to keep out:
Therefore if your Fence be for Wood, it may do well, for the Reaſon
aforeſaid: Alſo when you plaſh it, it will often be ready to die, by
Reaſon that it ſhoots ſo much from the Root.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed you ſome ſorts of Woods to make your Hedges
with, I ſhall now give you ſome Directions how to make them; and
here obſerve that for all thoſe which are for Ornament only: You
muſt prepare a Border by good digging and clean picking it from
weeds, adding ſome good Natural Earth, ſuch as the Kinds you ſet
do moſt naturally grow in, which let be well prepared againſt the
ſeaſon for planting, and then make uſe of your time: The greateſt ſort
may be ſet about a yard one from another, ſuch as your Holly, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the other about two foot or leſs, ſuch as your Juniper,
Mezereon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let this be the moſt, but if you have ſtore of
Plants, ſet them thicker, be ſparing in heading moſt ſorts of
Greens.</p>
            <p>For thoſe that are for Ornament and Profit, the Ground muſt be
made good, trenched deep, and mixt well with Dung; they may be
ſet about ſix foot aſunder. You may make very curious Hedges of
Pears, Cherries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I am too far got into the Orchard or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
I muſt retreat to my Forreſt-trees, to ſhelter me from the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners
Anger.</p>
            <p>Of thoſe ſorts that are for Ornament, Profit, and for Fence, I have
told you that there are two peculiar ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> the White-thorn and
the Crab; which are indeed the moſt proper to fence in our Forreſt-trees,
and woods, of any I know. I know moſt Hedges, which are
mixed with many ſorts of wood, are apt to come too faſt, without
planting Sets of White-thorn, which in moſt places are plentifull to be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54356:58"/>
had; bur if you would Raiſe them of Haws, order them as is ſhewed
of the Cherry or Yew-berries.</p>
            <p>Now to Raiſe your Crab or Apple-ſtocks, (though the Crab-ſtocks
are better than your Apple-ſtocks, for the Crab grows more rugged,
ſtrong, and is more laſting, but Stocks raiſed of Apple-kernels will
do well) let your Ground be well prepared by Digging, and picking
it clean from weeds; mix it with ſome good rotten Dung, then when
the time is, that they beat their Crabs for Verjuice, or Apples for Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then prepare your ſelf with ſo many as you think are convenient
for your Ground, and as ſoon as they be ſtamped, ſow them if you
can, for if they lie long in the Stampings, that will heat and ſpoyl
your Kernels: Therefore if you have them to fetch far, or that you
cannot ſow them inſtantly, then let them be ſifted from the body of
the Apple, and ſpread thin, or mixed with drye Sand, till you have
opportunity to ſow them; or you may keep them in Sand (the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
I mean) a little moyſt, till <hi>February,</hi> and then ſow them; but
be ſure your Ground be well prepared before-hand with good tillage,
and clean picking; cover them about one Inch, or a little more, with
fine Mould; afterwards, when they come up, keep them conſtantly clean
from weeds; Remembring if you ſow at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> that you take
care to keep Traps ſet, for fear Mice rob you of your Kernels. Thus
may you Raiſe what Quantity of Stocks you pleaſe, which at two
and three years old you may ſet where you would have them to ſtand,
for to Raiſe Trees, or to make Hedges for fenceing in your Ground.
Keep them clean from Weeds by Digging or Hoing.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewed you how to furniſh your ſelves with ſtore of
Stocks in a little time, which will make you as ſtrong and good Fences
as moſt wood whatſoever, and are very profitable too, both to yield
good Liquor for Drink, and to bring good Fewel to the Fire; I ſhall
now ſhew you how to plant theſe Quickſets, both for Hedges with
Ditches, and for Stant-hedges (as ſome call them) without
Ditches.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Strain a Line where the inſide of your Ditch muſt goe, next
your Hedge, then mark along by the Line, ſloping, as you would have
the Bank of your Hedge to ſlope, then ſtrain the Line on the other
ſide of the Ditch, and mark it out ſloping inward to the Ditch, as you
did the other ſide: For Example, ſuppoſe you make your Ditch a yard
at the top, and three ſpade or a yard deep, let it ſlope ſo on both ſides
that it may come to a foot wide at the bottom, but let the Hedge-ſide
ſlope the moſt, then if your ground be Green-ſword, and ſtiffe Land,
with a Turing Iron take all the Turf off the breadth of your Ditch,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54356:59"/>
then cut out a Triangle-piece all along next the bank, turn hat upſidet
down, for to make the ſlope of your bank; Lay ſome of the Turf you cut
off, or all of it, on the back-ſide of that Triangle-piece; thereon ſet one
Row of Quick, covering the Roots with Crumbs of Mould, the Ditch
one yard, and the Bank a yard, as you may ſee in <hi>Figure</hi> 3. where A. is
the Triangle-piece cut out of the Ditch, B. the piece laid on the Bank,
with the Turf laid graſs-ſide downward, and the Set on the top of that
piece, then level up the Bank till it comes level with the top of the
piece B. and then lay on ſuch another Angular piece, and on the top
of that a Quick-ſet, as the other, then level up as before, and ſet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Angular piece, with the Quick on the top; ſo have you three
Rowes of Quick-ſet, which let ſtand about one foot from another in
each Row, and if your Ground or the Bank be dry, ſet them a foot
deep, and if you will you may ſet one row on the top of the Bank; but
three Rowes ſet each againſt other, open, triangle, make an excellent
Fence; if ſet as is aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>(See Fig. 3.)</p>
            <p>And note, that the higher and larger you make your Bank, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your Quick will grow; for this Paradox is true in planting, That
the more you ſpend, the more you ſhall get; but if your Ground be
a light Soyl, then you need not take off the Turf from the triangle-pieces,
becauſe the Turf will make ſuch Ground hold up the Bank
the better; but then it will grow out at the edge of the Angle, and
ſo will trouble you the more to weed your Quick; and beſides you
will want it to lay in the midſt of your Bank, which would feed your
Sets much, and make them grow the better.</p>
            <p>But if you would make a Stant-hedge without a Ditch, the uſual
way is, to dig a Trench about a foot and a half wide, therein ſet two
or three Rows of Quick, which on good Land may prove indifferent
well, but if your Ground be bad, or that you would make it grow
and proſper well on any Land, then dig a place where your Hedge
muſt ſtand one yard wide, and make a Bank with Earth one yard
high, being one yard at the bottom, and narrowed by degrees to a foot
at the top; ſet two Rows of Sets on each ſide this Bank, as is ſhewed
before about planting the Bank by the Ditch; or you may make this
Bank two foot wide below, and two foot high, ſetting one Row of
Quick on each ſide, and one on the top, as is before directed; and
ever obſerve, that the larger you make your Banks, the better your
Sets will grow, as is before noted.</p>
            <p>You may, if your Fence be near to an High-way, have Earth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
from thence to make this bank, which will be a little fence of it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54356:59"/>
ſelf, and help the growth of your Sets much; or you may ſlope off
your ground a foot deep by this Bank, and ſome ten foot off come
out to the Level of the Ground; there may you furniſh your ſelf with
Earth to make the Bank, plowing or digging up that ground where
you took off the Earth, adding a little Dung to it, which you may
ſowe in the Spring with Corn or Hay-ſeed, and your Ground in little
time will be never the worſe, eſpecially if the Soyl be good.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſet your Hedge, cut off all the ſets within one inch or
two of the ground, and keep them weeded for two or three years; and
when they have ſhot two years on good, or three years on indifferent
ground, cut them off within three Inches of the ground; but if there
be ſome places too thin, there lay down ſome into the gaps, and cover
them and the reſt over one Inch with Mould, leaving the Ends of the
the Layers out, which will draw Root, and thicken your Hedge.
Let his be practiſed at all times, when you make or lay your
Hedges.</p>
            <p>But note, if your Hedge be ſet with Crab, or Apple-ſtocks, that
you leave one ſtanding, uncut up, at every twenty foot, or at every
ten or twelve foot, if the Ground be your own, on both ſides the
Hedge; then may you ſo order them, by pruning or ſtaking, that one
may lean into one ground, and the other into another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Prune up
theſe Stocks yearly, till you have got them out of Cattels reach, and
then graft them with Red-ſtrake Jennit-moyl, or what Syder, or
other Fruit you pleaſe; but if your Stocks be of Apple-kernels, you
may let them ſtand ungrafted, and they will yield you very good Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-fruit;
but Stocks ungrafted will be the longer before they bear,
and alſo when you graft, you may be certain of your Kind, but if you
find a very natural Stock, that is likely by Leaf, Shoot and Bud, try it;
by ſo doing you may have a new fine Fruit: if you like it not, you may
graft it when you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Hedge when it hath ſhot three or four year, you
may Lay, for to make a fence of it ſelf; for you muſt mind to keep it
from Cattel till it comes to be Laid, and one or two years after; And
now to Lay it, I ſhall give ſome few Rules, which may direct you
when you Lay any Fence-hedge, of what ſort of wood ſoever it
be.</p>
            <p>Firſt at every Laying, lay down ſome old Plaſhes, or young ones
if your Hedge be thin; but let them point with their Ends to the
Ditch-ſide of the Bank, keeping the ends low on the Bank; they will
the better thicken the bottom of your Hedge, and keep up the Earth
of your Bank.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:54356:60"/>
Secondly, At every Laying lay Earth on your Bank, to heighten it,
and to cover your Layers all but the Ends, which Earth will help your
Quick much, and make the Fence the better by heightning the Banks,
and deepning your Ditch.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do not cut your Plaſhes too much, but juſt ſo much as
they may well bend down; and do not lay them ſo upright as ſome
of our Work-men doe, but lay them near to a Level, the Sap will
break out at ſeveral places the better, and not run ſo much to the ends
as it will when they lie much ſloping. If you have Wood to ſpare,
cut up moſt of thoſe that grow near the Ditch; but hang the Bank
then with Buſhes, to keep the Cattel from cropping them the firſt year;
theſe will ſhoot ſtrong, and ſecure your Hedge well, keep up the Bank,
and thicken the bottom of your Hedge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Lay your Hedge pretty thick, turning the beard on the
Ditch-ſide; but do not let the beard hang uncut, as the common work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
do, (though it doth make a good ſhew at firſt making) but cut
off all the ſtragling boughs within half a foot of the Hedge on both
ſides, then will it ſhoot ſtrong at theſe places, and thicken your Hedge
much the more: Of this, Reaſon may inform you, as it did me, and
Experience will afterwards confirm it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you have got a good high Bank, make your Hedge ſo
low as you think it may but juſt ſerve for Fence the firſt year; for it
will ſoon grow high, and the lower your Hedge is made, the Quick
will grow the better, and the bottom will be the thicker; but take
care to keep out Cattel from the Field-ſide, the firſt year after it is
made.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would have a good Hedge for Fence, you muſt fell
it often, doing as is aforeſaid, and take care at every felling to root
out Elder, Travellers Joy, (that is Bull-bine, as ſome call it,) Bria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo leave not too many high Standard-trees or Pollards
in it; the Elm is one of the beſt. Doe not uſe too much dead wood
in the bottom of your Hedges, for that choaks your Quick; but if
you have a gap, make your dead Hedge at a diſtance. Much more
I could ſay of Hedges, but I forbear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Only I cannot paſs by the Learned Eſquires good Advice, in his</hi>
Diſcourſe of Forreſt-trees, <hi>(pag.</hi> 50.) <hi>which is this:</hi> I do only wiſh,
upon the Proſpect and Meditation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Benefit, that every
perſon whatſoever, worth Ten Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> within his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Dominions, were by ſome indiſpenſable Statute obliged to plant his
Hedge-rowes with the beſt and moſt uſefull kinds of them, eſpecially
in ſuch places of the Nation, as be the more Inland Counties. <hi>Thus
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54356:60"/>
far the Learned Author: To which I adde, that if they did not plant ſo
many Trees, and keep ſuch a number planted, they ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to plant ten Crab-ſtocks for the want of one Tree,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If this were but as much in uſe with us as it in <hi>Hereford-ſhire,</hi> and
once grown to a Cuſtom, we ſhould in few years baniſh out forraign
Drinks by this our excellent and moſt wholſom one. Beſides, our
Trees in ſhallow ground would thrive better in Banks of Hedge-rowes,
than in the middle of the Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, (ſaith he)</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubtedly if this courſe were effectually taken,
a very conſiderable part both of Meat and Drink which is ſpent in our
prejudice, might be ſaved by the Countrey-people, even out of the Hedges;
which would afford them not onely the Pleaſure and Profit of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Fruit, but ſuch abundance of Syder and Perry as ſhould ſuffice them
to drink of one of the moſt wholſom and excellent Beaverages in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Old</hi> Gerrard <hi>did long ſince alleadge us an Example worthy to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued:</hi>
I have ſeen <hi>(ſaith he, ſpeaking of Apple-trees,</hi> lib. 3. ch. 101.) in
the Paſtures and Hedge-rowes about the Grounds of a worſhipful Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
dwelling two miles from <hi>Hereford,</hi> called Mr. <hi>Roger Bodnome,</hi> ſo
many Fruit-trees of all ſorts, that the Servants drink for the moſt part no
other Drink but that which is made of Apples; the Quantity being ſuch,
that (by the Report of the Gentleman himſelf) the Parſon hath for
Tythe many hogſheads of Syder. An Example doubtleſs to be followed
of Gentlemen that have Lands: But Envy ſaith, The Poor will break
down our Hedges, and we ſhall have the leaſt part of the Fruit: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I adviſe you to go forward, in the Name of God; Graft, ſet,
plant, and nouriſh up Trees every corner of your Ground; the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is ſmall, the Coſt is nothing, the Commodity is great, your ſelves
ſhall have plenty, the Poor ſhall have ſomewhat in time of want to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their Neceſſity, and God ſhall reward your Minds and Diligence.
<hi>Thus far honeſt</hi> Gerard.</p>
            <p>And in truth, with how ſmall Charge and with how great Pleaſure this
were to be effected, every one that is Patron of a little Nurſery can eaſily
calculate: But by this Expedient, many thouſands of Acres, ſow'd now
with Barley, might be cultivated for Wheat, or converted into Paſture,
to the increaſe of Corn and Cattel; beſides the Timber which the Pear-tree
doth afford, comparable for divers curious uſes with moſt: this
alſo would make Timber the more plentifull; the decaying Trees and
pruning would be good Fire-wood.</p>
            <p>One thing more I do wiſh were practiſed in our Hedges, and thoſe
fined ſeverely that did not obſerve it, <hi>viz.</hi> That there ſhould not an
Oak in any Hedge whatſoever, be headed, but that the Owner might

have liberty to ſhread them up as ſome do Elms, though not to ſtock
or fell them till ſuch an Age; in ſuch Banks we ſhould have the beſt

            <head type="sub">Of planting ſeveral ſorts of Forreſt-trees, in order to making
the beſt advantage of Ground, as Orchards, or the like.</head>
            <p>SUppoſe you were to plant one Acre of Ground, or more, with
Walnuts or Cheſnuts, or the like, and would have it planted to
the beſt advantage; that is, to have your Trees ſtand in good Order
to the Eye, and to have as many Trees as conveniently you can in
your Ground, (which is ſuppoſed all men would have) and yet your
Trees to ſtand at convenient diſtance.</p>
            <p>Now (I ſay) ſuppoſing your Ground to be one Acre, and a Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical
ſquare, in ſuch a ground you may begin your firſt Row on which
ſide you pleaſe to ſtake out your Ground for the holes to be made;
you muſt firſt reſolve what diſtance your Trees had beſt be planted at;
remembring, that if your ground be good, and a deep ground, then
you may plant your Trees at ſomewhat the greater diſtance: Of the
Ground that moſt Trees delight in, you may ſee in the particular Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſpeaking of each Kind. Your Beſt way is to plant them Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and not ſquare, as ſome doe; for you can plant them in no form
or order whatſoever to be more pleaſing to the moſt Noble Senſe, than
to have every three Trees to make an Equilateral Triangle; nor in no
other way whatſoever to have ſo many Trees to ſtand in ſuch, or any
piece of Ground whatſoever, at ſuch a diſtance. For ſatisfaction, and
likewiſe to demonſtrate it more fully, obſerve theſe two following Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of the aforeſaid piece of Ground, which is one Acre, and is a
Geometrical Square.</p>
            <p>But before I ſhew you a Draft, or you ſtake out your Ground for
your holes to be made, firſt conſider well theſe few Rules:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Obſerve the Diſtance that your Trees ought to be planted at;
alwayes remembring, that if your Ground be good, and a deep Soyl,
that then your Trees will hold the longer, and by conſequence grow
to the greater perfection, therefore plant at larger diſtance. As for
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54356:61"/>
Example, If I were to plant this Acre of Ground with Syder-Apples,
(as for Inſtance, all red-ſtrakes, which is an excellent Syder-Apple, and
is likewiſe a great Bearer, and a Tree that doth not laſt very long,) my
Ground being alſo a ſhallow Ground, I think of 22 foot aſunder to plant
theſe Trees at, or as neer that as the Ground will permit.</p>
            <p>Then Secondly, I go round my Ground, and obſerving my Fence
well, and finding no great Trees in it, I then reſolve to ſet my Trees
at ſix foot from my Fence, (but note, if there be great Trees in your
Hedge that fences your Ground, then this is too nigh) then I ſet off
ſix foot at one Corner of my Orchard, and ſix foot at the other Corner
of the ſame ſide, which is the Eaſt ſide, then I ſet off ſix foot at one
Corner of the Weſt ſide, it matters not which, only that End which is
the Levelleſt, is the beſt for Meaſuring: Having ſet theſe three ſtakes,
I ſtrain a Line from one ſtake to the other, on the Eaſt ſide; then I lay
a ſquare to this Line, removing it along the Line till I find the other
End of the Square point exactly againſt the Stake on the weſt ſide;
then laying a Line right ſquare to that Line, till you come at the Stake
on the VVeſt ſide, I then meaſure by this Line as many 22 foots as I
can; noting how many times 22 foot I find, and what you find is over,
or more than 11 foot, then make your diſtance the leſs, to make that
up the equal diſtance for one Tree more: but if it be leſs than half
the diſtance your Trees are to ſtand aſunder, then adde that which is
under the 11 foot, to the number of Trees that be to ſtand aſunder.
Obſerve but this, and then you need not fear that your Trees will ſtand
too far off on one ſide, and too near on the other, it being the ſame
Charge to plant in good Order as at Random, as too many doe; nay
many times leſs Charge; and how much more pleaſing Order is, I
leave them to judge to whom the great God of Order hath given a great
delight to imitate him in his glorious works.</p>
            <p>But as for this my piece of Ground, which I pitch on only for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>viz.</hi> One Acre, and a Square, I muſt find the ſquare Root of
160 Rod, or as near it as my Chain will give, and then ſubſtract but
the 12 foot out for the diſtance of the Trees from the Fence, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Remainder by 22, the Quotient tells you how many Trees
will ſtand in a Row; the over-meaſure ſubſtracted from, or added to,
as your Reaſon teacheth you.</p>
            <p>Note this, that it is moſt commonly the beſt way for your Rows to
goe the longeſt way of your Ground; for though your Trees ſtand 22
foot aſunder, yet your Rowes in their ſtraight Lines will not ſtand ſo
far.</p>
            <p>Now to find the ſquare Root there are very many Rules, but none
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54356:62"/>
that are to my Apprehenſion ſo exact and eaſie as by Logarithmes: find
but the Logarithme of your Number, then take half that Log. the
Number anſwering is the ſquare Root.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exam.</hi> The Log. of 160, is 2. 204 11998.</p>
            <p>The half of this Log. is 1. 10205999.</p>
            <p>The neareſt Number anſwering this Logarithme is 12 Rod, 65/100
that is, 12 Rod 65 Links of a one Pole-Chain divided into 100
parts.</p>

            <p>By this it doth plainly appear, that 12.65 is the neareſt Number that
can be found by your Decimal Chain it is but 225/10000 more, and by
Logarithmes but 2 of a Link put into 100 parts, therefore exact as
need be for this purpoſe, unleſs it were for Calculation in Aſtronomy,
or the like. And you ſee that 12.64<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> multiplyed in it ſelf, amounts
to 159 Rod and 7696/10000: ſo that I take 12 Rod and 65 of 100 to be
Length or Breadth; it being a Square they both be as one.</p>
            <p>Now being the Queſtion is propounded in Feet, we muſt turn this
12 Rod and 65/100 into feet alſo; but note, you may work the ſame by

            <p>Then for the 65 Links of one Rod, put into
100 parts, or if it be your four Pole-Chain (as is
moſt uſual now) put into 100 Links; then are theſe
65 Links but 16 Links and a 1/49; by that Chain;

then by the Rule of Three, ſay, if 25 (the Links in one Rod) be equal

16 Links and a Quarter?</p>

thus, If 1000 be equal to 3 Barley-Corns, what is 700 equal unto?
I ſay as here you ſee it proved, that 700 is equal to two Barley-corns
and one tenth part of one, for 100 is one tenth of 1000.</p>

By this it doth plainly appear, that if 12 Rod 65/100 be turned into
feet, it maketh 208 foot, 8 Inches, 2 Barley-corns, and one tenth of a
Barley-corn: So that you ſee the ſquare Root of an Acre is near 208
foot 8 Inches two Barley-corns, neglecting 1/10, becauſe 65/100 is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too much. Now from this 208 foot 8 Inches, I take the 12 foot for
the Trees to ſtand off from the Fence, there remains 196 foot 8 inches,

So I find there may ſtand ten Trees, for here you ſee there
may be open places, and 20 foot 8 inches for one more;
ſo there wants but one foot 4 Inches (or 16 Inches) to
make 10 Trees in a Row, for there is alwayes a Tree
more than the open.</p>

your Scale muſt be one Inch divided into 37 parts, and
better; but for fear this Scale ſhould be too great, I draw
my Plat by the Scale of 40 in one Inch, ſo if you divide
208 (the breadth of the Ground) by 40, it gives 5
Inches and 8/40, and ſo broad muſt the Plat be, as you
may ſee by the Figure: Thus may you enlarge your Draught, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
it on your Paper, as your pleaſure is: But 'tis better to draw
all your Draughts as large as your Paper will give you leave; the

            <p>(See Fig. 5.)</p>
            <p>By this you ſee, that if you plant your Trees triangle, this Acre
of Ground hath 11 Rowes and 104 Trees; but if you begin either
ſide with 10, as before I began with 9, then will there be in this ground
105 Trees; but to know how many Rowes you may have in any
ground, doe thus, and you may preſently ſatisfie your ſelf; you ſee
the ground from one out-ſide Row to the other, is 196 foot 8 Inches,
which divided by 19 (the diſtance that the Rowes be aſunder, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting

of Trees one more than the Diſtances, in this Draught the
Trees ſtand at the ſame diſtance, but ſquare.</p>
            <p>(See Fig. 6.)</p>
            <p>By this laſt Draught it appeareth, that if you ſet the Trees at the
ſame diſtance, and ſet them ſquare, that then there will be but 9 Rowes
and 90 Trees in this ſquare Acre of Ground; but if you plant them
Triangle, then will it hold 14 or 15 Trees more: But if your Plat of
Ground be a long ſquare, or any other Irregular Figure, then will
your Triangle-way hold a great many more, in proportion to the
Quantity of Ground; beſides it makes many more Rowes, therefore
more pleaſing to the Eye.</p>
            <p>Note this well for ſetting your Trees exactly, having found the
diſtance they are to ſtand aſunder, and likewiſe how many Rows,
with a Line laid, or ſtakes true ſet, where your firſt Row muſt goe;
the ſaid ſtakes will be of good uſe to ſet the Trees by when your holes
be made; having reſolved on which ſide you will begin, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
let be the ſide you find moſt in ſight, ſet down your two Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtakes
for the firſt and laſt holes to be made, then with your
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54356:64"/>
Aſſiſtants meaſure exactly in your Row by the Line 21 foot and Ten
inches, but in caſe there ſhould be odde meaſure, then proportion it
(as is ſhewed before) by making one Hole more or leſs, as you ſee
cauſe: Then having two men to aſſiſt you, with a Chain (for Line
will reach or ſhrink,) meaſure exactly the diſtance of two Trees, let one
hold at one Tree, and one at the next in the Row, you ſtanding at the
Angle, with the Chain equally ſtiffe, put down a ſtake at the Angle,
and ſo go on to the next two Trees, pitching down your ſtakes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular:
And alſo conſidering the Thickneſs of your Stakes; thence
let your two men go to the next, and you ſetting down one at the Angle,
till you have ſtaked out the whole Ground; this doe when you come to
ſet your Trees, being carefull to keep your Chain ſtrained both ſides
alike, and to allow for the crookedneſs of your Trees, and when you
have got two Rows planted, then your Eye will aſſiſt you well enough
to obſerve the Rowes as you go on.</p>
            <p>Note alſo, that if your Ground be large, and a ſquare, then your
beſt way will be to find the middle Row, and ſet that off ſquare from
that ſide of your Ground you mind moſt, or find to be ſtraighteſt;
there begin to mark out your holes, and alſo to plant your Trees; but
if your Ground be Irregular, or have an Angle on one ſide, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
on your ſtraight ſide, and run the odde meaſure into the Angle, as
far as is convenient to plant in ſuch a Ground, you need but find what
diſtance your firſt Row muſt be ſet at: But if your Ground have both
the ſides ſtraight, then it will be convenient to ſet the ſide-rowes at
equal diſtance from your Fence; Thus you may well perceive, that it
is but meaſuring the length and breadth of your Ground, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
one to the diſtance your Trees be to ſtand at, the other to the
diſtance the Rows are to be aſunder, and you may proceed to ſtake
out your Ground. After this method you may plant any ſort of Forreſt
trees in Groves.</p>
            <p>The beſt way is, to ſtake out your whole Ground before you plant
a Tree, or make one hole; by ſo doing you may well perceive where
a fault is, and eaſily mend it in time (though ſome are of opinion other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,) but I ſhall leave them to their own Judgement, and ſatisfie my
ſelf with Experience and Reaſon: But for fear any thing ſhould be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
to you that I have writ, obſerve but the ſetting out of theſe two
Rows, and then I hope it will be plainly demonſtrated to you how
to proceed. Suppoſe the Length of your Ground ſhould be the length
of the Line marked at the End thus.</p>
            <p>(See Figure 7.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:54356:64"/>
Having ſtaked out your firſt Row, as before is ſhewed, and having
the Chain exactly the diſtance of two Opens, then bid one of your men
take one End, and the other man the other End, you holding exactly
the Middle, bid one hold at the ſtake one, the other at the ſtake two,
then pitch you down your ſtake right at the Angles, as the prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Line ſheweth: So let your two men remove from ſtake to ſtake,
and you from Angle to Angle, till you have ſtaked out your Rowe,
and then let them come to that Row you laſt ſet out, and goe on to
another, ſo proceed till you have ſtaked out your whole Ground. Thus
much for planting Trees in Orchard faſhion. I have been the larger
to ſhew the beſt way for improving your Ground, preſuming, that
every man that fenceth in a ground would plant as many Trees as he
can in it; let ſuch but mind what I have delivered, and what I ſhall
deliver in the next Chapter, I hope it will be ſatisfactory to him; if it
be, it will be the like to me.</p>
            <p>But what Order ſoever you plant your Trees in, make your holes
good before: Set not your Trees too deep, and keep them ſtaked the
firſt year, covering the ground over the Roots with ſome Litter, or
Dung, and over that a little Mould, to keep the Sun from burning the
Dung, and exhauſting the ſtrength. In the Spring walk over the
Ground you planted in Winter, and ſet your Trees to right, and tread
the Mould to the Roots, eſpecially if the Spring be drye; keep all the
cracks filled with Mould; after your Trees be ſet, keep your ground
with digging or plowing, for three or four years at firſt, but the longer
the better; your Trees will run and thrive in the looſe Ground much;
but if you do not ſo much mind Order in Planting, but would keep
your Land for Corn, and yet would gladly have Fruit-trees too (which
may very well be, and you may have good ſtore of Fruit: and not
much the leſs Corn,) then plant your Rowes about thirty foot aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the longeſt wayes of your Ground, and ſet the Trees in the Rows
about 15 foot aſunder, and let the Trees in each Row ſtand exactly
ſquare; ſo may you have a very fine Orchard, and little or nothing the
leſs Corn: Many years may you have as much Fruit as is worth a
good Crop of Corn, off ſo much Land, and not the leſs Corn; which
may well encourage you to planting, if you dare believe me; but if
not, be but ſo kind to your ſelf and me, as to trye whether I tell truth
not. Be ſure to keep Cows out of your young Orchards; Sheep will
do no harm, provided you wiſp your Trees about with Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
whileſt young, which is the beſt way to keep them from the
deſtructive Hares and Coneys.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXXIV.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of Pruning Trees, ſome general Obſervations.</head>
            <p>ALthough I have ſhewed you how to prune moſt ſort of Trees, in
each Chapter, where I ſhewed you how to raiſe them, yet I
ſhall ſay a little more; and all will be too little; for the Curate of
<hi>Henonville</hi> tells you in his Book of the <hi>Manner of Ordering Fruit-trees,</hi>
That it is a Thing very rare among Gardners to Prune Trees
well; for the doing of it well depends more upon their Ingenuity than
upon their Hand: It is alſo very hard to give Inſtructions for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it conſiſts not in certain and general Maxims, but varies accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the particular Circumſtances of each Tree, ſo that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
abſolutely upon the Gardners Prudence, who ought of himſelf
to judge what Branches muſt be left, and which are fit to be cut
away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed that erroneous Cuſtome and Saying (which is among moſt
men) of Timber-trees, not to prune them at all, or if you doe, to
cut off the boughs at diſtance from the Body, hath made many a good
Fruit-tree loſe its life ſooner by many years than it would have done,
and alſo hath yielded to the Owner much leſs and worſe Fruit than it
would have done: Therefore whatſoever Bough you cut off from Fruit
or Forreſt-tree, cut it cloſe and ſmooth, and the loweſt ſide cloſeſt,
then will it not hold water, and every year the Bark will ſurround and
overgrow the wound by little and little, till it hath quite healed the
place; But if you leave a Stump, it's likely that will hold water, and
make a hole into the very Body of your Tree, and ſo in little time
make it ſick and kill it, which before would bear you but little and
poor Fruit: Or if the Stump hang down ſo that it doth not hold wet,
then the Tree muſt be as big as that Stump is long, on all ſides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can over-grow that place; or if the Stump rots, and breaks
off, then many times it leaves a hole in the Tree, which if it tends
much upward, ſo that it takes water, it certainly kills the Tree; and
if the Tree be not a very thriving Tree, it will be very long before it
overgrowes that hole, though it do not take wet: Therefore what
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54356:65"/>
boughs you cut off, cut them off cloſe, unleſs the Tree be very old,
and the boughs great, ſuch I do not adviſe you to meddle with; but
if you doe, cut them at a diſtance from the Body, alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
to let the wound be ſmooth, and to tend as much from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon
as may be. All boughs that grow upright, be they great or little,
cut them not right croſs over, but cut them ſloping upward, and let
the ſlope aſpect the South, Eaſt or Weſt, if it may be; and in thoſe
boughs that lean from the head, cut the ſlope on the lower ſide, the
ſlope tending downward, ſo will they cover over the better; if the
wound be great cover it over with ſome Clay, well mixed with
Horſe-dung to keep it from the weather, and it will cover over the
ſooner.</p>
            <p>Many a good Tree is ſpoyled by grafting of it in bad places, as I
have ſeen in ſome hundreds, of which I have not ſpared (as oft as I
could) to tell the Owners, but few would believe me; for ſometimes
they cut off great boughs, till they come to 6 Inches (or thereabouts)
Diameter; there they put in four or ſix Grafts in the Bark, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two in the Clift, and ſaw the bough right croſs over, though it grow
upright, in which if the Grafts do grow, the head is ſo great, and they
growing Round (as it were endeavouring to cover over the wound)
make ſuch a hollow place (like a Diſh) on the Head, as holds water
and kills the Tree, which is many times dead before the Grafts can
cover over the head: or if the Tree doth not thrive very well, they
keep that place will covered with Loom, or Clay mixed with Horſe-dung,
and ſometimes they head the Tree very low, and thereby check
it ſo much, that it dyes in little time after: Sometimes they cut off
ſuch great boughs, and do it ſo ill, that though the heads grow, yet in
little time theſe wounds kill the Tree. Though I ſhall not here teach
you how to graft, yet let me adviſe you when you graft high great
Trees, not to cut them too low, but to prune them up till they come
to the thickneſs of your Arm, or leſs, and then graft them, for then
will the Grafts ſoon overgrow ſuch places.</p>
            <p>Leave a good many of theſe Heads on, according to the bigneſs of
your Tree, that if ſome miſs you may take them off the next Spring,
and yet have enough for the Head. If you graft in the Bark, you muſt
remember to head your Grafts about <hi>Midſummer,</hi> or elſe they will be
ſubject to blow off; put your Grafts in alway on the upper ſide, and
cut upright Boughs a little ſloping off, they will heal over the better;
keep them from Suckers, and then you may expect good Trees and
Fruit, of which I wiſh your Hedge-rowes were full.</p>
            <p>Of all ſorts of Trees whatſoever, if any Roots be broke or much
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54356:66"/>
bruiſed, or cracked, cut them off till you come to firm Wood, the
ſlope tending to the Ground like a Horſe-foot; but be very ſparing in
cutting the Roots of Greens, and alſo in cutting their heads off, yet
you may proportion the Head to the Root, by cutting off ſome ſide-boughs,
which cut off (if your Green be tender) the latter end of
<hi>March,</hi> or in <hi>April,</hi> and cut the Bough off two or three Inches from
the Body, and that time come Twelve month take off that piece cloſe,
and cover the wound with a little Wax or Clay well tempered: if your
Greens be for high Trees, endeavour to make them taper, by leaving
ſome ſide-boughs to eaſe the head.</p>
            <p>In all Trees you intend for Timber, be cautious in cutting off their
heads, eſpecially thoſe of great Piths, ſuch as the Aſh, Walnut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Unleſs your Tree grow top-heavy, or much crooked, and then at the
crooked place cut off the head ſloping upward, and nurſe up one of
the principal ſhoots to be the leading Shoot, but ſuch as are ſubject
to die when headed, or any Tree very great, meddle not with ſuch;
the Beech is one of the worſt to head of any Tree I know.</p>
            <p>Such Trees as you intend for to grow to a certain propoſed height,
you muſt take care to keep them taper, by leaving ſide-boughs in
convenient place and diſtance to make them taper, cutting ſuch boughs
off when you find your Tree is ſwelled enough below; ſtill minding
to take off the greateſt ſide-boughs and leave little ones, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
your head (by keeping it ſmall) according to the Body, and
maintaining the leading Shoot, letting it have no equals; for forked
Trees are never ſtraight: Thus do till you have got your Tree to the
height you intend, and there let the Head break out, and cut off all
the ſide-boughs, but if ſide-boughs ſtill break out, then give them a
Summer-pruning, a little after <hi>Midſummer,</hi> and cut them off cloſe;
ſo will you kill them, and have a fine, ſtately, clear Body, and fine Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-tree:
See <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>Obſerve this in all Trees you would have grow with a handſome
ſtraight body, till you have got them to the height you intend they
ſhall head at.</p>
            <p>Whileſt your Trees be ſmall you muſt prune them every year: The
beſt time for moſt is the Spring; but hardy Trees and Wood may be
pruned at any time in Winter; when they be a little older, once in
two year, then once in three, and then in four, and never ſeldomer
than once in five or ſix, ſo will the Bough be ſmall, the Tree will ſoon
overgrow the place, the Knot will not be great to vex the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Joyner at all, the place will not be very ſubject to put forth
Suckers, becauſe the Sap hath had no great recourſe to that place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:54356:66"/>
Mind alwayes to cut off your Boughs ſmooth, and cloſe to the
Body: This if you pleaſe to doe, you may have fine Timber, and
handſom Trees, which I dare engage will pay you or yours well for
your helps to them.</p>
            <p>The like doe with your ſtandard Fruit-trees, or thoſe you intend for
Pollards, till you have got them to the height you deſign they ſhall
head at, and at ſetting if they be tender Trees, or Trees that have
great Pith. If you muſt head them, let it be in the Spring, when you
find they begin to bud, but then you muſt take care of the winds in
Winter, that they ſhake them not ſo as to let the Air in to the ground,
to kill the Roots, therefore tie them to good Stocks.</p>
            <p>Or this is a good way for Trees that have not great Piths, or are
very tender; cut off ſome of the tops of the Boughs when you ſet
them, ſo let them be till the Spring, and when you ſee the Bud break
out, then cut them on every ſhoot of the head, a little above the
loweſt Bud or two of each ſhoot; ſo will the head ſhoot but with few
ſhoots, and they will be the ſtronger; the head being ſmall, the Root
will endeavour to proportion it to its former greatneſs, or near it: but
if you have many ſhoots break out, then cut them all off but four or
five, for ſo many are enough to make Arms for any Tree; but if then
you find the Tree to ſhoot too much, and grow top-heavy (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they will if well kept and on good ground,) then head the Tree
again, but not ſo low as you did before, (for Reaſon ought to be uſed
in all things; this will make your Tree ſwell in body much, and in
time be a fine Tree: So that I ſay, endeavour to get a good Body;
for in Fruit-trees this is to be noted, that you muſt in the firſt place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to get your Tree in ſuch a Condition as to bear you good Fruit,
and a Quantity, rather than little Fruit early, and then never good
Fruit or Tree after; therefore if you have a Tree that doth not thrive,
but is ſubject to blow much (as moſt ſuch Trees are) cut off the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Buds in the Spring, as low to a Leafie Bud as you can, and ſome
ſhoots, as near the place where the Tree headed as you can; but mind
to leave ſome Buds on the head to draw up the Sap, or elſe your Tree
may break out in the middle of the Body, or a little above Ground;
but if your Buds once ſhoot on the head, but half a foot, then will your
Tree come away. Thus and by digging about, have I helped ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a ſtunted Tree forward, which you may doe likewiſe, if you
pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I have many times obſerved ſeveral Fruit-trees, as Pears, Apples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to be full of falſe-bearing Buds; I call them ſo becauſe they did not
blow, for the Tree having got more head than the Roots could well
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54356:67"/>
maintain, had not ſtrength ſufficient to ſpare ſap for bloſſom, nor yet
for Fruit; which by pruning and thinning the heads of ſuch Trees, and
by ſlitting the bark on the Body in the Spring, hath made them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to bear well, when they have put forth new ſhoots at the head.</p>
            <p>And ſome ſorts of Fruit-trees there be which will blow and bear
themſelves to death, when they be middle-aged, as before I told you
ſome young ones would, if not helped by pruning; but the beſt wayes
to preſerve ſuch Trees from death, and to make them bear pretty
good Fruit, is, to cut off moſt of the blowing Buds, and to thin the
head of ſome boughs, to make it ſhoot again; then will it live many
years longer, and bear better Fruit: Some Trees there be that will
run ſo much into wood, that they will not bear of themſelves till they
come to be old, but if you cut off the head of the ſhoots as ſoon as
ever the Spring-ſhoot is over, which is near <hi>Midſummer,</hi> and take
out ſome great boughs then; if you mind your Time, and do it with
diſcretion, you may force that Tree to put forth blowing Buds, and
blow and bear the year following.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed you ſome wayes and hints of pruning Trees,
though I know ſome that are againſt Pruning them at all; So are there
ſome that are againſt Learning: but 'tis convenient for Trees to be
pruned well, as alſo it is very neceſſary for men to be brought up in
Learning; for thereby both produce much the better Fruits: therefore,

or want of skill, they leave moſt of them Stubs; and inſtead of
cutting the Arms and Branches cloſe to the Boll, back them off a

the weather, which periſhes them to the very head, deforming the whole
Tree with many ugly Botches, which ſhorten its Life, and utterly marre
the Tree.</q>
            <p>By this Animadverſion alone it were eaſie for an ingenious man to
underſtand how Trees are to be govern'd, which is (in a word or two)
by cutting clean, ſmooth and cloſe, making the ſtroke upward, and
with a ſharp Chizzel or Bill, ſo as the weight of an untractable bough
do not ſplice, and carry the Bark with it, which is both dangerous
and unſightly; and by endeavouring to keep the Tree taper, by leaving
ſome little Boughs on the ſides.</p>
            <p>I have here ſhewed you how to prune Forreſt-trees, with ſomewhat
of high Standard Fruit-trees; but if you would ſee more Books, then
ſee Eſquire <hi>Evelyns Diſcourſe of Forreſt-trees,</hi> and for Fruit-trees, the
Curate of <hi>Henonville</hi>'s Book.</p>
            <p>But here note, if you ſhould have any Trees that ſhould be ſtundied,
or very crooked, or much cropped by Cattel; the beſt way is not to
ſtand to prune up ſuch Trees to a Head, but firſt to fell them cloſe at
the Ground, and then they will put forth young ſtraight ſhoots; one
of the beſt you muſt nurſe up, if you intend it for a Timber-Tree; if
for under-wood, then let them grow with all the heads the Roots will
put forth: The Spring is the beſt ſeaſon for this. And thus much at
preſent of pruning Forreſt-trees; for I tell you there are more Trees
ſpoyled by bad Lopping or Pruning, or for want of good Lopping or
Pruning, than there are of all Diſeaſes belonging to Forreſt-trees, unleſs
they be accidental, as ſpoyl'd by Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. XXXV.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the Diſeaſes of Trees.</head>
            <p>THere be ſeveral Diſeaſes and Caſualties that do ſpoyl Trees, which
ſometimes happen in the Roots, and ſometimes in the Body or
Head.</p>
            <p>1. The Roots may be the decay of the Tree; as, if they ſtand in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54356:68"/>
Ground contrary to its Kind, as the Beech on cold Clay, and wet
Ground, or the Alder on ſharp dry Gravel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is contrary to
each Kind, and muſt not thus be ſet.</p>
            <p>2. It is alſo a great fault to the Roots of Trees, to ſet thoſe Trees
which naturally love to run ſhallow, too deep; or indeed any other.</p>
            <p>3. When Ground is very ſtiffe or Rocky, it muſt be digged or plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make way for the Roots to run in, and contrary Earth layd round
about the Trees Roots.</p>
            <p>4. Great weeds muſt not grow round the Tree, for they will rob
the Roots of their Nouriſhment; alſo they muſt early be weeded from
Seedlings, or ſmall Plants, leaſt they choak them.</p>
            <p>5. Ivy, and Travellers Joy, Bryany, and ſuch Climers, muſt be pull'd
up round your Trees, leaſt they pinch or make them crooked, and ſo
ſpoyl them.</p>
            <p>6. Suckers muſt carefully be pull'd off, whenſoever you ſee them
break out, opening the Earth, ſo that you may well come at the place
of the Root where they grow out, and then pull or cut them off cloſe:
If you find them rooted, you may ſet them again, but then you muſt
obſerve Winter-ſeaſon; but ſuch Trees as yield Suckers from the
running Roots, as the Elm, Cherry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it be in Woods, and they
thin, leave ſome of them as you pleaſe, they will do the Tree no harm;
be ſure to take ſuckers clean off from the Body the firſt year.</p>
            <p>7. The Bodies are moſt commonly in danger, if Deer, Hares, or
Connyes can come at them whileſt they be young; therefore if you
plant where Deer or Connies are, you muſt take care to fence them
well with Frames of wood, and look to keep them ſo, or elſe never
plant at all; for in one day or night they will bark round ſeveral, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Aſh, Line, Abele, Poplar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And take great care to keep
your Apples and Pears from Hares and Connies in hard Winters, for
they will ſpoyl them all if they come at them. The beſt fence to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
your Trees from them, is to tie Thum-bands of Hay or Straw
round them, ſo high as they can reach; keep this renewed early every
Winter.</p>
            <p>8. Great Boughs ill taken off, as I have many times ſaid before,
ſpoyls many a Tree; therefore take them off cloſe and ſmooth, and not
parallel to the Horizon: Cover the wound with Loom, or Clay, well
mixed with Horſe-dung, and keep it ſo covered; for if the wet fall
perpendicular on ſuch a place, it will in little time make the whole
Tree hollow, by the wet getting in there, which comes by great Lops
and bad Lopping; as you may ſee in too many Elms, Aſhes, Horn-beams,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſpoyl'd by ſuch careleſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:54356:68"/>
9. If a Tree be Bark-bound, then ſlit through the Bark with your
knife, from the head to the Ground: The Spring is the beſt ſeaſon;
This will do moſt Trees good, and no harm to any.</p>
            <p>10 If Worms be got between the Bark and the body of your Tree,
they muſt be cut out; and the place done over with Loom.</p>
            <p>11. Cankered places, or gall'd, or boughs broke, are to be cut
ſmooth, and covered over with Loom; the Canker muſt be caſt clean
out: If a great bough be broke, and the Tree old, cut it off at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Body, but little boughs cloſe.</p>
            <p>12. If a Tree be blaſted in part, or the whole head, cut all that is
blaſted or dead cloſe off to the Quick, and take out all dead boughs:
Keep Catterpillers from the heads of young Trees, leſt they eat off the
Leaves and Buds, and kill your Tree.</p>
            <p>13. Take care to deſtroy Moles and Mice, by Traps or Poyſon; for
Moles will make hollow the Ground, and much harm your young
Trees: Mice will eat all the Bark off round the Body in hard Winters,
and kill your Tree; but mind you in time to prevent them.</p>
            <p>14. Rooks do deſtroy many a Tree, both old and young, before
their time: As to old Trees by pinching off the tops, and breaking off
the Buds; and young Trees by lighting on their heads; their weight
breaking off their young tender ſhoots and Buds, cauſes the Trees to
die; and alſo they deſtroy Seedlings where they breed; their Dung
brings forth great weeds, as Nettles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo choaks the young
Seedlings; therefore kill all of them you can at breeding-time, by
ſhooting them, and ſetting Lime-twips on the tops of your young Trees.
You'l thrive the better if you deſtroy them.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Felling and Ordering Woods and Coppices.</head>
            <p>IF you love to have a thriving Wood, and to improve it for your beſt
Advantage, your beſt way is, not to let it ſtand too long before you
fell; for the oftener you fell your under-wood, the thicker it will be;
as at ten or twelve years growth on a ſhallow ground, and twelve or
fourteen years growth on your deep Soyl and beſt grounds; for there
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54356:69"/>
be many Inconveniencies in letting your Woods ſtand too long before
you fell them, or Trees in Woods that do not proſper.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When you let your Woods or Coppices ſtand long before
you fell them, you cannot come to ſurvey your Timber-trees, to ſee
which be decaying, and in ſo doing you are uncharitable to your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
no good Common-wealthſman, no good Husband for your ſelf,
and no good Chriſtian: For why ſhould any Reaſonable man let his
Trees ſtand in his Woods, or elſewhere, with dead tops, hollow
Trunks, Limbs falling down upon others and ſpoyling them, dropping
upon young Seedlings under it, and killing them? The ill husband,
while many of his Neigbours want ſuch Timber (nay poſſibly he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,)
there he lets his Trees ſtand, which were formerly worth 10 or
5<hi>l.</hi> a Tree, or more, till they be not worth the half that they were:
Here he loſeth the uſe of his Money, more than Twenty in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
if it be an Oak, he loſes the Bark, with the uſe of the Ground,
where 'tis likely ſeveral young Trees might have been, if that had
been taken down in time.</p>
            <p>I know that ſome perſons of Quality ſay, that this is a great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their Ground: But I think no greater than it would be to their
perſons to wear a Garment very Old, with half a skirt, a piece of a
Sleeve, and all the Trimming off. But I ſhall never pronounce ſuch
Judgement againſt trees, having ten times more Mercy. Such as be
thriving (unleſs they ſtand too thick) I would intreat you not to cut
down; for you do not loſe ſo much by ſuffering the Tree that is decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to ſtand; but you hinder you or yours as much in cutting down
a young thriving Tree.</p>
            <p>There are too many men in this Kingdom, who before they ſell
their Eſtates will many times fell off all their Timber that was good,
and which would have thriven well for many years, and ſo by the
Moneys they make of that, they lengthen out the time before they ſell.
I wiſh that my Vote (though ſingle) could perſwade thoſe men that
are reſolved to ſell ſuch Timber, that they would alſo ſell their Land
with it; and I do not queſtion but the Purchaſer (if a Lover of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as moſt Purchaſers are) would then give more for the Timber to
ſtand, by at leaſt 12<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, rather than have another man to
buy it off from his Ground. I once obſerved an Aſh-tree in the Wood-walks
at <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> which ſtood in the Walk that I made through
the Wood-walks to <hi>Hemſteed</hi> High-way; which Aſh I meaſured as
followeth, according to the cuſtomary way of meaſuring by the Line
of Numbers; it was a fine ſtraight tree, tapering a little, ſo that I
needed but to girth it in one place; it girthed juſt 72 Inches, and was
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54356:69"/>
58 foot long, from the place where the Root was ſawn off, to the place
where the head was cut off: The fourth part of 72 Inches, is 18
Inches.</p>
            <list>
               <item>The Rule is as 12,</item>
               <item>To 18 the Square in Inches,</item>
               <item>So is 58, foot the Length</item>
               <item>To a fourth Number;</item>
            </list>
            <p>And that fourth Number tells you the content in feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Extend the Compaſſes, one point fixed in 12, (the ſide in Inches
of a ſuperficial foot ſquare) to 18 Inches the ſquare of the Tree; keep
the Compaſſes fixed, and ſet one point on 58 the Length of the Tree in
feet, (but it muſt be the 58 on the left hand, or elſe the Compaſſes will
go off the Rull) and then turn the Compaſſes twice to the Right hand,
and the laſt movable point of the Compaſſes will fall upon 130 foot,
and ſomething above a half; but that Diviſion is ſo ſmall, a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
read well how much it is, if it be above half a foot: This is the
cuſtomary way with moſt men to meaſure trees, though it makes leſs
than there is, which in reaſon ought to be conſidered in the price, and
not in the falſe meaſure: but I will here ſhew you how to work both
the cuſtomary and the true way, by the Rules of Natural Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
that ſo you may trie whether you have meaſured right by the
Rule and Compaſs, or no; and alſo that you may ſee the ſweet Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between Geometry and Arithmetick.</p>
            <p>And firſt to work it by the cuſtomary way; here we take the fourth
part of the Circumference to be the ſide of the ſquare of the Tree,
(though erroneous) and meaſure it as a Cylinder. The fourth part
of 72 In. is 18 In. which multiplyed in its ſelf, gives
324, the ſuperficial Inches of one end:</p>

            <p>Then 58 (the Length) multiplyed by 12, gives 696

            <p>And 696 Inches multiplyed by 324 Inches, gives

Inches, I ſhall proceed that way:</p>

            <p>Now having the Circumference given, which is 72 Inches, we muſt

            <p>When this Tree was ſawn off a little above the Root, I told juſt 72
annual Circles; ſome of them were the greateſt that I ever yet ſaw in
any tree, and thoſe were about the middle of its Age; ſome three
made above one Inch, ſo that the tree then did grow above two Inches
in Diameter in three years time; but at firſt and of late, for ſome 6
or 7 years it did increaſe but little; for it was neer at its full growth,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54356:71"/>
ſo that if you multiply 12 the Semi-Diameter (for it was 24 Inches
at the Root-end) by 6, it gives you 72, ſo that it did grow one year
with another 2 Inches in 6 year, or one Inch in Diameter in three
years.</p>
            <p>I do not bring this Tree in for its Greatneſs, but for its quick growth,
and fine Length of Timber, which was helped by its ſituation, it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Valley, and ſet round with many other great trees. If this
tree had been ſold alone, it being ſuch a ſtraight Tree, and ſuch a tough
grane (for your great grand Trees are alwayes the tougheſt) to ſome
Pike-maker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it had been worth 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> the foot, at which price
the very timber comes to 09 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> 09 <hi>d.</hi> then the Head and Roots
would well pay for the Stocking and making up the wood, and make
up this ſumme Ten pound too.</p>
            <p>I do not bring this to compare with Trees that are and have been;
for the ingenious Author in his <hi>Diſcourſe of Forreſt-trees,</hi> pag. 84. tells
you of a Tree worth 50<hi>l.</hi> as affirmed by Capt. <hi>Bullock;</hi> but I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it to ſhew thoſe that love Trees, what Profit a thriving tree brings
them yearly: And I dare affirm, that they had better pay Uſe for
Money, than cut down a tree that ſtands in a good place, and is in a
good thriving Condition: therefore if your trees be growing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
in ſhoot, be not too haſty in felling, and when they are decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is too late, therefore let them not decay too long before you fell
them.</p>
            <p>When your Wood is come to the growth you intend to fell at, if
your Wood be thick of wood, then fell the Timber-trees and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
as cloſe to the ground as you can; but if your wood be thin,
then ſtock up your trees, eſpecially if great timber; and the Winter
after, into theſe holes where you ſtocked up the trees, ſet Elm, Cherry,
Popler, Sarvice, aud Sallow-Cuttings; ſo will theſe trees, which are
ſubject to grow from the running Roots, thicken your woods: the
Roots will pay for the ſtocking; you will ſave a ſoot or two of the beſt
of timber, and the Roots of other wood will grow the better in the
looſe ground where you made the holes: whereas the old Roots would
keep the Ground from nouriſhing, or any from growing there for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years. If your Ground be a ſhallow Soyl, do not fill up the holes
quite, but ſet in ſome Running wood, the Ground being deep by the
hills, will make the other wood grow better, and the ends of ſeveral
Roots being cut, will ſhoot forth at the ſides of the hole, and the holes
will receive Seeds which the wind will blow into them, and there being
weeds to choak them they will grow well.</p>
            <p>For theſe Reaſons I ſtocked up all the great trees which we felled
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54356:71"/>
in our Wood at <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> and I ſet in an Elm and a Cherry by the
ſides of the holes, and the Spring after there came out of the ſide-roots
of Maple, Cherry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which made good ſhoots, and many Sallows
came up in the holes, whereby our Woods were very well thicken'd,
to the Conteut of my ingenious Lord, though many people were much
againſt it, becauſe it was not uſed ſo to be done.</p>
            <p>If your Wood be thin, at every felling lay ſome boughs, which are
moſt convenient, into the thin places; and before next fall you will
have them well rooted, and good ſhoots from them; A man will doe
a great many in one day, for which you will be well ſatisfied in
time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January</hi> is the beſt time to fell Timber, but the Oak
in <hi>April;</hi> if you would have the Bark, when the Moon is decreaſing,
and the wind not Eaſt.</p>
            <p>When the Stubs of your under-woods are grown great, ſtock them
up: This is found to be good Husbandry with us in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi>
which they call Runting their Woods; it makes way for Seedlings,
and young Roots to run the better: Do this at felling-time, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you have felled Trees at the Ground. When the Roots begin to
rot they then come up beſt, then ſtock them all up, the other Wood
will grow the better, and they will pay you well for your Charge; they
will coſt you about 6 <hi>s.</hi> a Stack, and here they will be worth 12 <hi>s.</hi> or
more, when ſtocked up.</p>
            <p>When you fell your Woods or Coppices, cut them ſmooth and
cloſe to the Stub, and a little ſlanting upwards, as I adviſed you about
Lopping Pollards: the oftner you fell your Woods, Coppices, or
Hedges, the thicker they will grow; for every felling gives way to
the young Seedlings to get up, and makes the weak Plants ſhoot ſtrong.
Thoſe Woods which increaſe by running Roots, as Elm, Cherry,
Popler, Maple, Sarvice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which thicken your wood much: And
Felling makes the Roots of a tree to ſwell, as Lopping doth the Body;
and ſo it produceth the greater ſhoots, and comes ſooner to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Whereas great wood, and old, and ill taken off from the Stub, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times kills all.</p>
            <p>When you fell your Woods, leave young Trees enough; you may
take down the worſt that ſtand, next fall; eſpecially neer a great tree
that you judge may go down next fall, for by its fall it may ſpoyl ſome:
The Statute ſaith, you are to leave twelve ſcore Oaks at every Fall,
on an Acre; for want of them, ſo many Elms, Aſhes, Beeches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But leave according to the thinneſs of your wood, and where underwood
ſells well, there let your Timber-trees ſtand the thinner; and in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54356:72"/>
ſuch Countreys where Coals are cheap, and Timber ſells well, there
let your Timber-trees ſtand thick, and then they will need but little
pruning up.</p>
            <p>Endeavour to plant in your Woods ſuch ſorts of Wood as the Ground
is moſt proper for; if wet, then Alder, Sallow, Willow, Withy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
if ſhallow and dry, Aſh, Cherry, Beech, Popler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if ſhallow and
wet, Hornbeam, Sallow, Sarvice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but remember that the Oak
and Elm be entertained in all places. If your Woods or Coppices be
in Parks where you lye open to Deer, then at every Fall plant in them
ſuch woods whoſe Barks the Deer do not much love, ſuch are the
Hornbeam, Haſel, Sycamore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When Trees are at their full growth,
there be ſeveral Signs of their Decay, which give you warning to fell it
before it be quite decayed: As in an Oak, when the top-boughs begin to
die, then it begins to decay: In an Elm or Aſh, if their head dies, or
if you ſee they take wet at any great Knot, which you may know by
the ſide of the Tree being diſcolour'd below that place before it grows
hollow; or if hollow, you may know by knocking it with the head
of an Axe, of which you may be the ſurer ſatisfied by boring into the
middle of it with a ſmall Auger; or if you ſee the Nighills make holes
in it: theſe be certain Signs the Tree begins to decay, but before it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes
much, down with it, and hinder not your ſelf.</p>

            <head type="sub">How to take the heighth of a Tree ſeveral wayes, the better to

            <p>HAving ſhewed you how you may judge of Timber, whether it be
ſound or not, in the laſt Chapter, I will now ſhew you how to
take the heighth, that you may the better know the worth of it; for
where you have a Rule to go by, you may then the better gheſs.</p>
            <p>There be ſeveral wayes to take the Altitude of a Tree or Building
that is perpendicular: as by a two-foot Rule, or two Sticks joyned in
a right Angle, (that is ſquare as the Figure A. B. C. having at A. a pin
or hole to hang a Thred and Plummet on.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you were to take the height of X Y, firſt then hold that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54356:72"/>
end of your ſquare marked with C. to your Eye, then goe backward
or forward, till the Thred and Plummet hang juſt upon the middle of
your Square, perpendicular, and your eye looking through two ſights,
or two Pins at A. and C. or over the ends of the Square, thus look to
the very top of the Building at X.</p>
            <p>(See Fig. 8, 9.)</p>
            <p>Which found, with a Line and Plummet from your Eye at C, let
fall to the Ground at D, meaſure the length of that Line, and adde it
to the height, that Length to E; then meaſure the diſtance from E. to
the foot of the Altitude, as at Y, and that (if your Ground be level) is
the height of of X. Y.</p>
            <p>Or take the Level from your Eye to the height, and adde that
which is below the Level to the Height, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Line C. F. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>To find the height of a Tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by a ſtraight Staffe, or by a Line
and Plummet, the Sun ſhining, the Altitude perpendicular, and the
Ground Level; if not, you muſt make the end of both the ſhadows
level to each foot, which is ſoon done.</p>
            <p>As if I ſhould take the Level of B. at C. finding the very top of the
ſhadow to End there, I meaſure the Diſtance from C. to B. and find
it 60 foot; then at that very inſtant I ſet up a ſtick perpendicular, as
E. D. 12 foot long, which I find to caſt a ſhadow juſt 9 foot; and then
the Rule orders it ſelf thus: As 9 foot to 12, ſo 60 foot to 80, which
you will find true, if you work it by Logarithmes, or by Rule and
Compaſs thus; Set one point on 9, extend the other to 12, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
will reach from 60 to 80: Or if you work it by Natural Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick:
as 9 is to 12, ſo 60 to 80.</p>

               <p>Thus have I ſhew'd you how to take the height of a Tree, or any
other Altitude, ſeveral wayes; now if you would judge the worth of a
Tree ſtanding, firſt take the height to the very top, or neer it; then
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54356:74"/>
take the Height of the Length of Timber, ſo far as your Reaſon tells
you you might meaſure it if it were down; ſubſtract the Length of the
Timber from the Length of the height of the whole Tree, there then
remains the Length of the head. Thus have you the Length of the
Timber and Head; Next of all ſet a Ladder to your Tree, and girt it
in ſuch place as is moſt convenient, allowing for the Bark; then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the cuſtomary way of meaſuring, you may know the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Timber, and ſo conſequently the worth of the Timber, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the price where the Timber is ſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Timber of the Tree may thus, eaſily, and neer to the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be gheſſed at: The head will be more difficult, becauſe of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Forms they grow in; and beſides, ſome Timber-trees head much
lower than others, ſo that for want of helping up, either by their not
ſtanding near others to draw or help one another up, or for want of
pruning up while young, they head low, and run into great Arms of
good lengths of Timber; with ſuch Trees you muſt goe the higher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Arms, accompting them with the Timber as your Reaſon will
beſt direct you.</p>
               <p>Now then to eſtimate this head by Rule, I do judge, that if all the
boughs of the head of moſt Trees were in an intire piece, from the
place where they were cut off from the Timber, to the very top; the
neareſt (and I ſuppoſe exacteſt) Figure of any would be a Cone, or
near to a Conical form that the head ends in: For we ſee that when
a Tree is headed, it breaks out into a great many ſhoots, and as the
Tree growes higher in the Lop, ſome of theſe ſhoots decay, ſtill the
more endeavouring to end in the figure of a Conical Body: and ſo the
head of your Pollard-trees being greater than the Body, is occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Sap ſwelling that place, endeavouring to break out neareſt
to where it was accuſtomed to go up the boughs, it ſearcheth for a
paſſage, till it can contain it ſelf no longer, and ſo ſwells the head.</p>
               <p>This head commonly goeth with the boughs, and doth the better
help them to be allowed this Form, whileſt young; ſo that take a tree
headed or never headed, it ſtill ends in this Figure, nearer than any
other, eſpecially thoſe that never were headed: this being then the
neareſt Figure part of the head can be reduced into, this being granted,
it is as eaſily meaſured; for if you multiply the Baſis by one third of
the Altitude, the ſolid Content of the Figure is had, which you may
value at ſuch a price as Fire-wood beareth with you.</p>
               <p>I will give you one Example, and it ſhall be of an Aſh, which was
felled in a place called the <hi>Old Orchard,</hi> by the Stables at <hi>Caſhiobury:</hi>
This tree I obſerved by ſeveral of the Rules before, and found it to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54356:75"/>
be 80 foot high from the ground to the top-ſhoot; I alſo obſerved the
height of the Timber to be 56 foot long; by the ſame Rules then,
ſetting a Ladder to this Tree about 25 foot high, I girthed it with a
pack-thred (which place I took for the middle girth being the Tree
did not taper) and it girthed 64 Inches upon the Bark; But moſt men
that buy timber by the foot, have the Bark taken off at the girthingplace,
or an Allowance for the Bark; but you may readily know the
girth of the Tree under the Bark, though the Tree be ſtanding or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without ever taking off the Bark, or making Allowance by gheſs,
as ſome doe; which to perform, find with your Penknife, or Prickers,
the thickneſs of the Bark, or you may cut a hole thorow the Bark
in the girthing-places, or two or three holes, and then obſerve the
mean thickneſs: As on the foreſaid Tree, the Bark was half an Inch
thick, doubled makes one Inch, ſo then the tree is leſs by one Inch in the
Diameter when the Bark is off; then by this general Rule, as 22 is to
7, ſo is the Circumference to the Diameter.</p>

Inches and 8/22; then to find the true Circumference under the Bark,
agreeing to this Diameter; ſay thus, As 7 to 22, ſo is 19 8/22, to 61,
the Circumference, or near it.</p>
                  <p>For if you extend the Compaſſes from 7 to 22, the ſame will reach
from 19 8/22 to 61, very near.</p>
                  <p>Or you may turn this 8 into a Decimal Fraction, for as 22 is to

may in a moment find the Circumference under the Bark, which here
we find to be 61, then according to the cuſtomary way of meaſuring,
(though not the true way) take one fourth part of the Circumference,
and ſay, As 12 is to this ¼ part of the Circumference in Inches, ſo
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54356:75"/>
is the Length in feet twice repeated, to the content in feet or parts.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="example">
                  <head>Examp.</head>
                  <p>The fourth part of 61 is 15 and ¼ Inches, extend your Compaſſes
from the point 12. on your Line of Numbers, to 15 ¼: that extent will
reach from 56 to 91 foot and neer a half, being twice turned to the
Right hand, which muſt alwayes be if the ¼ of your Circumference be
more than 12 Inches, if leſs, then to the Left hand.</p>
                  <p>Thus having found the Timber of this Tree to be 91 foot and a
half (which muſt be valued according to the worth of Timber in the
place where you are) here I will value it at 12 <hi>d.</hi> the foot, (though it
was ſold with courſer Timber at an under-price) this at 12 <hi>d.</hi> the foot,
comes to 4 <hi>l.</hi> 11 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> Now to meaſure the head of this Tree accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our ſuppoſed Rule aforeſaid, if you take 56 (the Length of the
Timber) from 80 (the height of the Tree) there remains 24 foot for
the head: This 24 foot, which is the head, two parts of it I meaſure
as a ſolid Cylinder, and one part as a Cone: for if you girt all the
boughs a little above where they break out from the Timber, and adde
the ſeveral girths together, they will girth more than the Timber
where the head was cut off; two parts of the 24 foot is 16, which I
meaſure by the ſame Rule I did the Timber, by the Line of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and the ſame Girt.</p>
                  <p>As 12 is to 15½ (the ſquare in Inches,)</p>
                  <p>So is 16 (the Length in feet twice repeated) to 26 foot ¾ for the
⅔ of the Head:</p>
                  <p>Now for the ⅓ of the Head, which muſt be meaſured as a ſolid Cone,
we muſt find the Baſis, and multiply the Content thereof by one third
of the Altitude.</p>
                  <p>The Circumference of the Baſis was 61, but I will take it now for
60 Inches; then as before, As 22 is to 7, ſo is 60 (the Circumference)
to the Diameter, which is 19 and a little more; that which is more I
neglect, as not worth minding in ſuch a buſineſs as this.</p>
                  <p>Half 60 is 30, half 19 is 9 and ½.
<hi>Ex.</hi> to work it by the Line of Numbers:</p>
                  <p>Extend the Compaſſes from 1 to 9 and ½, the ſame will reach from
30 to 285, the Content in Inches of the Baſis, then ⅓ of 8 foot is 32
Inches;</p>

Inches, which divided by 1728 (the In. in
one foot ſquare) is 5 foot and ¼, and a little
more; this added to 26 foot ¾, make 32 foot
for the Head, which at a Groat <hi>per</hi> foot,

                  <p>So according to theſe Rules, this Tree was worth 5 <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> there
was of the Head one Stack, and near a quarter, and 12 Faggots; it
coſt 3 <hi>s. per</hi> Stack to cut out, and was worth in the place where it ſtood,
10 <hi>s.</hi> You ſee how near the Rule agrees with this tree; but if the tree
ſtands hanging down hill, it will then endanger the Timber in falling;
or if you fear the Timber to be faulty, or ſome of the Arms blown off,
you muſt judge-accordingly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is oft found in your great Elms and Aſhes, that they be hollow
within and yet good Timber on the out-ſides, eſpecially ſome length
of them toward or at the lower end: Now I will ſhew you how you
may judge very near the Quantity of Timber that is in one of theſe
trees, or a piece of them, according to the cuſtomary way.</p>

one end 12 Inches Diameter, at the other end hollow and decayed
6 Inches Diam. The piece was 26 Inches Diameter under the Bark.
Firſt I meaſure the piece as if all ſound Timber, then the hollow and

            <head>CHAP. XXXVIII.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of making Walks, Avenues, or Lawns.</head>
            <p>AS for making of Walks in Gardens, I ſhall not ſpeak of that in
this place, becauſe I have reſolved to keep my walk without the
walls: there are ſeveral Books of Gardening that have many Drafts
and Knots in them, but they be all done by gheſs, and none of them
fitted to a ſcale, to inform what Ground they be moſt proper for; ſo
that they be as fit for Butter-Prints as for Knots in a Garden.</p>
            <p>Moſt Walks that are made abroad, they either terminate, or end,
or lead to the Front of a Houſe, or Door, or Garden-gate, or other
Gate, High-way, or Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if you would make a Walk
from any one of theſe, and have reſolved upon the Center or Middle
Line of the Walk, as the Middle of a Door in the Front of a houſe, or
the like, there pitch up a ſtraight ſtake, and then from the ſquare of
the Front, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> raiſe a Perpendicular from this Stake, and at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
diſtance in this perpendicular Line, ſet up another ſtake; let
theſe two ſtakes be two little ſtakes at firſt, but that at the Centre al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the higheſt; theſe two ſtakes being thus fixed, and you fully
concluding them to be in the Mid-line, then come to the Centre-ſtake,
and having in readineſs a Quantity of Stakes, according to the Length
of your Walk, bid one of your aſſiſtance go as far as you can well ſee
back-ſight and fore-ſight, and there by the motion of your hand or
hat, and his own back-ſight, let him fix upright one ſtake as exactly as
may be in the Line, then take up the two little ſtakes, and at the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
fix in a ſtake ſix foot high, ſtraight and upright, with paper on the
top, and exactly in the place where the little ſtake ſtood: Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got two ſtakes placed (the Middle-ſtake and the Centre-ſtake,)
you may if your Walk be level, and the ground clear, and the Walk
not above one mile long, ſet up one ſtake at the End, in the Mid-line;
looking over the head of that ſtake and the other, moving it till theſe
three ſtakes be in a Right Line; ſo may you have the middle line of
your walk by theſe three ſtakes exacter than by more: for the fewer
ſtakes you uſe in your mid-line, the better; becauſe that if you be but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54356:77"/>
once a little amiſs, the more ſtakes are uſed, you will be ſo much the
further out of the right way.</p>
            <p>And note, it is better to take your ſight over the head of your ſtakes,
than to look by their ſides; therefore you muſt have the Center ſtake
higheſt, the next a little ſhorter, and ſo the next ſhorter than that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but if your Ground be not level, then order your ſtakes accordingly,
as thus:</p>
            <p>And if your Ground be not level, or be of ſuch a length, that you
cannot well ſee from End to End, then you muſt place down more
ſtakes, <hi>viz.</hi> between the Middle-ſtake and Centre-ſtake one, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Middle and End-ſtake one, if need require more. I have
oft made uſe of a ſight-ſtake, which I had only to find the place where
my other ſtakes ſhould ſtand; this ſtake was made with a ſlit in the
head half a foot deep, which I looked through over the heads of the
reſt, till I found the place where to ſet my ſtake right in the Mid-line:
It is of good uſe, and <hi>Fig.</hi> 13. may ſomewhat repreſent it; you may
make it to ſlide up and down, the better to come to the Level of the
head of the ſtakes.</p>
            <p>(See Fig. 13.)</p>
            <p>When you take ſight, to ſet any ſtake true in a Line with others,
ſtand at a little diſtance with your Eye from the head of the ſtake, ſo
ſhall you ſet it Exacter in the Line than when your Eye touches the
head of the ſtake; ſet your ſtake ſo that you may onely ſee three ſtakes
in a Line: let your Walk be of what length it will.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſtaked out your Mid-line, ſtrain a Line in this Mid-line,
and lay a ſquare to that Line, ſo ſet off the breadth of your Walk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
ſquare to your Middle-line, then ſet up ſtakes (as you did) againſt
every ſtake in the Middle of the Walk, and when you have got the
Lines true, where your Trees muſt ſtand, then drive down Oak-ſtakes
in the Line to the head, and then it is but putting down high ſtakes by
theſe when you come to ſet your Trees.</p>
            <p>Then having reſolved on the diſtance to ſet your Trees at, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
good ſtore of ſmall ſtakes, take your Chain (and not a Line, for
that will retch and ſhrink) and with your help ſet little ſtakes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in this Line, and ſquare where you would have every Tree to
ſtand, theſe ſtakes are to make your holes by, which I would have at
leaſt three foot wide, and two foot deep, and the holes made a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a Year before you ſet your Trees; if it were a year 'twere the
better, keeping the Mould turn'd over now and then, and mixing it
with Earth or Dung, if need be; then when the time of Planting is
come, begin betimes; however, on dry ground; ſet up Stakes by every
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54356:77"/>
Oak-ſtake you left in the Row before, having pruned the Roots and
Heads to an equal height, ſet them right one Tree againſt another
ſquare.</p>
            <p>And if your Trees be not all of one Size, ſet the greateſt firſt, right
one againſt another, and ſo leſſer and leſſer by degrees, minding that
both Rows go on ſquare together; and be ſure you mind to let your
Trees be at equal diſtance from End to End; then if you have a point
fixed at both Ends, you muſt run over that diſtance you reſolve to
plant your Trees at, before you ſet your Stakes, and if you find it is
over or ſhort of equal diſtances, then muſt you adde or ſubſtract this
odde open to or from the reſt, to make them all of equal diſtance.
See <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p>Now having your Trees and all things in Readineſs, ſet them by
the Stakes ſtanding in the Rows, minding to ſet every Tree to range
with the Stakes by back-ſight and fore-ſight: Cover and part the Roots
with fine Mould; and when they be all covered, lay on ſome Rotten
Dung over that Mould, and then cover that Dung with a little Mould:
this Dung will keep them from friezing in Winter, and from drying
too much in Summer; and alſo well prepares the water for the Roots.
Thus having ſet them, take care to fence them in at ſuch places where
need is, ſo will you as well as I reap a great ſatisfaction, if you let
not the Dung touch the Roots.</p>
            <p>Do not mask a fine Front, nor vail a pleaſant Proſpect (as too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doe) by making the Walks too narrow. If you make any Walk
that leads to any pleaſant Front of a Houſe, or other Object; if it be
but half a mile long, let it be at leaſt forty foot wide, but if longer,
more, as 50 or 60 foot wide, or the breadth the length of your Front;
But if you be for walks of ſhade, then make three Walks, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
one 40, the two out-ſide walks each 20 foot, or 50 and 25 the out-ſide
walks, or divide your Front into two parts, and let the middle be
as broad as both the ſide-walks; ſo that if you make three walks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
let the middle one be as much as both the other, ſo will the Trees
range much the better, whether you ſet them ſquare or triangular; but
however keep to one of them, though I think the ſquare to be the beſt,
becauſe then four Trees in the four Rows end all together, fit to end
in either Semicircle, ſegment of a Circle, Oval, Triangle, or Circle;
for all walks of any Length, eſpecially in Parks, ſhould end in ſome one
of theſe Figures, or lead into ſome other walk; but where they doe
fall into another walk, there ſhould be a Circle to receive them, or elſe
they ſeem much defective.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now endeavour to ſhew you how to make a walk through a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54356:78"/>
wood, and then I will give you an Example of ſome of the Figures
that Walks ought to end in.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you were to clear a Walk or Line through a Wood, for
to run the Mid-line true about three yards wide; having the Centre
given, doe as before, run your Mid-line as far as you can into the wood,
and at one yard diſtance on each ſide the Mid-line, two other Lines;
Run theſe Lines alſo as far as you can into the wood, keeping them
juſt one yard diſtant, and ſetting up ſtakes (as you proceed into the
wood) with large whites, all of a bigneſs, as half a ſheet of white Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
on every Stake ſpread abroad; when any of theſe three Lines come
to a Tree, run on the other two till you are paſt the Tree, and then
ſet him off again in its place, parallel to his fellowes, and ſo proceed
till you be through the Wood, marking that wood which muſt goe
down; then when your under-wood is ſtocked up, run out your Line
again; ſtill when you come to a Tree, ſet off Parallels; and when
paſt, ſet off into your true Line again: This way I cut a ſtraight Line
through the Wood-walk at <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> from the North front, over
one wall and ſeveral Hedges, neer a mile long, and when I came to
ſtake it out true, there was at the very end not four foot difference, as
the ingenious <hi>Hugh May</hi> Eſq; can witneſs, and ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>This way of ſtaking out a walk by three Lines is worth your practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
in ſetting out of Walks that go through Hedges or Buſhes, be
ſure to carry on the Mid-line of the walk, and the two Lines where
the Trees muſt goe, together; now and then meaſuring to ſee if they keep
their equal diſtances, and that which is amiſs you will ſoon find, and
may as ſoon rectifie it again.</p>
            <p>There is another way of carrying a ſtraight Line through a Wood,
which Reaſon taught me, and by Experience I have found true: the
place where the middle of the walk ſhould poynt to, being given, there
hang up a large Candle and Lanthorn, and having found the Mid-line
ſome 20, 30, or 40 yards from that, there hang up another, they muſt
both hang pretty high, but let that next the Houſe or Center be the
higher; having thus placed your two Lights, and in a clear calm night
(but not too light) goe with your Man to the further ſide of the wood,
till you make both theſe Lights in one Line, and then walk on, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them ſo, marking the Trees on each ſide of you, quite through the
Wood, order them to be cut down at leiſure; ſo ſhall you have a
ſtraight Line cut through the Wood.</p>
            <p>But if you are to make a walk from Gate to Gate, ſo that you are
tied to ſuch a Center at each End, if your walk be ſo that you can ſee
from End to End, it is then but ſetting up two Stakes, one at each end,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54356:78"/>
by the ſight of which cauſe a third to be ſet up in the middle: But if
you cannot ſee to the far End, for Hill, Wood, or the like, then you
muſt cauſe an high Pole, with a white on the top, to be ſet up at the
End, by that and your Centre-ſtake cauſe your Aſſiſtants to ſet up as
many as you think convenient in the Mid-line; but if that wood be
ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> high that you cannot ſee a high Pole at the End, then run it over as
near as you can by gheſs, take notice of the Length, and of your Error
at End and ¼ and ½ and ¾ each; at a Quarter of the Length of your
walk ſet off a quarter of your Error, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus bring your Line
till it ranges exactly from one point to another, from Gate to Gate;
then ſet off the two Lines where the Trees muſt goe (as is before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
by the ſquare, and if for three walks, then the four Rows of Trees;
if there be three Walks, let the Middle-walk be juſt as broad as both
the other, which is the beſt Form; or elſe all three of equal breadth,
ſo may you ſet your Trees not onely ſquare, but they will anſwer one
another ſeveral wayes beſide, as ſquare from A. to B. and other wayes,
as B. to C. and to D. ſo that every Tree muſt keep his Row, Range,
Square, and equal Diſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(See Fig. 14.)</p>
            <p>The pricked Lines ſhew how the ſight will take the Trees as ſquare
from A. to B. and Angle-wayes from C. to B. or C. to D. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed you how to ſtake out the Mid-line, and the two
ſide-lines of your walk: I wiſh Sir <hi>E. T.</hi> Sir <hi>W. B.</hi> and Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> had
ſeen theſe Directions before they had planted their walks; I do judge
they then would have done them better: For Errors in planting make
too many worthy Perſons forbear.</p>
            <p>Now as for the Figures which walks ought to end in, I have named
them before; and if you obſerve, moſt Plants (eſpecially Trees) which
make your Walks, the moſt of them end in a Circular figure; and
therefore I will ſhew you ſome wayes how Walks ought to end in a
Circle: For a walk ending bluntly without any Figure or entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, may be compared to a Tree with the Head off, and what
difference there is, let thoſe which well obſerve the Objects of Nature
judge. Let the Circle be three times the Breadth of your walk, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
you can, or bigger if you have Room.</p>
            <p>After you have found the Mid-line, and reſolved upon the Centre,
as at A. and of the Bigneſs of your Circle, next conſider of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of your Trees round the Circle; run that diſtance over firſt, and
if you find an odde Tree, let it ſtand in the Mid-line, and in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
as at B. but if no odde Tree, then let the Mid-line paſs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54356:79"/>
tween two Trees, adding or ſubſtracting the odde Inches, till you find
the equal diſtance your Trees muſt ſtand at, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(See Fig. 15.)</p>
            <p>Let the Trees in your Circle ſtand not much above half the diſtance
that the Trees are in the Rowes, as in the laſt they were 16 foot <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere,
Trees in the walk 24 foot, but in the Oval thicker, that they may
ſhew the Figure the better; A fine Tree in the Centre of all Circles
doth well.</p>
            <p>(See Fig. 16.)</p>
            <p>Two Walks meeting in a Point, let that be the Centre of the Circle,
as at A. and there a Tree.</p>
            <p>Two Walks croſſing one another, where the Mid line meets let that
be the Centre of a Circle, as B.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note:</hi> That if your Circle be divided into two parts, by Walks, as
the Circle A. find a diſtance that the Trees in each part may ſtand as
neer that diſtance as may be, there they be near 11 foot both, and the
Circle B. neer 10 foot aſunder.</p>
            <p>Now the ſmaller parts the Circle is put into, the thicker ſet your
Trees round it; as B. is put into four parts by the two Walks croſſing
it; ſet theſe parts the thicker that they may ſhew the Figure the
better.</p>
            <p>Of three Walks going up to a Circle, as they doe to the Bowling-Green
at <hi>Caſhiobury</hi> (which Green is 80 yards, or 240 foot diameter,
with a border 16 foot wide, planted with three Rowes of Spruce-firs,
ſet in the year 1672. being ſet Circular and Triangular,) ſee the Figure:
there are 90 trees in the outer Row, and 90 Trees in the innermoſt Row,
and 89 in the middle Row, which is 269 trees; I loſt not one of theſe,
except one that was ſtollen.</p>
            <p>(See Fig. 17.)</p>
            <p>To plant ſuch a Border, firſt with a Line on the Centre B. mark out
the Circle where the inner Row ſhould goe, then ſet two Trees in
the Circle, and in the Rows of the VValk, as at A. A. then having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
of the diſtance to ſet them at, run that Diſtance over from A. A.
and the odde Inches or parts adde or ſubſtract, according to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Opens, to or from the Meaſure you firſt reſolved on, as is
ſhewed before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Next I ſhall ſhew you ſome wayes how VValks may come into or
end in a Semi-circle, or Segment of a Circle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as A. being a Gate,

B. C. is a Hedge or Pale, A. is the Centre of the middle of the VValk

broad, or to order it to what proportion you pleaſe.</head>
               <p>Suppoſe the three Walks to be each forty foot wide, which makes
120 foot, then there is to be 40 foot without one ſide-walk, and 40
foot without the other ſide-walk, and 40 foot between each of the
ſide-walks, and the Middle-walk, which is four times 40 foot, that is,
160 foot; ſo that the 120 foot makes 280 foot for the Arch of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle,

(See Fig. 20.)</p>
               <p>Let the Centre A. be in a ſtraight Line with the pricked Line B. B.
and parallel to the Middle-walk C. the Line B. A. B. may be (if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
ſerve) 50 or 60 foot from the wall, pale, hedge, and that to
goe parallel to that Line; and where the wall or pale ends, there may
be a Row of Trees continued ſo far as you pleaſe or can, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At the

ſaw a Semi-circle ſet out ſomewhat like this, where I ſaw a great deal
of meaſuring before they could proportion it exactly to ſuch a place
as was intended: I took my Pen, and by theſe Rules I told them juſtly
how far they ſhould goe. More I could ſay, if I thought it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable

with three, four, or five Trees on each ſide, and parallel to the
Middle-walk, as is in the ſecond Figure of Semi-circles; but be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to make ſuch a Figure for your Walks to end in, and of ſuch a

may be one Row of Trees, (as in the Figure) or two, three,
four, or more, as you pleaſe; but three Rows ſet triangular do very

               <head>4. How and where a Semi-circle is proper on the ſide of a Walk,
&amp;c.</head>
               <p>Suppoſe you have a Walk a Mile in length or more, it is no
wayes improper, but pleaſant and ſatisfactory to have your Walks
ſhew you every ¼ of a Mile, ½ of a Mile, and ¾, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the End;
or from each End, or from one End back to the other; as if you begin
at the Centre-tree in the Semi-circle at A. then at ¼ of a Mile at the
Figure 1. make a Semi-circle to break out on the Right hand, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre-tree
to be exactly in the Row of the Walk, and juſt a quarter of
a mile, as is ſhewed in the Figure as well as the Largeneſs of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
would bear by the Semi-circle Figure 1; then at the half mile let
two Trees ſtand in a Semi-circle, at Figure 2, one to ſtand in the Row
that makes the walk, which two Trees is half a mile, and at three
quarters three Trees; ſtill minding that one be in the Row or Walk
the Centre-tree of your Circle, and the exact diſtance: So one Tree the
Centre of the Semi-circle, as at Figure 1. is a ¼ of a mile; two Trees
as at Figure 2 is ½ a mile, three Trees as at Figure 3 is ¾ of a mile:</p>
               <p>(See Fig. 21.)</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:54356:80"/>
               <p>Though the Figure doth not ſhow well, becauſe the ſmallneſs of the
Paper will not allow Room to draw the diſtance of miles, as the Trees
are according to Scale, (though my ſcale is here for the diſtance of the
Trees 160 foot for one Inch) yet I preſume, where this is really acted
in Walks, it will do well: I here begin at the Centre-tree in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-circle,
and in the Right-hand Row, ſhewing how the ¾ of the mile
may be ſet out, and ſhewed by the Semi-circles on the ſides; at the
other End, I begin at the Centre of the Circle, and ſo ſhew the ¼, ½,
and ¾, how they may be ſet out on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>Or if you pleaſe, you may have a Tree in the Mid-line of your
Walk, at every quarter of a mile, with a Circle to break round that
Tree three times the breadth of the Walk, which Tree muſt be pruned
up high, or elſe it will hinder the Proſpect of your Walk, (I fanſie the
other way is beſt) as let a Tree ſtand at every ¼ of a mile, as you ſee
in the Figure.</p>
               <p>(See Fig. 22.)</p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewed you how Walks may end in Circles, or Semi-circles,
I ſhall now ſhew how Walks may end or come into an Oval,
and how it ſometimes happens that an Oval is the beſt Figure that
Walks can End in.</p>
               <p>If three Walks meet acutely at one place, then it will be neceſſary
to have the Mid-line of the three Walks meet at a Tree in the ſide of
an Oval; for if you make that poynt the Centre of a Circle, it will
be too large, 'tis poſſible larger than your Ground will permit; as at
<hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> where the three Walks meet by <hi>Hemſted</hi> High-way; for
if I had made the Circle from the aforeſaid Centre, and made the Semi-di3ameter
ſo large as to have in the Circumference the two Trees mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
A. A. which rangeth for both Walks, then would this Circle have
been too great, and beſide could not be made within the Pale: Now
I having Orders from my Lord, that the Mid-line of theſe three Walks
ſhould meet at a Tree, as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 23. they doe at B. and that I ſhould
make the Figure ſo large as that the Wood which is between the
Middle-walk, and the two out-ſide Walks, ſhould end at a Tree which
ſhould ſtand exactly in the Range of Trees, for the Middle-walk, and
alſo for the in-ſide Rows of the two out-walks; by conſidering I found
the Oval to ſuit beſt with this ground; ſo I having theſe two Trees,
as at A. A. and the Poynt as at B. which I took for the Breadth of the
Oval, accordingly I made it. See the Figure.</p>
               <p>Length of the Oval is 205 foot, Breadth 124 foot, Middle-walk
50 foot, the ſide-walks each 40 foot wide, having wood between the
VValks, and round the Oval.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:54356:81"/>
(See Fig. 23.)</p>
               <p>Now having the two Trees as at A A. and the Centre-tree of the
three Walks B. from the Mid-line of the middle-walk, and in the middle
of that Line between A A. and B. draw a perpendicular Line, which
ſheweth the Length of the Oval; at each End ſet a Tree, as C. C. then
divide the diſtance between the Centre-tree at B. and the End-trees at
C. C. which let be at ſuch a diſtance as may beſt ſuit with the ſix Trees
between D. and C. on each ſide; here the Trees between B. and C.
are ten foot ten Inches diſtance, and the Trees between D. and C. are
10 foot 9 Inches diſtance; Let alwayes the Trees that make either
Oval or Circle ſtand pretty nigh, they ſhew this or any other Figure
the better: For this no certain diſtance can be given, but they muſt
be ſet at ſuch a diſtance as the Arch-line can be divided into, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall ſhew you how to know the Length of an Arch-line, and how
to make an Oval or other Figure hereafter.</p>
               <p>This Oval and Walks are ſurrounded with Wood, and alſo between
the Walks ending at a Tree, as at A A. you may make broader at your
pleaſure, or you may alter the Oval in ſhape or bigneſs, as your
Ground and Fancy ſhall direct you. Your Oval may be ſurrounded
with a double or treble Row of Trees if you fanſie it, and indeed if it
be in a place where it is not encompaſſed with wood, it is very proper:
An Oval or a Circle, are very good Figures for Ponds, though they
be not in uſe:</p>
               <p>Now for making Walks to end in a Triangle, this may be ſeveral
wayes, according to your Fancy or Ground: But I confeſs I never yet
ſaw or heard of any Walk in <hi>England</hi> or elſewhere that ended in ſuch
a Figure; But why may not the beſt of Figures be neglected by the
Ingenious Survey or both at home and abroad, as well as we ſee many
Excellent things known to ſeveral ingenious men, which are practiſed
by few.</p>
               <p>Having made at the End of Walks, Semi-circles, Circles and Ovals
of ſeveral ſorts, and notwithſtanding that I had at the end of the three
VValks that goe from the Garden to the Bowling-green, that end next
the Garden, a Figure given me by a worthy perſon (but how proper
for that place I ſhall not now ſpeak) I nevertheleſs neglected that, and
made the Triangle as is ſhewed by <hi>Figure</hi> 24. The trees I ſet the cloſer,
becauſe this being a Front of the houſe intended to be hid at a diſtance
all but the breadth of the VValks, therefore I choſe this Figure as
much proper for ſuch a deſign.</p>
               <p>(See Fig. 24.)</p>
               <p>This Line according to Scale is the Length of the Garden-walk, the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54356:81"/>
Break in the middle againſt the great Walk, is a Grate which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to front it.</p>
               <p>This Figure might be much improved if it were made a little larger,
ſo that the inner Row of the Triangles might range a little without the
End of the Garden wall, and at that end a walk to take it, to goe by
the Garden-ſide; ſo might you have a convenient by-way without the
VValls, from the 20 foot VValk, along either VValk of the Triangles,
to the walk by the Garden-ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other ſorts of Triangles proper for VValks to end
in, but for Shade I preferre this or the next following; if you would
have the Trees to ſhew the ſhape of their heads, then a ſingle Row is
beſt, as the out-Row of the Triangle-walk.</p>
               <p>(See Fig. 25.)</p>
               <p>For a Court you would have ſhaded with Trees, this Figure will
do well.</p>
               <p>In this laſt Figure you may let the little VValk end Parallel with
the VVall, and have no VValks by the ſide-walls; or you may make
onely one VValk on each ſide.</p>
               <p>As for making of the Triangle at the End of your Walk, it may
be Analogically according to your Ground; though theſe two be made
obtuſe, the perpendicular half the Length of the Baſe: there be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſorts of Triangles or triangular Figures; but theſe we have here
made are called <hi>Ambligone;</hi> that is, a Triangle which hath one obtuſe
and two acute Angles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewed you moſt of the Regular Figures through which
a Walk may paſs, or in which a Walk may end, I ſhall now ſhew
how a VValk may paſs through a Square, and ſo proceed.</p>
               <p>(See Fig. 26.)</p>
               <p>You may make your VValks according to this Figure, or you may
have the VValks break into the Square in the Middle, on every ſide,
which Figure will do well with a Tree in the Centre, where the prick
is, Thus:</p>
               <p>(See Fig. 27.)</p>
               <p>How a VValk may end in a Square, may well be perceived by this
laſt Figure; beſides, it is common in many places to be ſeen, yet in my
Opinion is not ſo convenient for a VValk to end in as the aforſaid Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures;
from theſe foregoing you may make ſeveral others, according
to your Ground: for it is a good Rule to <hi>Cut your Coat according to
your Cloath;</hi> and to proportion the Figure your VValk ends in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the beſt convenience of your Ground.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:54356:82"/>
                  <l>Let not your hand alwayes for Copies ſtay,</l>
                  <l>But let an active Fancy lead your way.</l>
                  <l>Proportion ſtill your Figure to your Ground,</l>
                  <l>Whether it be Triangle, Square, or Round.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Some of theſe Figures are alſo the beſt to make your Lawns, that is,
a ſpacious Plane joyning to your Houſe; which let be in Largeneſs
according as your Ground will permit, as 100 Acres or more.</p>
               <p>This Lawn is moſt convenient to be on the South ſide, or Eaſt ſide of
your Houſe: For if it be on the VVeſt ſide, it giveth the more way
for the weſt wind (which is moſt commonly the greateſt) to harm your
Houſe, by its free paſſage thereto: Alſo if your beſt Rooms front your
Lawn, as they alwayes ſhould doe, the Afternoon being the moſt uſual
time in which great Perſons do ſolace themſelves in theſe principal
Rooms, the Afternoon Sun will then be Offenſive to ſuch Rooms, and
the Proſpect will both be hindred and not ſo pleaſant; for the Sun by
ſhining againſt you and from the Object, doth by both hinder your
Proſpect; and moſt Proſpects are moſt pleaſant when the Sun ſhineth
on them. Theſe Inconveniences, which ariſe from your Lawns being
on the weſt ſide of your Houſe, being conſidered, I thence conclude,
by the Rule of Contraries, that it is moſt convenient for your Lawn to
be on the Eaſt ſide of your Houſe; for there you have your Rooms
ſhady in the Afternoon, the Objects which you view from your houſe
much beautified by the Sun ſhining upon them in the Afternoon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the aforeſaid Reaſons your Lawn may do very well on the South
ſide of your Houſe; for the Sun ſhining moſt part of the day on that
ſide of your Houſe, doth much adde to the beauty of that Front, which
ought to be the beſt Front of your Houſe; therefore a large Lawn
on that ſide, doth much help the Proſpect to the Houſe, and alſo
from it.</p>
               <p>A Lawn on the North ſide is no wayes convenient, for that layes your
Houſe too open to the cold North winds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVherefore, let your
North and VVeſt ſides be planted with VVoods, Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Square is no ill Figure for a Lawn, thus: VVhere there may be
three Avenues break out at the three Angles, or one at the Angle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to the Houſe: And if your Lawn be Riſing Ground to the Houſe,
ſome Trees ſet thin on the Lawn will be very pleaſant. (<hi>See Fig.</hi> 28.)</p>
               <p>Your Lawn may be bounded with VValks, if you pleaſe, which in
this Figure will do well, or you may have a ſingle Row of Line-trees
to bound your Lawn with, ſet at a good diſtance one from another, they
will ſhew the ſhape of their heads the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:54356:82"/>
As the Pricks are on the Lawn, ſo may your Trees ſtand, but leave the
Front clear, except the Lawn be much falling Ground from the Houſe:</p>
               <p>Let the Figure of the Houſe be in the form of theſe two, (<hi>Fig.</hi> 28, 29.)
or any other, yet let the Lawn be on both ſides the Front alike, making
an Angle at the middle of the Front, or at ſome Court gate right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, and breaking off (as you ſee in the <hi>Fig.</hi>) at a convenient diſtance
from the Houſe: A ſingle Row of Line-trees ſet at 4 Rod diſtance, as
they be in the <hi>Fig.</hi> will be pleaſant to bound your Lawn.</p>
               <p>(See Fig. 29.)</p>
               <p>From theſe two you may make ſeveral, but ſtill mind to make ſuch
as will beſt fit your Ground.</p>
               <p>A Circle is a good Figure for a Lawn, onely it muſt break off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it comes againſt the Front.</p>
               <p>A Triangle is alſo a very proper Figure for a Lawn, but let it not
be too Acute at the Angle which leads to the Front, but rather Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe,
or right angled at the Angle next the Front, as in the two laſt
Figures. I have often obſerved ſome Fields lying in the form of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,
leading up between two Woods or large Hedges, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I have ſeen a Houſe at the Angle; this hath been very pleaſant
to my fancy, eſpecially when it hath aſcended up hill, and hath had the
South, South-eaſt, or Eaſt Aſpect: Now if Noble-men and Gentlemen
that have Ground convenient, would but make ſome ſuch Lawns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Houſes, it would be very pleaſant, and a great Ornament to
their Seats. They may make theſe Lawns, and clear the wood that is
within the Figure of them, as it decayes, or as they have occaſion; the
Charge would not be great, but the Pleaſure and Profit would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be great and laſting:</p>
               <p>I do preferre your Lime-trees to bound in your Lawn, becauſe it is a
Tree that will grow well on any Soyl, having but care to plant it as it
ſhould be, beſide the fine ſhape all the Trees will naturally grow in, for
they will ſeem as though they were cut, provided they be not ſet too
thick, for then one hinders the ſhape of another.</p>
               <p>The Elm is a good Tree for this purpoſe, for it hath a fine green Leaf,
and if the Ground be Natural for it, it will grow to a great Tree, and
ſtraight, if kept with Pruning as it ought to be: Theſe Trees you may
plant thick round your Lawn.</p>
               <p>The Beech, in Ground where it likes, makes a ſtately Tree, ſo doth
the Walnut, Cheſnut; black Cherries where they like the Ground, are
quick Growers, and very pleaſant in the Spring when they be cloathed in
their white Garments; and indeed any Tree that is not very dangerous
to remove, as is the ſtately Oak and Pines, which were the very beſt,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54356:83"/>
were it not for this fault. The Firs and Ewes are not ſo difficult; they
will do well where they like the Ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now where men have not the Convenience or the Quantity of Ground,
if they make but 20 Acres in a Field in ſome good Figure leading to the
Houſe, it will be the more pleaſant, and the Charge as little as to do it
other wayes.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of ſeveral Superficial Figures, and how they are to be meaſured.</head>
            <p>TO ſpeak of all ſorts of Figures will be far beyond my intentions,
there being ſo very many irregular Figures which have many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
ſides and angles; but they may all be brought into parts of ſome
of the Figures following, and Meaſured like them; I ſhall ſhew you
one Uſeful Prob. eſpecially to make your Ovals by, whether they
be made from two Centres, or four; and then I ſhall touch at ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
Figures. (<hi>See Fig.</hi> 30.)</p>
            <p>Suppoſe three pricks or points given (ſo they be not in a ſtrait line)
to find a Centre to bring them into a Circle. This may be done ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ways, <hi>viz.</hi> either by Circles, or by raiſing Perpendiculars; as if
the points at A. B. C. were to be brought into a Circle: Draw a line
from A. to B. and in the middle of that line raiſe a Perpendicular,
as the line D. E. which you may ſoon do; for if you open your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
to any convenient diſtance, and ſet one point in B. draw the Arch
1. and 2. then ſetting one point in 4. draw 3. and 4. where theſe croſs
draw the line E. D. Do the ſame with the points B. C. and where the
two Perpendicular lines meet is the Centre, as at F, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Superficial
Figures that are irregular and right-lined, are ſuch whoſe Sides or Angles
are un-equal, of which ſome are triangles, or triangular Figures; and
here Note, that there are five ſorts of triangles, which are thus Named
and known:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Iſocheles</hi> hath two of the ſides unequal.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Scalena</hi> hath the three ſides unequal.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Orthygone</hi> hath one Right and two Acute Angles.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Ambligone</hi> hath one Obtuſe and two Acute Angles.</item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Oxygone</hi> hath three Acute Angles, or Equilateral triangles.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>(See Fig. 31.)</p>
            <p>Every triangle is half of a ſquare, whoſe Length and Breadth is equal
to the Perpendicular, and Side cut by the Perpendicular; as is plain
in the firſt Figure ſhewed by the pricked lines: therefore to Meaſure
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54356:83"/>

               <p>Not onely to prove this, but alſo to ſhew you how much readier
this way is, than the 100 Links, to bring it into Rods or Poles, then
divide it by 160, to bring the aforeſaid Meaſure to the one Pole Chain
and 100; multiply 14. 15 by 4, it gives 56. 60; and 6. 37 multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
by 4 gives 25. 48, which being multiplyed one by the other, gives
1442 1680/10000: I will neglect the Fraction as being not ¼ of a Pole, and
divide 1442 (the Poles in that Meaſure) by the ſq. Poles in one Acre
(160 Pole) and the Quotient is 9 and 2 over, that is, 9 Acres 2 Pole

and a little more, as before. But how much the other way is readier

                  <p>Some ſorts of Work are meaſured by the ſquare of 10 foot the ſide,
ſo that ſuch a Square is 100 foot; for ten times Ten is a Hundred: By
this Meaſure is your Carpenters Work meaſured, as Floors, Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Roofs of Houſes; So alſo is Tiling and Slatting meaſured; this is
very ready to meaſure and to caſt up: for if you multiply the Breadth
by the Length, ſo many hundreds as you find, ſo many Squares are
there; and what remains are parts of a Square.</p>
                  <p>Board and Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are meaſured by the foot, which may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            <p>The Rules to meaſure any Circle by, are the ſame, which is thus:
To take the Semi-circumference and the Semi-diameter, and multiply
theſe Halfs, the one by the other, ſheweth the ſuperficial Content or
<hi>Area</hi> of that Circle.</p>
            <p>This you may work either by the Pen, or Line of Numbers: As
by the line of Numbers thus: The Diameter being four foot, extend
the Compaſſes from 1. to 4. (the Diameter;) keep your Compaſſes
fixed, and alwayes on the Number 7854 ſet one point, and turn twice
to the Right hand: (but if they fall off at the End at the ſecond turn,
then muſt you ſet them on the firſt part of the Line when you have
turned them once, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Having taken the diſtance of 1 to 4. and ſet one poynt on the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Number 7854: the other poynt goes to 31 and neer ½, thence
if you turn another turn it will go off from the Line, therefore you muſt
find the poynt 31 and near ½ on the firſt part of the Line, and ſet one
poynt there, the other will reach to 12 and about 58/100, which tells you,
that in a Circle of 4 foot Diameter there are 12 ſuperficial ſquare feet
and a half, and better.</p>
            <p>Now to work it according to the Rule above, by the Line, if you
multiply the Semi-diameter by the Semi-circumference, it giveth the
Content, the ſame way I ſhall do it with my Pen:</p>

                  <p>The price for Removing Earth is according to

may be removed, where Men work for 12 <hi>d.</hi> the day, at theſe prices,

But if it be Loom, Brick, Earth, or Clay that will dig well, that
they can ſpeet with a Spade, and fill without the uſe of Pit-axe or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock,
then one fourth part may be abated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Rule is ſufficient

of your Ground, or Length of your Baſe and Perpendicular, &amp; you deſire
to go but a quarter of a Rod in length or breadth, which will content many
in ordinary uſes; as if a man hath digged a piece of Ground by the Pole
ſquare, that is 10 Pole and a half broad, and 21 Pole and a half long, you
may count up this, or any the like Numbers thus, ten times 21 is 210,
then ten halfs is 5 whole ones, and 21 halfs is 10 whole ones
and a half; and a half of a half is a quarter, which you may
keep in your Memory, or
ſet them down: ſo you ſee
here they make both by the
Decimal way, and this, 225
Pole and 3 Quarters.</p>

ſuch a Figure comes always off with a Quarter.</p>

the other, as the laſt was, it ends always in ſuch a Decimal as this, 1875,
that is half a quarter, and half half a quarter, that is ⅛ and 1/16 parts
of a pole ſquare.</p>
                  <p>This way may you caſt up the Content of a Ground very ſpeedily,
and Exact, if the middle Length and middle Breadth fall out in ¼, ½,
or ¾ of a Pole; and this way you may ſumme up a Field before you
do it decimally: And then one will be good proof to the other, which

               <p>Having taken the Breadth of

from the length in feet, to the Content. For as 12 (the ſide of a ſuperficial

length in feet (which in this Example is 10,) to the Content in feet and
parts, which is 8 foot 33/100: Note this for a general Rule, that if

            <p>IN Board, Glaſs, Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we onely took notice of the Length and
Breadth, which was ſufficient to find the ſuperficial Content; but
to meaſure ſolid Bodies we muſt take notice of the Length, Breadth
and Depth. Moſt of ſolid Figures are meaſured by finding firſt the
ſuperficial Content of the Baſe, or one End, and multiplying that by
the Length, if both Ends alike; but if tapering, then by ⅓ of the
Length; and as ſuperficial Meaſure hath 144 ſquare Inches in one foot,
and 72 ſquare Inches in half a foot, and 36 ſquare Inches in a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
So
<list>
                  <item>In ſolid Meaſure 1728 ſquare Inches make one foot,</item>
                  <item>And 8.64 ſquare Inches make half a foot,</item>
                  <item>And 432 ſquare Inches make a quarter of a foot.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For every Inch ſquare is like a Die, and ſo is a foot of ſolid Meaſure
ſuppoſed to be; for what it wants either in Breadth or in Thickneſs,
it muſt have in Length; ſo that in what form ſoever your ſolid Body
is, that you meaſure, there muſt be 1728 ſolid Inches to make a foot;
for 12 (the ſide of a foot) multiplyed by 12 gives 144 for one ſide;
and 144 multiplyed by 12 (another ſide) gives 1728, the Cube-ſquare
Inches in a Cube-ſquare foot.</p>
            <p>Now to find the ſolid Content of any piece of Timber or Stone that
hath the ſides equal, firſt find the ſuperficial Content of the End, in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54356:94"/>
Inches and parts; and multiply that by the Length in Inches, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
is the Content in ſolid Inches: Then divide that ſumme by 1728
(the Inches in a foot,) the Quotient ſheweth you the Content in ſolid
feet, and what remain are Inches. If you would work this by the
Line of Numbers, the Rule is thus:
<list>
                  <item>Extend the Compaſſes from one to the Breadth in Inches;</item>
                  <item>The ſame Extent will reach from the Depth to the Content of the
End:</item>
                  <item>Then extend the Compaſſes from one to this Content of the End;</item>
                  <item>Keep your Compaſſes fixed, and that Extent will reach from the
Length to the Content in ſolid Inches.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But if your ſolid Figure hath both Ends alike, and in form of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Polgone; that is, a piece of Timber hewed into 5, 6, 7 or 8
equal ſides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is called by ſome <hi>A priſme:</hi> then take the Semi-circumference,
and multiply that by the <hi>Radius</hi> or Semi-diameter, that
product by the Length giveth the Content.</p>
            <p>But if your ſolid Figure be a Cylinder, that is, a round piece
of Timber or Stone; having both Ends equal Diameter, as a Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> here take the Semi-circumference, multiply it by the Semi-diameter,
and the <hi>Area</hi> of that by the Length giveth the ſolid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>Now many of the Bodies of our Timber-trees will be near this form
of a Cylinder, but Cuſtom hath got ſuch footing (though very falſe,)
that men will not meaſure their Timber the true way, but will ſtill
keep their Error, which is, to gird the middle of the Tree about with
a Line, and take the fourth part thereof for the true ſquare, and ſo
meaſure it as a four-ſquare piece of Timber; but how falſe that is, may
appear by the enſuing Tables. Whoever is pleaſed to trye, will find,
that there may be four Slabs taken off, to bring that to a Square, and
that ſquared piece then will be near equal to the Meaſure they firſt
meaſured the piece of Timber by; ſo that when they have brought
their piece ſquare by hewing or ſawing, they then have the Meaſure
that it was meaſured for when it was Round.</p>
            <p>But ſeveral men have demonſtrated this falſe Rule to be falſe near ⅓,
as Mr. <hi>Wing,</hi> Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> and others: Yet Cuſtom doth and will keep
its Road.</p>
            <p>I have already ſhewed how to meaſure Timber by the Cuſtomary
way, by the Line of Numbers, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 35, and 36. before-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  <p>The Compaſs of a Tree being 84 Inches about, then three Inches

If any Tree be above 100 Inches Circumference, then take half that
Circumference, and find the Number belonging thereto in the Table,
then take one fourth part of it, and that makes one foot of Timber:
Suppoſe a Tree to be 146 Inches about, the half of it is 73, againſt
this in the Table is 4 Inches 075 parts; one quarter thereof, (<hi>viz.</hi>
one Inch 019 parts) makes one foot of Timber at that Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Tables, with what hath been before ſaid, will be ſufficient to
meaſure any Cylinder by, and how to meaſure a Cone I have ſhewed
already. A Cone is ſuch a Figure as the Spire of a Church, having a
Circular Baſe, and ending in a ſharp point. It is meaſured by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
Content of the Baſe, multiplyed by one third part of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
or Length. A Pyramid, or Pyramis, is ſuch a Figure as hath
an angular Baſe, and ends in a ſharp point, which is meaſured as the
Cone is. A Sphear or Globe, is a ſolid Figure, every where equally
diſtant from the Centre; it is meaſured by cubing the Diameter, and
multiplying that by 11, and dividing that product by 21, the Quotient
ſheweth the ſolid Content of the Sphere.</p>
                  <p>There be ſeveral other ſorts of ſolid Figures, as ſeveral parts of the

            <head type="sub">Of the Oval, how to make it, and how to meaſure it, with
other Obſervations thereon.</head>
            <p>HAving the Length and Breadth of the Oval given you, you may
take the whole Length and half the Breadth, as is ſhewed before
in bringing three Pricks into a Circle, and from the Centre of theſe
three poynts draw half the Oval, and ſo likewiſe the other half, as you
ſee the Oval in the Figure drawn; for the poynt F. is the Centre of the
Arch A B C, and the Arch A G C is made by the ſame Rule, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54356:97"/>
where the Line <hi>F H.</hi> croſſeth the Line <hi>A E C,</hi> as at K, there is the
Centre of the breadth <hi>B G,</hi> and the End <hi>A;</hi> from the Centre <hi>K</hi> may
you make the Ends of your Oval Round as you pleaſe; ſo that from
four Centres you may make the Ends of your Oval round as you
pleaſe; but if they be made from two Centres, as that is, then will
the Ends be more Acute.</p>
            <p>Or you may make your Oval thus: Having reſolved on the breadth,
draw the ſides from Centres in the Mid-line of the breadth, as before;
then ſet up two ſticks exactly in the Mid-line of the Length, at equal
diſtance from each End, then hold the Line at one, and turn the Line
to the ſide of the Oval, and then on the other ſide the ſtick, with the
ſame length, ſo may you make the Ends of your Oval as Round as you
pleaſe; for the nearer you place theſe ſticks in the Centre of the length
and breadth of the Oval, the nearer Round your Oval is made, even
till you come to a Circle: This way your Ingenious Work-men make
their Ovals in ſmall works, as your Plaiſterers, Joyners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it
is a good way, and ſo common that I need not ſay more to teach how
to make an Oval of any bigneſs; but here I ſhall take occaſion to ſhew
the Figure of one at <hi>Caſhiobury</hi> now made.</p>
            <p>(See Fig. 46.)</p>
            <p>To meaſure this Oval, which is 28 Rod long, and 19 Rod broad,
as 'tis now ſtaked out at <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> intended for a Kitchen-Garden:
This Oval being made of 2 Segments of a Circle whoſe Semi-diameter
is 15 Rod, as 'tis found by making the Oval; it being the Centre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt
of each Arch-line of this Oval, as the lines F A. F B. and
F C.</p>
            <p>Now, to find the length of one of theſe Arch-lines, is ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
which I find to be 18 Rod, the half length of one, which is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the line D D. ſo the whole length of one Arch is 36, and both
Arches round the Oval is 72 Rod.</p>
            <p>Now, take the ½ of one of the Arch lines, which is 18, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-diameter
of that Arch, which is 15 Rod; Multiply the one by the
other, and it is 270 Rod, which is the Figure A. B. C. F.<!-- <LIST>

            <p>For the Baſe A. C. is 28 Rod, which is the length of

theſe Rules are ſufficient.</p>
            <p>An Oval is no ill Figure for a Garden; for if the
Garden-wall be an Oval, and the length of the Oval
point North and South, as the afore-mentioned Oval doth (A. being
the South point, C. the North) then may ſuch a Wall be Planted with
Trees, both in-ſide and out-ſide, and have never a Tree ſtand to the
North Aſpect; for it you make your going in at the South end of your
Oval, then will thoſe 2 Trees or Tree that ſtood on the in-ſide, or were
to ſtand there, be removed from the North aſpect to the North-Eaſt,
and North-Weſt, according to the largeneſs of your Gate; ſo will
every 2 Trees on the in-ſide of your VVall tend nearer the South-point,
till they come to the point C. which is South; and then the Trees on
the out-ſide, every 2 Trees will fall nearer the North-point at C. till
you leave that point of the Oval between 2 Trees, ſo will not one Tree
ſtand to the North aſpect, and but few near the North aſpect; the like
whereof no other Figure can do, that I can think of.</p>
            <p>An Oval with the ends pointing Eaſt and VVeſt is no ill Figure for a
Garden; for the walls in this, as in the other, are not ſo ſubject to
oppoſe the winds as ſtraight walls be, therefore not ſo blaſting, as you
may well conceive.</p>
            <p>2. Ovals on each ſide the Front of your Houſe, would be no ill
Proſpect, but in many things very convenient; theſe being at equal
diſtance from the middle of your Front, and poynting upon your
Lawn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>As the Log. of this 17 Acres ¾, found by the ſuppoſed Scale, is to
the Log of the mean Proportional (23.08) of the true Quantity of Acres,

               <p>The way to work the <hi>Golden Rule,</hi> or <hi>Rule of Three</hi> by Log. is,
to adde the Log. of the third Number and ſecond Number together,

ſumme of a Thouſand, you muſt eſtimate or gheſs at the Unite, ſo that
you may read any ſumme under a thouſand, expreſſely, from the firſt

one being 100, then 9 tenths is 90, and 9 tenths of them tenths is 9,

that if you be to read any ſumme from one to 10, you have it in the

            <p>
               <hi>Example,</hi> In whole numbers, 55 and 15, firſt find 55, then count 15
forward, and the point is 70; for adde 5 to 55 it maks 60, and count 10

tens forward is 110, and 7 of a tenth, tis then 117, then from that point
count 35, and the point or Diviſion ſheweth 'tis 152.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example,</hi> A whole number and a Decimal, as 6 and 9/10 find 16 on
either part of your Rule: then count 9 of the 10 Diviſions, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
6 &amp; 7, which is one Diviſion ſhort of 7, and that is the point,
which is 6 and 9 tenths, or thus 6 9/10, or 6.9; it alſo may be read
6 90/100 for tis the point of that alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example,</hi> 2 whole numbers and 2 fractions, as 60, 80, and 70.50;
I take 60, and count 7 tenths forward, which is at the point 130;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54356:102"/>
Not here the middle one being read 100, then 3 tenths forward are for
30; then for the 80 and 50, which is 130, I count one tenth more, which
then is 131, and being the Diviſions on the Line fall ſo cloſe, you muſt
eſtimate or gheſs the 90/100 or 'tis but adding the 2 laſt figures together,
and keep the unite in your minde, to add to your other ſum, and ſo you
may be exact; add 50 and 80 together, it makes 130, keep 30 in mind
as in this <hi>Example,</hi> I neglect the 2 Cyphers and add 8 and 5 together,
which is 13, or add 80 and 50 make 130; now them 2 Cyphers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
together make but one Cypher added to 13, is 130; that is, one
Integer, and 30 of another; but if the 80 and 50 had been only 8 and 5,
then 10 had been the Integer, and the 3 had been 3/10 of one; and note
this, that if the Integer, or whole ſum that the fraction belongs to, in
Decimal fractions, I ſay, if the Integer be 10, then from one to 10 is
the Decimal fraction of that; and if the Integer be a 100 then from
one to a 100 is the Decimal of that; if a 1000, then from one to a
1000, the Decimal of a 1000 may be; and ſo of greater ſums: ſo that
in Decimals there is no improper fraction, as is in your vulgar fractions,
for there you may find the denominator more than the numerator if
the fraction be a proper fraction, but if an improper fraction, then the
Denominator leſs than the Numerator; as may be ſeen at large in moſt
books that treat of fractions; ſee Mr. <hi>Wingates Arithmetick</hi> natural: ſo
that decimal fractions may be expreſſed without the denominator by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before the decimal or broken number propounded, as 12 35/100 is thus,
12.35; and 2 98/100 thus, 2.98 &amp;c. or 2 5/10 or 2 ½ may thus be writ, and
is in Decimals writ 2.5, that is 2 and a half; for in this <hi>Example</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teger

one to 6, keep the Compaſſes fixed, and that ſame Extent will reach
from 8 to 48, the Content; or if you ſet one point of your Compaſſes on
1, and extend the other to 8 at that exent, if you ſet one point of your
Compaſſes on 6, the other point will reach to 48, the content; as was
before deſcribed.</p>
            <p>Note that your <hi>Rule</hi> muſt be divided into 10 equal parts, and theſe
10 parts each of them into 10 other equal parts; thus will your foot be
divided into a 100 equal parts, and thus muſt your yard, pole, &amp;c. be
divided; then will theſe parts anſwer the Line of Numbers which is a
a decimal line.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 2d. If a ſtone or board be 14 Inches broad, and 30 Inches
long, how many Inches are there in that ſtone, board, &amp;c? Extend the
Compaſſes from 1 to 14, the ſame extent will reach from 30 (the
length) to 420, the content in ſuperficial Inches.</p>
            <p>But if you would know how much of this bredth will make a foot
ſquare of board, glaſs, or ſtone, the rule is this; as the breadth in
Inches is to 144 the ſuperficial Inches in one foot, that Extent will reach
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54356:103"/>
from one to the length of one foot in Inch-meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 3d. Set one point of your Compaſſes on 14 (the breadth,)
extend the other to 144; that extent will reach from one to 10 and
near 3/10, and ſo much makes a foot long, at 14 Inches broad, ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Meaſure: To prove this, if you multiply 14 by 10 3/10, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
will be 144 2/10; ſo it is but 2 of 10, or one fifth part more.</p>
            <p>But the moſt cuſtomary way to meaſure Board, Glaſs, Stone, or
any thing that is meaſured by ſuperficial Foot-meaſure, is, by Inch-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and Foot-meaſure together. And the Rule is this: As 12 (the ſide
of a foot ſquare) is to the breadth in Inches, ſo is the Length in Feet or
Parts, to the Content in Feet or Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 4. Shall be in the aforeſaid Example, to make the Rule
more plain: Set one poynt of your Compaſs alwayes on 12, extend
the other to the breadth in Inches, which is 14, that Extent will reach
from two foot and a half (which is 30 Inches) to near 3 foot, <hi>viz.</hi> to two
foot 9/10 and better, as before.</p>
            <p>But note, if the Breadth in Inches be more than 12, as in the laſt
Example, then muſt you turn your Compaſſes from the Length in
feet and parts to the Right hand; but if the breadth be leſs than 12
Inches, then muſt you turn your Compaſſes from the length in feet to
the Left-hand: And becauſe this Rule is the moſt uſed, ſee another
Example, for this way moſt men do meaſure by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 5. A Board ten Inches broad, and 6 foot long, how many
foot are there in that Board? Extend your Compaſſes from 12 (the
ſtanding number) to 10 (the breadth in Inches,) that Extent will reach
from 6 the length in feet (to the left hand) to 5 the Content in feet;
for as 12 is to 10, ſo is 6 to 5.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewed ſome Examples in ſuperficial meaſure in Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication,
here I ſhall ſhew a few Examples in ſolid Meaſures; and
firſt know, that you muſt take the ſuperficial Content of the Baſe or
End of the Piece of Timber or Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether it be Round,
Square or Triangle, which you may do by Multiplication, as is before
ſhewed; then multiply the Content of the Baſe by the Length of the
piece, and the product giveth the ſolid Content of the piece.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example Sixth.</hi> A piece of Timber 14 Inches Broad, and 10 Inches
deep, and 30 Inches long, how many ſquare Inches in that piece of
Timber?</p>
            <p>Set one poynt of your Compaſſes on one, extend the other to 10
(the depth;) that Extent will reach from 14 (the breadth) to 140,
the Content of the Baſe.</p>
            <p>Then ſet one poynt of your Compaſſes on one, and extend the other
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54356:104"/>
to 30 (the Length,) that ſame Extent will reach from 140 (the Content
of the Baſe,) to 4200 the ſolid Content of the piece in Inches.</p>
            <p>But if you would find the Content of this piece of Timber, or any
other, in feet and parts, you may do it thus: Find the Content of the
Baſe, as before; then as the ſquare Inches in a foot (<hi>viz.</hi> 1728,) is to
the Content of the Baſe, ſo is the length in Inches, to the Content in
feet and parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 7. How many feet and parts are there in the piece of the
laſt Example, which was 14 Inches broad, and 10 Inches deep, and
30 Inches long; having found the Baſe, as before, to be 140, then
extend the Compaſſes from 140 to 728, that ſame Extent will reach
from 30 (the Length in Inches) to two foot and neer a half, <hi>viz.</hi> to two
foot, 744 Inches; you muſt turn your Compaſſes from 30, towards
the left hand.</p>
            <p>But if you deſire to know how much in length makes a foot, then
the Rule is thus: As the Content of the Baſe is to 1728 (the Inches
in a foot ſquare) that ſame Extent will reach from 1 to the Number of
Inches or parts which will make a foot at ſuch a Length.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 8. Of the ſame piece of Timber mentioned in the laſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
the Baſe you may find (as before) to be 140, then extend the
Compaſſes from 140 (the Baſe) to 1728, (the Inches in a foot ſquare)
that ſame Extent will reach from 1 to 12, and little more than 35/100;
for if you multiply 12 35/100 by 140, the product will be 1729, which
is but one more than the Inches in a foot. And here you may note the
Error that many men commit in adding the Breadth and Depth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and take the half of that ſumme for the true ſquare; and the
more the ſides differ, the more they be miſtaken.</p>
            <p>The ſame Error is daily committed by thoſe which meaſure Timber;
for they take the Circumference in the middle of the piece of Round
Timber, and one fourth part of that they take for the true ſquare of
the piece, which is altogether falſe, (as I ſaid before) though Cuſtom
doth ſtrongly uphold that error againſt Reaſon. But if it be a true
ſquared piece of Timber, then you may meaſure it this way, very
Readily; as,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 9. A piece of Timber 10 Inches ſquare, and 16 foot
long.</p>
            <p>The Rule is this: Alwayes ſet one poynt of your Compaſſes on 12,
extend the other to the ſide of the ſquare in Inches or parts, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
will reach from the Length in feet or parts, to a fourth Number,
and from that Number to the Content in feet and parts; that is, it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54356:104"/>
will reach from the Length of the piece of Timber in feet and parts,
to the Content in feet and parts.</p>
            <p>As thus, in this Example; Extend your Compaſſes from 12 to 10
(the ſide of the ſquare in Inches) that diſtance will reach from 16 (the
Length in feet) at two turns of your Compaſſes, to 11 foot, and a
little above 1/10, <hi>viz,</hi> 11 foot and 192/1728. Be ſure alwayes to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that if your piece of Timber be leſs than 12 Inches ſquare, then you
muſt turn twice from the Length of the piece, to the Left hand; but if
more than 12 Inches, then to the Right hand twice.</p>
            <p>Now this being the way in uſe, I will ſhew one Example more: of
a Tree 30 foot long, having the Circumference 60 Inches; now the
fourth part of 60 is 15, which I take for the ſide of a ſquare equal to that
Circle, as is uſually done, though not with truth alwayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 10. Then I extend my Compaſſes from 12 to 15 (the ſide
of the Square in Inches) and that Extent will reach from 30 (the
Length in feet) to near 47 feet, the Content; this is the cuſtomary
way, but if you look into the Table, <hi>pag.</hi> 174, you may there ſee,
that 60 Inches Circumference, one foot length gives 1.988, which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
by 30, gives 59 foot and 640; here alſo you ſee the error of
the cuſtomary way; but of this I have ſaid enough already, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhall give no more Examples now; but note this, that what is
here ſaid of Foot-meaſure, may alſo be applyed to Pole, Yard, or
the like.</p>
            <p>Having the Root given, by two turns of your Compaſſes, you may
ſave two Multiplications, and find the ſquare of that Root, and the
Cube, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo may you find as many Numbers as you pleaſe, in
a continual Proportion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 11. The Root being given, extend your Compaſſes from
one to 12, that Extent will reach from 12 to 144, the ſame Extent
will reach from 144 to 1728; ſo then, if 12 be the Root, 144 is the
ſquare of that Root, and 1728 the Cube of that Root, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but note,
that when you extend your Compaſſes from 1 to 12, the next turn
will go off the Line; therefore you muſt ſeek 12 at the beginning of
the Line, to the left hand, and then turn from that 12; note this in all
Caſes wherein your Compaſſes go off the Line.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewed you (the Root being given) readily to find the
Cube, I will now ſhew you (the Cube being given) how to find the
Root; and though this, and ſome other Examples before, be not done
by Multiplication, yet becauſe they depend one upon another, I do here
ſhew them.</p>
            <p>To extract the Cube-Root, the Rule is; divide the ſpace between
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54356:105"/>
the Cube given, and 1, into 3 equal parts, and the diſtance of one of
theſe 3 parts from 1, is the Root.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example.</hi> 11. The Cube 64 being given, what is the Root? divide
the Diſtance from 64. to one into 3 equal parts, one third part of that
diſtance will reach from one to 4, the Root; for the firſt third part
will reach from 64 to 16 the ſquare, the 2d third part from 16 to 4 the
Root, the third part from 4 to one, for 4 times 4 is 16, and 4 times
16 is 64; the ſame Rule obſerve for any other number.</p>
            <p>Thus may you find the ſquare of any Circle, or the end of a tree,
the ſquare equal to that Circumference, and ſo meaſure it as is before
ſhew'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 12. Having the Circumference of a Tree, you would know
the ſide of a Square equal to that Circumference, as, in the 10th.
Example the Circumference was 60 Inches, now to find the Content in
ſuperficial Inches of ſuch a Circle, the Rule is as is before ſhewd, as 22
is to 7, ſo is the Circumference to the Diameter; now if you Extend
your Compaſſes from 22 to 7, that Extent will reach from 60 to 19.
and 2/22, the Diameter, this Fraction may be turned into a Decimal
Fraction, and ſo wrought, but being ſo ſmall it is not worth minding in
ſuch operations as this: then if you take half the Diameter and ½
the Circumference, and multiply one by the other, or if you Extend
your Compaſſes from one to 9 and ½, that Extent will reach from 30
to 285 the ſuperficial content in Inches, then to find the ſquare by the
Line of Numbers, that is, to finde a Number which if Multiply'd in
its ſelf, makes this Summe; the Rule is, Extend your Compaſſes from
285 to one, and the middle between theſe 2 Numbers is 16 882/1000 very
near, as here you may ſee; but firſt note, that if your Rule have but
the Lines on it that moſt of your ordinary Rules have, that is, but 2
Lines on it as 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8 9; and 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10; then this
Queſtion may be ſome trouble to work on ſuch a Rule; but if your
Rule hath 4 parts or 6 parts, as a 6 foot Rule may have, then this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be performed very readily, as you may hereafter better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
for if you take 285 in the ſecond part of the Rule, then is the
middle figure one, a 100; and the figure one at the end is 10; and the
Rule is, that you muſt take the middle between 1 and 285, which
here you cannot; for if you count the firſt one, one, the middle one
is then 10. and the end one is 100, ſo then 285 is off from the Line;
whereas if your Rule had another part added to it, then might you
work, and read it very readily.</p>
            <p>But to work it by this Rule, you muſt take the diſtance from 100 to
285, that is from the middle one to 285, then take half of this diſtance
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54356:105"/>
and add it to half the length of the Line, and the Compaſſes will reach
from 10 in the middle to near 17 (the ſide of a ſquare equal to 285)
as you may ſee it here proved by the pen.</p>

            <p>So that four proportional Numbers being deſired to be known, if
any three be given you may find the fourth.</p>
            <p>As if 2, 8, 6, and 24. be the Numbers given, theſe Numbers may
be ſo varyed (as is aforeſaid) that if any three be given, you may find
the fourth; Note,</p>

ſought, ought to proceed from the ſecond term, as the third did from
the firſt in the ſame proportion: Therefore if you multiply the Second
Number by the third Number, or the third by the ſecond, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

            <p>THE Rule of <hi>Three Inverſe</hi> is when the Number ſought proceeds

from the third.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:54356:107"/>
And if the third Number be greater than the firſt, then will the fourth

then the fourth will be greater than the ſecond.</p>
            <p>In this Rule if you multiply the firſt term by the ſecond, and divide
the Product by the third, the Quotient ſheweth the fourth.</p>
            <p>The firſt Number and the third muſt be of one Kind, and the ſecond

required to do ſuch another piece of work in four dayes. According
to the Rules before named, though 24 be here propounded firſt, yet
it muſt be in the Second place, and then the Queſtion will order it ſelf
thus:</p>
               <p>As 4 is to 24, ſo is 16 to 96:</p>
               <p>Or thus, As 4 is to 16, ſo is 24 to 96.</p>

&amp;c.</head>
            <p>TO level any piece of Ground that you can ſee from ſide to ſide,
or from the Middle to any ſide, goe into the middle, and there
ſet up your Inſtrument, be it Water-level, or Ground-level with ſights,
and when you have pl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ced it ſo high as you may ſee over the higheſt
part of the Ground, as half a foot, or a foot, then ſet a ſtake in the
middle, the top exactly level with the ſights; and one on the higheſt
ſide, the top level with the middle ſtake; then turn the Level or Lood
back ſight, and ſet one Level with theſe two on the loweſt ground:
So have you three ſtakes in Line level: Keep your Level true to
your Middle-ſtake, and turn your Level till it makes Right-angles
with theſe three ſtakes, and ſet up two ſtakes at each ſide one Level
with thoſe three: So have you five ſtakes ſet true Level in two Lines;
and if your Ground be large, you may ſet up two Rowes more by
the Level<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in ſmall Grounds 5 ſtakes is enow: Then may you lay
by your Level, and looking over the head of one to the head of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
cauſe your Aſſiſtant to put down ſtakes between two and two, till
you have ſet as many ſtakes level in your Ground as you think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient:
Or you may have a Rule, and look over the edge of that, it
being level with the head of the ſtake, to the head of the other, and
put ſtakes down between you and the other ſtake, what Number you
pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſtaked out your Ground with all the ſtakes heads level,
and half a foot higher than the higheſt part of your Ground; in ſome
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54356:108"/>
Ground the middle-ſtake and the ſtakes in the Croſs-line will be the
Level-line the Ground muſt be brought to; that is, abating the hill,
and filling up the low-ſide to the Level of the Mid-line; but if your
Ground be very uneven, then you muſt meaſure over all the ſtakes,
and take them middle-high, for their mean Level, and by the Rule of
Three proportion your Ground to that.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Valley be 10 Pole long, and two foot deep from the
ſtraight Line, and there is a hill 5 Pole long, how many foot deep
muſt I goe in that 5 Pole of the Hill, to fill up this Valley? This may
be anſwered by the Rule of Three Inverſe, or back Rule of Three:
The Rule orders it ſelf thus. As 5 is to 2, ſo is 10 to 4: So if you
work it by the Line of Numbers, extend your Compaſſes from 5 to
2, that ſame Extent will reach from 10 to 4, ſo then you muſt goe
4 foot deep in ſuch a Hill, to make good ſuch a Valley as is before
ſaid.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you are to abutt the top of a Hill four foot deep and 1. 2
Pole from the top of that Hill, that 4 foot is to come out: this is eaſily
performed, (though a Leveller to the beſt man in the Land did not
underſtand it) ſet up a ſtake on the top of the Hill two foot or three
foot long, above ground, and another at the ſame height where your
depth comes out; three Rod from that ſet a ſtake down, till the head
comes to be in a Line with theſe 2, and at that ſtake you muſt be one
foot deep: At 6 Pole another as before, there you muſt be two foot
deep; another at 9 Pole, there you muſt ſink three foot. You may
ſet more ſtakes at equal diſtances, which will direct you that you
cannot goe amiſs.</p>
            <p>To make any Sloop, firſt line out your top and foot true, then if
your Sloop be not very long, you may have a Frame of Wood made
according to your Sloop, which will be as a Mould to trye your
work by. Two foot Riſe, in 6 foot Level is a good Proportion for
a Sloop.</p>

            <head type="sub">For making Syder obſerve theſe Rules.</head>
            <p>WHatſoever Apples you make your Syder of, let them hang
on the Trees untill they be through Ripe, which you may
know by theſe few infallible Rules: Firſt, if you find the Kernels
Brown, or the Seed rattle in the Apple, as in ſome they will; or if
you ſee them begin to fall much in ſtill weather, or if you find them
to handle like a drye piece of wood, ſounding in your hand if you toſs
them up; then you may go to gathering as faſt as you pleaſe, ſo
your Fruit be drye; obſerve that the greener your Fruit is, the
ſourer will your Syder be; therefore be not too forward in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering.</p>
            <p>For gathering your Apples, obſerve theſe Directions: Take care
they be not too much bruiſed; for your bruiſed Fruit, if they be a
little kept, will rott, and give your Syder an ill taſte, and a high
brown Colour, and not yield ſo well; for your bruiſed place of the
Apple, if it doth not immediately rott, the Juice of that place will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
forth, and be a dry Red, yielding little Taſte or Liquor, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a bad taſte.</p>
            <p>But to the making of one Hogſhead of Syder, there is required a
great many Apples; as if they be good yielding Fruit, and not too
long kept, ſome 18 or 20 Buſhel will make a Hogſhead; if not, as
aforeſaid, then 24 Buſhels, or more, to one Hogſhead: Therefore,
though I would not have your Apple too much Bruiſed, yet I would
not adviſe you to pick them by hand: But you may lay a Truſs or
two of Barly Straw under your Tree when you goe to gather them,
and on that lay ſome Blankets (or the like) according to the Bigneſs of
your Trees; thereon with Diſcretion ſhake your Fruit, letting not
too many lie on at one time, but carry them to the Place where you
intend they ſhall lie till you grind or beat them: Thus you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
your Straw and Blankets from Tree to Tree, as your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:54356:109"/>
Now for keeping them after you have gathered them, let it be in ſome
houſe if you can with convenience, and on ſome dry boards or boarded
flowers, but if it be an Earth-flower you muſt lay them on, firſt cover it
with good dry ſtraw, and ſo lay them on that, for if you lay them on the
earth they will decay faſter, and turn muſty before they have done
ſweating; for 'tis obſerved that which is beſt to preſerve Plants is the
quite contrary to keep and preſerve Fruit, for the holy Scripture telleth
plain, that which a man ſoweth muſt firſt dye, before it take root to live
and produce its kind.</p>
            <p>Thus it may be with fruit lying on the ground, where the ſecret va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
of the earth tend much to the death or diſſolution of the fleſhy
part of the fruit, that the ſeed might the ſooner be at liberty, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
its like in its ſeveral kinds; for Nature, or the ſecret providing
power of the Almighty, is at all times, and in all places actuating
and aſſiſting every ſpecies to produce its kind; for any who hath but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the Walnut or Cheſtnut, though one hath got his Fur Gown &amp;
the other his Noli-me-tangere Cloke, as to too of the ſenſes, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
when they be able to ſhift for themſelves, (as I may ſay) then
how willingly the Gown and Cloke is thrown aſide, to venture boldly
to the Earth, for to do as at firſt their parents did for them, but of
this ſee further in the Chapters before; and ſince we are now ſpeaking
of one particular fruit, <hi>viz.</hi> Apples, of the time of their keeping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you make them into Syder: a ſet time I cannot deliver, for your
Summer Fruit will be ready to beat before your Winter Fruit: but as
ſoon as you have ſeen them ſweat, which will be in ten dayes, or a
fortnight, then to beating or grinding of them as faſt as may be, keeping
your Fruit ſeveral, if you have enough to fill a veſſel of one kind, if
not, put ſuch kinds together as be near ripe together, the Syder will
ferment more naturally.</p>
            <p>But let your winter fruit lye three weeks or a month before you beat
or grind them: the greener your fruit is when gathered, let them lye
the longer before you beat them: Thus when you have beaten or
grinded your Apples: let them lye a night or 24 hours if you pleaſe
before you preſs them, it will make your Syder have more of the Sack-Colour,
and hinder it from Fermenting too much; and if your fruit be
ripe to eat, or mellow, then put to every twenty Buſhels of ſtampings
ſome ſix gallons of clear water, put that on the top of the ſtampings as
ſoon as you have beaten them; if your fruit be ſoft and mellow you
may put more, if not, the leſs: this alſo will keep your Syder from
fermenting too much, and though your Syder be weaker it will be
much pleaſanter: Therefore if your Apples be mellow before you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54356:110"/>
beat them there will go ſo much of the fleſhy ſubſtance of the Apple
through the ſtrainer or bag, with the Liquor that it will be hard to get
this Lee ſeparated from the Syder, before it begins to ferment, for the
Liquor will endeavour to free it ſelf of theſe little particles which when
once ſeparated from the united body, turneth to an earthy ſubſtance,
and then the Liquor working hard to free it ſelf of theſe then uſeleſs
and decaying parts, and having no place to turn them out at, but at the
bung, and it being contrary for theſe earthy parts to aſcend upwards,
cauſeth by its much fermenting, not only the ſtrong, but alſo the pleaſant
Spirits to take their flight, and go into the great world to be ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
at another new generation, and ſo leave the Liquor both dead and of a
foure taſte, which when theſe higher Spirits are fled, then ſoureneſs doth
maſter the taſte in the Syder, which it receives from the groſs Lees in
the veſſel; therefore if your Syder be made of mellow fruit, let it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
24 hours in ſom Fatt or large veſſel, that the groſs Lees may ſettle
to the bottom before you put it into your veſſel, and then draw it off,
leaving as much of this thick groſs Lee behind as you can (which groſs
Lee you may put among your preſſings for water-Syder) and if you
think the Syder is yet ſo thick that it will work much, then draw it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another tub by a tap two or three inches from the bottom; and in
this laſt tub let it ſettle ſo long as you think it is neer ready to work in
your tub: for if it work in your tubbs then will you get but little of
the groſs Lees from it: you muſt keep it covered all the time it is in
your tubs; for note the finer you put it up into your Veſſel the leſs it will
work or ferment, and the leſs it fermenteth the better will your Syder
be; but if you ſhould have child the Syder, as ſometimes it may ſo
happen in cold weather, that it doth not work at all, when you have
put it into your barrel, or hogſhead, but is thick, in ſuch a caſe put to
a hogſhead a pint of the juice of Alehoof, with half the quantity of
Iſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>glaſs, and it will make it clear and fine; but if it do it not preſently, do
not deſpair, for it will ferment poſſibly in the ſpring or when the fruit
bloſſoms that it was made on, the Spring after it was made.</p>
            <p>Having obſerved theſe few Rules, then put it into your barrel or
hogſhead, and as ſoon as it hath done working, bung it up, there keep
it till it is fit to bottle, which let it be when it is fine; for if you bottle it
while it is thick, or not well ſettled, it will endanger your bottles,
and not be ſo wholſom: but ſome do love to have their Syder cutting,
counting it then the better; this may be performed if your Syder be
fine by putting a little bit of Loaf-Sugar, in every bottle, when you bottle
it, and thus more wholſom.</p>
            <p>I am of the ſame opinion with Sir <hi>Paul Neal,</hi> that the oftner Syder
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54356:110"/>
by any accidental cauſe doth ferment, the worſe it is; if twice it will be
harder or ſourer than if it had fermented but once: and if it ferment
thrice it is ſtill worſe; therefore keep it if you can from fermenting or
working too much, and alſo too often.</p>
            <p>As for the ſorts of Fruit the Redſtrakes and Gennet Moyle, are the beſt
counted; yet there be many ſorts of fruit which if the Syder be well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
will be little inferior if not better: The Golden Pippin makes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Syder; the Kerton Pippin, the Ruſſet Harvy, Kentiſh Codlin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
makes good, or indeed any Apple that is not a Crab; for there be
many ſorts of Wildings that have a fine Winy Liquor, and the fleſh of
a hard, and not of a ſoft ſubſtance; for that Fruit, (let it be Pear or
Apple) that hath the fleſh ſoft, and is ſoon Mellow is not good for Perry
or Syder; for ſuch very ſoft Fruit doth break into ſo many ſmall particles,
that they ſpoil your Syder before they can be ſeparated, but that Fruit
that hath its fleſh hard, that when you beat and preſs it, will flat down
like a ſponge, ſooner then it will ſeparate into little particles; and if it
be kept beyond its natural time of being ripe, will grow tough but not
Mellow, is the only Fruit for Syder and Perry, for by Sir <hi>Pauls</hi> leave
it is not alwayes the beſt eating Apple or Pear that makes the beſt Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or Perry, but ſuch as aforeſaid, no more than the beſt eating Pear is
the beſt baked; and of this dayly experience ſheweth the contrary.</p>
            <p>Much more I could ſay concerning Syder, but if there were a whole
Volume writ of it, yet the ſeveral ſeaſons of years, the ſeveral ſorts
of Fruit and other accidents that happen, no man can adviſe you of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
therefore let your reaſon teach you with what hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but if you would ſee ſeveral mens opinions of the ordering of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſee Eſquire <hi>Evelins</hi> Book, joyned to his Diſcourſe of Foreſt-Trees.</p>
            <p>To make your water Syder; take the ſtampings when you preſs
them from your firſt Syder, and put them into tubs, and when you
have a tub full, put to theſe ſtampings half as much water as you had
Syder: if your Fruit be good and very ripe you may put more, if the
contrary leſs; let the tubs be covered, and ſtand thus with the water
and ſtampings together four or five dayes and nights: if it be cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let them ſtand a week, then you may preſs the ſtampings and as ſoon
as you have got as much as you think will fill a veſſel, put it on the fire
and ſcum it well, and when you find the ſcum begins not to riſe very
faſt, then take it off from the fire and put it into Tubs or Coolers, to
cool, and when it is cold then Tun it up, and when it hath done work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then bung it up, and in a months time it will be fit to drink; you
may if you pleaſe boyl a little Ginger in it, or a little Cloves, Juniper
berries, or other things which you fancy to pleaſe the pallet, or againſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54356:111"/>
ſome diſtempers you fear; for ſmall things taken in time may prevent
dangers very great; Syrupe of Rasburies gives a very pleaſing taſte
in Syder.</p>
            <p>Perry may be made and ordered after the ſame manner, only take
care your Pears be not too ripe, for if they be, you will be troubled to
get your Liquor fine: thoſe Pears be beſt for Perry that have a hard
fleſh, and ſtony at the core; the juice eaſily ſeparating from the fleſh,
the Fruit yielding a good plenty of juice, the Pears commonly of a
harſh taſte.</p>
            <p>But thoſe Pears that have a ſoft fleſh, as many of our beſt eating
Pears have, are not good for Perry; as the Burry, Borgatmotes,
Green-feilds, Green-cheſels, and ſeveral others of like nature.</p>
            <p>We have a Pear at <hi>Caſhiobury,</hi> and it is at other places near <hi>Watford;</hi>
it is a little harſh juicy Pear, but makes excellent Liquor, as my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Lord can teſtifie, and ſeveral others; its only inconvenience
is, it is but a ſmall Fruit, but the quantity it yields is good; I take it to
be a kind of wild Pear never grafted; but for its excellency aforeſaid,
the kind deſerves to be preſerved by the curious, I know no name it
hath as yet.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Wingate</hi> near <hi>Welling</hi> hath an excellent Pear for Perry; I have
taſted of the Liquor, and have ſeen the fruit, but whether it is a good
bearer or no I know not: which ſhould be a property in Perry Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees.</p>
            <p>There is a Pear called by my ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Pritchet</hi> Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to my Lord of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Rufins Pear, which makes excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and is a good bearer, as I have oft been informed by him; by the
taſte of the fruit it is very good for Perry: Indeed moſt ſorts of baking
Pears make good Perry, or any that is Qualified as is beforeſaid, and
that bears well, and yields great ſtore of Liquor.</p>
            <p>Mind your Veſſels be ſweet you put your Syder or Perry in; for a
little tang in the Veſſel will ſpoil all, a Sack Veſſel is very good (though
diſcommended by ſome) ſo is your White-wine or Clarret-wine casks,
or a Veſſel where Syder hath been before, &amp;c.</p>
