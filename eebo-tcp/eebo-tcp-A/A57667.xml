            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Reader.</head>
                  <p>IT is the greatest justice in the world to be just to
the dead, since they, if injured, cannot be their own
Compurgators, and that is it hath obliged me to use
that tendernesse to this great Author, who, to the
regret of all learned, hath so suddenly left this world.
His great pains in the dilatation of this Book, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
seen by the bulk of it, nor had the Epistle and
Preface escaped his second thoughts, had not the lease
of his life expired so soon as it did. And therefore I
have not (which is the arrogancy of too many) presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to make any diversion, or alterations in either, but
rather have thought it just to let them passe in this, as
they did in the first Edition, that is to say, in his own
words.</p>
                  <p>For had I been unjust to the Author in this respect,
I had withal been guilty of as great an injury to the
worthy Gentleman (though not of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
to whom he was, when alive, pleased to
dedicate it; since I cannot but hope that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the same tendernesse &amp; indulgence towards the
Orphan, as he was pleased to express when he first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it an infant. I shal further ad, that it wil render
it self to the Reader much more acceptable, not only
for its Additions, but also, that the Author had tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
revised the same; and that the care and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervising
of the Presse rested so much upon me, (not
onely out of an ordinary care, but singular respect to
the deseased Author) as that I think it needlesse to
prefix an <hi>Errata,</hi> there having nothing passed, but
what an ordinary capacity may easily correct. As
for the Book, I shall adventure it the Test of the
most censorious Mome; and for the Author, in his
life time; there was not found the mouth or pen so
black, that durst asperse his name, or parts; but since
his death, One (so much a Hobbist, that I wish he turn
not Atheist) hath in print given him a snarling chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
<pb facs="tcp:97888:3"/>
whom leaving to his folly, I shall only desire that
this short sentence, <hi>de mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tuis nil nise bonum;</hi> may be
his remembrancer for the future.</p>
                  <p>Besides the Authors endeavours in his <gap reason="foreign">

It is hoped ere long, that thou mayest see a Volume
of his Sermons in print, such as will convince the
world of the calumny of that Cynick, but continue
his own memory while there shal be found either lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of learning, or the learned.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may likewise take notice of an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,
wherein he is entertained with a strange Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of modern, and some ancient Hereticks, acting
their parts in their own proper persons, as neer as the
skil of the Graver could represent them. And what
could more properly have been annexed? for now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

none of them cared for, whilest he lived;
even so doth it fare with Religion; for
the Carkass or Skeliton of which, for the
bare sound whereof (being now made a
meer <hi>Eccho, Vox, praetereaque nihil)</hi>
there is so much contesting, and digladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the World; whereas few or none
care for the life and substance of Religion,
which consisteth in works, not in words; in
practicing, not in prating; in Scripture du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
not in Scripture phrases: She is as
our Saviour was, placed between two
Theeves; to wit, <hi>Superstition</hi> on the right
hand, and <hi>Atheism</hi> on the left. The one
makes a puppit of her, sets her out in gaudy
accoutrements, bedawbs her native beauty
with painting, and presents her in a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricious
not in a Matron-like dresse; but
the <hi>Atheist</hi> strips her naked of her Vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:97888:4"/>
robs her of her maintenance, and
so exposeth her to the scorn and contempt
of the world. But let these men esteem of
her as they list, she is notwithstanding the
fair daughter of the Almighty, the Queen
of Heaven, and beauty of the whole Earth.
Religion is the sacred Anchor, by which the
the Great Ship of the State is held fast, that
she may not be split upon the Quick-sands
of popular tumults, or on the Rocks of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Religion is the pillar on which the
great Fabrick of the <hi>Microcosm</hi> standeth.
All humane Societies, and civil Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are without Religion; but ropes of
Sand, and Stones without Morter, or Ships
without Pitch: For this cause, all Societies
of men in all Ages, and in all parts of the
Vniverse, have united and strengthened
themselves with the Cement of Religion;
finding both by experience, and the light
of nature, that no human Society could be
durable, without the knowledge and feare
of a Deity, which all Nations do reverence
and worship, though they agree not in the
manner of their worship. All their wayes
and opinions in Religion, I have here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the publick view; but to you Sir,
in particular, as to one, whom I know to be
truely religious, not being carried away
<pb facs="tcp:97888:4"/>
with the fine flowers and green leaves, but
with the solid fruits of Religion, consisting

without which no man shall see the

that truth though comly in it selfe, is yet
<pb facs="tcp:97888:5"/>
more lovely, when compared with falshood?
how should we know the excellency of light,
if there were no darknesse; the benefit of
health, if there were no sicknesse; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of the spring, if there were no winter;
<hi>Opposita juxta se posita clarius elucescunt: The
Swans fethers are not the lesse white, because of
their black feet; nor</hi> Venus <hi>the lesse beautiful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of her Mole.</hi> The Stone is set out by the
file, and the picture by its shadow. To infer
then, that because the world is pestered with
too many Sects and Heresies, therefore we
must not mention them, is as much as if they
would say, the way to heaven is beset with
too many theeves, therefore we must not take
notice of them. But how shall we avoid
them, if we know them not; and how shall
we know them, if concealed; its true the
world is pestered with too many Religions,
and the more is the pitty; yet this Book made
them not, but they made this Book. He
that detects errors makes them not. They
that informed the <hi>Israelites</hi> there were Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
in the Land, did not place those Gyants
there. But now I will let these men see the
ends for which I have undertaken this task,
of presenting all Religions to their view; and
they are grounded on the divers uses that
may be made thereof. 1. When we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the multitude of false Religions in the
world, by which most men have bin deluded;
are not we so much the more bound to the
goodnesse of Almightie God, who hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
us out of darknesse, and hath caused
<pb facs="tcp:97888:6"/>
the day Star of his truth to shine upon, and
visit us; who having suffered the World
round about us, to sit in the Valley of the
shadow of death, and to be overwhelmed
with worse than <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkness, hath not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
in this our <hi>Goshen</hi> aboundantly
displayed the light of his truth; but how
shal we seriously weigh or consider this great
mercy, if we do not as wel look on the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
condition of other men as on our own
happinesse, which we cannot do, if we know
not the errors which make them wretched.
What comfort could the <hi>Israelites</hi> have taken
in their Land of light, if they had not known
that the rest of <hi>Egypt</hi> sate in darkness. 2 When
we look upon the different multiplicity of
Religions in the world how that in all times,
and in all places, men though otherwise bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
have notwithstanding embraced a
religion, and have acknowledged a Divinity;
I say when we look upon this, do we not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the impudency of those <hi>Atheists</hi> in this
age, who either inwardly in their hearts, or
outwardly in their mouths dare deny the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
or else the providence of God; and
count all Religions but inventions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
policy. How can those <hi>Atheists</hi> avoid
shame and confusion when they read this
book, in which they shall see, that no Nation
hath been so wretched as to deny a Deity,
and to reject all Religion; which Religion
is a property no lesse essential to man, and
by which he is discriminated from the Beasts,
than rationality it selfe. 3. In the View of
<pb facs="tcp:97888:6"/>
all Religions, we may observe how the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of this world are wiser in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than the Sons of God; for they spare no
paines and charges, they reject or slight no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
commanded them by their Priests and
Wizards; they leave no meanes unattempted
to attaine happinesse: See how vigilant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout,
zealous, even to superstition they are;
how diligent in watching, fasting, praying,
giving of almes, punishing of their bodies,
even to death sometimes; whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
we are very cold, carelesse, remisse, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
and luke-warme in the things that so
neere concerne our eternal happinesse. They
thought all too little that was spent in the
service of their false gods, wee think all is lost
and cast away which wee bestow on the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the true God. They reverenced and
obeyed their Priests, wee dishonour, disobey
and slight ours; they observed many Festivall
daies to their Idols, we grudge to give one
day to the service of the true God. They
made such conscience of their Oaths taken in
presence of an Idol, that they would rather
loose their lives, than falsifie these Oaths: But
wee make no more scruple to take the name
of God in vaine, to sweare and forsweare,
than if we worshiped <hi>Iupiter Lapis,</hi> meer stocks
and Stones; such reverence and devotion they
carried to their Idols, that they durst not
enter into their Temples, nor draw near their
Altars, till first they were purified; they did
not onely kneel, but fall flat on the ground
before their feigned Gods; they knock their
breasts, beat their heads to the ground, teare
<pb facs="tcp:97888:7"/>
their skines, wound and cut their flesh, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby to pacifie their false gods: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we will not debarre our selves of the least
pleasure or profit to gaine Heaven; and so ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent
is our behaviour in the presence and
house of Almighty God, <hi>Before whom the</hi>
Cherubims <hi>and</hi> Seraphims <hi>dare not stand, but
with covered faces:</hi> as if he were our equal, and
not our Lord or Father, for (to speak in the
Prophets words) <hi>Malach. 1: 6. If hee bee our
Father, where is his honour? and if hee bee our
Lord, where is his fear?</hi> Doubtlesse these false
worshippers shall stand up in judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, who know our Masters will, but
doe it not; is not their zeal in the practice of
religious duties, to be preferred to our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse;
and their ignorance, to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
which without practice, will but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
our damnation, <hi>for he that knoweth
his Masters will, and doeth it not, shall he beaten
with many stripes;</hi> Wee are in the right way to
Heaven; they are in the wrong way; but if we
stand still, and walk not, they will be as neer
their journies end as we. They worship I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
we commit sacriledge: But is not a
sacrilegious theefe as hateful to God as an
ignorant Idolater? 4. When we look upon the
confused multitude of Religions in the
world, let us learne to tremble at Gods
judgements, to make much of the light whilest
we have it, to hold fast by the truth, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it with all affection, and the Ministers
thereof; for if once we forsake the right way,
which is but one, we shall wander all our
daies after in by-paths, and crooked lanes of
<pb facs="tcp:97888:8"/>
error, which are innumerable: if we reject
the thread of Gods word presented to us by
the Church: a thread I say, surer than that of
<hi>Ariadne,</hi> we shall be forced to ramble up and
down, through the inextricable <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of
erronious opinions. It stood with the justice
of God, to suffer men who in the begining
were of one language and religion, to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Babel and confusion, both of tongues
and false religions, for not retaining the
truth; to dig to themselves broken Cesterns,
which would hold no Water, for rejecting
the fountain of living Waters; to surfet upon
the poysonable flesh of quails, who grew
weary of the bread of Angels; and with the
swine to eat husks, who would slight the
wholsome food of their Fathers house. If
the <hi>Iewes</hi> put Gods word from them, and
judge themselves unworthy of Eternal Life,
Loe, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> will turn to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
Act. 13. 46. 5. In reading this Book we
shal finde, that the whole rabble of vain, phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical,
or prophane opinions, with which
at this day, this miserable distracted Nation
is pestered, are not new revelations, but old
dreams, of ancient Hereticks, long agoe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Church, and exploded by the
publick authority of Christian Magistrates;
but now for want of weeders, these Tares
spring up again in the Lords field, and are
like to choak the good corne; unlesse the
Lord of the Harvest send forth labourers into
his Harvest. 6. The reading of this Book,
may induce us to commiserate the wretched
condition of a great part of the World buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:97888:9"/>
as it were, in the darknesse of ignorance,
and tyranny of superstition: <q>To blesse
God for the light and freedom we enjoy,
whereas they are not greater sinners than
we; but except we repent, we shall all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
perish; let us not then be too high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,
but fear, and when we think we
stand, let us take heed-least we fall:</q> God
hath already permitted divers of those old,
obsolet, and antiquated hereticall opinions
to break in amongst us; <q>the times are now
come, that men will not suffer wholesome
Doctrine; but having itching ears after
their own lusts, get them an heap of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
turning their ears from the truth, and
giving themselves unto Fables.</q> 2 <hi>Tim. 4.
Thus is the Lord pleased to deal with us, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
Heresies to repullulate, that they who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
among us, may be manifested.</hi> He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
Prophets and Dreamers amongst us, but
it is as <hi>Moses</hi> saith, to prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, and to know,
whether we love the Lord our God <hi>with all
our hearts, and with all our souls,</hi> Deut. 13. To
conclude, whereas all men are desirous of
happiness, and immortality, but few walk
in the right way that conduceth to it; being
there are such multitudes of by-waies, as we
may see by this Book, let us follow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of the Prophet, <hi>Ier. 6. 16. Stand in the waies,
behold and ask for the old way, and walk therein,
and yee shal finde rest for your souls.</hi> And thus
good Reader having shewed thee the true use
of this book, I leave it to thy perusal, besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
God to keep us from the by-waies of
error, and to lead us into the way of truth.</p>

<hi>Abel</hi> sacrificed, <hi>Heb. 11. Noah's</hi> sacrifice was pleasing
to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. This could not be will-worship, for
such is no wayes pleasing to God; it was therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

disobedience were excommunicated out of Paradise,
which was then the type of the Church; and every soul
not circumcised the eighth day, was to be cut off from
the people of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. The Word then being
preached (for God preached to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, and
doubtlesse he preached to his Children out of Paradise)
the Sacraments administred, and Excommunication
exercised, which are the three main points of Church
discipline, it follows there was then a Church and

God of order,<note place="margin">Churches.</note> will have all things done in his Church
with order and decency; the meeting also together in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97888:18"/>
one place to hear, and pray, and offer sacrifice, did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
amity amongst Gods people. Besides we read <hi>Gen.
25.</hi> 22. that <hi>Rebecca,</hi> when the children strugled in her
womb, did not stay at home, but went, to wit, to the
publick place where Gods worship was, to enquire of
the Lord; and because in this place God used to shew
his presence to his people, by some outward signe, it
was called Gods presence; therefore <hi>Gen. 4. 16. Cain</hi>
went out from the presence of the Lord, that is, he was
excommunicate out of the Church: but we must not
conceive, that as yet there were any material buildings
for Gods service; for in the beginning men conceived
it unfit to include God within the narrow bounds of a
material Temple, whom the Heaven of Heavens can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contain; therefore they worshipped him in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
air, either upon hills, for they thought low places
were unbeseeming the most High God: hence they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
every hill Gods hill; or else if they were necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to sacrifice on the sea shore, or in some low plain,
they made their Altars so much the higher; which from
their altitude, they called <hi>Altaria;</hi> and these places of
Divine worship they named <hi>Templa</hi> from contemplation.
The very Gentiles thought it unfit to confine the Sun
their chief God to a narrow Temple, seeing the whole
world was his Temple: and after they had built Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for their Deities, they would have them for a long
time to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because they were abused both by Jewes and
Gentiles to superstition,<note place="margin">Groves and high places condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> idolatry, and all uncleannesse;
therefore God commands them to be cut down, <hi>Exod.

on the high hills, and under green trees, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 13.
such are also reproved by <hi>Hosea, chap.</hi> 4. 13. its true that
in the beginning the people of God had no other Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
but hills and groves; <hi>Abraham</hi> sacrificed upon an
hill; <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. he planted a grove to call upon the name
of the Lord, <hi>Gen. 21. Gideon</hi> is commanded to build an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97888:19"/>
Altar upon the top of the rock, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 6. 26. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
when these places were abused to idolatry,
God would have them destroyed, <hi>Levit. 26. 30. Hos.
10. 8. Amos 7. 9. Ezek.</hi> 6. 3, &amp;c. because he would not
have his people to give the least countenance to the
Gentile idolatry; for suppose they had not upon those
places erected any idols, yet they must be destroyed,
because such places were abused to idolatry; besides
God had given them a Tabernacle and Temple in
which he would be worshipped, and to which they
should repaire from all parts to call upon his name.
This Temple also was built upon a hill; they should
therefore have contented themselves with the place
that God assigned them, and not follow their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
or the wayes of the Gentiles, who afterward
in imitation of the Jewes built their Temples on hills,
as may be seen by the Samaritans and others: Neither
would God be worshipped in groves, because these were
places fitter for pleasure aud dalliance then devotion;
they were dark and obscure places, fitter for the Prince
and workes of darknesse, then for the God of light, or
children of the day.</p>

<hi>Iuno;</hi> these statues were placed over their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,

inclosed within stately buildings, which were their
Temples; these they built within consecrated groves;
such was the Temple of <hi>Vulcan</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> of <hi>Cybele</hi> in the
grove of <hi>Ida,</hi> of <hi>Iupiter Hammon</hi> in the grove of <hi>Dodene,</hi>
of <hi>Apollo</hi> in the grove of <hi>Daphne,</hi> &amp;c. these dark groves
were fit to strike a terror in the worshippers, and to
perpetrate their works of abomination; and because
they had continual lights burning in them, they were
called <hi>Luci</hi> a <hi>Lucendo,</hi> afterwards they became <hi>Asyla,</hi>
Sanctuaries or places of refuge; which some think were
first erected by <hi>Hercules</hi> his children, to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

Christians also in the time of <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Sylvester</hi> the first,
made their Temples places of refuge; which so increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that Monasteries and Bishops palaces became San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries;
but the exorbitancy of these was limited by

offering also which was exhibited for the safety of the
offerer, the fat was burned, because it was the Lords,
the rest was divided between the Priest and the people;
the breast and right shoulder belonged to the Priest;
to shew that he should be a breast to love, and a shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

For this cause the High Priest carried the names
of the twelve Tribes on his breast and shoulders. The
first fruits were an handful of the eares of corn as soon

them the whole might be sanctified. Tithes were pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

that light men knew there was a God, to whom they

knew also that the worship of God and Religion could
not be maintained, nor the Priests sustained, nor the

by Moses a Chief Priest, who was to enter the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
once a year with his Ephod, to know the will of God.
This was <hi>Aaron,</hi> whose Breeches, Coat, Girdle, and
Myter were of Linnen; when he entred into the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
the High Priest had his second High Priest to serve
in his absence. There were afterward appointed by
<hi>David</hi> four and twenty Orders of Priests, every one of
which Orders had a Chief, or High Priest; the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
was entailed to the house of <hi>Levi,</hi> because the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
were chosen in stead of the first born, because they
killed the worshippers of the Golden Calf,<note place="margin">Levites among the Iewes.</note> and because
<hi>Phinehas</hi> killed <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi.</hi> The Priests are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called Levites, and sometimes they are distinct
names; for we read that the Levites paid tithe of their
tithes to the Priests, their common charge was to pray,
preach, sacrifice, and look to the Sanctuary, in which
they served with covered heads and bare feet; their
Office was also to debar lepers, and all other uncleane
persons from the Tabernacle for a certaine time. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to excommunicate great offenders, which was
called cutting off from the people of God, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
to cast out of the Synagogue. Thirdly, to
anathematize obstinate and perverse sinners, who being
excommunicate would not repent. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persmith
was anathematized by <hi>Paul,</hi> or delivered to
Satan, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 20. Tim;</hi> 4. 14. The office of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97888:20"/>
Levites also was to help the Priests in gathering of
tiths, and to carry water and wood for the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein did the high Priest differ from other
Priests?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The high Priest only had power to enter into the
Sanctuary;<note place="margin">Difference of the high Priest from other Priests.</note> he only wore a blew robe with bells, a
golden Ephod, a breast-plate, a linnen Myter, a plate
of Gold on his head: by the Crown or plate was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
Christs Kingly office, by the breast-plate his
Priestly, and by the bells his Prophetical office: the
high Priest also was only anointed, after the order of
Priesthood was setled; but before this, every Priest
was anointed, he also wore about his paps a broydred
girdle, to signifie that his heart should be girt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from the love of earthly things, They that
took Sanctuary, were not to be set at liberty till the
death of the high Priest; to signifie that by the death
of our High Priest Jesus Christ, we are made free. The
high Priesthood was tied to the line of <hi>Aarons</hi> first born,
the other Priests were of <hi>Aarons</hi> other children; the
Levites were of <hi>Levies</hi> other posterity; the high Priest
might marry none but a Maide; other Priests migh mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a Widow, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21. The high Priest might not miourn
for the death of his kindred; other Priests might mourn
for their Father, Mother, Son, Daughter, Brother, and
husbandlesse Sister; in other things they agreed; For
all Priests must be without blemish, all must be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle, all must
be washed, all must be consecrated by offering certaine
Sacrifices; all must have the blood of the Ram put on
the tip of the right eare, the thumb of the right hand,
and great toe of the right foot, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29</p>

and substituted under him <hi>Phinees</hi> to be chief of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.
After the <hi>Israelites</hi> entred the Land, the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
staied some years at <hi>Silo;</hi> then did <hi>Ioshuah</hi> divide
the Land, and designed certain Cities of refuge, which
with some other Cities he assigned to the Priests and
Levites. The Priesthood did not continue long in the
house of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but after the death of <hi>Eleazer,</hi> and three
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97888:21"/>
Priests his Successors, this office devolved to <hi>Eli,</hi> of the
family of <hi>Ithamar;</hi> who being carelesse, suffered divers
abuses to creep into the Ecclesiastical Government, till
God raised <hi>Samuel,</hi> who reformed both the State and
Church, by appointing Schools of Prophets, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories
of Levites. From <hi>Silo</hi> the Tabernacle was
translated to <hi>Nob,</hi> from thence to <hi>Gibeon,</hi> when <hi>Nob</hi> was
destroyed by <hi>Ioab,</hi> and at last it rested in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> So
that all this time there could be no setled Church dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
among the Jewes. The Ark also was oftentimes
removed, to wit from <hi>Canaan</hi> to the <hi>Philistines,</hi> from
thence to the <hi>Bethshemites;</hi> afterward it stayed twenty
years at <hi>Kiriathjeharim;</hi> after this it remained three
moneths with <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> and at last it was brought by
<hi>David</hi> into <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vnder David and Solomon.</note> All this time neither Tabernacle,
nor Ark, nor Priesthood were setled, till <hi>David</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Levites, and out of them chose <hi>Abiathar</hi> for
High Priest, and <hi>Tsadoc</hi> for chief of the inferiour Priests,
who were to deliver the Ark to the Levites to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on their shoulders, and withal appointed Singers,
and other Musitians: in all 68. of the Levites. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
also for the service of the Tabe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>acle in <hi>Gibeon,
Tsadoc</hi> and his Brethren. At last, <hi>David</hi> being assured
by <hi>Nathan</hi> that his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> should build the Temple,
he ordered that 24000. Levites should be set apart for
the service of the Temple: to wit, 4000. door-keepers,
and as many Singers, and 6000. Judges and Governors,
and the rest for other Offices. <hi>Abiathar</hi> is made high
Priest, to wait on the Ark at <hi>Ierusalem. Tsadoc</hi> is chief
of the inferior Priests to serve in the Tabernacle at <hi>Silo.
Tsadoc</hi> was <hi>Sauls</hi> high Priest, descended from <hi>Eleazer
Aarons</hi> first born; <hi>Abiathar</hi> of the stock of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> and
<hi>Eli</hi> fled to <hi>David,</hi> who entertained him for his high
Priest; after the death of <hi>Saul, David</hi> retained them
both, thinking it did not stand with his honour and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
to reject <hi>Sauls</hi> high Priest. This <hi>Tsadoc</hi> under <hi>Soloman</hi>
was anointed the second time Priest, as <hi>Solomon</hi> was the
second time anointed King, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 22. and <hi>Abiathar</hi>
is deposed for the sins of <hi>Eli</hi> and his Sons; and so in <hi>Tsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi>
the Priesthood is translated from the house of <hi>Itha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi>
to <hi>Aarons</hi> family again. There were also Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
ordained, some for the first fruits and tenths, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97888:21"/>
others for the moneys that were given to the Temple
towards the redemption of vows, first born, and sins:
The Priests and Levites were maintained out of the first
fruits and tithes; the other treasure was for maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the daily sacrifices and other charges of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
the Gibeonites, with others, appointed by <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Solomon,</hi> did help the Levites in their Ministration:
the Priests, and in their absence, the Levites did admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
justice, both in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in the Cities of
Refuge, and ordered Ecclesiastick affairs. There were
also sometimes Extraordinary Prophets, besides the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
Its probable that the ordinary Prophets were
of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> because the administration and
care of holy things belonged to them; but extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Prophets were of other Tribes; these medled not
with sacraments and sacrifices, which was the Priests
office, nor had they their calling by succession, as the
Priests; nor was the gift of Prophecy only tied to the
man, as the Priesthood was: for we read of <hi>Miriam,
Hulda,</hi> and divers other women Prophets: and in the
Primitive Church, though women must not speak in
the Church by preaching, praying, or exhorting in an
ordinary way as the Ministers use, yet they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
to utter their extraordinary prophesies, if so be
their heads were covered in sign of modesty; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Apostle will not have women to speak in the
Church, because they must be in subjection to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands;
and this punishment is laid on them for being
deceived in <hi>Eve,</hi> and harkning to the counsel of Satan.
For, if women did preach, they might be suspected to
speak by that Spirit that deluded <hi>Eve.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What was the Ecclesiastick Government after <hi>Solomon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The renting of the ten Tribes from the other two
under <hi>Roboam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">After Solomon.</note> did much impair the beauty and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of the Ecclesiastick state. Besides that, it was
much defaced by idolatry; but reformed by <hi>Hezekias,
Iosias,</hi> and <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> who took away the high places.
Under <hi>Athaliah</hi> it was almost extinguished, had not
<hi>Iehojada</hi> the high Priest anointed <hi>Ioash,</hi> who again refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion. He being denied all aid from the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
out of their treasure towards the repairing of the
Temple, caused a Chest to be made, into which mony
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97888:22"/>
given in that kinde should be put, and imployed by
the high Priest, or by the chief of the inferior Priests,
and the Kings Scribe or Secretary, towards the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Temple, whereas before it was collected
by the Levites. King <hi>Vzziah</hi> would have burnt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
on the Altar, but was prohibited by <hi>Azariah</hi> the
high Priest, and eighty other Priests. This <hi>Vzziah</hi>
named also <hi>Azariah,</hi> though a King, yet was justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by the Priests for his pride, sacriledge and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in medling with their function; whereby he vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the Laws of Politick government which a King
should maintain; for confusion must arise, where offices
are not distinct, but where men are suffered to incroach
upon each others function. 2. He had no calling to
the Priesthood; and no man taketh upon him this office
but he that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> 3. He violated
the Law of God, who confined the Priesthood to the
house of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> excluding from that
all other Tribes. 4. He was injurious to Christ, whose
type the high Priest was, in offering sacrifices and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
representing thereby our high Priest Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
who offered up himself a sacrifice, of a sweet smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
savour unto God. So <hi>Iohojada</hi> the high Priest did
well to depose <hi>Athaliah,</hi> who was a stranger, an ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later
and usurper; this was lawful for him so to doe,
being high Priest, whose authority was great both in
civil and ecclesiastick affaires; but this is no warrant,
for any private man to attempt the like. Besides <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jada</hi>
was bound to see the young King righted, both as
he was high Priest, and as he was his kinsman. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi>
restored all according to King <hi>Davids</hi> institution;
he raised great Taxes towards the maintenance of Gods
worship, and permitted the Levites to flea the burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings,
which before belonged only to the Priests of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and caused the people to keep the Passover in the
second moneth, whereas by <hi>Moses</hi> his institution it
should be kept the first moneth. He permitted also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that were not sanctified or cleansed, to eat the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
against <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, which were innovations
in Religion. <hi>Iosias</hi> reformes all abuses, abolisheth ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
repaireth the Temple, readeth publickly the Law
of <hi>Moses,</hi> which was found by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the high Priest,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97888:22"/>
and makes a covenant with God to keep the Law. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
King <hi>Eliakim</hi> or <hi>Ioachim</hi> Religion was so corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the Priests, Levites, Prophets or Scribes with
the Elders of the people condemned the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
to death. Under <hi>Zedechiah</hi> both the Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and state fell together in <hi>Iudea.</hi>

defaced their Religion with much Idolatrous worship,
for executing of which they had their Priests and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Ministers answering to the Levites; but they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
no Priests or Levites of the order of <hi>Aaron</hi> to live
amongst them. Yet they had their Prophets also and
Prophets Children or Scholars: Their two chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
extraordinary, were <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Elisha.</hi> They had
also their Elders, who had power of Ecclesiastical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
but both Elders and people were ruled by the
Prophets, who recided in the chief Cities at last the ten
Tribes lost both themselves and Church discipline,
when they were carried away by the <hi>Assyrians.</hi> When
<hi>Salmanasser</hi> carried away the <hi>Israelites</hi> into <hi>Assyria,</hi> some
remainders of them stayed behinde in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
but being overpressed with multitudes of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
sent thither to new plant the country, the small
number of the Ephramites left behind, were forced to
comply with the new inhabitants, in their idolatrous
religions; now that the Israelites were not quite dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of their native country, may be seen in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Iosiah, 2 Chron.</hi> 34. 6, 7, 33, &amp; 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 35. 18.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In the wealth and magnificence of their Temple,<note place="margin">Solomons Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the outward splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the Iews Religion.</note>
which for the beauty, riches, and greatnesse thereof,
was one of the wonders of the world; for besides the
abundance of Iron work, there was in it an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
quantity of brasse, silver, and golden materials. The
great Altar, the Sea or Caldron, the Basis, the two
Pillars before the Temple, the twelve Oxen, the ten
Lavers, the Pots, the Shovels, the Basins, and other U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinsels
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97888:23"/>
of the Temple were all of brasse, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. as for
silver, <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us <hi>lib. 8. &amp;</hi> 9. that there were in
the Temple ten thousand Candlesticks whereof most
were silver, wine Tankards eighty thousand, silver Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
ten thousand, two hundred thousand silver Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
forty thousand Snuffers or pot-hooks, which he
calls musical instruments; besides incredible numbers
of silver Plates and Dishes, silver Tables, and the Doors
of silver. This we know, that <hi>David</hi> left seven thousand
talents of refined silver for the Temple, besides what
<hi>Solomon</hi> added, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. as for gold, we read that
the Oracle and Altar were overlayed with gold, so were
the Cherubins, and the whole house overlaid with gold,
and the very floore also, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. besides the golden
Altar. <hi>Solomon</hi> made the Table whereon the shewbread
was of gold; the Candlesticks also, with the flowers,
and lamps, and tongs, with the bowls, snuffers, basons,
spoons, censers, and hinges, all of pure gold, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 7.
I need not speak of the rich woods and pretious stones
in the Temple. The Contriver of this Fabrick was
God himselfe; the form of it was four square; the Courts
four; one for the Gentiles, another for the Israelites,
the third for women, and the fourth for the Priests: the
Gentiles might not enter into the Israelites court; for
that was counted a prophanation of the Temple; yet
our Saviour who was frequently conversant in the
court of the Gentiles, accounted that a part of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house and the house of prayer, and it was out of
this Court that he whipped the buyers and sellers; this
was called <hi>Solomons</hi> porch, <hi>Iohn 10. Acts</hi> 3. because in
that place <hi>Solomon</hi> stood when he dedicated the Temple
and used there to pray, or because it stood undemolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> when the rest of the Temple was
destroyed. In the Priests Court stood the Altar of
burnt offerings and the brasen Sea. In the Sanctuary
called the Oracle (because there God delivered his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles)
stood the Ark, the Censer, Propitiatory and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubines;
it had no light nor window in it; hither the
high Priest only had access, and that but once a year,
where he burned incense, so that he neither could see
not be seen. In the holy place which was also without
windows, there burned lights perpetually, to represent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97888:23"/>
the celestial lights; but in the most holy there was no
light at all, to shew that all outward light is but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
being compared with that light which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiteth,
and which no man can approach unto. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Ark were the two Tables of the Law, the pot
with Manna, and <hi>Aarons</hi> rod. The Tables and the rod
represented Christs active and passive obedience; the
golden pot with Manna, his two natures. The Temple
was built after the manner of the Tabernacle; but that
did far exceed this in stability, magnitude, glory, and
continuance: In the Tabernacle were but two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
in the Temple four; in the Tabernacle there was
but one golden Candlestick, and one brazen Laver, but
in the Temple there were ten of each. So this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Solomons</hi> far exceeded the other built by <hi>Zerobba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
wherein was wanting the Cloud, the celestial fire,
the Ark and the holy Oyl; besides in number of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
magnifick structure, and wealth, it was far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the first, and yet in respect of Christ the second
did far exceed the first, who supplyed the want of the
Cloud, fire, oyl, Prophesie, <hi>Vrim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi>
He being all these in a more excellent manner; but wee
must note that though the pot with Manna and <hi>Aarons</hi>
rod were kept in <hi>Moses</hi> his Ark; yet in <hi>Solomons</hi> Ark
were only the two Tables of the Law, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 9. In
the Womens Court stood the <hi>Gazophylacium</hi> or treasury,
containing the Almes or Gifts that were offered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What else may we observe of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That this Temple was to the Jewes as their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
or Metropolitan Church; the Synagogues which
were not in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> till after the captivity, did resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our Parish Churches; in which the Scribes taught,
as the Priests in the Temple; and as there was a high
Priest for the Temple, so there was for the Synagogue
a high Ruler called <hi>Archisynagogus.</hi> In the Synagogues
also they had their distinct Courts, as in the Temple,
and an Ark for the book of the Law; and the same ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
ascribed to the one as to the other, but that
they could sacrifice nowhere but in the Temple upon
the brazen Altar in the Court of the Priests; which
Altar was called <hi>Ariel</hi> or the <hi>Lyon,</hi> because like a Lyon
it devoured the flesh of the sacrifices. Upon the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97888:24"/>
Altar incense was offered; Christ was represented by
both Altars; his humanity and passion by the brazen;
his divinity, resurrection and ascension by the golden
Altar, and the incense thereof mounting towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
In the Court of the Priests called the holy place,
stood the Table of Shew-bread, on which were twelve
loaves, which represented the twelve Tribes; upon
each loaf was a dish of franckincense, shewing Christs
intercession for his people. The Candlestick and Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
or Snuffers represented the doctrine and disciplin
of the Church. Some divide the Temple but into three
parts, excluding the Court of the Gentiles; to wit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the outward Court of the Israelites, the holy or
Court of the Priests, and the holiest of all, into which
the high Priest entred once yearly with blood, incense
and smoak. It was death for any other to enter there,
and even for the high Priest himselfe, if he entred above
once in a year; yet <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Heliodorus</hi> took the
boldness to enter thither; but the one never prospered
after, and the other fell mad; so dangerous a thing it
is to be too bold with Religion. The brazen Laver
and the Shew-bread in the Priests Court represented
the two Sacraments of the Church, to wit, Baptism and
the Eucharist. The Women shewed their devotion in
bestowing their looking-glasses (which were not of
glass, as ours are, but of polished brass) upon the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Laver, <hi>Exod.</hi> 38. 8. a looking-glass sheweth us the
spots of our faces, but Baptism washeth away the spots
of our soules. Two other Temples were built in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to that of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> namely, the Temple of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> built by <hi>Sanballat</hi> upou mount <hi>Garizim;</hi> the

is uncertain; yet <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us that <hi>Herod</hi> pulled
down the old temple, and built a new one; which
was six and forty years in adorning and perfecting.

Church militant,<note place="margin">What represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Solomons Temple and V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensils thereof.</note> so the fixed Temple resembled the
Church triumphant; the three Courts represented the
threefold estate of mankind; to wit, his state in sinne
before the Law, by the outward court of the Gentiles:
his state under the Law by the inward court of the
Priests; and his state under grace by the holy of holies.
The Temple as it was built by <hi>Solomon</hi> a peaceable
Prince, resembleth the Christian Church erected by
Christ the Prince of peace. The one was built with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
noise, so was the other. The Temple was built upon
a hill; and the Church, saith Christ, is like a City built
upon an hill. In the Oracle or most holy place, was
neither the light of Sun, Moon nor Candle, resembling
the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the Revelation, having the glory
of God, and the Lamb for the light thereof, <hi>Rev. 21.

the Tables of the Law, <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, and the pot with
Manna; the mercy Seat covered the Ark, whereon
were the golden Cherubins; Christs Kingly Office was
represented by the Ark crowned with gold; his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
by the censer, and his Prophetical office by the
mercy seat, whence God spake to the high Priest; the
Tables of the Law and <hi>Aarons</hi> rod shadowed out his
active and passive obedience; the Cherubins looking
on the Ark, did signifie Jews and Gentiles looking on
Christ their King. The pot with Manna did adumbrate
his divinitie by the one, and his humanity by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Propitiatory covered the Law, and so hath
Christ hid and concealed the condemning power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
in the Sanctuary or holy place was the Table with
the twelve Loaves representing the Twelve Tribes, and
in them all true Israelites, or Church of Christ; on the
one side having the golden Candlestick, on the other
the Altar of incense, besprinkled yearly with the blood
of the Sacrifice: and representing the preaching of the
word and prayer, which by the death of Christ are
made acceptable to God. In the same place also stood
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97888:25"/>
the brazen Altar of burnt offrings and the brazen Sea;
the one resembled Christ, by whom we are justified;
the other holiness of life, by which we are sanctified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or the Altar of burnt offrings did signifie our Eucharist,
and the brazen Sea our Baptisme. The fire that burned
continually on the Altar did signifie Christs divinity;
for our God is a consuming fire, saith the Apostle. The
holy Oyl with which the Priest was anointed, shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the graces of the Spirit poured our on Christs huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;

the Pychagoreans; hence they thought that either the
soul of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> or of <hi>Elias,</hi> or of <hi>Ieremy</hi> had anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Christs body. They preferred Traditions to the
written Word, and placed most of their holiness in
washing, counting it a less sin to commit fornication,
then to eat with unwashed hands; from their daily
washings they were named <hi>Hemero-Baptists;</hi> they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
washed when they returned from the market,
thinking themselves polluted with the touch of other

in their opinions were Pythagoreans, ascribing all

things, shunning oathes, pleasures, and wine, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves with water only, and mean apparrel;
their garments were white, and had all things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
amongst them. They worshipped towards the
East, observed the Sabbath more strictly then others;
kept seven Pentecosts every year, to wit, every seventh
week one, and generally they abstained from marriage:
yet some did marry for procreation. They were super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
in preserving the names of Angels: they were
much given to silence with the Pythagoreans, chiefly
at table: none were admitted into their Society with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
four years probation: there were some of these <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senes</hi>
contemplative only, and lived in gardens, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

these rejected all Traditions and Scriptures, except the

hour, that is our twelfth. That day they might not
travel above twelve miles, least by comming home too
late they might want time for preparation to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
which began in the evening, and which for the
excellency thereof, was called the Queen of Feasts,
and gave denomination to the whole week; on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
they must not travel above two thousand paces or
cubits, for so far was the distance of the Ark from the
Camp. They were so superstitious in the keeping of
their Sabbath, that they would not fight that day, and
so suffered <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to be taken twice. Whereas they
knew that God commanded them to encompass <hi>Iericho</hi>
seven times that day; and that works of charity, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and of Religion were to be done that day, the
preparation for the Sabbath was proclaimed by sound
of trumpet, and to shew their zeal to that day, they
would keep some more hours then were enjoyned,
which additament they called <hi>Sabbathulum.</hi> They
would not dresse meat that day, because then it did not
rain Manns in the desart besides the seventh day, which
was the Sabbath or rest for men and beasts; they had
every seventh year a Sabbath, wherein the ground rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and their great Sabbath in the end of seven times
seven, called the <hi>Iubilee,</hi> in which debters, prisoners,
and morgagers of lands were made free; when the
Passeover fell upon the Sabbath, this was called the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97888:27"/>
great Sabbath, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 31. and then there was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for the Passover, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 14. but there was
no preparation due to the Passeover but in respect of
the Sabbath; which had this priviledge above all other
festivals; because God had particularly sanctificed this
day for his service; being both a memorative day of
Gods rest from the works of creation, and figurative
of our rest in Heaven; this day is abolished in respect
of the ceremonial and judicial part thereof; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

loyns girt, shooes on their feet, and staves in their hands,
to shew they were in haste to be gone; but afterward
when they were secure out of danger, they eat the
Passeover sitting, or leaning after the Roman manner:
which posture our Saviour observed when he eat the
Passeover. The beast that must be eat was a Lamb or
Kid, as being cheapest; and because it must be eat up
at one time, this Lamb was to be kept four dayes, to
wit, from the tenth day till the fifteenth, that they
might have the longer time to think on their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
by looking on the Lamb, and withall to search
if any defects were in it; for the Lamb must be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blemish; but this custome did not hold long: it
must be also a male, and not above a year old. There
must not be fewer then ten at the eating of the Lamb.
it was killed between the two evenings, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
three of the afternoon till sun-setting, which
was the first, and from thence till day light was quite
spent, which was the second evening. This killing of
the Lamb was rather a Sacrament, then a Sacrifice, as
not being performed by a Priest, but by private men,
and not in the place appointed for sacrifices, but in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
houses. The blood of the Lamb was sprinkled on
their thresholds; this ceremony was used but only the
first Passeover as I can find; the Lamb was roasted, not
boiled, for the more expedition; and nothing of it
must be left, least it should hinder them in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and it must be eat with sower herbs, to put them
in minde of their bitter servitude in <hi>Egypt:</hi> the bread
that was eat with it was unleavened, to shew their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97888:27"/>
haste in removing thence; the whole solemnity from
this was called the feast of unleavened bread, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Passeover: Albeit properly the Passover was
only the first day, yet the whole eight days were so
named. This sacrament was a true representation of
Christ the immediate Lamb of God, <hi>that takes away the
sins of the world;</hi> who is the true Passover, because the
devouring Angel of Gods wrath hath past over our sins;
he was killed and roasted by the fire of his Fathers
wrath; he is our true food, whom we must eat with
sowr herbs, and our loyns girt, to shew how ready
we must be to undergo the bitterness of afflictions, and
to subdue our carnal lusts; we must eat him without
leaven, that is, without pride and hypocrisie; now is
the time to eat him by faith: for this is the evening of
the world, in which our Passover was sacrificed for us.
The first and last day of this feast, were the two great
days; but the days between them were only half holy
days: Other ceremonies of this feast we will see

moneth in their civil computation,<note place="margin">Their feast of Trumpets.</note> was called particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Feast of Trumpets; for though at other feasts
they sounded trumpets, yet at this feast there was
more sounding, to wit, all the day, not so much in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of <hi>Isaacs</hi> deliverance from death on mount <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi>
nor for the Law given with sound of trumpets on
mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> for the feast of Pentecost was instituted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97888:28"/>
for that, but for the greater solemnity of the new year,
from whence they reckoned their Sabbatical years and
Jubiles, and dated all their deeds and bargains. This
sounding then of trumpets was a solemn promulgation
of the new year, and a preparation for the three ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
feasts that moneth; to wit, of Expiation the tenth
day, of Tabernacles from the fifteenth to the one and
twentieth, and the great feast on the two and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
day; but I think this was no particular feast, but
the conclusion of the feast of Tabernacles. Of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to be offered in the new Moons read <hi>Numb. 28. 11,
15.</hi> as for those words of <hi>David, Psa. 81. 3. blow the trumpet
in the new Moon,</hi> they are most likely to be meant of the
first new Moon or feast of Trumpets. The feast of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
was kept the tenth day of <hi>Tisri;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their feast of Expiation.</note> and it was so
called because the high Priest then entred into the
Oracle, to expiate his own and the peoples sins; for
himselfe he took a young Bullock and a Ram; for the
people he took a Ram for a burnt offering, and two hee
Goats for a sin offering; the two Goats he presented at
the door of the Tabernacle before the Lord; one of
these (lots being cast) was sent into the wildernesse;
this was called the Scape-Goat, upon whose head the
Priest laid all the sins and evils of the people, to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away by the Goat into the wilderness: The other
Goat was sacrificed. On this day was their great fast,
<hi>Act.</hi> 8. 9. wherein they abstained from all kind of
work and delights, so that they might not kindle fire,
nor dresse meat; notwithstanding their afflicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the joyful Jubile was this day proclaimed. Of
the rites used at this day by the Moderne Jwes, we will
speak hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What was their Sabbaticnl yeare and their Idbile?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iews their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical year.</note> Every seventh year was a Sabbath or rest: for
then the land did rest from plowing and sowing; then
poor debtors that were native Iewes and not Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
or strangers, were released, if they were not able
to pay: by this God would exercise the charity of his
people to the poor, and have them rely on his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
who gave such increase to the sixth year that
it brought forth provision enough for three years, and
therefore all things were this time held in common,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97888:29"/>
and they lived as <hi>Adam</hi> did in Paradise, or as people in
the golden age, when the earth <hi>sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

accord brought forth all things; <hi>omnis tulit omnia tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>
Of this years fertility see Levit. 25. 20. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
servants were this year to be set free, Exod. 21. 2.
and the Law to be read publickly, Deut. 31. 10. The
Jubilee so called from <hi>Iobal</hi> a Ram,<note place="margin">Their Iubilee.</note> because of the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Rams horns at that time was instituted <hi>Levit.
25.</hi> 8. for the comfort of prisoners, servants, and debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;
for then all things were brought back to their
former estate; and therefore perhaps it is called Jubilee
from <hi>Iobhel,</hi> to deduce or bring back; all lands that had
been sold or morgaged, were restored to the right
owners, by which meanes Families and Tribes were
preserved entire without commixtion or confusion, and
their ancient inheritances remained whole. This feast
was kept every fiftieth year, but was proclaimed the
forty ninth, on the day of expiation; and was a type
of that great liberty and delivery we have by Christ;
which is begun in this world, and consummated in that
which is to come, where we shall enjoy eternal rest,
and shall obtain remission of all our debts, and the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of that ancient inheritance prepared for us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the foundation of the world. This year of Jubilee
also was to put them in minde of their deliverance
from the captivity of <hi>Egypt.</hi> As in the Sabbatical year,
so likewise in this all things were common: the servant
whose ear was bored, is now set free; and the slave that
was sold for six years, is now dismissed, although those
six years were not yet ended. The beasts also had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to feed where they pleased. But as the Jewes
did keep no Jubilee in the captivity of <hi>Babylon;</hi> neither
have they kept any since Christ. As for their feasts of
<hi>Purim,</hi> and dedication, or renovation, called therefore
in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we will speak anon. These were
all the Festivals kept by the Iewes; the three chief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Sabbath, were the Passover, Pentecost, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles
in commemoration of three great benefits,
without which no Society or Common-wealth can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
to wit, Liberty, Laws, and Defence or Protection.
Now for diverse reasons God instituted so many feasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
days. First, because he would have his people keep
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97888:29"/>
in mind the benefits he bestowed on them. Secondly, to
give him thanks; which they solemnly did chiefly at
Easter, by offering their first fruits; at Pentecost by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Loaves; at the feast of Tabernacles by sacrificing
in that they had now gathered in all their fruits. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by these festivals the love and amity of Gods people
were the more preserved in their often meetings. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and so was their devotion the oftner exercised in
sacrifices, by which the Levites and poor were relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Fifthly, unity of Religion was also by this means
preserved. Sixthly, and their obedience also in this
was tried. Seventhly, but chiefly Christ the promised
Messiah was in these Feasts represented; for every sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and oblation did shadow forth his death and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
by whose blood alone, and not by the blood of
Goats and Rams, we have obtained eternal redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What sorts of Excommunication was used among the
Iews.</p>
                  <p>A. At first they excluded the delinquent out of their
Synagogue,<note place="margin">Their excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of old.</note> John 9. 22 but not quite out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for he might stand in the gate in time of Divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
this censure lasted thirty days and more, if the
party repented not; and if he died without repentance,
he wanted the ceremonies of common burial, and a
stone was laid on his coffin, signifying he deserved sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
They had a higher degree of excommunication,
which Saint Paul calls <hi>[a giving over to Satan]</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 5.
by the Greeks the partie so excommunicate was called
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and such were not permitted to come neer
the Temple. Curses also were denounced against them;
<hi>Hymenaeus, Alexander,</hi> and the incestuous person are
those excommunicated. Their highest degree was
<hi>Maran-atha,</hi> that is, the Lord cometh, 1 Cor. 16. signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
that the Lord was comming with vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such; these were totally secluded from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, which is called a cutting off from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and a blotting or razing of their names out of the
book of life; answering to those three degrees, the
Greek Church had; their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
and 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So the Latine had their <hi>Absten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,
Excommunicati,</hi> and <hi>Anathemata,</hi> the reason why God
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97888:30"/>
would have this strict discipline used in his Church is
First to terrifie the evil doers; Secondly, to preserve the
sound sheep from being infected by the scabbed. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to keep up the reputation of his Church, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
might be scandalized for conniving at sin. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that Gods judgements may he either diverted or
prevented, for he is just, and will not wink at sinne.
Fifthly, that the excommunicate person by this severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be brought to repentance and amendment of
life. They had a peculiar way in excommunicating
the Samaritans, to wit, by sound of trumpet, and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Levites, who first by word of mouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
a curse against the Samaritans, and those that
eat or conversed with them; shewing that they shall
never be Proselytes in <hi>Israel,</hi> nor have any part in the
resurrection of the just. Then they wrote this curse,
and caused it to be read add pronounced in all parts of
<hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How did God instruct the Iews of old?</p>
                  <p>A.<note place="margin">Iews, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by God of old.</note> Sometimes by visions and dreams, sometimes by
secret inspiration, sometimes by a voice from Heaven;
sometimes by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that is, light and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which were the precious stones on the breast
plate of the high priest; but ordinarily he taught them
by his word, either written by his holy Pen-men, or
unwritten, namely by Tradition; for God delivered
his will this way to <hi>Moses,</hi> and he to <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
this to the Elders, and they to the Prophets.
From the Prophets the great Synagogue received these
Traditions, till at last they were committed to writing,
for the benefit of those Jewes which dwelt in <hi>Iudea,</hi>
about the year of Christ 230. This was called the <hi>Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi>
of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but 500. years after Christ, the Jews
at <hi>Babylon</hi> made a more exact collection, and this they
called the <hi>Thalmud</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which contains all their
Canon and civil Laws, and is with them of no lesse au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
then the Scripture. They have besides this,
their <hi>Kabbala,</hi> which is a mystical kind of learning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
most in certain letters and syllables, out of which
they raise many mystical whimsies. The <hi>Thalmudists</hi>
expect a temporal kingdom, the <hi>Kabbalists</hi> a spiritual,
who also hold that there was an invisible world crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97888:30"/>
2000. years before this, because the first word in
<hi>Genesis</hi> is <hi>Bereshith,</hi> and the first letter thereof is <hi>beth,</hi>
which stands in their Arethmetick for 2000. R. <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
compiled the <hi>Thalmud</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> the other of
<hi>Babylon</hi> was made up by <hi>R. Asse;</hi> which is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
six parts, sixty Books, and five hundred thirty and
two Chapters. It's thought that <hi>Ezra</hi> deliverd this
<hi>Thalmud</hi> to <hi>Simon</hi> the High Priest, and he to his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
till at last it came to old <hi>Simeon,</hi> (who took up
Christ in his arms) and from him to his scholar <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel.</hi>
It's most likely that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had his <hi>Kabbalisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Philosophy from the Jewish Rabbies; but of these
passages see <hi>Galatinus de arcanis, Munster, Fagius, D. Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi>
and the <hi>Thalmud</hi> it selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What maintenance did the Iews allow their Priests and
Levites?</p>
                  <p>A.<note place="margin">Their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Priests and Levites.</note> Besides certain Cities and shares in their sacrifices
and oblations, they allowed them the first fruits and
tithes, the first fruits of the threshing floore, Num. 15.
20. comprehending the first fruits in the sheafe, offered
at the Passeover in the beginning of harvest; and the
first fruits of loaves at Pentecost in the end of their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
besides the first of the dough, Numb. 15. 20. Nehe.
10. 37. Rom. 11. 10. these first fruits were called heave
or wave-offerings, because they were shaken up and
down, to shew that God was Lord of Heaven and
Earth; or else from hand to hand to all corners
of the earth, to signifie that the whole earth was the
Lords. The firstlings of man and beast God challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as his own, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. because he spared the first
born of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when he smote those of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
The firstlings of clean beasts were sacrificed, the fat
whereof was burned, but the flesh was given to the
Priest. But the firstlings of men and unclean beasts
were redeemed for five silver shekels of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
paid to the Priests for each of them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 15, 16.
when they carried up their first fruits to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they
had a pipe playing before them, and a bull with gilded
homes, and a garland of Olive branches on this head.
As for their tithes, the husbandman according to <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligers</hi>
reckoning, out of 6000. bushels in one year, paid
for his first and second tith and first fruits 1121. bushels,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97888:31"/>
which is above a sixth part of the whole, besides the
tith of their cattel, and fruit of their trees; and so strict
were the Pharisees in the payment of their tiths that
they tithed mint, <hi>anise &amp; cumine, Matth.</hi> 23. 23. out of
the first tith payed to the Levites, by the husbandman,
was payed a tith to the Priest by the Levites. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
tith was payd by the husbandman, either in kine
or in money as he pleased. This tith was not so great
as the first; for if he paid 590. bushels for his first tith,
he paid but 531. for his second tith: but this second
tith every third year was spent by the husbandman at
home upon the poor, and not in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.
This year was called the year of tiths, <hi>Deut. 26.
12.</hi> and though at this day the Jews have no lands, yet
they pay carefully the tenth of their encrease.</p>
                  <p>Q. What Church government had the Iews after they were
carried captive into <hi>Babylon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. They had no setled government in <hi>Babylon,</hi> being
then in misery and captivity;<note place="margin">Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the captivity of Babylon.</note> yet they had some Elders
and Prophets, as may be seen in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 1. After the
captivity, they reformed all things according to King
<hi>Davids</hi> institution; but the number of singers, doot
keepers and other officers came far short of the former:
This government continued in some measure, till the
time of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who sold the Pontificare to
<hi>Iason</hi> the brother of <hi>Onias</hi> the high Priest: he dy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grecs
brought in the Greek government, and so did the
third brother <hi>Menelaus;</hi> at last it was totally subverted
in the eighth year of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and again restored by
<hi>Matathius,</hi> and more fully by <hi>Iudas, Ionathan</hi> and his
brother <hi>Simon;</hi> in <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Priesthood was transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the family of <hi>Tsadoc</hi> to the posterity of <hi>Ioiarib,</hi>
who came of <hi>Eleazer.</hi> And the government held out
in some sort till <hi>Herod</hi> the first overthrew it, by thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the lawful Priests, and substituting at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
unworthy men. The like was done by the Roman
Governors; then were the Levites deprived of their
tiths by the chief Priests. The singers were permitted
by <hi>Agrippa</hi> the younger, to wear a linnen garment as
well as the Priests; they retained then some Priests and
Levites; they had also Scribes and Lawyers, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction with the Elders of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97888:31"/>
people. They had also Synagogues of their profession
abroad in <hi>Alexandria, Cilicia,</hi> and other places, <hi>Acts.</hi> 6. 9.
and in <hi>Iudea</hi> too, whither the people met to pray, and
hear the Law and Prophets read. The Synagogues had
their Rulers, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15. who did interpret the Law;
they were also called Prophets, Scribes, and Lawyers:
but the Government of the Jewish Church was much
pestered by the Samaritans, Esseans, Sadduces, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises:
Nazareans who rejected the books of <hi>Mojes,</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merobaptists,
who washed themselves daily, and the
<hi>Herodians,</hi> who held that <hi>Herod</hi> was Christ; the Esse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
contemned marriage, and thought themselves holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then other men, therefore called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Saints, they
would have had all things equal. The Samaritans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
all Scripture, except the Pentateuch, and were
the sworn enemies of the <hi>Iews.</hi> The Pharisees were so
called from Separation, for they separated themselves
from other men, accounting all profane but themselves.
They placed all Sanctimony in outward shews. The
Sadduces, so called from Justice, denied providence,
subjected all things to our will, denied the souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
Angels, and the Resurrection. The Scribes
perverred all by their sophistical glosses on the Law.
Of these things, see <hi>Sigonius, Bertram, Iosephus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> But what Church government have the Iewes at this

Moen, <hi>Fridburg, Amsterdam,</hi> and in divers places of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Bohemia,</hi> and elsewhere, they have their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
where they use to pray together, and to hear
the Law read. Before they come thither, they wash
themselves, and scrape their shooes with an iron fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a wall before the Synagogue. They enter with
great reverence, bowing themselves towards the Ark,
where their Law is kept, and are tied to a set form of
prayer, which they must read in their books; they that
cannot read must hearken diligently, and say Amen,
though they understand not what is read; for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
is the old Hebrew, which they generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not. They utter divers brief benedictions, and
after them some short prayers; and because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97888:32"/>
sacrifice, being banished from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the place
appointed for sacrifice, therefore in stead thereof they
read the Law concerning sacrifices and offerings; and
some Expositions thereof out of the Thalmud, which
they understand not. They pray in particular for the
rebuilding of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and their return thither, which
they dayly expect, for which they expresse great joy
and vociferation. Then they read a long prayer, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
out of the Psalms, with some part out of the first
Book of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> ch. 30. Then they conclude with
singing these words of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> vers. 17. <hi>But upon mount
Sion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holinesse; and
the house of Iacob shall possesse their possessions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the
house of Esau shall be stubble,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And Saviours shall come
upon mount Sion to judge the mount of Esau, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
shall be the Lords.</hi> Other Songs also they sing, much
to this purpose; and when they sing or say these words,
<hi>[Hearken O Israel, the Lord our God is one God]</hi> they turn
their heads to the four corners of the world, intimating
thereby that God is every where King. There be some
of their prayers which they are bound to say every day
twice, standing strait, thinking that thereby they shall
merit. But when they utter these words of <hi>Isai. 6. 3.
[Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabbath, the Earth is full of
the Glory]</hi> they leap three times. They hold, that
whosoever doth speak whilest they are praying, shall
eat burning coales when they are dead. After this,
they utter an execrable praver against all Christians and
baptized Jews. Then they pray for peace, bowing their
head to the left, then to the right hand, and depart out
of the Synagogue with their faces stil towards the Ark,
like crabs going backward. They use also to go slowly
out of the Synagogue, lest by making haste, they might
seem to be weary of praying. When they mention the
adoration which is given to Christ by Christians, they
spit on the ground in detestation thereof.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97888:32"/>
they hold the Angels to be there present; but if
any be necessiated to break wind, he must beg pardon
of God, who hath made him a body so full of holes;
he that prays must make no interruption, though a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
should bite him, or the King of <hi>Israel</hi> speak to him.
They are bound to utter an hundred blessings every

                     <hi>A.</hi> About five in the afternoon the Door-keeper of
the Synagogue with a hammer knocks at their doores,<note place="margin">Their times of prayer.</note>
warning them to repair to Evening prayer. When they
are come, they sit down, and begin their service with
these words of the 84. Psalm: <hi>[Blessed are they that dwell
in thy house]</hi> Then the Precentor, having said or sung
some Psalms, and half that holy prayer called <hi>Kaddesh,</hi>
the whole Synagogve saith eighteen prayers, according
to the number of bones in a mans back. And then
the Praecentor comes down from his Pulpit, and falls
upon his knees before the Ark, after the example of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah,
Iosh.</hi> 7. 6. and layeth his left hand under his
face, because it is said, <hi>Cant. 2. 6. His left hand is under
my head.</hi> This the people do likewise, and with their
faces covered, and towards the ground, they say the
sixth Psalm. Having ended their Evening Prayer, and
pawsed a while, they begin their night prayers, which
they should say after supper; but because it would be
inconvenient to return late to the Synagogue, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times they are drunk after supper, therefore before
they depart they say some prayers; but if any have
a quarrel with his neighbour, he takes the Liturgy-book
and shuts it, clapping his hand upon it, intimating
hereby that he would pray no more, till his neighbour
were reconciled to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Why do the Iews, beside the Sabbath, keep holy the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
and Thursday?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. Ezdras</hi> appointed that the people should meet
three times in the week,<note place="margin">Iews hear the Law three times a week.</note> to be taught the Law, because

                     </gap>, say they, without the Law. And
because <hi>Moses</hi> went up the mountain the second time
to renew the Tables of the Law, and to pacifie Gods
anger for the peoples worshipping the Golden Calf on
Thursday, and returned thence on Monday; therefore
the devoted Jews use to fast these two days, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee
did in the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> What Ceremonies observe they about the Book of the
Law?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In every Synagogue the Book of the Law is kept
within a Chest;<note place="margin">Their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies about the book of the Law.</note> this Book is the Pentareuch, written
on parchment in great Characters, and carried to and
fro on two staves, fastened at each end of the parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Before the door of the Ark or Chest, hangs a
piece of Tapestry, on which divers birds are figured,
because birds were pictuted upon the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
This book is wrapt in linnen, which is covered
with Silk, Velvet, or Tissue. The office of carrying the
Law, is sold to him that gives most, and the money is
bestowed on the poor. The two staves are called the
trees of Life. When the Praecentor brings the book
out of the Ark into the Pulpit, then they all sing these
words, <hi>Numb. 10. 35. Let God arise; and let his enemies be
scatrered, &amp;c.</hi> After some Anthymns are sung, one comes
between the Chasan or Chief Singer, and him who
bought the Office of carrying the Law, and kisses (not
the parchment, for that were too great presumption)
but the cloaths in which it is wrapped; then with a
loud voice he blesseth God, who hath chosen them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all others, and given them a Law. Then the chief
Singer reads a Chapter, and the Book is kissed again,
with blessing of God for giving the true Law. Then it
is elevated on high; the whole Congregation shouting;
<hi>This is the Law that Moses gave to Israel.</hi> The Women in
the mean time being in a distinct Synagogue by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
are not permitted to kisse the Book; nor to be
there with the men, to shew what modesty ought to
be there; but if he who carrieth the Book, should by
chance stumble with it, a long fast must be enjoyned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that fall being held ommous, and a presage of great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.
When the Book is wrapped up again within
all its coverings, young and old kiss it, touching it only
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97888:33"/>
with their two fingers; and whilest it is carried back
to the Ark, they all sing again, <hi>Return Lord to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands of Israel,</hi> Num. 10. 36. So prayers being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as they are going out of the Synagogue, they say,
<hi>The Lord preserve my going out, and comming in, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
and for ever,</hi> Psal 5. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is their manner of observing the Sabbath at this
day?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because <hi>Moses</hi> commanded the Israelites to gather
as much Manna on the sixth day as might serve them
also the seventh,<note place="margin">Their manner of observing the Sabbath.</note> therefore all that they eat and drink
on the Sabbath, is prepared and dressed on the Friday;
and if the servants work be more then they can perform
before the Sabbath, their Masters, be they never so
great and rich, must help them, that the Sabbath be not
broken; yet they have three Feasts that day, one in
the Evening when they begin their Rest, the second at
Noon, and the third in the Evening when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
their Sabbath. All that day their, Tables remain
covered; If they do not wash their heads, hands and
feet; If they pair not their nailes, beginning at the
fourth finger on the left hand, which pairings must not
be trod upon, but either burned or buried; if they
change not their cloaths; if the men cut not their
beards, and the women if they combe not their heads;
if they sharp not their knives, and make every thing
clean in their houses on the Friday, they esteem the
neglect of any of these circumstances a violation of
their Sabbath. Before the Sun go down, the women
kindle their Sabbatarian lights, which is an ancient
custome, as may be seen in <hi>Persius, Satyr</hi> 5.
<q>
                        <l>Herodis venere dies, unctáque senestrae</l>
                        <l>Depositae pinguem nebulam vemuere lucernae.</l>
                     </q>
Except we understand here by <hi>Herods</hi> dayes, <hi>Herods</hi>
birth-day, which was carefully observed by the <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Sect. Now the reason why the women kindle
the lights, is because the first woman extinguished the
light and glory of man by her disobedience. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
use to hasten their Sabbath, and to enlarge it, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may have the more liberty and refreshing, who all
that time cocl: and refresh themselves in water, for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97888:34"/>
which cause the Jews are forbid by their Rabbins to
draw all the water out of any place, but to leave some
for refrigeration of these scorched souls. They beleeve
that a good and evil Angel stand before their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
observing who pray and hear most diligently.
These Angels wait upon such to their houses, where
finding all clean and neat, they depart joyfully, though
the evil Angel be not concerned, but is forced to shew
a seeming content. They do not put out their lights
all that day, nor must they snuff them, least they should
thereby break their Sabbath, nor must they that day
catch a Flea, or kill a Louse. If a <hi>Iew</hi> in his journey
be overtaken by the Sabbath, he must stay, though in
the midst of a Field or Wood, though in danger of
theeves, storms, or hunger, he must not budge. They
begin their feasting on the Sabbath with conse crated
Wine, and two loaves of Bread, in memory of the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
portion of Manna they gathered for the Sabbath:
which day they think is not sufficiently observed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they eat and drink largly in the day time, and kiss
their Wives often in the night. In their Synagogues
they have read to them seven of their Chapters by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
several men, who come in at one door, and go out
at another. These Lectures are out of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>Act.</hi> 13. 27 &amp; 15. 21. they pray for the souls of
those who have violated the Sabbath, who being in
Hell, have so much ease by their prayers, as to turn from
one side to the other. But their Service lasteth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the sixth hour, which is our noon; for by their
Law they must neither pray nor fast beyond this hour.
If any dream of such things as they count ominous, such
as the burning of the Law, the falling of their houses,
or teeth, they must fast till the evening, and so they
must fast the next day, as a punishment for fasting on
the Sabbath. After dinner the most of their discourse
is about their use-money, and other worldly businesse.
In the evening they repair to their Synagogues againe,
and thence to their third feast. They conclude their
Sabbath with singing, or caterwaling rather, which
they continue as long as they can, for ease of the defunct
souls: And withal they pray that <hi>Elias</hi> would hasten
his comming, even the next Sabbath if he please, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97888:34"/>
he might give them notice of the Messias his comming.
Then the richer sort lighting a torch, taking a silver box
full of spices with one hand, and a cup of wine in the
other, they say certain blessings to God for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of Light, Wine, Spices, and the Sabbath, and with
some ridiculous ceremonies they end the Sabbath, and
begin their week. Some wash their eyes and face with
that consecrated wine, counting it medicinable: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sprinkle it about their houses against all Charms,
and Witchcraft. They smell to the spices, that they
may not faint when one of their soules deparreth,
which it doth at the end of every Sabbath, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
at the beginning of the same, so that every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day they have two souls; besides they think that
Hell fire stinks in the week days, but not in the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
therefore they smell to the spices when the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
is ended. They pour out some of their consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
wine on the ground, to refresh <hi>Core</hi> and his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who live yet under the ground in fire. On the
Sabbath they will not light their Candles, make their
fires, milk their Cows, snuff their Candles; dresse their
Meat themselves, but have Christians to do such trivial
things, and then they brag that they be the Lords of
the world, and the Christians be their servants.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The richer sort spend thirty dayes in preparation,<note place="margin">Modern Iewes, how they keep theis Passover.</note>
and buying of the purest wheat for their unleavened
bread, with which also they furnish the poorer sort,
who cannot buy. Their first born onely fast the Eve
before. The Sabbath which immediatly precedeth
the Passover, is very holy among them. In this they
have long Sermons concerning the Passeover, and use
thereof; this they call the great Sabbath. They are
very curious in cleansing their houses, and washing
their utensils three dayes before <hi>Easter,</hi> being more
carefull with the Pharisees to wash the outside of the
platter, then to purge out the rapine and intemperance
that is within. The night before the Passeover they
take great pains to finde out all the Leavened bread
that is in their houses. They search and sweep every
corner and Mouse-hole for crums with wax candles;
if they finde none, they purposely fling down some,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97888:35"/>
that they might not seem to have prayed and laboured
in vain: All the crums they finde, they lay up carefully
against the next day, and burn them. They are very
curious about the grinding, kneading, and baking of
the unleavened bread; the corn must be ground three
dayes before it be baked. The Mill stone must be
cleansed from all former Meal, and so must the Chest
that holds it. The water that is used, must be brought
in consecrated vessels, about the going down of the Sun,
covered. The Master of the Family must draw the
water himself. The form of their unleavened cake is
round, and full of holes to let in aire, least it should
swell. No other ingredient is permitted in the flower,
but water. About ten or eleven they dine, but soberly,
that they may with the better appetite eat their unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
bread in the Evening. But first they repair to
their Synagogues, where they sing and pray; onely the
women stay at home to cover the tables, to hang the
walls with Tapestry, and to expose their cupbords of
Plate, and other riches to be seen, to put them in minde
of that wealth which was in the Temple when it was
robbed and demolished. Each Master of the Family, if
he be rich, hath his chair of state, wherein he sits like
a Prince, to shew that they were now redeemed from
the bondage of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The poorer sort sit majestically
also in their seats.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> When it begins to grow dark,<note place="margin">Their manner of eating the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb.</note> they run home
from the Synagogue; a platter is uncovered, wherein
are three Cakes, the uppermost representing the High
Priest, the middle the Levite, and the lowermost the
people of <hi>Israel;</hi> in another dish is a roasted leg of Lamb
or Kid, with an hard egge; there is also a dish of Pap
or thick stuff, made of divers fruits with wine spiced,
and chiefly Cinnamon, representing the straw and
brick of <hi>Egypt:</hi> in another platter there are Letrice,
Parsley, Ivy, Raddish, and such like herbs, with another
dish of vinegar, to represent the sower herbs caten here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
with the Lamb. Every one hath his draught of
wine. The middle cake is broken into two pieces; the
one whereof the Master hides in a Napkin, to shew how
the <hi>Israelites</hi> fled with their dough unleavened out of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97888:35"/>
                     <hi>Egypt.</hi> Then laying hold on the other peece of Cake,
they sing, <hi>Such was the bread of affliction our Fathers eat
in Egypt. Here we are now, the next year we shall be in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
The platter with the Cakes is carried from the
Table to the Children, that they night demand what
that is, as we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 26, 27. When the Cakes
are set down again, they sing a song of their deliverance;
and drink another glasse of Wine, leaning like Princes
in their chairs. Then some of the Cakes are eaten
with thanks-giving, and some of the Herbs dipped in the
Pap. And at last the third Cake is broken, and some
more of the herbs are eaten.</p>

they are not in their own Land, but live amongst

the true cause why they keep not the old Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
is, because Christ our true Passeover is sacrificed
for us, who hath put an end to all the old Ceremonies;
and it is observeable that those Jews who now live in
<hi>Canaan,</hi> even in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> do use altogether the same

<hi>Abraham,</hi> they would do the works of <hi>Abraham;</hi> they
would beleeve with <hi>Abraham,</hi> who saw the day of
Christ and rejoyced; they can claim no share in the
covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> because they deny and
persecute him who is the foundation of the Covenant;
they condemn Christians for making and honouring of
the image of Christ and of his Saints; which is not so
much out of zeal against images, for they allow the
images of the Cherubins which were in the Tabernacle
and Temple, but rather out of spight against Christ and
his Saints. They count it idolatry to honour Christ
in his picture or image, and yet they consider not that
themselves are the greatest Idolaters in the world, in
worshipping God according to their own fansie, and
not according to his word, which teacheth us that he
is to be worshipped in the unity of Essence, and Trinity
of persons, which they deny; thus they worship though
not images, yet their own imaginations: how often
have their Progenitors attempted to reestablish their
antient government, but still in vain, and to their own
destruction? witnesse what they suffered under <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>

the greatest enemies that ever Christianity had, so doe
they continue their harred against us at this day; but
being kept under they dare not do the mischief they
would; yet they curse us still, and hold that the best
of Christians is no better then the Serpent, whose head
deserved to be trod upon. They think they do God
good service if they can cheat a Christian; and they
make no conscience to forswear themselves, when they
take an oath upon any of our Bibles, thinking they are
bound to keep no oath but what they take upon their
own <hi>Torah</hi> or book of the Law which is read in their
Synagogues. Neither will they swear willingly, but

judgement shall be saved, and shall acknowledge Christ
the true Mesliah; yet not all without exception; but
all whose names are written in the book of life: this
restriction sheweth, that some will not be saved. 5. By
suffering the Jewes to live amongst us, we shall be the
more induced to acknowledge the goodnesse of God
towards us Gentiles, in receiving us to mercy, when
he cast off his own people. By this also we are taught
to fear and tremble at Gods judgements; <hi>because for
unbelief they were broken off; we stand by faith; let us not be
too high minded but fear; for if we continue not in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
we shall also be cut off,</hi> Rom. 11. Lastly, from the
Jewes we have our Scriptures; they can be our witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to the Gentiles, that cut Scriptures; are not devised
and compiled by us, but by our enemies; out of which
Scripture, even to the great grief of the Jewes, we can
clearly prove that Christ is the true Mesliah; therefore
it is convenient that we permit them to live amongst
us:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> May Christian Princes permit the Iewes to exercise
their own Religion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They may,<note place="margin">Whether to be permitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to exercise their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> if so be they dishonour not Christ,
nor traduce or molest his Church: For they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
exercise their Religion, then curn Atheists; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
seeing they worship the same God with us, though
not in the same manner, and read the same Scriptures
though not in the same sense. For this cause the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, and the Imperial Laws suffered them;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97888:37"/>
and Christ himself permitted their Doctors to sit in the
chair of <hi>Moses,</hi> and to teach his Doctrine, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled
the people to obey the same; besides, by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Jews to use their Religion without molestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by using them courteously, they may be the sooner
enduced to embrace Christ; and indeed our cruelties
against them, and the wickednesse of our lives have
been, and are still great obstacles to their conversion.
But Christian Princes must be careful that they be not
suffered to blaspheme Christ, or abuse his Church; for
they are keepers of both Tables, and they do not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the sword in vain; they should also use all the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
means they can, to bring them to the knowledge
and love of Christ, by instructing them in the grounds
of Christian Religion; but violence must be avoided;
for faith cometh by perswasion, not by compulsion;
neither must their infants be forcibly baptized against
their Parents consent, but when they come to years of
discretion they should cause them to be instructed in
the principles of Christianity, nor must their Parents
be suffered to hinder them; but whilest they are infants,
they must not be baptized against their Parents will,
because that were to take away the right of paternity,
which parents have over their children both by the
Laws of God, of Nature, and of Nations; besides the
children of Jewes who are enemies of Christ, cannot
be comprehended within the Covenant, and therefore
are not capable of the sign of the Covenant, till they be
of years; and if then they embrace Christ, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Covenant, and so made capable of the
seal thereof. Besides, the forced baptism of Jewish
children would be a great scandal to Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which would be traduced as a violent way to force
infants to receive that of which they had no knowledg
nor could give their consent to; and so these children
when they come to years of discretion, might justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiare
that Religion, which was forced on them,
when they had neithe knowledge of it, nor gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> In what things must not Christians communicate with
Iews?<note place="margin">Wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are not to communicate with Iews.</note>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97888:38"/>
together, nor entertain friendship and familiarity,
least by these means Christians should be infected with
their errors and superstition, or least they should seem
to countenance their wicked opinions. 2. Christians
must not serve Jews in any kind of service; for then
they will brag that they are the Lords of the world, and
Christians their slaves: besides, it is unseemly that the
children of the free born (for so we are, being made
free by Christ) should serve the sons of the bond wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
for they are true Israelites, and the sons of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
who have the faith and do the works of <hi>Abraham:</hi>
who are Israelites not after the flesh, but after the spirit.
3. Christians must not employ Jews for their Physitians;
for this were to engage them: besides, we know out of
Histories how dangerous such Physitians have proved
to Christians, who by reason of their inveterate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
make no conscience to poyson them, but rather
think they are bound to do so. 4 Christians must take
heed how they traffick with Jews, least they be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them, or least they partake of the sins and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
of the Jews, by selling them such wares as
they know they will abuse to their superstitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
5. Let not Christians borrow money of Jews, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they mean to be undone by them; for they have
ever been, and are to this day, unconscionable Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.
6. Christians ought not to read their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
books, but to suppress and burn them; for
by them our blessed Saviour in his person, offices, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
&amp; miracles is highly dishonoured, and his Church
traduced: therefore Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, about the
year of Christ 1230. caused the <hi>Thalmud</hi> in which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion is so much blasted, to be burned; which
was performed accordingly by the Chancellor of <hi>Paris;</hi>
and about the year 1553. Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that all the Jewish blasphemous books, with
both the <hi>Thalmuds</hi> should be searched out, and flung
in the fire: and that their estates should be consiscared
who did harbour or read, print or write such wicked
books, or bring them from forraign parts into Christian
Territories.</p>

kept with great Ceremony, the other four are but half
holy days; all this time they sup-plentifully, and drink
strenuously, till it be midnight, but they drink up four
consecrated cups of Wine, two before supper, and two
at, or after supper: each of these cups is accompanied
with a prayer, and the last with execrations against
Christians; at supper they eat the other halfe Cake;
and keep open all night their doors and gates, as being
perswaded that then they are safe and secure from all
danger, and that they are ready to entertain <hi>Eliah,</hi>
whose comming they expect then. During this time
they eat up the whole three cakes mentioned before,
and have divers disputations about what work is fit to
be done that time, full of ridiculous subtilties. If du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this time they find any leaven in their houses, they
touch it not, but cover it till they burn it. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not certain which is the true fourteenth
day of the Moon, when they begin their Easter, they
keep the second day as solemnly as the first; and because
they know not the true seventh day, therefore least
they should mistake, they observe also the eighth day,
after which day they bring leaven into their houses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
the men fast three times after, to expiate for
their intemperance during the feast; and for the space
of thirty days, they neither marry nor both, nor cut
their hair, because <hi>Rabbi Akibha</hi> lost by death all his
Disciples, being eighty thousand, between Easter and
Pentecost.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>A. Pentecost,<note place="margin">Their Pentecost.</note> so called in the new Testament, from
the fifty days between Easter and that feast, in the old
Law it is called the feast of Harvest, and of first fruits,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 16. because then their Harvest began, and
the time they offered their first fruits of the Earth. The
Jews are very exact in numbring each week and day
from Easter to Pentecost, praying continually that God
would bring them home againe to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that in
their own Land they might offer to him their first fruits
as <hi>Moses</hi> commanded them. They keep two holy days
at Pentecost, because they know not which is the true
day. They produce their Law twice: and by five

men they read so much as concerneth that festivity. They
strow their Houses, Synagogues, and streets with grass,
fil their windows with green boughs, and wear on their
heads green Garlands; to shew that all places about
mount <hi>Sinai</hi> were green, when they received the Law.
They eat that day altogether white meats of milk, to
shew the whitenesse and sweetnesse of the Law. They
make a Cake, or Pye having seven Cakes in one, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the seven Heavens into which God ascended from

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>art, is now
observed by the Jews eight days together. The two
first and two last are solemnly kept; the other four are
but half festivals. They first repair to their Synagogues;
then after some praying and singing, they run home to
their Tents, but do not stay there all night, as their
Ancestors were wont to do. They use to take in one
hand boughs of Palme, Olive, and Willow, and in the
other a Pome-citron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they bless God, and shake
the boughs towards the four cardinal points of Heaven:
then having placed the Law upon the Pulpit, they go
round about it seven times in seven days, in memory of
the Walls of <hi>Iericho,</hi> encompassed seven times. Then
having shaken the branches in their hands, they pray
against Christians. This feast is kept about the middle
of <hi>September;</hi> in which moneth they beleeve shall be
fought the great battel between <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> in which
<hi>Gog</hi> shall be slain, and the Jews restored to their own
Land. About night they go abroad in the Moon light,
believing that God doth reveal to them by the shadows
of the Moon who shall live or die that year, for then
they begin the computation of their year. The shaking
of the branches towards the four corners of the world,
signifies the destruction of the four great Monarchies,
(to wit) the <hi>Assyrian, Persian, Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman.</hi> They
make great use of Citrons in this feast, for they send six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
men every year into <hi>Spain</hi> to bring with them as
many of these as they can: for by the Citrons,
they say, are represented just men, who are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97888:39"/>
as full of good their workes, as this fruit is full of
seeds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How do they keep their new Moons?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Their new Moons are but halfe holy days with
them;<note place="margin">Their new Moons.</note> for in the morning they go to their Synagogues,
the rest of the day they spend in eating, drinking, and
gaming: The day before the new Moon they use to fast;
when they first see her, they utter a Benediction, and
leap three times towards her, wishing that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
may come no neerer to hurt them, then they are
able to come neer and hurt her. The women have more
right to keep this day holy then the men, because they
would not part with their Ear-rings and Jewels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the making of the Golden Calf; but willingly
parted with them towards the building of the Temple.
They give a ridiculous reason, why sacrifices were
commanded every new <hi>Moon;</hi> because, say they, the Moon murmured against God in the beginning; therfore
he took her light from her, and appointed sacrifices to
expiare her crime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Why do the Iews fast in the moneth of <hi>August?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because they hold the world was made in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fast in August.</note>
therefore they make that moneth the beginning of
their year; and believe, that about that time God will
come to judge the world; for this cause they fast and
pray divers days before, and baptize themselvs in Lakes
and Rivers; and where these are wanting, they make
pits, which they fill with water; in these they dip
themselves over head and ears, thinking this a meanes
to expiate their sins; they frequent their Synagogues
and Church yards, desiring God to pardon them for
the good Jews sake who are buried there, and in the
same they distribute large Alms to the poor. In some
places there they cause Rams horns to be sounded when
they go to their Synagogues, to put the greater terrour
in them, when they consider their sins, and the horror
of Gods judgements. Their fasting ceremonies being
ended, they shave and bath themselves, and begin their
year with much mirth and jovialty.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because they are commanded by <hi>Moses,</hi>

                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.
24. to keep holy the first day of the seventh moneth,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97888:40"/>
therefore they begin their Civil year from that day,
which after evening peayer in their Synagogues they
initiate with a cup of wine, wishing to each other a
good year. The younger sort repair to the chief Rabbi
for his blessing, which he bestoweth on them by prayer
and imposition of hands. Being returned home, they
fall to eating, drinking, and making merry. On the
Table is set down a Rams head, to put them in minde
of that Ram which on this day was sacrificed in <hi>Isaacs</hi>
stead, and to signifie that they shall be the Head, and
not the Tail of Christians. They feed that night plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
on fish and fruit, to shew that they will encrease
and multiply in good works, as the fish do in the Sea;
and that their enemies shall be cut off from all help, as
the fruit is plucked off from the tree. In the morning
they go betimes to their Synagogues to sing and pray;
the Law is taken twice out of the Ark, and some Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
read; after which, one soundeth a Rams horn on
the Pulpit; if he sounds clear, its a good sign; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
they hold it ominous, and a sign of a bad year.
This horn-trumpet is also in memory of <hi>Isaacs</hi> delivery
by the Ram this day, as they hold. The rest of the
day they spend in good cheer and mirth. After dinner
they go to the waters, there to drown their sins. If
they see any fish in the water, they shake their cloaths,
that their sins falling upon those fishes, may be carried
away by them into the Sea, as of old they were by the
scape-goat into the wilderness. At night they feast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and so initiate the year with two days mirth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How doe they prepare themselves for Morning prayer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They hold it necessary that every Jew from the
fifteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for morning prayer.</note> till Pentecost, should rise before day;
because then the nights are long, but from Pentecost
till the fifteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> they may rise after day; their
rising will be the more acceptable to God, if they have
weeped in the night, for with such the stars and planets
do weep; they must let their tears fall down their
cheeks, because then God is ready with his bottle to
receive them; these tears may serve them for good use;
because when at any time, the enemies of <hi>Israel</hi> send out
Edicts to destroy the Jewes, God is ready with these
bottles to pour them out upon these writings, and to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97888:40"/>
blotuot the Edict that the Jews may receive no hurt
thereby. They hold the morning the best time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the house of God, because <hi>David</hi> faith, <hi>Thou
wilt heat my voice betimes in the morning.</hi> In the evening
they say God commands all the gates of Heaven to be
shut; which are guarded by certain Angels, who are
silent till after midnight, then a great noise is heard in
Heaven, commanding the gates to be opened: this
noise is heard by our cocks here below, who presently
upon this clap their wings and crow, that men thereby
may awake; then the evil spirits who had leave to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
up and down in the night, whilest Heaven gates
were shut, lose all power of doing hurt: as soon as they
hear the cock crow, they must say this prayer as they
are taught by their Rabbins: <hi>Blessed be thou O God, Lord of
all the World, who hast given such understanding to the cock.</hi>
When they change their shirts, the walls and bed-posts
must not see their nakedness; but they must change
within the bed-cloaths. They must not in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
put on the left shoe before the right; but at night
they should put off the left shoe first. As they are going
out of their chamber in the morning, they must with a
submissive mind bow their head to the ground, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the devastation of the Temple at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
but no man must offer to say his prayers till first
he hath eased himself at the stoole, and washed his
hands, because upon them evil spirits sit in the night
time; and his face also, because it was made after the
image of God; but they must be careful that the right
hand with which they touch the Law, and write the
name of God, may no waies be defiled. And when in
private they are easing of themselves, they must not
then think of God, or of his Law, for that will shorten
their life, as their Rabbins say. If any man touch his
eye in the morning with unwashed hands, he shall be
blind; if his ears, deaf; if his nostrils, they shall still be
dropping; if his mouth, it shall stink; if any part of his
skin, it shall be scabbed; they must not presume to pray
but in their four cornerd cloak, from which hangs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
borders, laces, or Phylacteries, which they call
<hi>Zizim;</hi> they must also have their <hi>Tephillin</hi> tied to their
heads and hands; these are scrowls or bundels of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97888:41"/>
but of these and many more of their superstitious
ceremonies, see <hi>Buxtorsius</hi> in <hi>Synagoga Iudaica.</hi>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> How do they prepare themselves for the feast of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The first ten days after the beginning are peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential,<note place="margin">Their feast of Reconciliation, and Ceremonies therein.</note>
in which they fast and pray. The ninth day
every man, young and old, takes a Cock in his hand;
every woman and maid a Hen. After some impertinent
sentences pronounced out of Scripture, each one whirls
the Cock about the Priests head, saying, This Cock
shall die for me; then the Cocks throat is cut, his body
flung to the ground, and at last roasted: His guts are
cast upon the top of the house, that the Ravens may
carry them away, and their sins together. They la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
much for white Cocks, which they hold to be
pure from sin; red Cocks they detest, as being full of
sin. The reason why they sacrifice a Cock, is, because
the Hewbrew word <hi>Gheber</hi> signifieth a man, and in the
Thalmud a Cock; so to them the death of a Cock is as
much as the death of a man. After this, they go to
the Church yard, confesse their sins, and give to the
poor the price of their Cocks, because of old they used
to give their cocks to the poor. In the afternoon they
dip themselves again in water, and prepare lights for
their next days service in the Synagogue, where, in the
evening they meet, and reconcile themselves to each
other, where hath been any offence; he that seeks to
be reconciled, is sufficiently satisfied, though the other
be obstinate; and thinks himself acquitted, in seeking for
that the other hath refused. If the party wronged die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he that did the wrong goeth to his grave, and before
ten witnesses confesseth his fault; they confesse also
their sins to each other, in some secret place of the
Church: they go two and two; the one boweth his
body, turning his face to the North; whilest he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
and beating of his breast, receiveth thirty nine
stripes on the back, of his fellow with a leather thong,
whom he repayes in the like manner. Having done,
they return home, and make merry with their roasted
cocks and hens. Over their cloaths they put on a white
shirt or surplice, to shew that now they are white and
pure from sin.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The ninth day the men in the Synagogues, the
women at home, about evening, light wax candles, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
which they pray, stretching out their hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the lights; which if they burn clear, they take it
for a good sign that their sins are pardoned, and that
they shall be happy: if the lights be dim, or the wax
melt, it's ominous. Then they fast, goe bare-footed,
abstain from oyl, bathing, and carnal copulation: they
spend much of the night in singing and praying, and
most of the next day, while the Priest extendeth his
hands to blesse them, they all lay their hands
on their faces, as not daring to look on those
sanctified hands of the Priest. At this time they fast
48. hours together, and some have been observed to
stand upright and pray above 24. hours without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.

Satan, that he may not accuse them for their sins.</p>

Ark with dancing about it; in the interim, whilest the
books are out of the Ark, a candle burns within it, to

in scrabling for the same, fall often times together by
the ears. That day their Ecclesiastick Offices are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to sale, which occasioneth much strife and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
among them. The money raised on the Offices, is
for the repair of their Synagogues, and relief of the
poor. At last they conclude all with good cheer and
wine at supper, and are merry, if while the Law was
carried about, he did not stumble that carried it, for
that is held very ominous.</p>

Of furnishing the consecrated wine, which is spent in
their Sabbaths, and other Festivals Thirdly, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

of folding and unfolding the Book of the Law.
Fourthly, of lifting up, and carrying about the said
Book. Fifthly, of touching the sacred staves on which
the Book or Parchment is rowled. Young men are
greedy of this office, because they think the touching
of these staves will prolong their life. Sixthly, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Why do they keep the feast of Dedication?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They keep it in memory of <hi>Iudas Macchabaeus,</hi>
who dedicated the Temple the 25. of <hi>November.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their feast of Dedication.</note> After
it had been possessed and polluted by the Grecians, it
was then ordained by <hi>Iudas</hi> and his brethren, and all
the people, that this feast should be kept yearly for
eight days together. At that first Dedication was found
a small vessel of Consecrated oyl; which of it self was
not sufficient to hold out above one night, but by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
it maintained the Lights for the whole eight days.
Now this feast consisteth in drinking and gormandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and in pompous superstition about their lights.
Yet Christ honoured this feast with his presence, <hi>Iohn</hi>
10. 22. not to countenance the abuses thereof, but the
institution it self; for all places set apart for the service
of God, ought to be consecrated and dedicated to him
by prayer and decent ceremonies; therefore <hi>Moses</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
the Tabernacle to God, and <hi>Solomon</hi> the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with great solemnity and prayers; when the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was rebuilt, after the peoples returne from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
it was dedicated again; and now the third time it
was dedicated, when it was profaned by <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
These second Dedications are called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is,
Renovations. The Temple was also newly consecrated
or dedicated under <hi>Ezechia,</hi> after it had been profaned
by <hi>Achaz, 2 Chron.</hi> 29. The Priests and Levites spent
eight dayes in this dedication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is their feast of <hi>Purim?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That is of Lots;<note place="margin">Their feast of Purim.</note> for <hi>Haman</hi> by lot had appointed
the Jews to be massacred all through the <hi>Persian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in one day, to wit, the thirteenth day of the
twelfth moneth, which is <hi>Adar</hi> or <hi>February;</hi> but the
Plotters were massacred themselves by the Jews the
same day. For at <hi>Sufae, Haman</hi> with his ten Sons, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97888:42"/>
five hundred men more were slain, and three hundred
the day after: and on the same day through the rest of
<hi>Assuerus</hi> his Dominions were slain by the Jews 75000.
So because this day they destroyed their Enemies, and
the next day rested themselves, therefore at this feast
they keep two holy days, or rather days for <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
In their Synagogues they set up lights in the night time,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d the whole book of <hi>Esther</hi> is read. As often as they
hear the name of <hi>Haman,</hi> they keep a cruel noise, and
stamping with their feet. They read all that passage of
the death of <hi>Hamans</hi> Sons at one breath, to signifie the
suddennesse of that death. These two days are spent
in singing, playing, eating and drinking. The men
wear womens apparrel, and the women mens, against
the Law of God, which they think at this time of mirth
they may lawfully violate. And that the poor may be
merry also, the richer sort furnish them with meat and
drink; and so with this ryotous <hi>Bacchanal,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
their Anniversary Feasts; for this is the last of
the year, having none between this and <hi>Easter.</hi>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> What Fasting days do the Iews observe now?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They keep the four Fasts mentioned by <hi>Zachary
chap.</hi> 8. 19. to wit,<note place="margin">Their fasts.</note> that of the tenth moneth, on the
the tenth of <hi>December,</hi> in memory of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> besieged
that day by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> Secondly, they fast the
seventeenth day of the fourth moneth, or <hi>Iune,</hi> in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the two Tables of the Law broken, for the loss
of their dayly sacrifice; for burning of the Law; for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up idolatry in the Temple; for besieging <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the
second time, and for breaking down the walls thereof.
They count the days from this till the ninth of the next
moneth all unlucky; so that they avoid all great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse;
and School-Masters during that time will not
beat their Scholars. Thirdly, they fast the ninth day
of the fifth moneth, or <hi>Iuly,</hi> because then the Temple
was burned; therefore they go bare-foot, sit on the
ground, read <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> Lamentations, and in the Church
yards among the dead they bewail the losse of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
From the first till the tenth of this moneth, they
abstain from flesh, wine, shaving, bathing, marrying, and
pleading, and from all kind of delights. Fourthly, they
fast the third day of <hi>September,</hi> because <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of those Jewes that were not carried away in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
was treacherously murdered, as we read <hi>Ieremy
40.</hi> and 41. Besides these fasts, they have others, but
not so generally observed; for some of their preciser
sort fast every Monday and Thursday. Some fast the
tenth of <hi>March,</hi> because <hi>Miriam</hi> died that day, and the
people wanted water in the Desart. Some fast the
tenth of <hi>April,</hi> for the death of <hi>Eli,</hi> and his two Sons,
and the losse of the Ark. Some fast the eighteenth of
this moneth, for the death of <hi>Samuel.</hi> At <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the
Jewes used yearly to fast in remembrance of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Bible out of Hebrew into Greek by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Interpreters: This fast was observed the eighth
day of <hi>Tebheth</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> and was a day of much
heavinesse among them; which must proceed from
their pride or envy, or too much superstition, disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that their Law should be imparted to the Gentils,
and that this Translation was a profanation thereof. So
superstitious they are in their fasts, that they will read
no passages in the Bible but such as are sad and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
as the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem, Ieremies</hi> Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
&amp;c. and not any passage that is joyful, such as
their delivery from Egyptian slavery, or <hi>Hamans</hi> tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
The only fast that God commanded was that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the day of Expiation; other fasts were enjoined by
the Prince upon emergent occasions; as the fast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Iehosophat,</hi> by <hi>Ioachim</hi> and other Princes.
Divers other private fasts they have upon private occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Their fast is from all meat and drink till the
evening that the stars appear.</p>
                  <p>Q. What is the manner of their Marriages?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They are married in the open air,<note place="margin">Their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.</note> either in the
streets or gardens, by their Rabbies. The Bridegroom
wears about his neck a hair-cloath, the end of which
the Rabbi puts on the Brides head, after the example
of <hi>Ruth,</hi> who desired to be covered with the skirt of
<hi>Boaz</hi> his garment. Then the Rabbi takes in his hand
a glasse full of wine, over which he pronounceth a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
praising God for this Conjunction, and gives it to
the Bride-man and his Spouse that they may drink.
Then he takes from the Bridegroom his gold ring, and
asks of the standers by if it be good, and worth the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97888:43"/>
given for it, and so puts it upon one of the Brides
fingers: then are the marriage writings read openly!
Then the Rabbi takes another glass of wine, over
which he prayeth, and presents it to the married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be tasted; but the Bridegroom takes the glasse
and dashes it against the wall, in memory of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and for the same cause in some places
ashes are put on the Bridegrooms head; so the Bride in
sign of sorrow puts on a black cloak, and the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
a black hood; they are married in the open aire,
that by looking up to Heaven, they may be put in mind
of multiplying like the stars. The other ceremonies
used before and after marriage, are not to our purpose,
as not being Ecclesiastical. But we must know that
besides the principal Wife, they have others that are
subordinate, which we may call Concubines, who
have not the command of the family, nor gifts, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
from the Husband, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> had from <hi>Isaac,</hi> nor
matrimonial writings, as the chief Wife hath; nor
may their Children inherit, but receive gifts onely; thus
<hi>Abraham</hi> dealt with the sons of his Concubines, <hi>Gen.
25.</hi> Their custome also is first to be contracted, and
after some space of time to be married; which contract
was confirmed either by writing, or by a piece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or by copulation; but this last was punishable.
Their marriages are accompanied with blessings and
prayses; therefore if they are married within doors,
that house is called <hi>Beth-Hillulim,</hi> the house of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> After the same manner that they did in the time
of Christ;<note place="margin">Their Bills of Divorce.</note> when any man is weary of his Wife, he
writes a Bill of twelve lines only, neither more nor
fewer; this he delivers to his Wife before three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
who subscribe and seal the same, whereby he
gives her free power to go whither she will, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of her self as she pleaseth, but she must not marry
again till after ninty days, that it may be known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she be with child or not; the Woman also might
give a Bill of Divorce to her Husband, of which our
Saviour speaketh, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 12. and withall sheweth
that such Bills of Divorce were not commanded but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97888:44"/>
tolerated by <hi>Moses</hi> for the hardnesse of their hearts;
and tells them plainly that whosoever puts away his
wife, and marries another, commits adultery, and so
doth she if she marries another, <hi>Mat. 5. 31. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Martyr</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. is mistaken when he saith,
that there is never any mention in Scripture, that the
woman gave a Bill of Divorce to her Husband; but our
Saviour tells us, that if the woman put away her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and marry another, she commits adultery; but
the man and woman could not put away one another
without a Bill of Divorce, and that before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> After what manner is the Wife separated from her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Husbands brother?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The widow with five witnesses repairs to the
chief Rabbi,<note place="margin">Their separation of the wife from the deceased Husbands bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> who asks her certain questions, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
her Husband hath been dead three moneths, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his brother be a single man, whether the man
present be her husbands full brother, of what age they
are of; and whether they think themselves fit for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation?
Then he asks of the woman if she be fasting,
for otherwise she must not spit in his face. Then he
asks of the man if the woman present were his brothers
Wife, if he will marry her, or suffer his shoe to be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
off. If he say he will not marry; then a shoe is
brought, and put upon his right foot being bare; then
the woman comes, saying, this my brother in Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
to raise up seed to his brother, and so bowing her
selfe, pulls off his shoe, and spits in his face; saying, so
shall it be to him that will not build up his brothers
house; and thus they are parted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is the manner of Circumcising their Children?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Child is first washed,<note place="margin">Their circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Rites thereof.</note> and layed in clean lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen;
for if he be foul, or defile himself while he is Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,
the Mohel or Circumciser is to suspend or
interrupt his prayer, till he be washed againe. In the
morning of the eighth day, the God-father seateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
down in a seat placed neer the Ark, and the Mohel
neer him. Twelve wax candles are brought in, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the Twelve Tribes. Then two cups of red wine,
the circumcising knife, with two dishes; the one of oyl,
the other of sand. When the Child is brought to the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97888:44"/>
door by the women, the Congregation riseth up, the
God-father takes the Child and sits down in his seat.
There is also a seat prepared for <hi>Eliah,</hi> whose comming
they expect at the circumcision. The child is then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and usually by the name of some of his Ancestors,
so that <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 61. it was wondered at, that <hi>Zacharie</hi>
should name his Son <hi>Iohn,</hi> seeing none of his kindred
was named with this name. The eighth day was so
strictly observed, that if it fell on the Sabbath, the child
was then circumcised; not sooner least God should be
thought to be tied to the Sacrament, and because the
Child the first seven days after the birth was held le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
unclean, and yet remaining in his blood, <hi>Levit.
12. 2, 3. &amp;</hi> 22. 27. nor later, least the parents should
be longer withheld from the comfort of the Sacrament.
The Penalty of contempt or neglect of circumcision
was <hi>a cutting off from the people,</hi> Gen. 17. 14. that is, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
or bodily death of the parents. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God would have killed <hi>Moses</hi> for not circumcising
his son; or else by the death of the son himselfe, when
he comes to years of discretion, if he be not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
either by himself, or by his parents, or by the
Judges.</p>
                  <p>Q. How doth the Mohel cut off the foreskin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He first rubs it, that it may be the lesse sensible,
then blesseth God for the Covenant of Circumcision,
and withal cuts off the forepart of the skin, and flings
it into the Sand, in memory of that promise, <hi>Gen 32.
12. I will make thee as the sand of the Sea;</hi> then he spits
some red wine on the wound, and washeth it, and
some also on the Childs face, if he faint, and taketh the
bleeding member into his mouth, and sucks the blood
from it, which he spits into the other cup of wine. Then
he teares off the remaining skin with his sharp-pointed
nailes, and layeth the clouts dipt in oyl on the wound,
and bindeth them. Then he blesseth God again, and
the Godfather takes the other cup of wine, and prayeth
for the Child. And the Mohel moisteneth the childs
lips with wine and his own blood, and prayeth again.
If the child be sick on the eighth day, his circumcision
is deferred till he recover. If he die before the eighth
day, he is circumcised at the grave, but without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> How do they redeem their first born?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> When the Child is one and thirty days old,<note place="margin">How they redeem their first born.</note> he
is set upon a Table by the Father before the Priest,
with as much money as two Dollers and a half. After
some questions propounded by the Priest to the Father
and Mother, amongst others, whether he esteems more
of his money, or of his Child; he answers, of his Child;
then the Priest takes the money and layeth it on the
Childs head, and pronounceth that he being the first
born, and presented before the Lord, is now redeemed:
if before this time the Father dies, then the Mother sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
by a scroll about the childs neck, that he is the
first born, and not redeemed; who when he comes of
age, is bound to redeem himself. He is held to be of
just age when he is thirteen years old, for then the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
stand no more charged with his sins, but must
himselfe bear his own burthen.</p>
                  <p>Q. What duty is performed to the sick?</p>
                  <p>

expiation for their sins, and that they may have a share
in Paradise, and in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Q. How do they use their dead?</p>

piece of their garments, because <hi>Iacob</hi> tore his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
when he heard of <hi>Iosephs</hi> death. They mourn
also seven days because <hi>Ioseph</hi> did so for his father. All
the water in the house they pour out into the streets.
They cover his face, and bow his thumb, that it resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
the Hebrew Shaddai, that so they may terrifie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
from comming near the Corps. His other fingers are
stretched out, to shew that now he holds the world no
longer, having forsaken it. They wash the body with
warm water, and anoint the head with wine, and the
yolk of an egg; and cloath him with the white surplice
he wore on the day of Reconciliation, and then they
Coffin him. When the Corps is carried out of the house
they cast a shell after him, signifying that all sorrow
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97888:45"/>
should be now cast out of that house. In the Church
yard a prayer or two is said; then the Corps is buried,
the next of kin casteth in the first earth. In their return
they cast grasse over their heads; either to signifie their
frailty and mortality, <hi>For all flesh is grass,</hi> or else their
hope of the Resurrection. When they enter the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
they skip to and fro, and change their seat seven
times. The Mourners go bare-foot seven days; abstain
from wine and flesh, except on Sabbaths and Festivals.
They bath not in 33. days, nor pare their nails. They
burn candles for seven days together, thinking that the
departed souls return to the place where they left the
body, and bewail the losse thereof. They beleeve that
no Jew can be partaker of the Resurrection, who is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> except God through hollow passages
of the earth convey his body thither; grounding this
conceit upon <hi>Iacobs</hi> desire to <hi>Ioseph</hi> that he should bury
him in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not in <hi>Egypt.</hi> They borrowed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Gentile customs in their Funerals, as cutting or
tearing their skin, hiring of women to sing, and minstrils
to play; also shaving; going bare footed, and bare-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with dust on their heads, washing, anointing and
embalming, besides beautifying of their Sepulchres, and
adding of Epitaphs, &amp;c. they used also burning of the
dead, as may be seen in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 12. and <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 10.
they bury apart by themselves, and not with those of
another Religion. Their common Epitaph is, <hi>Let his

to worship the Sun; and so was the King to offer to

they kept a feast for five dayes in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

to strangers, and received much money thereby;
to this purpose they sat and exposed themselves at the

used to have their Processions, and to carry their Idols
on their shoulders, the people before and behinde

heads and beards, and to stand in their Temple with Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Scepters, and other Weapons in their hands, and
Candles lighted before them. They held a Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,

Here stood two <hi>Priapi</hi> or <hi>Phalli,</hi> and within the Quire
(into which the chief Priest onely might enter) stood
<hi>Iupiters</hi> statue, supported with Bulls, <hi>Iuno</hi>'s with Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
having in one hand a Scepter, and a Distaff in
the other: In the Temple stood <hi>Apollo,</hi> cloathed and
bearded, whose Oracles were much consulted; if the
Petition was liked, the Image would move forward;
if otherwise, backward. Here also stood divers other
Idols; 300. Priests were maintained here; who did
Minister all in white, with their heads covered, and
sacrificed twice a day, with singing and musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
if to <hi>Iuno;</hi> but to <hi>Iupiter</hi> no musick. Their
high Priest was elected every year, whose cloathing
was Purple, and a golden Myter. Not far from the
Temple was a deep Lake, in which were kept consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fishes: in the midst thereof stood a stone Altar,
crowned continually with Garlands; on this odours
did still burn. They had divers feasts: the greatest
was that of the Fire; where they set divers trees hung
with divers sorts of beasts for sacrifice on fire, after they
had carried about these Fires (in Procession) their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols.

divers young men at this feast geld themselves. Here

till his return. The young men were bound to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
their hair, then to cut it in the Temple, and to
offer it in a box of Gold or Silver, with their names in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
thereon. Some other foolish circumstances there
were in their superstitious Church discipline, if I may
so call it: Of which see <hi>Lucian</hi> in his <hi>Syrian</hi> Goddesse;
out of whom I have this description. By this, and by
what we are to speak of the Gentile idolatry, we may
admire the madnesse of those men, who being made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the image of God, do subject and enslave themselves
to dead images, to senselesse blocks and stones, which
have eyes and see not, eares and heare not: then not
without cause did <hi>David</hi> say, <hi>that they who made them are
like unto them;</hi> he meanes those that worship them; for
not the Artificer, but the Worshipper makes the Idol;
So the Poet,
<q>
                        <l>Qui fingit sacros auro vel marmore vultus,</l>
                        <l>Non facit ille De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </q>
And it is strange to see how cold and sparing we are in
the worship of the true God: how zealous and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
they are in the service of their false gods; they can
cut their flesh, and cry from morning to evening with
<hi>Baals</hi> Priests; they can part from their gold and silver,
their jewels and ear-rings to make them a golden Calf,
yea they can offer their sons and daughters to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the fire to <hi>Moloch;</hi> and yet there is no sin so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to God as Idolatry; for it is repugnant to his
entity, because <hi>an Idol is nothing in the world,</hi> saith the
Apostle; it is repugnant to his unity, because he is but
one; but false gods or idols are many; it is repugnant
to him as he is verity, because <hi>Idols are lying vanities;</hi> it
is repugnant also to him, as he is life, because Idols are
dead and senselesse things; it is repugnant to his purity;
for Idols are called filthinesse, pollution, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Scripture; it is also repugnant to the love he
carrieth to his Church: for it causeth jealousie in him,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97888:49"/>
and therefore he calleth Idolatry <hi>Whoredom,</hi> and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>Adulterers;</hi> and they that worship Idols are said <hi>to
goe a Whoring after other gods;</hi> it is likewise opposite to
gods goodnesse; therefore idolatrie is particularly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
sin, as if it were the only sin in the world, so <hi>Exod.
32. 22. This people is prone to sin,</hi> that is, to idolatry: so
<hi>Lament. 1. 8. my people have committed a sin,</hi> that is, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry:
and as it is most repugnant to Gods nature, so it is
to almost all his commandments. To the first; because it
makes other gods then he. To the seond: because it makes
graven Images, and worships them. To the third: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it takes Gods name in vain, by giving it to the
creature even to stocks and stones. To the fifth:
because it gives the honour due to parents, uno sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Idols; for the Idolater <hi>saith to the stock, thou art
my Father, and to the stone thou hast begotten me,</hi> Jer 2. 27.
To the sixth commandement, because the Idolater is a
horrible murtherer, in not sparing his own children.
To the seventh, for Idolatry is not onely spiritual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultry,
but the cause also of carnal pollution, and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
lust; for among the Indiáns they practised So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy
in the sight of their Idols, as a part of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
due to them. Lastly it is against the eighth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement;
for the Idolater is a sacrilegious thiefe,
stealing from God his due, and giving it to his Idol, as
the Prophet complaineth <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 8. There are three
sins inseparable companions of Idolatry; namely, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
Coveteousnesse, and carnal Pollution. For the
first, The Apostle <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20. joyneth Idolatry and
Witchcraft together: The <hi>Ephesians</hi> as they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Idolatry, so they were to Magical Arts: and as
soon as they forsook their idolatry, they forsook also
their witchcraft, and burned their conjuring books,
<hi>Acts</hi> 19. 19. as <hi>Manasseh</hi> reared up Altars for <hi>Baal,</hi> so he
used inchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits, and
Wizzards, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 6. hence proceeded diabolical
inspirations, and Enthusiasmes, Oracles, and many other
inchanting tricks. As for covetousness, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that it accompanies idolatry; for it is a kind of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
and so the Apostle calls it; The covetous man
worshippeth his god <hi>Plutus,</hi> or <hi>Mammon,</hi> with as great
devotion as any Idolater doth his Idol: he saith to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97888:49"/>
                     <hi>wedge, thou art my hope, and to the gold, thou art my
confidence;</hi> he sacrificeth to his god the poor whom he
oppresseth, his own soul also, and his body too, which
he macerates with care, and deprives of things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
King <hi>Ahaz</hi> no sooner gave himself to Idolatry,
but he presently shews his sacrilegious covetousnesse in
robbing the house of the Lord of its wealth, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.
As for carnal uncleannesse, how much that hath been
practised by Idolaters, is known to them that have
read Histories; for they did not think their daughters
fit for marriage, till first they had been prostituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Idols; and though adultery, fornication and
Sodomy were thought sins, yet these were held vertues,
and a part of religious worship in the presence of their
gods; and it is no marvel; for their very gods were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous,
Adulterers, and Sodomites; and divers Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
after their death were deified, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in <hi>Laurentia,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Faustulus,</hi> who for her
whoordomes among the Shepherds was called <hi>Lupa,</hi>
that is a Whore. Such another was <hi>Leaena</hi> among the
<hi>Athenians;</hi> such was <hi>Faula, Hercules</hi> his Whore, and
<hi>Flora,</hi> who left her estate to the Romans. In a word,
Idolatry hath been the cause of all sin and mischiefe in
the world; from whence proceed murthers, rapine,
oppression, injustice, intemperance, uncleannesse, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
avarice, &amp;c. but from this, that men forsook the
living God, who is the punisher of vice, and rewarder
of vertue; and served false gods, who had been wicked
men themselves whilest they lived, and patronized
wickednesse when they were dead?</p>

spend their time in singing Hymns, and rehearsing the
Acts of their gods. It is not lawful for them to go out
of the sacred bounds allotted them: if they doe, they
may be killed by Law. They hold Mice to be arrant
enemies to their gods, therefore they kill them. Of
this subject see <hi>Solinus, Athenaeus, Diodorus, Boeinus,</hi> and

a River, which with them are hallowed. The <hi>Magi</hi>
may with their own hands kill any thing, except a
man, and a dog. They leave no part of their sacrifices
for their gods, but divide it by the direction of their

to it, or dirt, was death. They sacrificed chiefly to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97888:51"/>
Fire and Water; the fire they cherish with dry sticks
without their barks, with tallow also and oyl. When
they sacrifice to the Waters, they slay the beasts in a
ditch, and lay the flesh on Mirtle, and Lawrel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
<hi>Magi</hi> burn the same, then they pray and sprinkle on the
earth, Oyl, Milk, and Honey. They used not to slay
their sacrifice with a knife, but with a mallet or club.
The <hi>Magi</hi> keep the sacrifice still burning, and pray eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day an hour before it. They adored the Sun, whom
they called <hi>Mithra,</hi> at his rising, and offered to him
white Horses, whose sacred Chariot was drawn with
white Steeds before the King when he went to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
They had divers festival days, the chiefe whereof
was that of the Sun. The next was that they called
the Destruction of Vices, when they killed poysonable
creatures and sacrificed. Of these Persian Rites see,
<hi>Herodotus, Athenaeus, Pausanias,</hi> and others.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They worshipped first of all <hi>Vesta,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Scythians, their old Religion.</note> then <hi>Iupiter,
Apollo, Venus, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Hercules:</hi> they had neither I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
Altars, nor Temples for any of their gods, except
for <hi>Mars,</hi> whose temples they erected of bundles of twigs,
heaped up together. In stead of his Image, they set up
an old iron sword, to which they offered yearly sacrifices
of cattel, and horses; and of men every hundreth Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
with whose blood they besprinkle <hi>Mars</hi> his sword.
Then they cut off the right shoulders of the slain men,
and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and then to strangle the beast which they sacrificed,
praying to that god to whom they offered the beast;
they kindled no fire of wood, for the Country yielded
none, but they burned the bones of the beast to boyl
the flesh withal; if they want a vessel, they boyl the
flesh in the beasts paunch; they use no Vows, nor any
other ceremonies. Their chiefest sacrifices were Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

                     </gap>o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their cattel and milk. To these silk and felt Idols
(for of such materials they make them) are offered the
first fruits of milk, meat and drink, the hearts also of
beasts, which they leave before them all night, and
then eat them in the morning; they offer horses to the
Emperours Idol, which none afterward must ride; they
do not break, but burn the bones of their Sacrifices; by
their discipline they must not touch the fire with a
knife, nor meddle with young birds, nor pour milke,
drink, or meat on the ground, nor break one bone with
another, nor make water within their Tents, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other such traditions, which if violated, are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with death, or else redeemed with much money.
They believe another world, but such as this is. When
one dieth, he hath meat set before him, and mares milk:
his friends eat a horse, and burn the bones thereof for
his soul: they bury also with him a Mare, a Colt, and a
Horse bridled and sadled; his gold and silver also; and
they set upon poles the horse hide that was eat, that he
may not be without a Tent in the other world; they
use to purifie every thing by making it passe between
two fires. When they pray, they are injoyned by their
Discipline to lift up their hands and smite their teeth
three times. They use to feed the Ghosts or Spirits
with Mares milk cast in the air, or poured on the ground.
They have their religious Votaries and Monasteries, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which there is an Order called Senscin, which
eat nothing but bran steeped in hot water. They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
not Idols, nor do they marry; but they hold trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animation,
and divers other ridiculous opinions, as may
be seen in <hi>Iohannes de Plano Carpini,</hi> whom Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Anno.</hi> 1246. sent Embassadour to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Court.
See also <hi>M. Paulus Venetus, Vincentius, Bellouack</hi> in <hi>spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bist.
Math. Paris</hi> and others. There is one thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in their Discipline, that they force no man to
embrace their Religion. But <hi>Ortelius</hi> mentioneth a strange
custom amongst them, that their Priests on high trees
preach to them, and after Sermon besprinkle their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
with blood, milk, earth, and cow-dung mixed
together, and no lesse strange it is that they do not bury
their dead but hang them on trees.</p>

them had some knowledge of the beginning of the
world, which they learned, not from the Jewes, with
whom they had no commerce, but from the heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
and Poets; and these were led to believe
this truth by the guide of natural reason; for when they
considered the continual vicissitudes in the world, the
alteration, generation, and corruption of things, the
nature of motion and of time, whereof the one presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
a Chief Mover; for nothing can move it selfe;
the other consisteth in Priotity and Posteriority, which
depends upon motion, and suteth not with Eternity;
when they observed also the Harmony, Order and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of things, &amp; how every motion and mutation aimed at
a certain End, they concluded that this great Universe
could not be ruled, or have existence by chance, but by
providence and wisdom; and that therefore this must
needs have a beginning; otherwise we could not know
whether the Egge or the Bird, the Seed or the Plant,
the Day or the Night, the Light or the Darknesse were
first. And seeing the world consisteth of corruptible
parts, how can the Whole which is made up of such
Parts be Eternal? They found also that it was repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to reason, for so many Eternals and infinite En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
to exist actually together; for every Entity in the
world must be Eternal, if it selfe be eternal. Besides,
that it is against the nature of Eternity to admit <hi>magis</hi> &amp;
<hi>minus,</hi> degrees, auction or diminution; which it must
needs do, if the world be eternal; for if there have
been infinite annual revolutions of the Sun, and infinite
monethly revolutions of the Moon, there must needs
be something greater then Infinity; for the revolutions
of the Moon, are far more then of the Sun; by these
reasons they were induced to acknowledge a beginning
of the world; of which <hi>Merc. Trismegistus</hi> in <hi>Poemandra</hi>

to the world, some from one element, some from
another. The <hi>Platonists</hi> alwayes held the creation of
the world; and the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> affirming there is a
first mover, must conclude, that the world which is
moved, had a beginning; they say also that the world
doth depend upon God; how then can it be Eternal?
seeing dependance and eternity are incompatible. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
in his Book <hi>de mundo,</hi> and in his Metaphysicks
saith, <hi>That God is the cause and Author, not onely of living
creatures, but also of nature it selfe, and of the world. Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
in his Books of the nature of the gods confesseth, <hi>That
every thing had a beginning, and that man was not created
by chance, but by a supream power. Seneca, Macrobius,
Virgil, Ovid,</hi> and other Latine Poets, except <hi>Lucretius,</hi>
affirm the same Doctrine. The Stoicks also asserted the
original of the world, and so did the <hi>Epicures,</hi> though
these held a beginning fortuital, not providential, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the original of things to chance, not to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.

the bones as holy reliques: the Priests Fee is the
skin, with the head, feet, and inwards, and some part
of the flesh also. Before the Corps of any great man be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97888:53"/>
buried, they set a table before it, furnished with all sort
of meats, with the odour of which they think the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
soul is refreshed and heartned against the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the body. They cast into the fire with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
pictures of his men, women, horses, and other things
to serve him in the other world. In <hi>Tangoth</hi> they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Idols with many heads and hands; they have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries
where the Monks are walled up. In <hi>Succuir,</hi>
they make perfumes of Rheubarb for their Idols. In
<hi>Caindu</hi> they prostitute their wives, sisters, and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to strangers, as an honour due to their Idols. In

their Idols if they recover; their Sorcerers also cause
them to offer to these Idols sacrifices of Rams with
black heads, which with spiced drinks they eat up mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
with singing and dancing, and fling the broth of
the sacrifice in the air. In some Provinces of <hi>Cathaia</hi>
the Monks wear strings about them full of nut shells, on
which they are still praying: they worship still to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the north, but keep their Church doors open
towards the south. Of these see <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> and

but they worship the Sun so long as he is with them,
and in his absence the Moon and north Star. To these
they offer yearly sacrifices of Deer, which they burn
except the head and feet; they sacrifice also for their
dead. The <hi>Samodyes</hi> which are subject to the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,</hi>
are much addicted to witchcraft and idolatry; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them each kindred have their Temple where
they sacrifice; their Priest is he that is eldest, whose
ornaments are small ribs and teeth of fishes and wilde
beasts hanging about him; with a white Garland on
his head; in his divine service he doth not sing but
howse, and that so long till he become like a mad man,
and then falls down as if he were dead, but riseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
or dereth five Deere to be sacrificed, and then
thrusts a sword half way into his belly, still singing or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97888:54"/>
howling rather; the sword he takes out again, heats it
in the fire, and then thrusts it in at the Navel, and out
at the Fundament; then he lets two men standing by
him, pull off his head and left shoulder with a small
line, by which they pull the head and shoulder into a
kettle of hot water, but he reviveth again, and cometh
out whole as he was before; with such jugling illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do they deceive the people. But of these see <hi>Richard

                     <hi>Q.</hi> How many ways can <hi>Satan</hi> delude men by such false
miracles?</p>
                  <p>A. Three wayes. 1.<note place="margin">Three wayes whereby <hi>Satan</hi> deludes men by false miracles.</note> By local motion, suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
one object from the eye, and substituting in
stead thereof another; thus are we deceived in many
supposed transformations; as when we think we see
Women transformed into Cats, or Hares, or any other
creature; the Woman is suddenly conveyed away and
the Cat put in her place; such were these transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Vlysses</hi> fellows into beasts, and of <hi>Diomedes</hi> his
company into birds. 2. By darkning the Medium or
Aire, that we cannot see the object, or by condensing
of it so, that the object appeareth bigger then it is, or by
altering of it so, that the object appeareth quite other
then it is; as we see strange things through some glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
or lastly, by working on and disturbing of the fancy,
which is no hard matter for Satan to do, being a subtile
spirit of long experience, and full of knowledge. 3.
By working on the outward sensitive organ, either by
altering situation thereof; thus by elevating or depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the eye, we see things double, and otherwise then
they are; or by disturbing the visive spirits, or by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
a mist before the eye. By such tricks the Egyptian
Sorcerers made the people beleeve they had done the
same miracles that <hi>Moses</hi> did. And so the Witch of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
deluded <hi>Saul,</hi> by presenting to him the resemblance
of <hi>Samuel;</hi> whereas it was not in the power of Satan
to disturb the soul of any just man, and to take it from
that place of rest and happinesse, where it is under the
immediate protection of the Almighty; yet many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men are of another opinion, that <hi>Samuel</hi> did truly
appear, God so permitting that <hi>Saul</hi> might be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of his wickednesse, and desertion from God, by the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97888:54"/>
same Prophet, whose counsel he had heretofore despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Now though Satan deludes oftentimes with false
miracles, yet I deny not, but that sometimes by Gods
permission he doth strange wonders; by the help of
natural causes, as he can raise storms, so he did against
<hi>Iobs</hi> Children; he can carry his Witches in the Aire,
so he did carry Christ to the pinacle of the Temple, and
thence to an high Mountain; so the Angel carried <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk;</hi>
he can also make beasts to speak, by guiding
their tongues, so the Angel made <hi>Balaams</hi> Asse to utter
certain words; but he can do no miracle, that is, he
cannot produce such effects as exceed the activity of
natural causes; so he cannot raise the dead, or give
them life again; he cannot restore sight to the blinde,
where there is a total privation, nor can he transform
men into beasts, being the body of a beast is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of an humane soul; nor can the soul of man ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
a beasts body, there being no relation betweene
the matter and form, nor is there any disposition, appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
or aptitude in that matter to receive such a form.
This is onely the work of God, who changed <hi>Lots</hi>
Wife into a Pillar of Salt, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> into a
beast. Satan hath no power over celestial bodies,
though he be Prince of the Aire; he cannot create, nor
do these things, which God hath reserved for himselfe.
Therefore when we hear of men transformed into
beasts, or raised from the dead, and such like miracles
as exceed the course and activity of nature, we may be
assured these are not true miracles, but Satanical delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
especially if they be done to confirme errour,
wickednesse and superstition; for the end of all true and
divine miracles are to establish truth and holinesse.
Therefore when we read of bringing down the Moon,
of driving the Stars backward, and such like impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities
beleeved among the Gentiles, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
they were meer delusions of Satan. Such were
those wonders adscribed to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> of making
images to walk, of turning stones into bread, of being
transformed into a Sheep, Goat, and Serpent, of raising
souls from the dead, and such like stuffe; all these
were meer jugling tricks and Satanicall decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> But why are we so afraid of Satans Stratagems, seeing
the most of them are but illusions?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This fear in us proceeds partly from the guilt of
our own conscience;<note place="margin">The fear of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans stratagems (though illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) whence it proceeds.</note> for <hi>Adams</hi> sin brought fear both
on himselfe and on his posterity; therefore after he
had fallen, he confesseth, that as soon as he heard the
voice of God in the Garden, he was afraid and so
we his children do often times fear, where no fear is,
and are afraid sometimes at our own shadows, or at the
shaking of a leafe Partly this fear proceeds from want
of faith, which Christ reproved in his Apostles; who
when they saw Jesus walking in the night time on the
Sea, they were afraid, thinking they had seen a Spirit.
Besides, the implacable hatred of Satan against man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
his delight he taketh in affrighting and hurting
us, either in our persons, or in our estates, that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable
enmity which is between the Serpent and
the Womans seed, is a great cause of this fear in us.
Lastly, we are naturally fearful in the dark, because our
imagination worketh upon it self, having no outward
object to divert it; hence Satan who is the Prince of
darknesse, useth the opportunity of the night to hurt or
to delude us; thus he affrighteth us in the dark in our
houses with strange apparitions, motions and sounds;
whence some houses have blin said to be hanted with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
So in the night he affrighteth travellers with <hi>ignis
fatuus,</hi> or jack in the candle, as we call it, which though
it be a natural <hi>Meteor,</hi> yet Satan can move it to and fro
purposely to draw travellers into precipices or waters.
So in the night time he affrighteth mariners at Sea, by
insinuating himself into these fiery <hi>Meteors,</hi> which like
candles or balls of fire, run up and down the ship; these
were deified by the old <hi>Pagans;</hi> if one single flame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
they called it <hi>Helena,</hi> and held it an ominons fign

they named them <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and placed their
statues in their ships, as we read <hi>Act.</hi> 28. And Sea men
use to tell us of many strange sights and apparitions
they have seen in the Ocean. Satan also useth to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
men in Churches and Church yards in the dark,
by representing to their phantasie the shape of dead
men in their winding sheets; in the night also strange
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97888:55"/>
voices and sounds are heard neer deep waters, or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
which are taken as presages of some shortly to be
drowned there; the like I have heard my selfe, and
have found the event to fall out accordingly; for one
day travelling before day, with some company neere
the River <hi>Don</hi> by <hi>Aberden,</hi> we heard a great noise, and
voices call to us; I was going to answer, but was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
by my company, who told me they were spirits,
which never are heard there, but before the death of
some body; which fell out too true; for the next day,
a gallant Gentleman was drowned with his horse, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to swim over. It is strange what <hi>Plutarch</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of the voice which from the shoare called upon
<hi>Thamus</hi> the Egyptian ship-Master (who then had
cast Anchor at <hi>Praxeae)</hi> telling him that the great god
<hi>Pan</hi> was dead. Though the night Mare, which is called
<hi>Incubus</hi> and <hi>Succubus,</hi> be a natural disease; as Physitians
know, yet Satan hath often times made use of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,
to abuse the bodies of men and wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hath Satan in a chain, so that without permission he
could neither afflict <hi>Iob</hi> in his person, children, nor
cattel, nor durst he enter into the herd of swine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leave from Christ. 2. Let us remember what
Christ hath promised, to wit, that he will be with us,
to the end of the world; and if he be with us, who
can be against us? Christ came to destroy the works of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97888:56"/>
the Devil; to cast out the strong man, and to tread
down Satan under our feet; he hath promised not to
leave us Orphans; <hi>he is the good Shepherd that laid down
his life for his sheep,</hi> which he holdeth so fast that no
man shall take them out of his hand; his name is <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
God with us. He was amongst his Apostles,
<hi>Luke.</hi> 24. when they were assembled together, and in
great fear; and so he will be in the midst of two or
three gathered together in his name. He is the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Israel,</hi> that neither slumbers nor sleeps; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with <hi>David</hi> let us lie down and take our rest, for
he will make us to live in safety. Though we walk
through the vally of the shadow of death, let us fear
no evil, because the Lord is with us. Let us not be
moved, because he is at our right hand; he is our buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and our exceeding great reward, therefore let us
not feare 3. Let us put on the whole Armour of God,
chiefly the shield of faith, that we may quench all the
fiery darts of the Devil, and let us fight against Satan,
as Christ did with the sword of the spirit, which is the
word of God. Let us resist the Devil and he will flee
from us. 4. We must remember that God doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
permit Satan to buffet us as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> that he
might try our patience, and obedience, that we may be
the more watchfull of our selves against that roaring
Lyon, which compasseth the earth to and fro, seeking
whom he may devour; that we may be the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in prayer, that we may adhere the closer to God,
and that we may acknowledge his fatherly care and
goodnesse, who will not suffer us to be tempted above
measure, comforting our selves in this, that his grace is
sufficient for us. 5. We must remember that God hath
given his Angels charge over us, to hold us up in their
hands, least we dash our foot against a stone. Christ
was no sooner tempted by Satan, but the Angels came
and ministred to him. When <hi>Iacob</hi> was persecuted by
his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> God sent a multitude of Angels to
guard him. The Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> was encompassed with
fiery Chariots, or Angels in that shape, from the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Souldiers. Let us not then fear, so long as we know
that the Angels of God are round about those that fear
him, and delivereth them; and that the same Angels
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97888:56"/>
will be ready at our death to convey our souls as they
did <hi>Lazarus,</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome. 6. Let us support
our selves against Satan, by the assurance of Christs
death, and the remission of our sins; <hi>for blessed is the
man whose sins are forgiven him;</hi> therefore let us not be
afraid, for <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are
in Christ Iesus. It is God that justifieth, who can
condemn?</hi> if Satan objects against us, that sin hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,
let us answer him in the Apostles words,
<hi>grace hath much more abounded.</hi> 7. Let us as our Saviour
counselleth us, <hi>watch and pray continually;</hi> our spirituall
enemies are many, vigilant, malicious and powerful;
nothing will give them advantage over us, but security
and neglect of prayer; vigilancy and prayer are Armour
of proofe against all tentations; with these Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
armed himself when he was buffeted by the Angel of
Satan; therefore saith Saint <hi>Hierom, When thou walkest
abroad, let prayers arm thee; when thou returnest home, let
prayers meet thee: Egredientes domo armet oratio, regredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entibus
de platea occurrat oratio.</hi> Lastly, let us take
heed we do not countenance or approve, or have any
commerce with <hi>Necromancers,</hi> or such as take upon them
to raise Spirits; for God often times punisheth such
vain curiosity; let us beware of too much retirednesse;
for Satan is most ready to tempt us when we are alone;
so he tempted <hi>Eve</hi> when she was alone in the Garden,
and assaulted Christ when he was alone in the Desart.
Let us take heed also of too much sadnesse and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;
for though this be a natural infirmitie, yet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
by it takes occasion to work mischief; as we see in
<hi>Saul,</hi> who is said to have an evil spirit, when he was
in his melancholy fit; and we know that in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
mad men, Phreneticks, and Lunaticks are called
Demoniacks, because the Devil took occasion by their
madnesse to advance his kingdom of darknesse. And
let us chiefly endeavour to have a good conscience
which is a continual feast, to live a holy life, and to be
just in all our wayes, and so we shall not need to feare
Satans Stratagems or illusions; <hi>for the righteous man is

is full of Temples and Monasteries, replenished
with multitudes of Idols, which their cunning Priests
feed with the smoak of meats, but they eat the meat
themselves. The Priests here have so much power over
their gods, that they may beate and whip them when
they do not answer their expectation. They have one
Idol with three heads, which they much reverence.
These represent their three great Philosophers, <hi>Confusius,
Xequiam,</hi> aud <hi>Tanzu.</hi> Their chiefe gods are the Sun,
Moon, and Stars. They worship also the devil, not out
of love, but feare, that he may do them no hurt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they place his picture in the fore Castle of their
ships. They are Pythagoreans in the opinion of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahimation;
therefore some of them will not kill any
living thing. For this cause at <hi>Quinsay</hi> in a walled
Parke belonging to a Monastery, the Monks feed 4000
living creatures of divers kinds, out of their charity to
the souls of Noble men, which were entred into the
bodies of these creatures. Their Monks are shaven,
are bound to weare beads, to be present at burials, to
maintain Celibate whilst they are Monks, to pray two
hours together before day. Of these religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
there be four sorts, distinguished by their colours,
black, white, yellow, and russet. These have their
Priors, Provincials, and Generall; he is carryed on
mens shoulders in an Ivory Chaite, and is cloathed in
silke. Their maintainance is not onely the Kings
allowance, but also the benevolence of devout peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which they procure by begging and praying for
them. They have their Nuns also, and Hermits, and
consecrated Hills, to which the people make divers
Pilgrimages. There are many Colledges for learning,
which is of high esteem among them. Their Secular
Priests weare long hair and black cloath, their Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares
are shaven, but neither must marry. They are
bound to observe all Feastivall days, such as the New
and Full Moons, the Kings birth-day, but chiefly New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years

have abundance of Hospitals for the poor, and no beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to be seen among them. But for any knowledge
of heavenly joyes, or hell torments, they have very
little or none at all. They are very much afraid when
there is any Eclipse of the Sun or Moon, which they
hold to be man and wife; for then they think that these
two gods are angry with them. Of their many super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious

which he worshippeth: hence some are buried, some
burned, some hanged in the Ayr, and some drowned
in the Water. They hold that God made all things,

that the good are rewarded, and the wicked punished.
That each man hath two spirits waiting on him, a good
and a bad. That the world shall stand 8000 yeers, and
then shall be burned into ashes, whence shall come
forth two eggs, and out of them one man, and one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who shall again replenish the Earth. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Orders are so strict, that it's death among them
to speak to a woman. They feed on Rice onely, and
herbs which they beg from door to door. They must
not buy nor sell, nor take Rents. They are tyed to rise
at midnight to pray to their Idols. They go still bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed,
and in poor cloaths. Every King of this Country
at his Coronation is bound to erect a Temple, with
high Steeples and multitudes of Idols. Their priests go
in yellow, being a sacred colour, resembling the Suns
light. They may not nourish any female thing, not so
much as a hen. He that drinks Wine, is stoned to death.

but also in regard of its inorganical operations, to wit, of
Understanding and Will: they found that the more
the body decayed and grew weak, the more vigorous,
active, and strong was the soul; that it lost nothing of
its operations by the losse or decay of the outward
senses, that it could comprehened all the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it self, that it could move it self in an instant, from
one end of the world to the other; that it can make
things past many years agoe, as if they were present;
that it can conceive spiritual Essences, and Universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
all which do prove how far the soul exceedeth
the body and bodily senses, which can reach no farther
then to sensible qualities, singularities or individuals, to
things present only, to bodies only. Besides, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that the soul could not dye, or perish, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and putrifie as bodies do, because it is immaterial,
simple, without composition of different substances,
and free from contrary and destructive qualities, which
are the causes of death, corruption and putrefaction in
bodies. Again, every body is quantitative, sensible,
and may be measured, and filled; but the soul hath no
quantitie, nor is it sensible but by its effects, nor can it
be measured, nor can the whole world fill it, nor doth
it increase or decrease as bodies do; nor can it receive
hurt or detriment, from any outward thing; and

the more sublime or eminent the object is, the more is
the soul corroborated in sits understanding; neither is
the soul subject to time and motion, as bodies, are; for
it makes all times present, and is not capable of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
corruption, alteration, &amp;c. moreover, there is in
the soul even of <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself, a desire of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

natural, and consequently necessary; and wee

with horrible Idolatry. Here is an Idol, to which
Pilgrimes resort, either with their hands bound, or
ropes abovt their necks, or knives sticking in their
armes and legs, which limbs, if they fester, they are
accounted holy. Gold, Silver, and Jewels are given
by these Pilgrims, to maintain this Idol and his Temple.
All these gifts are cast into a Lake, and kept there, for

the uses aforesaid. This Idol is carried yearly in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
with Virgins and Musick going before. Under
the Idols Chariot Pilgrims strive to be crushed to
death, whose bodies are burned, and the ashes kept

and stab themselves with knives, to the honour of this
Idol, and cast into its face the pieces of their cut flesh.
Women also do prostitute themselves to procure
money for the Idols mainteinance. He thinks himself
blessed that can but touch the Idols Chariot; whereas
in other parts of the Indies the Wives burn themselves
alive with their Husbands bodies, or else they are sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

with their deadhusbands. In some places, when men
make Vows to their Idols, they pay them, by suffering
the Priests with sharp hooks fastened to the cross-yard
of a Mast, to lift them up by both shoulders, till the
blood run down on the Mast; then he is let down, and
lifted up again by the middle to give thanks to his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
for accepting his sacrifice. The Chief Priest of
those parts dispenseth with Marriages at his pleasure;
and when he gives licence to the Woman to marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
he feales it with a hot iron on her shoulder. They
have divers feastivals, some to their Kine, some to the
Sun, and to other of their gods. When the Sun &amp;
Moon are eclipsed, they say it is because they are bit by
that celestial signe called the Dragon. See <hi>Vertomannus,

others in Chariots. They beleeve there are divers,
Paradises, to which every peculiar god carrieth his own

people are so in love, that many use to drown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
others to cut their own throats, or to break
their necks by casting themselves down from high
towers, to this they are encouraged by their cunning
and coverous Priests, who out of this suck no small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
Some in narrow holes receive breath onely
by a Cane, and so continue fasting and praying till they
die. The Priests strangely extort confession from the
people, by putting some of them in scaleshanging from
high Rocks: from whence they being cast down by
their <hi>Gogins,</hi> which they say are men disguised like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
are broken all to pieces. They have a Feast in

                        <hi>Philippinae,</hi> their religions.</note> Mahumetans, and Pagans
in those Islands, who worship the Sun, Moon, and Stars,
which they hold to be the children of the Sun and
Moon. Their Priests are for the most part women,
who are Sorcerers and Prophetesses. They worship
also the Devil in ugly shapes, and so they do that thing
which they meet with first in the morning, except it be
a Lizard, or other kinde of worme; for the sight of
these is held so unlucky, that it makes them leave off all
businesse, and return home. They use to deck their
Idols with Ostrich feathers. At the sacrificing of a
hog they sound Cymbals, two old women, with Pipes
of reede reverence the Sun, and in their sacred gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with hair-laces and horns on the head of the
Elder, dance about the hog, muttering certain words
to the Sun. Then a cup of Wine is poured on the

with a woman. In <hi>Zeilan</hi> or <hi>Ceylon,</hi> the blinded people
undertake Pilgrimages of a thousand leagues, eighteen
miles whereof they wade up to the middle in dirty
stinking water, full of Blood-Leeches, and seven
leagues they clamber up a steep Mountain, by the help
of nayls and thorns tied thereto, there being no other
passage. And all this toyl is to visit a stone on the top
of this hill, having in it the print of a mans foot, who
they say came thither first to instruct them in Religion.
Neer the stone is a springing water, in which they
wash, then pray, and with sharp pointed instruments
cut their flesh, and draw blood, thinking thereby that
God is pleased, and that all their sins are pardoned.
In this water the poor are permitted sometimes by the
King to gather precious stones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof there is store,
to pray for his soul. There are in this Island many
Temples, Priests, and Idols, Monasteries also of yellow
Monks shaven, and still praying on Beads, who have
their Processions in great solemnity, with dancing
and musick, the Abbot riding upon an Elephant in
rich attire, carrying a golden rod in his hand, lifted
over his head; they pray here to the devil when they
are sick, and to the Image of the Elephants head for
wisdom. They have a huge Statue bearing a sword in
its hand; they think the world shall not end so long as
this Image is in safety. See <hi>Massaeus, Vertimannus,

the Elements in the composition of bodies, ascribed

the names of <hi>Apolio</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> the four Elements by
the names of <hi>Vulcan, Iuno, Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Ceres.</hi> The five
lesser Planets by the names of <hi>Saturn, Iupiter, Mars,
Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi> At length they multiplyed their
gods so fast, that every Beast, Spring, River, Tree,
Trade or Profession in the world, Disease in the body,
Faculty and Passion in the Mind, had its peculiar Deity.
And so mad they were upon idolatry, that of a mans
Yard they made a god, under the name of <hi>Phallus</hi> and
<hi>Priapus,</hi> in memory of <hi>Osiris</hi> his Privities, which after
much toyl were found by <hi>Isis</hi> in <hi>Nilus,</hi> being drowned

Their Priests were shaved, and clothed in pure Linnen,
abstained from fish, Wine, and Onyons. Their Kings
after election were chosen into the society of Priests.
They held two beginnings: they consecrated red Bulls,
flung the heads of their Sacrifices into <hi>Nilus,</hi> and abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from salt. See <hi>Arnobius, Eusebius, Plutarch, Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>

Beasts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They were fed by their Priests in their Temples
with choice food: when any dyeth, it is wrapped in
clean Linin and embalmed, and buried in a consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
place, with much lamentation. All shave themselves
in that house where a Dog dieth. Their god <hi>Apis</hi> being
dead and lamented, another was found by the Priests,
and brought to <hi>Memphis,</hi> where he was placed in <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
Temple, and seven days kept holy for him. By
their Law he must live but a prefixed time; then he is
drowned in a sacred spring, and buried with much
lamentation. All beasts are not worshipped in all parts,
of <hi>Eygpt,</hi> but in some places the Crocodile, in other
places the Goat, in some Satyrs, in others <hi>Cynocephalus,</hi>
or <hi>Anubis,</hi> with his Dogs-head. The Serpent was a

Cat, the Hawk, and <hi>Ibis,</hi> and two fishes peculiar to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
to wit, <hi>Opyrinchus</hi> and <hi>Lepidotus.</hi> They worshipped
the <hi>Hippopotamus,</hi> Frogs, Beetles, and other vermifie.
Their Priests were bound to offer a Cock to the Sun,
a Dove to <hi>Venus,</hi> a Peacock to <hi>Iuno,</hi> &amp;c. And bloody
<hi>Busiris</hi> sacrificed men to <hi>Nilus. Quis illaudati nescit Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridis
aras?</hi> The Egyptians hate Swine so much, that if
by chance one should touch them, he instantly washeth
his cloathes: and Sow-heards are forbid their Temples.
They circumcise male and female, and offer wine to the
full Moon. The Priests wash themselves thrice in the
day time, and twice in the night. They must not eat
milk, eggs, or oyl, except with Salads. Their Priests
were Judges, their Gymnosophists were Philosophers,
who had their Colledge in a Grove neer the banks of
<hi>Nilus:</hi> The Egyptians observed divers feasts to <hi>Isis, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,
Latona, Mars, Minerva, Mercury, Bacchus, Osiris</hi> and
his Nurse. In these feasts was much disorder and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
some beating of themselves, some cutting their fore
heads with knivs; some dancing, some singing, some drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
some quarrelling. In the feast of <hi>Bacchus</hi> they were
all drunk. In that of <hi>Mars</hi> all mad, knocking down one
another with clubs. In the feast of <hi>Isis</hi> they shewed their
folly in tumbling an Ass down from a Precipice. In that
of <hi>Minerva,</hi> in burning lights with oyl and salt. But of
these, and other ridiculous, or rather impious Rites, see

                     <hi>A.</hi> Here at this day Christians have their Churches,
Jews their Synagogues, and Mahumetans their Mosques:
of these last there be four sorts differing in their Laws,
Liturgies and Ceremonies. There is a Sect in <hi>Chairo</hi>
which liveth altogether on horse flesh. And another
who go naked, giving themselves to fleshly lusts openly.
The Christians there are Eutychians, and are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
but it is thought that they have forsaken circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
by the perswasion of the Popes Legates at a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
held at <hi>Cairo, Anno.</hi> 1583. These are called <hi>Cophti,</hi>
not from their Profession, but from their Nation: for in
the Thalmud <hi>Egypt</hi> is called <hi>Gophti,</hi> and the Egyptians in
old time, <hi>Aegophtia.</hi> They are not rigid Eutychians, which
were condemned in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> for affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
one Nature, and one Will in Christ: but they are
modern Eutychians, called <hi>Iacobites,</hi> from <hi>Iacobus</hi> the
Syrian, who held that Christ was true God, and true
man; yet he and his Scholars will not in direct termes
affirm there are two natures, lest they should fall into
the error of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> of the two Persons. These fast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Wednesday and Friday, and have four Lents in
the year. They make Infants Deacons, and baptise them
not afore the fourtieth day, and then give them the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist.
They leave out the words in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed,
<hi>From the Son.</hi> They condemne the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
and admit no general Council since that of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
They read publickly the Gospel of <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> They
receive the Eucharist in both kinds, and in leavened
bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To the sick they neither administer the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
nor Extream Unction. They deny Purgatory
and Prayer for the dead. They Marry in the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of consanguinity. And in their Church government
are subject to the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> There are not
above three Christian Churches at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and so
many at <hi>Cairo;</hi> about fifty thousand Christians in all.

let them burn till Sun-rising, all this while singing
<hi>Mahumets</hi> praise. Candles are presented to the King
that day, of incredible heigth and bignesse, who that
night heareth all the Law read. By Mahuments Law
Soothsayers are inprisoned, and yet here are many of
that profession. There are here divers Sects of Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
some like our Anabaptists, condeming all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and trusting to Enthusiasmes; others who think
by their fasting and good works, that they are so holy
and perfect, that they cannot sin. There be some who
hold all Religions to be true, because every one takes
that to be God which he worships, and they teach that
the Heaven with the Planets, Stars, and Elements are
one God. They have also their Hermits. By their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
Women may not enter their Mosques, because
of their often pollutions, and for that Eve first sinned.
The day after a child is born, the Priest is sent for to
pray. The child is washed by the women, who name
it, and then it is circumcised; but somtimes the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
is put off for divers yeers. They are very strict
in their fastings, not tasting any thing, though they

him evill; and black, and the Author of their miseries:
And that they are no wayes beholding to him for what
they enjoy, but to their own industry. They put with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Rings Wheat, Water, and Oyle, for their god
to feed upon. Such Rings are worn by many as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatives
against danger. Their Priests use to preach
to them on festival dayes, and after Sermon to besprinkle
the infants with Water, in which a Newt doth swim.
They consecrate to their Idol the first bit and draught
of their meat and drink. But I believe, this black god
they rail against, is the devill, whom their cunning
Priests represent to that ignorant people in some black
and ugly shape; Sometimes of a black dog. If they
paint themselves with Chalke, they think they do good
service to their God. When he is angry with them,
they use to bribe the Priest with gold; so fishermen use
to do, when they have no successe at sea. The Priest
with his wives walks in Procession, knocking his breast
and clapping his hands, then hanging some boughs
from the trees on their necks, and playing on a Timbrel,
the Priest flings Wheat into the sea, to appease the
angry God. They have certain trees in great venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
consulting with them, as with Oracles, using di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
foolish ceremonies. They worship a certain bird,
which hath feathers like stars, and a voice like a Bull.
The Tunie is a sacred fish with them, and not to be
touched. So are the mountains, whose tops they
daily feed, or the Priests rather, with meat and drink.
When one dieth, the Priest makes gods of straw to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the dead in the other world, wine and good
cheere are sent with him, and servants, with his wives;
if he be the King, these are slain to wait upon the King,
and their heads advanced upon Poles round about the
grave. They hold it a sin to spit on the ground. The
Tuesday is their Sabbath. They use circumcision and
some other Turkish ceremonies. See <hi>G. Arthus Dantis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eanus,

circumcise both male and female on the eighth day,
in memory of Christs circumcision. The males are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
fourty days after, and the females eighty. They
abstain from certain meats, and use some Mosaical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.
They are very rigid in their Fastings, they
begin their Lent ten days before ours, some Fryers eat
no bread all the Lent, some not in a whole year; but
are contented with Herbs, without Salt or Oyl: They
keep a fast of three days after <hi>Candlemasse,</hi> in memory of
<hi>Ninevehs</hi> repentance. Some Fryers all that time eat
nothing, and some Nurses give their Children suck but
once a day. He that marrieth three wives is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.
Queen <hi>Candace</hi> after her conversion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
the two magnificent Temples of the Sun, and
Moon, to the Holy Ghost and the Crosse. Afterward
these two Temples were given to the Monkish Knights
of Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> Order, with two large Monasteries.
The <hi>Abyssins</hi> in their Liturgy mention the three first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils, but not that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> because they
are Eutychians, or Jacobltes. Their Patriarch is onely

They believe traduction of Soules. They are careful to
confesse their sins to the Priest, and still after confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
receive the Eucharist. The Patriarch onely excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates,
and none but murtherers usually. Inferiour
Priests and Monks labour for their maintenance, but
the Bishops, Deanes, and Prebends, have large reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
and benefices. They permit their Clergy to marry
once, and have pictures in their Churches, but not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Betwixt Easter and Whitsuntide, they eat flesh

the Devil, before the French came thither, and in
most places there as yet, they worship him; who when
he is offended with them, flings dust in their eyes. The
men marry two or three wives, who after the death of
their husbands never marry againe, but go still after
in black, and besmear their faces with coal dust and
grease; they do first expose their daughters to any that
will lie with them, and then give them in marriage.
They believe that after death their soules ascend into
the Stars, and go down with them under the Horizon
into a Paradise of pleasure. They believe also that god
stuck a multitude of arrows in the beginning into the
ground, and of these sprung up men and women. They

have divers ridiculous opinions of God, as that he once
drank much Tobacco, and then gave the pipe to their
Governour, with a command that he should keep it
carefully, and in so doing he should want nothing; but
he lost the Pipe, and so fell into want and misery. Such
senselesse conceits have these people, who as they are
savage in their carriage, so in their understandings they
are little better then beasts. They use to sing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
praises, to dance about fires, which they make to
his honour, and leap over them. They bemoan the
dead a great while, and bring presents to the grave.

                  <p>A. Before the English planted Christianity there, they
worshipped the Devil,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Virginia,</hi> its Religion.</note> and many idols, as yet they doe
in many places there. They beleeve many Gods, but
one principally who made the rest; and that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were made of water, and the Woman before the
Man, who by the help of one of the gods, conceived
and bore children. They are all Anthropomorphites,
giving to their gods the forms of men, whom they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with praying, singing, and offerings. They hold
the soules immortality, rewards and punishments after
this life, the one in heaven, the other in a burning pit
toward the west. The Priests are distinguished from
other people by garments of skins, and their hair cut
like a comb on their crowns. They carry their gods
about with them, and ask counsel of them. Much of
their devotion consisteth in howling and dancing about
fires, with rattles of Gourd or Pompian rindes in their
hands, beating the ground with stones, and offering of
Tobacco, Deer suet, and blood on their stone Altars.
They undertake no matters of consequence without
advice of their Priests, the chief whereof is adorned
with Feathers and Weasels tails, and his face painted
as ugly as the devils. They bury their Kings (after their
bodies ate burned and dryed) in white skins, within
arches of mats with their wealth at their feet, and
by the body is placed the devils Image. The Women
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97888:69"/>
expresse their sorrow with black paint and yellings for
twenty four hours. None but the King and Priest
may enter these houses, where the Images of Devils
and their Kings are kept. Instead of saying Grace at
meat, they fling the first bit into the fire; and when they
will appease a storm, they cast Tobacco into the water.
Sometimes they sacrifice children to the devil. But

which they honour with dances and songs. Once a
yeere they offer to the Sun a Harts hid stuffed with
herbs, hanging Garlands of fruits about his horns, so
presenting this gift towards the east, they pray the Sun
to make their land produce the same fruits again. But
to their Kings, they use to Sacrifice their first-born
males. Much of their devotion like the rest of barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Salvages consisteth in singing, dancing, howling,
feasting, and cutting of their own skins. Adultery in
the woman is punished with whipping. In some parts
of this Country the next of kin is permitted to cut the
adulteresses throat, and the woman to cut the adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
In some parts also of this Country they worship
the devil; who when he appears and complains of
thirst, humane blood is shed to quench his thirst. When
a King is buried, the cup wherein he used to drink, is
still set upon his grave, and round about the same are
stuck many arrows; the people weep and Fast three
days together, the neighbour Kings his friends cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

half their hair. Women are hired, who for six moneths
howl for him three times a day. This honour the King
and Priest have, that they are buried in their houses,
and burned with their houses and goods. See <hi>Benzo,

Sun, and Water: because the Sun by his heat, and the

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97888:69"/>
when they eat; drink, or Sacrifice, they use to throw
up in the ayre towards the Sun, some part of their food.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> took advantage of this Superstition,
and made these people believe they were messengers
sent thither to them from the Sun; whereupon they
submitted, holding it impious to reject the Messengers,
which their chief God had sent them. They worship
also here Idols, and in some places the devil, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the same superstitious Ceremonies in the burial
of their dead, that their neighbours do. See <hi>Hackluit.</hi>

who requires of his Disciples no other Sacrifice but
that of a contrite heart; he having shed his own blood,
that we might spare the shedding of ours. These
wretched <hi>Americans</hi> acknowledged one chief God, yet
they worshipped many: Principally the Sun, to whom
they offered the heart of the Sacrifice; even of men: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did they eat or drink, or smell to a flower, till
they had cast up in the ayre to the Sun some portion
of their meat and drink, and some leaves of their
flowers. At <hi>Mexico</hi> they worshipped many Idols, but
three principally: The first was called <hi>Vitziliputzli,</hi>
placed in an azure-coloured Chair, with Snakes-heads
at each corner. On his head were rich plumes of
Feathers with gold; in his left hand was a white
Target, in his right a Staffe; at his sides he had four
darts. Perhaps by this Image they represented the
nature of God; by his blew Chair they might signifie
heaven his seat, by the Snakes-heads, his wisdome; by
the feathers and gold, his glory; by the Target, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
by the Staffe, direction; and by the four arrows,
his power, extending over the four parts of the world:
East, West, South, and North; or else, which is more
likely, they represented the Sun by this Idol, whose
aboad is in the azure skie, and his arrows or beams are
extended to the 4. quarters of the world: the feathers
may signifie his lightness; and the gold, his glory; his
target and staff may shew that the Suns heat is both
defensive and offensive. Near to this Idol stood a

Moon. They had a third Idol, of black stone, with
four darts in his right hand, looking angerly; this they
worshipped as the god of Repentance; this Idol, with
the others, was richly adorned with gold any jewels.
In <hi>Cholula</hi> they worshipped the god of wealth or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandising;
they had also an Idol of Paste, or Dough,
which was consecrated and made every year, to which
rich presents were brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and stuck in the paste.
They made gods also of their chief Captives, to whom
they gave divine Honors, for 6. somtimes for 12 months,
praying and sacrificing to him, and carrying him in
procession; but at last the Priests kill him; the Chief
Priest pulls out his heart, offers it smoaking to the Sun;
then is he opened, cut in pieces, and eaten. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored

without cause then did God forbid the Israelits to

dedicated to their Idols. Against all such vanities
<hi>Arnobius</hi> in his Book against the Gentiles disputeth
elegantly, shewing that God is not taken with such
toyes as Temples, Altars, and sacrifices; but <hi>cultus

whose habit was a Crown of rich Feathers on his head,
Pendants of Gold, with green stones at his ears, and
under his Lip an Azure stone; his office was to receive
the body of the dead King at the Temple door, with a
mournful song, to open the breast of the sacrificed
man, to pull out his heart, to offer it to the Sun, and
then to sting it to the idol, to which the man was sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed.
The inferiour Priests in the interim holding
the legs, arms, and head of the Sacrificed wretch, whilst
his heart was taking out. They used also to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

skins of men, and cloath some therewith, who went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

to burn incense before their idols every morning, noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,
evening, and at midnight, for then with Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
and Cornets they sounded a long time, which
done, they burned the Incense in Censers with much
reverence, and then they beat themselves and draw
blood with sharp bodkins. They did preach also on
some festival days to the people. The revenues of the
Priests were great; the Temples in state, magnificence,
and wealth, exceeded ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and wore their hair long, for they never cut
it. They did sometimes annoint themselves with an
Unguent made of venemous beasts, which made them
without fear, and armed them with cruelty. They
painted their skins black. They washed the new born
Children, and let them blood in their ears; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
marriages by asking the parties mutual consent,
and tying together a corner of the womans vaile, with
a corner of the mans gown, and so brought them to
the Bridegrooms house, causing the Bride to goe seven
times about the hearth. They buried the dead either
in their Gardens, or on Mountains; sometimes they
burned the body; and if he was a great man; they killed
his Chaplain, and his Officers to attend him, burying
also wealth with him, that he might not want in the
other world. The Priest used to attire himself in these
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97888:71"/>
great Funerals, like a Devil with many mouths, and
glasse eyes, and with his staff stirred and mingled the
ashes. When the King died, the Priests were to sing
his Elogies, and to sacrifice two hundred persons to serve
him. Adultery was punished with death, and so was
dishonesty in their Nuns and Monks, of which there
were two great Cloysters at <hi>Mexico.</hi> But who will see

by reason of thick foggs and mists arising out of the

days; but these vapours being spent, and the earth dry,
the Moon was first seen, and then in some few hours
afterward, the Sun. The tradition which they have of

happened about six hundred years after <hi>Noahs</hi> flood,
and which drowned only the country about <hi>Athens</hi> and

then, that their tradition was grounded on <hi>Noahs</hi>

This description is directly of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, not of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calions;</hi>
besides <hi>Mela, Solinus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> write that <hi>Ioppe</hi>
the maritime town of <hi>Syria</hi> was of great antiquity, as
being built before the flood; which cannot be meant
of <hi>Ogyges</hi> or <hi>Deucalions</hi> flood, which were onely in some
places of <hi>Greece,</hi> and went not so far as <hi>Syria;</hi> neither
was it any great antiquity, for <hi>Ioppe</hi> to be built

At the first appearance of green corn, children were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97888:72"/>
so when the corn was a foot above the ground,
and again when it was two foot high, holy days were
kept, &amp; children butchered. In some of their feasts they
sacrificed a woman, and with her skin covered a man,
who danced about the streers two days together. In

upon the Lake, a boy and a girle were drowned to
keep company with the gods of the Lake. In <hi>May</hi> they
kept the feast of <hi>Vitziliputzli,</hi> in which his Image made
of paste, richly adorned, was carried by the maidens
attired in white, on their shoulders to the court, and
thence by the young men to the stairs of the Temple,
and thence to the top with Musick, much adoration,
vain ceremonies, and wicked sacrificing of men were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that day. In <hi>May</hi> also was kept the Feast of Pennance
and Pardon, in which a captive was sacrificed. After
much profane adoration, the people took up earth and
eat it, desiring pardon for their sins, and bringing rich
presents to their Idol, and whipping themselves on the
shoulders. Much meat is presented that day to the
Idols, and then to the Priests, who five days before had
eat but one meal a day. The Merchants had their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
god, and festival day, in which they sacrificed a
man, after they had given him for nine days divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
His heart they offered about midnight to the
Moon, perhaps because she is mistresse of the waters, on
which Merchants use to traffick; or because they are
more beholding to her light in the night then others
are. Concerning these festivals, their Schools and
Seminaries, their belief of the Souls immortality, of
their rewards and punishments, of their nine severall
places appointed for them, See <hi>Acosta, Gomara,</hi> and <hi>P.

Idolaters, but curious work-men in carving and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Images. They had in their houses Images
made like Beares, which they worshipped as their hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
gods, with singing, and Incense. In hollow
Images, they caused boyes to answer the peoples pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
as if God had spoke to them. When they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97888:73"/>
wanted rain, or were in any danger, they had their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
and Pilgrimages to these Idols. In <hi>Nicuragua,</hi>
they worshipped the Sun, and divers Idols. All their
Priests except Confessors, married. The ordering of
the Sacrifices and their numbers, depended meerly on
the Priests, who used to go about the captives three
times singing mornfully, and then with their flint
knives suddenly open their Breasts. They divide the
body thus; the Prelate hath his Heart, the King his
hands and feet, the taker his Buttocks, and the people
the rest. The heads are set on trees, under which
they Sacrifice men and children. They have their
Idolatrous Processions, in which for the honour of
their Idol, they wound themselves, and for the desire
of future happinesse, they offer themselves chearfully
for Sacrifices. Whilst the Priest annoints the cheeks
and the mouth of the Idol with blood, the others sing,
and the people pray. The Priest makes marriges, by
joyning the little fingers of the Bridegroome and Bride
neer a fire; but the Lords are permitted for honours

beaten, and the Adulteresse is divorced. He that

divers Idols, and the devill in divers shapes; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Souls immortality. Their Priests are their
Physitians, and therefore in great esteem, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rich, for they have all the goods of him whom they
cure. When they go to wars, they carry their gods
with them, of whom they ask Counsel of all affairs;
and then they keep Lent for two moneths. They
punish in some places theft and murther with the losse
of Eares and Nose; in other parts, with death. These
faults in the Nobility are punished with the losse of
their hair onely. In some places they hold it a part of
their devotion, to offer their daughters to be defloured
by their Priests. When it thunders and lightens, they
say the Sun is angry with them. When there is an
Eclipse, they Fast, the married Women scratch their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97888:73"/>
Faces, and pluck their hairs; the Maidens draw blood
with sharp fish bones. When the Moon is Eclipsed,
they say the Sun is angry with her. When a Comet is
seen, they beat drums and hollo, thinking by this to
drive it away. They use to consult with and invocate
the Devil. The Priests learn Physick and Magick when
they are young, being two yeers shut up in Woods; all
that time they keep their Cells, see no women, nor eat
flesh. They are taught by their Masters in the night.
The dead are buried either at home, or being dried at
the fire are hanged up. The bones at last are burned;
and the Skull presented to the Wife to be kept by her
as a relique. In their <hi>Lent</hi> fasts they abstain from
Women and Salt. See <hi>P.</hi> Martyr, <hi>Gomara, Linschoten,

then eat them. When their gods are angry, they
macerate themselves with fasting. Their Priests are
stoned or burned, if they marry against their vow of
Chastity. They believe rewards and punishments
after this life. The spot in the Moon they hold to be
a man imprisoned there for Incest with his Sister. They
feed yearly the departed souls with <hi>Maiz</hi> and Wine.
They held the souls of great men onely, and such as
were buried with them, immortal. Their great mens

and believe that there are rewards and punishments
after this life. For they hope that if they kill and
sacrifice many of their enemies, they shall be carried
beyond the Mountains into pleasant Gardens, there to
dance and rejoyce with their fore-fathers. They
stand in much fear of the Devil, who is still vexing of

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97888:74"/>
they go abroad, they commonly carry fire with them,
as their defence against the Devil, who they think is
afraid of fire. They have their solemn Festivals, which
they celebrate with dancing, howling, and tatling. The
Husband hath power to kill the adulterous Wife.
Their marriages are without any ceremonies. They
bury their dead upright in a pit with their goods. The
Husband playes the Midwife to the woman, washeth,
painteth, and nameth the child by the name of some
wild Beast; they have some knowledge of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood:
of these passages see <hi>Masscus, Lerius, Stadius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

understood the maker of all things; next to him they
worshipped the Sun, and the Thunder after him: The
images of these three they never touched with their
bare hands; they worshipped also the Stars, Earth,
Sea, Rainbow, Rivers, Fountains, and Trees. They
adored also wild Beasts, that they might not hurt them,
and in sign of their devotion, when they travelled they
left in the cross ways, and dangerous places, old shoes,
feathers, and if they had nothing else, stones. They
worshipped the Sun by pulling off the hairs from their
Eye-brows; when they fear, they touch the earth,
and look up to the Sun. They worshipped also the
dead bodies of their Emperors, and indeed every thing
they either affected or feared. They have some glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
knowledge of the beginning of the world, of <hi>Noahs</hi>
flood, and they believe the end of the world, which
still they fear when the Sun is Eclipsed, which they
think to be the Moons Husband; they held their Priests
in such esteem, that no great matter was undertaken by
Prince or people without their advice. None had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to the Idols but they, and then only when they
are cloathed in white, and prostrate on the ground. In
sacrificing they abstained from women, and some out
of zeal would put out their own eyes. They used to
consult with the Devil, to whom they sacrificed men,
and dedicated boyes in their Temples for <hi>Sodomy.</hi> They
had also their Temples richly adorned with Gold and
Silver, and their Monasteries for Priests and Sorcerers.
Their Nuns were so strictly kept, that it was death to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97888:74"/>
be deflowred; after fourteen years of age they were
taken out of the Monastery, either to serve the Idols,
and such must be Virgins still, or else to serve as Wives
and Concubines to the <hi>Ingua</hi> or Emperor. They are
very frequent and strict in their confessions, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
undertake what pennance is injoyned them. But
the <hi>Ingua</hi> confesseth onely to the Sun; after confession
they all wash in baths, leaving their sins in the water.
They used to sacrifice Vegetables, Animals, and men,
chiefly Children, for the health or prosperity of their
<hi>Ingua,</hi> and for victory in War; in some places they eat
their men-sacrifices, in others they onely dried and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
them in Silver Coffins; they anoint with blood
the faces of their Idols and doors of their Temples or
rather slaughter houses. See <hi>Acosta, Cieza, Gomara</hi> &amp;c.</p>

different colours, which they burned. The <hi>Ingua's</hi>
Children were dedicated in these Feasts, their ears
were pierced, then they were wiped, and their faces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
with blood, in sign that they should be true
Knights to their <hi>Ingua.</hi> In <hi>Cusco</hi> during this moneth and
feast, no stranger might remain; but at the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they were admitted, and had a morsell of bread
presented to each man, that they should by eating
thereof testifie their fidelity to the <hi>Ingua.</hi> In the
second moneth which is our <hi>Ianuary</hi> (for in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
in which the Sunne returnes from <hi>Capricorne</hi>
was their first moneth) they flung the ashes of
their sacrifices into the river, following the same
sixe leagues, and praying the River to carry that
present to <hi>Viracocha;</hi> in three following months
they offered one hundred sheep. In the sixth they
offered one hundred sheep more, and made a feast
for their <hi>Maiz.</hi> In the seventh they sacrificed to the
Sun. In the eighth and ninth moneths, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
sheep were offered. In the tenth, one hundred
sheep more, and to the honour of the Moon burned
torches, washed themselves, and then were drunk four
days together. In the eleventh moneth they offered
one hundred sheep, and upon a black sheep poured
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97888:75"/>
much Chica or Wine of <hi>Maiz,</hi> to procure rain. In the
twelfth moneth they sacrificed one hundred sheep and
kept a feast. They have also their fasts which continue
in mourning and sad processions two days, and the
two days after are spent in feasting, dancing, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.

thirst, and cold; therefore they carry them meat,
drink and cloathes. They used also to put gold, and
silver in their mouths, hands, and bosomes; much
treasure hath been digged out of graves. But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that the souls of good men were at rest in glory.
The bodies were honoured after death, sacrifices were
offered to them, and cloaths. The best beloved Wife
was slain and attendants of all sorts. To the <hi>Ingua</hi>'s
Ghost young children were sacrificed, and if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was sick, many times the Son was slain, thinking
this murther would satisfie death for the Father. Of

tyrant superstitious fear is, and what wretched slaves
they are, who are captivated by this tyrant, far more
savage then <hi>Mezentius, Phalaris, Busyris,</hi> or any other
tyrannical butcher that ever was; for there is no ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
so powerfull, or barbarous, but may be avoided
by flying from him to remote places, but who can fly
from that superstitious fear, which a man doth carry
continually about him; <hi>Quid terras alio calentes Sole mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus?
patria quis exulse quoque fugit?</hi> a man may fly
from his country, saith <hi>Horace,</hi> but not from himselfe;
this tyrant haunts the superstitious wretch continually,
as the evil Spirit did <hi>Saul.</hi> Againe, no tyrant can ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize
over a man longer then he lives; death sets e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
slave at liberty; but this tyrant leaves not his
slave in death, but with the terrors of future torments
in hell, doth vex his soul when it is departing hence;
<hi>Curae non ipsa in morte relinquunt;</hi> there is no slave so
wretched and miserable, no pain so great, no captivity
so unpleasing, no chaines so heavy, no prison so loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
which in sleep are not forgotten; for then the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97888:75"/>
slave is at liberty, the pain is eased, the chaines are
light, and the darkest dungeon, is then a beautiful Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace;
but this <hi>Deisedemonia,</hi> as the Greeks call it, this
superstitious fear will not permit its captivated slave to
rest or take any quiet, but affrights him in his sleep with
horrid dreams, and hideous phancies, so that sleep
which should be his comfort and ease, becomes his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter.
Besides, Temples and Altars, which use to be
Sanctuaries for Delinquents, are no ease or sanctuary at
all to the superstitious sinner; any servant might be
defended from his Master by laying hold of the Altar;
but no Altar, no Temple, no Sacrifice can priviledge
the superstitious soul, who is still jealous and fearfull
of his cruel gods; and what wonder is it, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the nature of those insatiable devils, whom they
worship, who are never satisfied with the blood of
beasts, men, women, and children, but are still thirsting
after more, with the horse-leech; if these be the gods
which the Gentiles serve, surely as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, they
had been in no worse condition if the <hi>Typhones,</hi> and <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi>
had overthrown these gods; for they could not
have been mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e cruel, nor have exacted more bloody
victimes. And doubtlesse as the same <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith,
these poor wretches do not love their gods, but rather
hate them, because they still fear some hurt and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
from them; therefore as some men flatter and
give rich presents to tyrants, not because they love them
(for indeed they hate them) but that they may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
hurt by them; so deale superstitious men with
their gods. And in truth <hi>Plutarch</hi> is not altogether
mistaken, when he makes Superstition worse then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme;
for the Atheists hold there is no god, but
the Superstitious honour such fordid, base, and cruel
gods, that it were far better there were no gods: then
such; for it is lesse impiety to say there is no god, then
to give his sacred name and honour to such wicked,
greedy, barbarous, and blood sucking devils. I had
rather (saith he) men should say there is no <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
then that they should say <hi>Plutarch</hi> is an inconstant,
fickle, cholerick, a revengefull, and cruel man. And so
he concludes that superstition is the cause of Atheisme
and impiety; because men looking upon the ridiculous
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97888:76"/>
gestures, impurity, cruelty, injustice, madnesse, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and all kind of villany perpetrated in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
concluded, it were better have no gods, then
such abominable Deities. But see <hi>Plutarch</hi> himselfe in

say at first shined out of a Cave; and their tradition is,
that out of two Caves came mankinde; the biggest men
out of the greatest Cave, and the least men out of the
lesser Cave. They worship also divers Idols with ugly
shapes, by which the Devil useth to speak to them;
these they call <hi>Zaemes,</hi> to which they kept divers festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.
In these they had their publiqu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dances, with
the musick of shells tyed about their armes, thighs, and
legs. The King sits drumming when the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves, having their skins painted with divers
colours of herbs. When they sacrifice, they use with a
sacred hook thrust down their throat, to turn up their
stomack. Then they sit down in a ring, crosse-legged,
and wri-necked about the Idol, praying their sacrifice
might be accepted. In some places the women dance
about their Idols, and sing the praises of their ancient
Kings; then both Sexes on their knees offer cakes,
which the Priests cut and give to every one a piece, this
each man keeps as a holy relique all the year against
dangers. If any fall sick, the Priests impute this to
their neglect in the Idols service, therefore exhort them
to build a Chapp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, or dedicate a Grove to their god.
They think the Ghosts of the dead walk, who assault
such as are fearful, and vanish from them who are not
afraid. Their several Rites are like those of the other
Pagan Countries. See <hi>P. Martyr.</hi>

                     <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> we may conclude with

there is no such murtherer as the Idolater, who not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97888:76"/>
onely destroyeth the bodies of men and beasts to please
his Idol, but likewise murthereth his own soule: there
is no such Adulterer as he, who not only goeth a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after false gods, but also adulterates the truth; for
every false god is adultery; there is no such thief as he,
for not only much robbery and oppression is committed
to maintain false worship and idolatry, as <hi>Arnobius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth
in the Romans, who to maintain the worship
of their gods, did rob all other gods and nations, and
with their triumphant gold <hi>(Persius</hi> calls it <hi>aurum ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum)</hi>
adorn their images; but besides this theft, the

salutis;</hi> the main wickednesse of mankind, the
chief guilt of the world, the devourer or destroyer of
mans happinesse and salvation; therefore he will not
have any Christian to paint, or make graven images to
be worshipped, affirming that it is flatly against the
law of God, and likewise against their vow in baptism
to forsake the Devil and his Angels; how do they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him, if they make him? if they make it their trade
to live by him, how have they renounced him? can
they deny with their tongue, what they confesse with
their hand? destroy that with their words, which
they build up with their deeds; confesse one God, and
make many; preach the true God, and yet make false
gods? If any say that he worships none, though he
makes them, <hi>Tertullian</hi> will answer him, that he who
makes false gods, doth really worship them, not with
incense and sacrifice, but with his wit, sweat, industry,
and skill, which he impends on the making of them;
he is more then their Priest; for without him they
could have no Priest. How can a Christian put forth
that hand to touch the body of our Lord, by which he
hath made a body for the Devil? And as it is Idolatry
saith he, to carve, or paint Idols, so it is, any ways to
adorne them, to build houses or temples for them, so
that all such Artificers are guilty of idolatry; so are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Astrologers, who call the stars by the names of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97888:77"/>
Idols, and take upon them to foretell future contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
by them; so are School-Masters, who teach the
Genealogies and Fables of these false gods; this seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
indeed was needful in the beginning of the Gospel,
when Gentilisme was to be suppressed, that way might
be made for Christianity; but now Pagan idolatry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quite extinguished among us, there is no danger in
reading, or teaching of Heathen Authors. He condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
also Merchants that bring home and sell incense or
any thing else whereby idols are worshipped. So he
will not have Christians to be present at the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
shews, or festivals of idols, nor to give any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to them, or to wink and connive at them, or to
call them gods, or to swear by them, for that is to take
the name of the true God in vain; nay, he will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Christians to light candles, or set up bayes in
their doors, which upon solemn days was an honour
due to the Emperour, because this ceremony had some
resemblance with Gentile idolatry.</p>

But we must observe, that although the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

Philosophers confesseth there is but one Unitie the root
of all things; one goodnesse of infinit power, the
Author of life and motion in the world. So <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
who first assumed the name of Philosopher saith:
that God is one, and all in all, the light of all powers,
the beginning of all things, the torch of heaven, Father
mind, life, and motion of the Vniverse. <hi>Empedocles</hi>

who produceth all things of himselfe, the End of Ends,

and beauty, by whose light all things shine, &amp;c.
<hi>Simplicius</hi> saith, that from this divine beauty proceed
all beauties, and all truths from this divine truth, the
beginning of all beginnings, the sowrce and original of
all goodnesse, the cause of causes, God of Gods, &amp;c.
<hi>Plotinus</hi> to the same purpose makes God the original of
all things and who only is sufficient in himselfe, giving
being to all, &amp;c. The same doctrine is taught by his

this was also the general Tenet of the Stoicks,
as may be seen in <hi>Epictetus,</hi> who sheweth that above all
things we must learn to know there is but one God, the
governour of all things, &amp;c. who is not ignorant of our
works, words, and thoughts, &amp;c. <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us that
nothing is more excellent then God, by whom the
world is governed, who is subject and obedient to
none. So <hi>Seneca,</hi> we must find out something more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
then the world, whence the Stars had their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
&amp;c. He calls God the Soul and Spirit; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
and keeper of this Universe, the Lord and Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
of this great work, &amp;c. The same is acknowledged
by <hi>Chrysippus</hi> as he is cited by <hi>Plutarch;</hi> there cannot
(saith he) be found out any other beginning or origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of justice, but from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who is the common
nature, fate, and providence of all things. The <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks</hi>
maintained the same doctrine, as may be seen
in <hi>Aristotles Physicks, Metaphysicks,</hi> and <hi>De mundo;</hi> he
acknowledgeth a first, infinite, and eternal Mover, who
is only wise, and the cause of causes. He is the Father
of gods and men, the preserver of the world, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<hi>Hercules.</hi> Of divination by chirping of Birds, <hi>Augures;</hi> of

the Priests that had care of each <hi>Curla</hi> or Ward in the
City: for <hi>Romulus</hi> divided <hi>Rome</hi> into 33 Wards, and
assigned to each of them a Priest or <hi>Curio.</hi> Over these
was <hi>Curio maximus,</hi> that is an Archbishop. The Priests
which <hi>Romulus</hi> ordained to the memory of <hi>Titus Tatius,</hi>
King of the <hi>Sabins,</hi> were called <hi>Sodales Tatit.</hi> The
Priests that went alwayes covered with threaden caps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

it was also an act of mercy to hide the dead
bodies in the earth, that those organs of such a divine
soul, might not be torne by wild Beasts, and Birds,
and buried in their mawes. That disconsolate mother
of <hi>Euryalus</hi> in the Poet, is not so much grieved for the
murthering of her Son, as for that he should be left a

The
burying of the dead is commended by the Pagan
writers as a work of humanity, mercy, clemency, piety,
justice, and religion; therefore the Latine pharse yet
doth intimate, how just a thing it is to bury the dead;
when they call Funerals Deities, <hi>justa exequiarum.</hi> or
<hi>justa funebria.</hi> We read in <hi>Homer Iliad.</hi> 24. how angry
<hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> were with <hi>Achilles,</hi> for abusing and
neglecting to bury the body of <hi>Hector;</hi> shewing that
<hi>Achilles</hi> had lost all mercy and modesty
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. And to shew how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
an act it is to bury the dead, the Gentiles assign
the care of Funerals and Sepulchres, to certain gods
which they called <hi>Manes,</hi> whose chief was <hi>Pluto,</hi> called
therefore <hi>Summanus;</hi> hence all Tombs and Monuments
were dedicated <hi>Diis manibus;</hi> and therefore they who
offered any violence to Tombs, were said to violate the
<hi>Manes; Deorum Manium jura sancta sunto.</hi> Of this you may
see more in our <hi>Mystagogus Poeticus.</hi> It was counted an
execrable thing, if any should light upon a dead body
unburied, and not cast earth upon it; therefore the
high Priest among the Jewes, albeit he was not to be
present at any funeral, yet if by chance he found a
dead corps, he was to bury it himselfe. And so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
were the <hi>Iewes</hi> in this duty, that the bodies of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors
were to be buried after Sun set. <hi>Horac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> brings
in the dead corps promising a reward from <hi>Iupiter</hi> to
him that should cast some earth upon it. <hi>Multaque <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unde potest tibi defluat; aequo? Ab Iove Neptunoque;</hi> but
if he refuse to do this work of humanity, <hi>piacula nulla
resolvent,</hi> no sacrifice should be able to expiate his crime.
And to make men the more careful of this last duty to
the defunct, the Poets faigned that the soules of those
dead bodies which lay unburied, did wander up and
down a 100. years without any rest, neither were they
admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Hence it is that <hi>Patroclus</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> doth so earnestly

sollicit <hi>Achilles</hi> to bury him. The like earnest suit doth
<hi>Palinurus</hi> in <hi>Virgil</hi> put up to <hi>Aenaeas,</hi> for the same favour;
and because want of burial was counted one of the
greatest disgraces and punishments that could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on the dead, therefore selfe murtherers were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred

chief god was <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whom they call the Father and

their Deliverer, their Counsellor, their Law-giver, and
Defender of their Towns: hence these Epithets of

                     </q>
But yet <hi>Homer</hi> is permitted to abuse this supream God
with the titles of an Adulterer, and of an impotent god,
who was subject to the Fates, and bound by the other
gods till <hi>Thetis</hi> loosed him; He makes him also false in
his promises to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> a laughing stock to <hi>Iuno</hi>
and <hi>Minerva,</hi> a slave to Love: subject to sleep, a make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

Greeks and Romans worshipped the same <hi>Iupiter:</hi> yet
the Romans being a wiser people, spake alwayes reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
of him, as may be seen in the Prince of Poets, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>

cases, is to be preferred before <hi>Homer,</hi> as I have shewed
elsewere. Their next god was <hi>Apollo,</hi> or the Sun, whom

made him the Author of Divination: Hence his Oracles
were famous everywhere. They that died suddenly,
were said to be killed by him: they made him also the
god of Musick and Physick. He was called <hi>Alexicacus,</hi>
and <hi>Apotropaius,</hi> that is, a Deliverer from, or a turner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of evil. The mysteries of these things we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
elsewhere, in <hi>Mystagogo Poetico.</hi> He had a rich

Torch was meant her light; she was also the same with
<hi>Proserpine,</hi> and is called <hi>Triformis</hi> from the Moons three
different shapes: but she was a cruel goddess, who
would not be satisfied without humane sacrifices; in
<hi>Arcadia</hi> she was worshipped in the form of a Virgin,
covered with a Hindes skin, having a Torch in one
hand, two Serpents in the other, and on her shoulders
her Bow and quiver. Of these mysteries I have written

gold, and white Ivory; having in one hand a Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,

Moon is Queen of the night, therefore she hath her
Crown, Throne, and Scepter; the Owle being a night
bird, was fitly dedicated to her that was Lady of the
night. She was the goddess of riches and Fecundity,
and the same with <hi>Lucina:</hi> therefore she hath the
Pomegranate, a Symbol of plenty; as she is the Moon,
the hours attend her; as the giver of riches, the Graces;
for bounty and good turns require thanks. In some
<hi>Graecian</hi> Temples her Image is drawn by Peacocks, to
shew that pride and wealth go together, and that
rich people delight in gaudy and glorious apparel: At
<hi>Argos</hi> she was worshipped with Vine branches about
her, treading on a Lions skin, in contempt of <hi>Bacchus,</hi>

and a burning Torch in the other, with a sheaf of Corn

Sol, Aesculapius, Iupiter, Liber, Hercules, Mars, Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,

Sun, which was the chief god worshipped among the
Geniles. <hi>Luna, Hecate, Diana, Iuno, Lutina, Venus,

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97888:87"/>
Cerberus,</hi> &amp;c. are but different names of one and the
same infernal deities. And as the same god had differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
names, so he had different sorts of worship; for the
Sun under the name of <hi>Apollo,</hi> was worshipped in the
form of a beardlesse youth, with yellow hair, carrying
in one hand a Cythron, in the other, arrows, and his
bow. As <hi>Sol,</hi> He was honoured in a flaming ship full
of rich wates, carried about the world, by which
light is imparted to all. As <hi>Phoebus,</hi> he was adored in
a golden Chariot drawn by four horses swift and fiery,
in one hand he holdeth a glitering target, in the other
a burning Torch, on his head a golden Crown beset
with twelve pretious stones. As <hi>Aesculopius,</hi> he is set
forth sitting in a Chair, in the habit of a grave man with
a long beard, crowned with Bayes, holding in one
hand a knobbed staffe, and with the other learning on
a Serpents head. Sometimes he is described with
two Cocks in his hand, and certain frutis and herbs in
his lap, by which the properties of Physitians are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented;
but the Sun is the great Physitian. As
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> he was worshipped sitting in a throne with a
Scepter in one hand, and an Eagle in the other, by
which was expressed his power and dominion. As
<hi>Bacchus</hi> of <hi>Liber,</hi> he was set out like a naked youth,
with hornes in his head, a Crown of Ivie, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of fig leaves, with the <hi>Thyrsus</hi> or Vine Speare in
his hand, sitting in a Chariot drawn by Tygers, and
Panthers. Which may signifie both the power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and raging heat of the Sun. <hi>As Hercules,</hi> they
honoured him cloathed with a Lions skin. Crowned
with poplar leaves, and the club in his hand knocking
down the <hi>Hydra.</hi> We have shewed the meaning of
these in <hi>Mystagog. Poetic.</hi> and that the Suns courses
through the twelve Signes were adumbrated by <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>
his twelve labours. <hi>As Mars,</hi> he was adored
with a Helmet on his head, a spear in one hand, and a
Bow in the other. <hi>As Mercury,</hi> he was worshipped
like a young man on a square stone, having wings on
his head, and on his feet, with a sword in his hand kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
many eyed <hi>Argus:</hi> by which was meant the Suns
perpetual vigour, in that he was resembled by a youth,
the wings shewed his swiftnesse, the square stone the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97888:87"/>
four seasons of the year, or four Climats of the world,
His killing of <hi>Argus</hi> shewed the confounding of the Star
light by the suns presence. <hi>As Pan</hi> he was expressed and
adored under the form of a Satyre, with a red face,
long beard, horns on his head, a spotted skin about him,
having in one hand a Pipe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>But see the</hi> Mytbologists, and what we have written in Mystag. Poetice.</note> in the other a Shepherds
staffe; his beard and hornes signified his beames; his
speckled skin, the Heaven speckled with Stars; the
pipe, the harmony of his motion; and the staffe, his
power. Much more might be said of this subject.</p>
                  <p>Q. Vnder what names and shapes did they worship the

                        <hi>Moon,</hi> how worshipped.</note> As <hi>Hecate</hi> she was worshipped under the shape of
a monster with three heads, by which they signified the
Moons threesold form she assumes, according to
her accesse and recesse to and from the Sun. As <hi>Luna</hi>
at her first appearance, she was honoured with white
and golden garments, and a burning torch, to shew the
increasing of her light: when she was halse full, with
a basket of fruit, to shew how the fruits fill and grow
with her: but when she was at full, with a dark colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
garment, to signifie the decreasing of her light. As
<hi>Diana,</hi> she was worshipped in the habit of a woman,
with a torch flaming in one hand, two snakes in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a bow and arrows on her shoulder, sitting in a
Chariot drawn with white Deer, all which signified
partly her light, and partly her motion. Her light is a
help to hunters, therefore she was worshipped in the
habit of a hunter. As <hi>Iuno</hi> she was honoured in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of a Queen, sitting in a chariot of brasse, silver
and gold, which signified both her light, beauty, and
dominion over the night. As <hi>Lucina,</hi> she was crowned
with the herb <hi>Dictamnus,</hi> or Dittany, which is good for
women in labour: and a burning torch in her hand, to
shew the hot fits, and sharp pains of Child-bearing wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
upon which the Moon hath great power. As <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
she was resembled by a beautiful woman naked,
crowned with roses, and rising out of the Sea, by which
they signified the light and beauty of the Moon when
she ariseth. As <hi>Ceres,</hi> she was represented by a Matron
with a sheaff of corn on her head, and a lamp in her
hand, to shew, that from her proceeds both light and
plenty.</p>

Temple was built round, and in it a perpetual fire kept
by the Nuns of <hi>Vesta.</hi> These two Elements were joyned
together, because fire is begot, both in, and of the
Earth. The Virgins habit signified the purity of the
Fire; her sitting, the immobility of the Earth; the
white Garlands, the purity of the air, or Firmament,
compassing the Earth and Fire; the roundnesse, of the
Temple shewed the rotundity of the Earth. The earth

The Sea's swift motion was represented by the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin

waters, by the Crown and Scepter. He was called

Sea deities, and indeed the same with <hi>Neptune;</hi> so was
<hi>Oceanus,</hi> whose Chariot was drawn by four Whales:
<hi>Proteus</hi> is also the same, though those are held by most

Fishes. The <hi>Tritons</hi> were counted <hi>Neptunes</hi>

the three-headed-dog <hi>Cerberus,</hi> all which was to shew

the condition of the dead. The Cypress-tree stood
alwayes by him; he was called from ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,

wise and fools, Kings and beggars into one place;
<hi>omnes eodem cogimur;</hi> Death is called <hi>Cerberus,</hi> that is
a devourer of flesh: For it consumes all flesh. This is
the black dog as <hi>Seneca</hi> calls him, which is still barking

with this water, after a firebrand taken from the
altar had been quenched in it, and then some holy flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or meal was cast on them. This done, the Priest
prayed, then the Victim was brought to the altar, with
the head upward, if it was dedicated to the superiour
gods; but if to the inferiour, with its head downward.
The Fat, Heart, Spleen and Liver, were offered to the
gods; the rest of the beast was eat up by the Priests
and people, spending the rest of the day in gormandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

They used to try if their victim would prove acceptable
to their Gods, by putting the Cake on the head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the horns, which were in solemn feasts gilded;
if the beast stood quiet, it was fit to be sacrificed; if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
it was rejected. In all sacrifices <hi>Vesta</hi> was first
invocated <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to shew both the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and necessity of fire in sacrificing. Their custom
also was to sacrifice in the morning to the Gods, in the
evening to the <hi>Heroes</hi> or Demi-gods. The Greeks did
not as the Romans, grind the corn which they laid on
the head of the Victim, but laid it on whole <gap reason="foreign">

manner of the ancient feeding, before the grinding of
corn was invented. This whole corn was called <gap reason="foreign">

They were wont also after their sacrifice and feast, to
burn the tongue of the beast and besprinkle it with
Wine, as <hi>Homer</hi> sheweth, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

This was to shew that after drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and feasting, the tongue should be silent: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
divulged what was then spoken. This was also
done in honour of <hi>Mercury</hi> the god of Eloquence and
of sleep; for about sleeping time the tongue was sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed.
The Grecian Priests used to dance or run about
their Altars, beginning first at the left hand, to shew
the motion of the Zodiack, which is from the West
called by Astronomers the left part of the world: then
they danced beginning at the right hand, to shew the
motion of the first sphear, which is from East to West.
Their bloody sacrifices were called impure; but Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincense,

They that sacrificed to the infernal gods, wore black

the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> was built in the highest part of

by the sons of <hi>Hercules. Theseus</hi> had erected one before
called <hi>Theseum,</hi> in imitation of which <hi>Romulus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>
built such another. At first the Gentle gods had no
Temples at all, but were worshipped either on Hills or

a Temple in <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Ianus</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> Before that time

to conjecture; they gave her a short coat, to shew the
swiftnesse of her motion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for a long coat signifieth a
slow motion; therefore they painted <hi>Saturne</hi> whose
motion is the slowest of all the Planets, with a long
coat. The hood or chapron with long eares, was to
represent her horns, or else to shew that sounds are
heard a far off in the night, which is the time of her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.
Her piked shoes also may resemble her
hornes. <hi>Tuisco</hi> their third Idol is set out in the skin of
some wild beast, with a Scepter in his hand; this is
thought to be the first and most ancient of that nation,
from whom the Germans call themselves Tuytshen, or
as the Flemings pronunce it Duytshen, as <hi>Verstegan</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth;
but I think that under this name they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
<hi>Mars;</hi> for as <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes, <hi>Mars</hi> was one of
the German gods. His hairie garments doth shew the
feirce and truculent disposition of that warlike god;
besides that, hairie <hi>Sylvanus</hi> is thought to be the same
that <hi>Mars.</hi> His Scepter may signifie the power and
command which Souldiers have in the world. But
it is more likely by this Idol they meant <hi>Mercury;</hi>
for next to the Sun and Moon, he was as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith,
the <hi>Germans</hi> chief god. His Scepter and hairie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may signifie the power and command that elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and musick have over the most brutish natures;
and of these two faculties <hi>Mercury</hi> was the inventer.
And we must know that, as the Romans next to the
Sun and Moon honoured <hi>Mars</hi> the Patron of their city,
for which cause they dedicated to him the third day
of the week; so the <hi>Germans</hi> for the same cause dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Mercury</hi> their chief founder and patron the same
day, which from his name <hi>Tuisco</hi> is called Tuesday yet
retained among us. Their fourth Idol was <hi>Woden,</hi>
from whom Wednesday is so called. He was the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>Mars,</hi> and is called Woden, from being wood or
mad; intimating hereby the firercenesse of Souldiers,
and furie of Warr. He is painted with a Crown on
his head, a sword in his hand, and in compleat armor.
Their fift Idol is <hi>Thor,</hi> which was their <hi>Iupiter,</hi> for they
made him the god of the aire, and commander of winds
rain, and thunder; they painted him sitting in a chaire,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97888:92"/>
of state, with a Scepter in his right hand, a golden
Crown on his head, encompassed with twelve stars,
by which they meant he was King of the upper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
and commander of the stars: from him Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day

will not have this <hi>Seater</hi> to be the same that <hi>Saturne,
because he was other-ways called Crodo;</hi> but this is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;

Proserpina.</hi> The goddesse of wisdom is called <hi>Pallas</hi>
and <hi>Minerva,</hi> &amp;c. Doubtlesse then this Idol was
<hi>Saturn</hi> as his picture shewes; for he is set out like an
old man; and so he was painted among the Romans;
the wheele in his left hand signifieth the revolution of
time, the pail of water in his right hand, wherein

<hi>Saturn</hi> under the name of <hi>Crodo,</hi> like an old man
standing on a fish, holding in his hands a wheele and a

woman standing in a Chariot drawn with two Swans
and two Doves. On her head she wore a Garland of
Myrtle; in her right hand she had the Globe of the
world, in the other three Oranges. Out of her
brest proceeded a burning Tap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

naked with fruit in their hands waited on her. In
<hi>Westphalia</hi> they worshipped an Idol all in armour,
holding a banner in his right hand with a Rose, and in
the left a pair of Scales. On his Breast was carved a
Beare, on his Helmet a Lion. It seems by the Idol
they understood <hi>Mars.</hi> The <hi>Rugians</hi> neer the <hi>Baltick</hi>
sea, worshipped <hi>Mars</hi> in the form of a Monster with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
faces, and seven swords hanging by his side in their
Scabberds; he held the eighth sword naked in his
hand. The same <hi>Rugians,</hi> as also the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
an Idol with four heads, two of them
looking forward, and two backward; in his right hand
it held a horn which the Priest every yeer sprinkled
with Wine, in the left hand a Bow; this also seems to
be <hi>Mars.</hi> The <hi>Sclavi</hi> adored an Idol standing on a
Pillar, with a Plough-share in one hand, a Lance and
Banner in the other; his head was beset with Garlands,
his leggs were Booted, and at one of his heels a bell
did hang. Some of them did worship an Idol on
whose brest was a Target, in which was ingraven an
Oxe head. It had a Pole-Axe in its hand, and a little
Bird sitting on its head. All these may seem to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Mars.</hi> The <hi>Moscovites</hi> and <hi>Russians</hi> adored an
Idol called <hi>Perun,</hi> in the shape of a man holding a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
stone in his hand, resembling Thunder; a fire of
Oken wood was continually maintained burning, to
the honour of this Idol; it was death for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steres,
if they suffered this fire to go out. It seems
this was <hi>Iupiters</hi> Image. The <hi>Stetinians</hi> in <hi>Pomerania</hi>
worshipped a three-headed Idol, and used to ask Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
or advice of a black horse: the charge of which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97888:93"/>
was committed to one of the Priests. In the countries

                     </note> or rather
they worshipped the Devil, as appears by their inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
humane sacrifices. The <hi>Scythians</hi> used to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
every hundreth captive to <hi>Mars:</hi> So did the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
thinking there was no other means to pacifie
that angry and butcherly god, but by murthering of
men. Of the same opinion were the old <hi>Germans,</hi> who
sacrificed men to <hi>Mercury.</hi> The <hi>Cymbrians</hi> or <hi>Cymmeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
by their women Priests used to murther and sacrifice
men. These she-devils girt with brasse girdles, and in
a white surplice, used to cut the throats of the captives,
to rip up their bowels, and by inspection to foretel the
event of the war, and withal to make drums of their
skins. The <hi>Goths</hi> did not think they pleased the Devil
sufficiently, except first they had tormented the poor
captive by hanging him upon a tree, and then by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him in pieces among brambles and thorns. These
<hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Getes</hi> believed that the dead went into a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
place where their God <hi>Tamolxius</hi> ruled; to him
they used still to send a Messenger chosen out among
themselves by lot, who in a boat of five Oars went to
supplicate for such things as they wanted. Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of sending him was thus; They took him hand and
foot, and flung him upon the points of sharp pikes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if
he fell down dead, they concluded that the god was
well pleased with that messenger; if otherwise, they
rejected him as an unworthy messenger; therefore they
chose another to whom they gave instructions before
he died, what he should say to their god; and so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97888:94"/>
slain him upon their pikes, committed the dead
body in the boat to the mercy of the sea. The <hi>Lithuani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
used to burn their chief captives to their gods. The
<hi>Lusitanians</hi> ripped open the bowels of their captives in
their divinations, and presented their right hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cut off, to their gods. The <hi>Sclavi</hi> worshipped an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
called <hi>Suantovitus,</hi> whose Priest the day before he
sacrificeth, makes clean the Chappel, which none must
enter but he alone, and whilest he is in it, he must not
draw his breath, but hold his head out of the window,
least with his mortal breath he should pollute the Idol.
The next day the people watching without the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
door, view the Idols cup; if they find any of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
which was put there wasted, they conclude the
next years scarcity, but other wise they hope for plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and so they fill the cup again, and pray to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
for victory and plenty; then pouring out old wine
at the idols feet, and offering to him a great cake, they
spend the rest of the day in gormandising. It is held a
sin and a dishonour to the idol not to be drunk then.

by their example; but when they saw the trees cut
down, they began to lament the losse of their gods,
and complained to their Prince of the wrong done to
them by the Christians, whereupon the Preachers were
commanded presently to abandon the country, and so
these dogs returned to their vomit. They adored also
Serpents, which they entertained in their houses, and
used by their Priests to ask Oracles or advice of the
fire, concerning their friends, when they fell sick, if
they should recover health again. The same Idolatry
was used by the <hi>Polonians</hi> or <hi>Sarmatians.</hi> The <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
or <hi>Pannonians</hi> did not onely worship the Sun, Moon
and Stars, but also every thing they first met with in
the morning. Most part of <hi>Livonia</hi> is yet idolatrous,
worshipping the Planets and observe the heathenish cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
in their burials and marriages. In <hi>Samogethia</hi> a
country bordering on <hi>Prussia, Livonia,</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi>
they worshipped for their chief god the Fire, which
their Priests continually maintained within a Tower
on the top of an high hill, till <hi>Vladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
beat down the Tower, and put out the fire, and
withal caused their Groves to be cut down, which they
held sacred, with the Birds, beasts, and every thing in
them. They burn the bodies of their chief friends, with
their horses, furniture, and best cloaths, and withal set
down victuals by their Graves, believing that the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
soules would in the night time eat and drink there.
The like superstition is used by the <hi>Livonians.</hi> So the
<hi>Lapponians</hi> are at this day for the most part idolatrous;
they hold that no marriage which is not consecrated by
fire and a flint,<note place="margin">See <hi>Olaus, Munster</hi> in his Geography, and others.</note> is lawful; therfore by striking of the flint
with iron, they shew that as the hid sparks of fire flie
out by that union, so children are propagated by

which is carefully to be observed of all for one moneth
or thirty days. 6. Of their charity amd alms-deeds to
the poor and indigent. 7. Of their Matrimony, which
every man is bound to embrace at 25. years of age. 8.
Against murder. To the observer of these commands
he Promiseth Paradise; in which shall be silken Carpets,
pleasant Rivers, fruitfull trees, beautiful women,
musick, good cheer, and choice wines, stores of gold
and silver plate with precious stones, and such other
conceits. But to those that shall not obey this Law,
hell is prepared, with seven gates, in which they shall
eat and drink fire, shall be bound in chains, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with scalding waters. He proveth the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
by the story of the seven sleepers, which slept
360. years in a Cave. He prescribes also divers moral
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97888:99"/>
and judicial Precepts, as abstinence from swines flesh,
blood, and such as die alone: also from adultery and
fals witness. He speaks of their <hi>Fridays</hi> devotion; of
good works; of their Pilgrimage to <hi>Meccha;</hi> of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
to each other; of avoiding covetousnesse, usury,
oppression, lying, casual murder, disputing about his
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> or doubting thereof. Also of prayer, alms,
washing, fasting, and Pilgrimage. He urgeth also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
forbideth swearing, commends friendship,
will not have men forced to Religion; will not have
mercy or pardon to be shewed to enemies. He urgeth
valour in Battel, promising rewards to the couragious,
and shewing that none can die till his time come, and
then is no avoyding thereof.</p>

there is a terrible Dragon in the mouth of hell; and
that there is an iron bridge, over which the wicked
are conveyed, some into everlasting fire, and some into

rising, and the Moon at her first appearing should be

hold it unlawfull for any man to go into their Temples
not washed from head to foot; and if after washing,
he piss, go to stool, or break wind upward or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he must wash again, or else he offends God.

but <hi>Mahomet</hi> is come and gone, above a thousand years
agoe. 3. The ancient Fathers believed that the two
Witnesses which shall oppose <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and shall be
slain by him, are <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> but these are not yet
come. 4. The tradition of the Primitive Church was,
that <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall reign but three years and a halfe,
supposing that this period of time is meant by time and
times, and half a time: but <hi>Mahomet</hi> we know reigned
many more years. 5. Antichrist will wholly oppose
himself against Christ, vilifie him, set himself up in his
stead: and to extol himselfe above all that is called
God: but <hi>Mahomet</hi> doth speak honourably of Christ,
in calling him the Word of God, the Spirit of God, the
Servant of God, the Saviour of those that trust in him,
the Son of a Virgin, begot without the help of man, &amp;c.
as may be seen in his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> 6. Our writers, as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,
Cartwright,</hi> &amp;c. hold that Antichrist is described
<hi>Revel.</hi> 9. under the name of that Star which fell from
Heaven, having the key of the bottomlesse pit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>Abadd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n</hi> and <hi>Apollyon;</hi> but that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
with his followers are set out in that same chapter
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97888:100"/>
under the four Angels bound in the great River <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
7.</hi> The Apostle 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. saith, <hi>that Antichrist
shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it in the Temple of God as God, and shall exalt himselfe
above all that is called God.</hi> But this cannot be meant of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> for he never sate in the Temple of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by this word we understand the Temple of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
or the Church of Christ; for he and his Disciples
separated themselves from the Church of Christ, and
will have no communion with Christians. 8. Antichrist
is to come with signs and lying wonders, and by these
to raise his Kingdome. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> came with the
sword, and by it subdued the neighbouring Nations, so
that neither he nor his followers did or doe pretend to
any wonders. 9. Our writers say that Antichrist is
not to be taken for a particular person, but for a whole
company or society of people under one head; but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
was a particular person. 10. Antichrist is to be
destroyed by the breath of the Lords mouth; but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
died a natural death. By all these reasons then
it appears, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> cannot be that Great <hi>Antichrist</hi>
who is to come in the end of the world. Yet I deny
not but he was an Antichrist in broaching a doctrin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to Christs Divinity. Such an Antichrist was
<hi>Arius;</hi> likewise in persecuting Christ in his members,
he may be called <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and so might <hi>Nero, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
Dioclesian,</hi> and other persecutors. Besides, the
number of the beast 666. is found in <hi>Mahomets</hi> name,
and so it is found in divers other names. If we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the miseries, desolation and blood that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
upon the spreading of Mahumetanisme in the
world, we may with <hi>Pererius</hi> on <hi>Revel.</hi> 6 conclude that
<hi>Mahomet</hi> is signified by death, which rideth on the pale
horse, followed by Hell or the Grave; to whom was
given power over the fourth part of the earth, to kill
with the sword, with famine, &amp;c. for he was the death
both of soul and body to many millions of people; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whose wars followed destruction, famine, pestilence
and many other miseries, in that part of the world,
where he and his successors have spread their doctrine
and conquests.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> Are all the Mahumetans of one profession?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No:<note place="margin">Their Sects.</note> for there be divers Sects amongst them; but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97888:100"/>
the two main Sects are, that of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> followed
by the <hi>Turks;</hi> and of <hi>Hali</hi> by the <hi>Persians.</hi> To this
<hi>Hali Mahomet</hi> bequeathed both his Daughter and his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>
which the <hi>Persians</hi> believe is the true Copy, and
that of the <hi>Turks</hi> to be false. This <hi>Hali</hi> succeeded <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
both in his Doctrine and Empire; whose inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the Law they embrace for the truest. As
the Saracen <hi>Caliphs</hi> of old, exercised both the Kingly
and Priestly Office; so both are claimed by the modern
<hi>Persian;</hi> for both were performed by <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</hi>
But to avoid trouble, the Persian Sophi contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the Secular Government, leaving the Spiritual
to the <hi>Mustaed Dini,</hi> who is as the <hi>Musti</hi> in <hi>Turky.</hi> These
two Sects differ in many points: for the Arabians make
God the author both of good and evil; but the Persians
of good only; the Persians acknowledge nothing eternal
but God; the Turks say that the Law is also eternal; the
Persians say that the blessed souls cannot see God in his
Essence, but in his Effects or Attributes: The Turks teach
that he shall be visible in his Essence. The Persians will
have <hi>Mahomets</hi> soul to be carried by the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi>
into Gods presence when he received his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> The
Turks will have his body carried thither also. The
Persians pray but three times a day, the Arabians five
times; other differences they have; but these are the
chief Doctrinal differences: the maine is about the
true <hi>Alcoran,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Most of their religious Orders are wicked and
irreligious.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> their religious orders.</note> For those whom they call <hi>Imailer</hi> and <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
brothers of love,</hi> are worse then beasts in their lusts,
sparing neither women nor boys; their habit is a long
coat of a violet colour, without scam, girt about with
a golden girdle, at which hand silver Cimbals, which
make a jangling sound; they walk with a book in their
hand, containing love Songs and Sonnets, in the <hi>Persian</hi>
tongue; these go about singing, and receive money for
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97888:101"/>
their Songs, and are always bare-headed, wearing long-hair,
which they curle. The Order of <hi>Calender</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
perpetual Virginity, and have their own peculiar
Temples, or Ghappels. They wear a short coat made
of Wool and Horse hair, without sleeves, They cut
their hair short, and wear on their heads Felt-hats,
from which hangs cuffs of horse hair, about a hand-breadth.
They wear iron rings in their ears, and about
their necks and arms; they wear also in their Yard an
iron or silver ring of 3. <hi>lib.</hi> weight, whereby they are
forced to live chastely; they go about reading certaine
Rimes or Ballades. The Order of <hi>Dervises</hi> go about
begging almes in the name of <hi>Haly,</hi> son in Law to their
god <hi>Mahomet.</hi> They wear two sheepskins dried in the
Sun, the one whereof they hang on their back, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on their breast; the rest of their body is naked.
They shave their whole body, goe bare-headed, and
burn their temples with a hot Iron. In their ears they
wear rings, in which are precious stones. They bear in
their hand a knotty club. They are desperate Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
will rob and murther when they finde occasion;
they eat of a certain herb called <hi>Asserad</hi> or <hi>Matslach</hi>
which makes them mad; then they cut and slash their
flesh; the madder they are, the more they are reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
In <hi>Natolia</hi> neer the Sepulchre of a certain Saint
of theirs is a Covent of these Monks, being about five
hundred, where once a year there is kept a general
meeting of this Order, about eight thousand, over
whom their superiour called <hi>Assambaba</hi> is President. On
the Friday after their devotions they make themselves
drunk with <hi>Asserad</hi> in stead of Wine; then they fall
to dancing in a round, about a fire, singing Ballades,
which done, with a sharp knife they cut flowers and
Figures on their skins, for the love of those women
they most affect. This Feast holdeth seven days, which
ended, with banners displayed, and drums beating,
they depart all to their severall Covents, begging almes
all the way as they march. Their fourth Order cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Torlachs,</hi> are cloathed like the <hi>Dervises,</hi> but that
they wear also a Bears skin instead of a Cloak, but
they go bare headed and shaven; they anoint their
heads with Oyle against cold; and burn their temples

against defluxions. Their life is beastly and beggerly,
living in ignorance and idleness; they are begging in
every corner, and are dangerous to meet with in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart
places, for they will rob and plunder; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
Palmestry like our <hi>Gypsies,</hi> who use to pick silly
womens pockets as they are looking in their hands.
They carry about with them an old man, whom they
worship as a Prophet; when they mean to have mony
from any rich man, they repair to his house, and the
old man there prophesieth sudden destruction against
that house;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Q. Are there no other hypocritical Orders amongst them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, many more. Some whereof go naked, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
their privities, seeming no wayes moved either
with Summers heat, or winters cold; they can indure
cutting and slashing of their flesh, as it were insensibly,
to have their patience the more admired. Some will
be honoured for their abstinence in eating and drinking
sparingly and seldome. Some professe poverty, and
will enjoy no earthly things. Others again professe
perpetual silence, and will not speak, though urged
with injuries and tortures. Some avoid all conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with men. Others brag of Revelations, Visions,
and Enthusiasms. Some wear Feathers on their heads,
to shew they are given to contemplation. Some bave
Rings in their ears, to note theri subjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in harkning to spiritual Revelations. Some hare
chains about their necks and armes, to shew they are
bound up from the world; some by their mean cloaths
brag of their poverty. Some to shew their love to
hospitality, carry pitchers of clean water, which they
profer to all that will drink, without taking any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
Some dwell at the graves of the dead, and
live on what the people offers them. Some of them
have secret commerce with women, and then give out
that they conceive and bare children without the help
of man, purposely to extenuate the miraculous birth
of Christ. Some are <hi>Antinomians,</hi> affirming that there
is no use of the Law, but that men are saved by Grace.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97888:102"/>
Some are for traditions and merits, by which salvation
is obtained, and not by Grace. These addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wholly to Meditation, Prayer, Fasting, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spiritual exercises; there be some who are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hereticks, for they hold that every man may be
saved in his own Religion, and that Christs Law is as
good as <hi>Mahomets;</hi> therefore they make no scruple to
enter into Christian Churches, to sign themselves with
the Crosse, and besprinkle themselves with Holy water.
These Votaries have their Saints, to whom they have

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They have eight Orders or degrees; 1. The
<hi>Mophti</hi> or their Pope,<note place="margin">Their secular Priests.</note> on whose judgment all depend,
even the Great Turk himselfe, both in spiritual and
secular affaires. 2. The <hi>Caldelescher,</hi> who under the
<hi>Mophti</hi> is judge of all causes, both Civil and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
3. The <hi>Cadi</hi> whose Office is to teach the people.
4. <hi>Modecis,</hi> who have the charge of Hospitals. 5.
<hi>Antiphi,</hi> who publiquely read the heads of the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan
superstition, holding in one hand a naked sword,
in the other a Semiter. 6. <hi>Imam,</hi> who in their Temples
have charge of the Ceremonies. 7. <hi>Meizin,</hi> who on
their Towers sing and call the people to prayer. 8.
<hi>Sophi,</hi> who are their singing men in their Temples.
The higher Orders are chosen by the grand Seigniour.
The inferiour by the people, who have a small pension
from the Turk, which being insufficient to maintain
them, they are forced to work and use trades. There
is required no more learning in them, but to read the
Alcoran in <hi>Arabian,</hi> for they will not have it translated.

feet, face, and organs of the five Senses. 5. In giving
of almes either in mony or in meat; for their manner
is to sacrifice beasts, but not as the <hi>Iews</hi> upon Altars;
these beasts they cut in pieces and distribute among
the poor. Their other Sacrifices, which either they
offer, or promise to offer when they are in danger, are
so divided, that the Priests have one share, the poor
another, the third they eat themselves. 6. In making
of Vows, which are altogether conditionall; for they
pay them if they obtain what they desire, otherwise
not. 7. In adorning their Temples with multituds
of Lamps burning with Oyl, and with Tapestry spread
on Mats, upon which they prostrate themselves in
prayer. On the walls are written in golden letters,
<hi>There is but one God, and one Prophet Mahomet.</hi> 8. In
praying five times a day, and on <hi>Friday</hi> which is their
Sabbath (because <hi>Mahomets</hi> birth-day,) six times,
bowing themselves to the ground, twice as often as
they pray. Whosoever absents himself, chiefly on

yeer,<note place="margin">Their Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Mecca.</hi>
                     </note> and it is held so necessary, that he who doth not
once in his life go this Pilgrimage, shall be assuredly
damned; whereas Paradise and remission of sins is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to them that go it. The way is long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to those of <hi>Greece,</hi> being six moneths journey, and
dangerous by reason of <hi>Arabian</hi> theeves, mountains of
sand, with which divers are overwhelmed; and want of
water in those sandy and barren desarts. Their chief
care is to be reconciled to each other where there is
any difference, before they go; for if they leave not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them all grudges and quarels, their Pilgrimage
will do them no good; they begin their journey from
<hi>Cairo,</hi> about three weeks after their <hi>Easter,</hi> called
<hi>Bairam,</hi> being guarded with 200 <hi>Spachi</hi> on Dromedaries,
and 200 <hi>Ianizaries</hi> on Camels with eight pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
a rich vesture for the Prophet, and a green
Velvet covering wrought with gold to cover his Tomb,
which the <hi>Bassa</hi> delivers to the Captain of the Pilgrims.
The Camels that carry these Vestures are covered with
cloth of gold, and many small bels; the night before
their departure is kept with great Feasting and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.
No man may hinder his wife from this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
and every servant is made free that goeth it.
The Camel that carrieth the box with the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is
covered with cloth of gold and silk, the box with
silk onely during the journey, but with gold and
Jewels at their entring into <hi>Mecca.</hi> Musitians also and
singers encompasse the Camel, and much vain Pompe
is used in this Pilgrimage They use divers washings
by the way when they meet with water. When they
come to <hi>Mecca,</hi> the house of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which they fable
was miraculously built, receiveth a new covering and
a new Gate; the old vesture is sold to Pilgrims, which
hath a vertue in it to pardon sins; after many idle Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
performed, they go round about <hi>Abrahams</hi>
house seven times; then they kisse a black stone,
which they believe fell down thither from Heaven; at
first it was white, but by the often kissing of sinners
it is become black; then they wash themselves in the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97888:103"/>
Pond <hi>Zunzun,</hi> without the Gate five paces; this pond
the Angel shewed to <hi>Hagar</hi> when she wanted water
for <hi>Ismael.</hi> Of this also they drink, and pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of their sins. After five days abode at <hi>Mecca,</hi> they
go to the <hi>Hill of pard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ns,</hi> 15 miles distant, and there
they leave all their sins behind them after they have
heard a Sermon and prayed, and offered Sacrifices.
Upon their return they must not look back to the Hill,
lest their sins follow them. From hence they repair
to <hi>Medina,</hi> where <hi>Mahomets</hi> Sepulchre is thought to be;
but by the way they run up a certain hill, which they
call the mount of health; they run, that they may
sweat out all their sins. Thence they come pure to
the Seducers tombe which notwithstanding they may
not see, being hanged about with a Silk Curtain, which
by the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> being 50. in number to attend on the
tombe, and to light the Lamps, is taken down when
the Pilgrims Captain presenteth the new one; without,
each man gives to the Eunuchs handkerchiefs, or such
like, to touch the tombe therewith; this they keep as
a special Relique. When they return to <hi>Egypt,</hi> the
Captain presenteth the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to the <hi>Bassa</hi> to kisse, and
then it is laid up again; the Captain is Feasted, and
presented with a Garment of cloth of Gold. They
used to cut in pieces the Camel with his Furniture
which carried the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See <hi>Vertoman, Lanicerus,</hi> and others.</note> and reserve these pieces for
holy Reliques. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> also is elevated, that all
might see and adore it, which done, every one with

Church. Sometimes the child is circumcised at home;
and receiveth his name, not then, but when he is born.
They feast then commonly three days, which ended,
the child is carried with Pomp to the Bath, and from
thence home,<note place="margin">See <hi>Georgio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitz</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> where he is presented with divers gifts
from his Parents Friends. Women are not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

                     <hi>Q.</hi> What Rites doe they observe about the sick and dead?</p>
                  <p>A. Their Priests and chief friends visit them, exhort
them to repentance,<note place="margin">Their Rites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the sick and dead.</note> and read Psalms to them. When
any dieth, the Priest compasseth the Corps with a
string of beads, made of <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> praying God to
have mercy on him; then the Priests carry it into the
Garden, wash it, and cover it with its own garments,
with flowers also and persumes, and his Turband is
set on his head. Women perform this office to the
body of a woman. This done, the body is carried to
the Temple with the head forwards, and set down at
the Church-door, whilst the Priests are performing
their service; then it is carried to the burial-place
without the City: the Priests pray for his soul, are paid
for their pains, and feasted at home. Some part of
their good cheer is set on the grave, for the soul to feed
on, or for alms to the poor. They believe there are
two Angels, who with angry looks, and flaming fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands,
examine the dead party of his former life,
whom they whip with fiery torches if he be wicked;
if good, they comfort him, and defend his body in the
grave till the day of judgment; but the bodies of the
wicked are knocked down nine fathoms under ground,
and tormented by their angry Angels, the one knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with an hammer, the other tearing him with an
hook, till the last day; against this torment the <hi>Turks</hi>
use to pray at the graves of the dead. The women
there do not accompany the dead to the grave, but
stay at home weeping, and preparing good cheer for
the Priests and others of the departed mans friends.
They believe that when the Corps hath been in the
grave on quarter of an hour, that a new spirit is put
into it, is set upon its knees, and is examined by the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97888:104"/>
foresaid Angels of his faith and works. They believe
also that it is a work of charity, and conducible to the
soul of the defunct,<note place="margin">See <hi>Menavino, Bellonius,</hi> &amp;c.</note> if the birds, beasts, or ants be fed
with the meat which they set on the graves of the

                     <hi>Q.</hi> How far hath this <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Superstition got foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the world?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Though it be not so far extended as Gentilisme,<note place="margin">Their Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how far spread.</note>
yet it hath over-reached Christianity; not in <hi>Europe,</hi>
where Christianity prevaileth, but in <hi>Africa</hi> where it
hath thrust out the ancient Christian Churches, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the Half-Moon in flead of the Crosse, except it be
among the <hi>Abyssins,</hi> and some small places held by the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Portugal:</hi> But in <hi>Asia</hi> it hath got deeper foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
having over-run <hi>Arabia, Turkie, Persia,</hi> some part
of <hi>Mogols</hi> countrey, and <hi>Tartaria,</hi> onely here and there
some smal Congregations of Christians are to be found.
In <hi>America</hi> indeed it is not as yet known. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why this Superstition is so far spread, are these. 1.
The continual jars, frivolous debates, and needless dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladiations
about questions of Religion among Christians,
which hath made the world doubt of the truth thereof,
and takes away the end and scope of Religion, which is
to unite mens affections; but the remedy is become the
disease, and that which should cure us, woundeth us.
2. The wicked and scandalous lives both of Christian
Laity and Clergy: for the Mahumetans generally are
more devour in their religious duties, and more just in
their dealings. 3. The Mahumetan Conquests have in
those parts propagated their Superstition. 4. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is more pleasing to the sense then Christianity;
for men are more affected with sensitive pleasures,
which <hi>Mahomet</hi> proffers in his Paradise, then with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
which are lesse known, and therefore lesse desired.
5. The greatnesse of the <hi>Turkish</hi> tyranny over Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
the rewards and honours they give to those that
will turn <hi>Muselmen,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> are great induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for weak spirits to embrace that religion; for a
Christian Runegado that will receive circumcision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, is carried about the streets with great joy
and solemnity, is presented with many gifts, and made
free from all taxes; for which very cause, many, both
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97888:105"/>
                     <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Albanians,</hi> have received circumcision. 6.
The liberty which is permitted to multiply wives, must
needs be pleasing to carnal-minded men. 7. They
permit no man to dispute of their <hi>Alcoran;</hi> to call any
point of their religion in question; to sell the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
to strangers, or to translate it into other languages: It
is death to offend in any of these, which is the cause of
much quietnesse and concord among them. 8. They
inhibit the profession of Philosophy among them, and
so they keep the people in darknesse and ignorance, not
suffering the light to appear and to detect their errors.
9. They teach, that all who live a good life shall be
saved, whatsoever his religion be; this makes many
weak Christians revolt from their holy faith without
scruple or check of conscience; for what care they,
whether they serve <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Mahomet,</hi> so they be saved?
10. They hold, that after a certain time of torments in
Hell, the wicked shall be released from thence; this
doctrine is more pleasing to wicked men then Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
which admits of no redemption from Hell, nor
any mitigation of eternal torments. 11. Men are
much taken with moral outsides, whereby the Turks
exceed Christians; for they are more modest in their
conversation generally then we; men and women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
not together promiscuously, as among us; they
are lesse sumptuous in their buildings; lesse excessive
and phantastical in their clothes; more sparing in their
dyet, and altogether abstemious; more devout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
in their Churches, so that they will not suffer
a piece of paper to be trod upon, or lie on the ground,
but will take it up, kisse it, and lay it in some place out
of danger; and this is, because the name of God and
<hi>Mahomets</hi> Law is written upon paper; they are also
more sober in their speeches and gesture, and more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to their Superiors then we are. 12. There is
nothing more pleasing to our nature then private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
which by Christs Law is prohibited, but by
the Mahumetan Law is allowed; for they are to hate,
and to kill their enemy, if they can. 13, <hi>Arianism</hi> had
infected most of the Eastern Churches; therefore it
was no wonder if they received <hi>Mahomets</hi> Doctrine,
which was grounded upon <hi>Arius</hi> his Heresie. 14. They
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97888:105"/>
suffer no man to blaspheme Christ, but honour him, and
speak reverently of him; so they do of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
which makes that neither <hi>Iews</hi> nor <hi>Christians</hi> are
in those parts much averse from, or violent against
their Religion. 15. They have been alwayes very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and diligent in gaining Proselytes, and yet force
no man. For these, and such like reasons, let us not
wonder at the great encrease of Mahumetanisme in the
world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Of what continuance is Mahumetanisme?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. Mahomet</hi> was born in the year of Christ, 592. in
the time of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope, and <hi>Mauritius</hi> the
Emperour:<note place="margin">Mahumetanism, of what conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</note> according to <hi>Genebrard</hi> he lived 63. years, of
which he spent 23. years in spreading of his doctrine,
then died in the year of our Lord 655. <hi>Constance</hi> being
Emperour, and <hi>Eugenius</hi> the first Pope; So that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetanisme
hath lasted already above 1000. years, to
the great oppression and vexation of the Church of
Christ, and to the eternal dishonour of Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who if they had spent but the tenth part of that
blood against the Turks, which they have shamefully
and sinfully shed in their own private quarrels, there
had not been at this day any remainder of that damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sect, which hath longer continued a scourge to the
Church of Christ, then ever any enemy did against Gods
people of old. For the <hi>Egyptians</hi> oppressed the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
scarce 200. years; the <hi>Canaanites</hi> 20. years; the

and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> from the first to the last, did not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ex &amp; oppress Gods people above 300. years; afterward
they were oppressed by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> 40 years;
the Christian Church from <hi>Nero</hi> till <hi>Constantine</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
about 260. years; and afterward by the <hi>Goths</hi>
and <hi>Lombards</hi> nere 300. years. But this oppression of
the Church by <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath, as I said, lasted above a
thousand years. The reasons are divers as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the former question, to which may be added
these. 1. By this long persecution and tyranny of the
Turks, God will try and exercise the faith, patience,
constancy, and other vertues of his people, which
would corrupt and purrifie like standing water, or <hi>Moab</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tled upon the Lees, not being poured from vessel to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97888:106"/>
vessel. How can the courage of a Souldier be known
but in a skirmish? or the skill of a Mariner, but in a
storm; <hi>Marcet sine adversario virtus;</hi> that tree, saith Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,
is most strongly rooted in the ground, which is
most shaken with the wind. <hi>Nulla est a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or fortis &amp; soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
nisi in quam venti saepius incursant, ipsa enim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>exatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
constringitur, &amp; adices certius figit.</hi> 2. God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to continue this tyranny and power of the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
to the end that Christian Princes may love
each other, and stick close together against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemy; that their military discipline might be
exercised abroad, and not at home: For this cause
the wisest of the Romans were against the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Carthage;</hi> fearing least the Romans wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an enemy abroad, should exercise their swords
against themselves; which fell out accordingly. For
the same cause God would not utterly destroy the
<hi>Philistines, Ammonites, Moabites,</hi> and other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
enemies of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> But such is the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christians, that though we have so potent
an enemy close at our doores, ready to devour us,
yet wee are content to sheath that sword into our
owne bowels, which we should imploy against
the common foe. 3. God will have this sword of
Mahumetanisme to hang over our heads, and this
scourge to be still in our eyes, that thereby wee may
be kept the more in awe and obedience; that if at any
time we start aside like a broken bow, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
againe in time, considering God hath this
whip ready and at hand to correct us. Thus God
lest the Canaanites among the Jewes, to be pricks
in their eyes, and goads in their sides. <hi>I will not</hi>
(saith the Lord) <hi>drive out any from before them of the
Nations which</hi> Joshua <hi>left when he died; that through
them I might prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of
the Lord to walk tberein, &amp;c. therefore the Lord left these
nations without driving them out hastily.</hi> See <hi>Iudg. 2. 21,
22.</hi> &amp; 3. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. 4. God is content to continue
this Mahumetan Sect so long, because justice is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
among them, without which a State or Kingdome
can no more stand then a tree without a root, or an
house without a foundation; they are also zealous and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97888:106"/>
devout in their way; and great enemies to Idolatry, so
that they will permit no images to be painted or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among them, knowing that God is not offended so
much against any sin as against idolatry, which is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
adultery, most destructive of that matrimonial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juction
between God and us. 5. The Lord by the long
continuance of Mahumetanism, will punish the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and wickednesse of the Greek Emperours, as
likewise the multitude of heresies and schisms hatched
in that Church. 6. This Sect of Mahumeranism is so
made up of Christianism, Judaism and Gentilism, that
it abates the edge of any of these nations, from any ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
desire of its extirpation.</p>

at length sealed it with his blood; and so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
suffered death for our sins, and rose again for our

Apostles behind him to propagate this doctrine through
the world, which they did accordingly, confirming
their words with miracles, and their own blood; and
so this light of the Gospel scattered all the fogs and
mists of Gentile superstition; at the sight of this
Ark of the new Covenant, the Dagon of idolatry fell
to the ground: when this Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi>
did roar, all the beasts of the forrest, that is, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

down with earthquake and thunder, when <hi>Iulian</hi> sent

power of the two-edged sword which came out of
Christs mouth, that nothing was able to withstand it.

the Wolves. The watch-men being inebriated with
honour, wealth, ease, and security, fall asleep on the

was not then the weaknesse of Christian Religion that
was the cause of <hi>Mahomets</hi> prevailing; for the heat of
the Sun is not weak, though it cannot soften the clay;
not is the good seed that is cast into barren ground,

it doth not alwayes edifie. All the water in the Sea

Persecution was the Arrow that did flie by day; but
Heresie the Pestilence that raged in the darknesse.
Persecution was the Pruning knife that lopped the
branches of Religion, but Heresie the Axe laid to the
root of the tree. Persecution was the Dragon that
drove the woman into the wildernesse, but Heresie the
beast that spake blasphemies. Open Persecution began
in <hi>Nero</hi> a Tyrant, but Heresie in <hi>Simon</hi> a Witch. Open
Persecution began about 66 yeers after Christs Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but heresie immediatly after Christs departure,
about the sixth yeere, in the beginning of <hi>Caligula's</hi>

Religion, and what were his opinions?</p>
                  <p>A. <hi>Simon</hi> called <hi>Magus,</hi> because he was a Witch;
a <hi>Samaritan</hi> by birth,<note place="margin">Hereticks and Heresies, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi>
                     </note> and a Christian by profession; he
would have bought the gifts of the Holy Ghost for
mony, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 13. He denyed the Trinity, and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe to be the true God. He taught that the
world was made by the Angels, not by God. And
that Christ came not into the world, nor did he truly
suffer. He denyed also the Resurrection of the flesh,
and permitted promiscuous marriages. He likewise
affirmed that the true God was never known to the
Patriarchs and Prophets. This point was afterward
maintained by <hi>Menander,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Menander, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninus, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silides.</note> 
                     <hi>Cerinthus, Nicholas, Saturninus,</hi>
and <hi>Basilides</hi> succeeding Hereticks. Upon this Doctrine
also the <hi>Tertullianists,</hi> and <hi>Anthropomorphits</hi> grounded
their Heresie, in ascribing a humane body to God. His
denying of the Trinity, begot afterward the <hi>Sabellians,
Samosatenians, Montanists, Praxians, Photinians,</hi> and
<hi>Priscillianists.</hi> His Heresie of the Creation of the world
by Angels, begot the <hi>Marcionites, Manichees,</hi> and the
<hi>Angelick</hi> hereticks, who worshipped <hi>Angels.</hi> In saying
that Christ came not, nor suffered, he gave occasion to
the Heresies of <hi>Valentinians, Cerdonians, Marcionites,
Aphthardocites, Docits, Samosatenians,</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans.</hi>
Upon his denyal of the Resurrection, <hi>Basilides, Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Carpocrates, Apelles,</hi> and the <hi>Hierarchits,</hi> grounded
their Heresies. Besides, <hi>Epicurism, Libertinism,</hi> and
<hi>Atheism</hi> got vigour hereby. By permitting licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and promiscuous copulation, he gave occasion to
the <hi>Basilidians, Gnosticks, Manichees, Acatians, Eunomians,</hi>
and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> to live like beasts,<note place="margin">See <hi>Austin, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> upon this subject, in their Books they wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Heresies.</note> and to slight <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi>
Besides these impious opinions, he held Magick
and Idolatry lawful. He gave to the Angels barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
names. He slighted the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as being
not from God; and blasphemously denyed the Holy
Ghost to be a substance, but a bare vertue or operation,
and caused his Disciples to worship his whore <hi>Helena,</hi>
or <hi>Selene,</hi> for a goddesse.</p>
                  <p>Q. 5. Why did Simon Magus &amp; his scholars, with many other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
since him, besides Iews &amp; Mahumetans deny the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>A. Partly the malice of Satan who hates and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97888:109"/>
the truth, partly the pride of Hereticks who
would seem wiser then the Church,<note place="margin">Trinity denied by <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> and his Scholars, with others besides Iewes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans, and why.</note> partly their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
because by naturall reason they cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this ineffable mystery, and partly malice against
Christ, whose Divinity is denyed by Jewes and Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans;
bred this Heresie: notwithstanding the truth
is plainly set down both in the old and new Testament,
asserted by all the Greek and Latin Fathers, confirmed
by all Generall councills, and proved by all Orthodox
Divines that it is no more repugnant to naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghost to be one
God, then for the soul, mind, and body to be one man;
but because this Doctrin is sufficiently proved by all
Divines both ancient and moderne, and all objections
to the contrary answered and refuted, I will forbeare
to set down what is so plain and obvious, already
handled by so many Pens, and will onely shew that
the Doctrin of the Trinity was not unknown even by
the light of nature to the Gentile Philosophers, Poets
and Sibylls. <hi>Zoroastres</hi> speaketh of the Father, <hi>who
having perfected all things hath delivered them to the second
Mind, which Mind</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath received from the
Father knowledge and power.</hi> Here is a plain testimony
of the first and second person. Concerning the third,
he saith <hi>that the Divine love proceeded from the Mind or
Intellect,</hi> what else is this Divine love but the Holy Ghost?
The <hi>Chaldaean Magi,</hi> which were their Philosophers,
acknowledged three beginnings, to wit <hi>Ormases, Mitris,</hi>
and <hi>Ariminis,</hi> that is God, the Mind, and soul, <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Trismegistus</hi> taught his <hi>Egyptians that God who is life
and light begot the</hi> Word, <hi>who is the other</hi> Intellect, <hi>and
maker of all things, and together with him another who is
the</hi> firie <hi>God, or</hi> Spirit; here the three persons are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
named. He sheweth also <hi>that the subtil intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Spirit by the power of God did move in the Chaos;</hi>
this is consonant to the words of <hi>Moses, the spirit of
God moved on the waters. Orpheus</hi> singeth the praises <hi>of
the Great God, and of his word which he first uttered.
Pythagoras</hi> and his Schollars were not ignorant of this
Mystrey, when they placed all perfection in the number
of three, and made love the Original of all things.
<hi>Zeno</hi> the <hi>Stoick</hi> confesseth <hi>that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Word is God,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97888:110"/>
and the Spirit of Iove. Socrates</hi> acknowledgeth <hi>God to be
the</hi> Minde <hi>or</hi> Intellect, <hi>that the Essence of God is his</hi> Idea,
<hi>which he begets by the knowledge of himself, and by which he
made the World. Numenius</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean, Plotinus,
Iamblichus</hi> and others do write very plainly of the
three <hi>Hypostases</hi> or Persons in the Trinity, so that no
Christian can write more fully, as may be seen in their
own words, as they are alleadged by <hi>Du-Plessis</hi> in his
Book of the truth of Christian Religion; who citeth
also certain Oracles of <hi>Serapis</hi> the Egyptian chiefe Idol
or Devil; and of <hi>Apollo</hi> out of <hi>Suidns,</hi> by which we
may see how the evil Spirits are forced to confesse the
Trinity. I could also alledge the testimonies of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bills</hi>
to the same purpose; but because I study brevity,
and these heathen testimonies and Sibyllin verses, are
cited by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Origin</hi> against <hi>Celsus, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi>
against <hi>Iulian, Eusebius</hi> in his preparation, Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
in his bookes of the City, &amp;c. I forbear to insist
any more on this subject. And as the Gentiles gave te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
to this plurality of persons, so did the Jewes
also, though now they reject this doctrine, thinking
that we by worshipping the Trinity, do worship three
Gods; but their ancient Rabbins do prove the Trinity
out of the Old Testament, as <hi>Rabbi Simeon,</hi> the Sonne
of <hi>Iohai</hi> brings a place out of <hi>Rabbi Ibba</hi> upon <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy

                     <hi>Iehovah Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henu
Iehovah Echad.</hi> He shewes that the first <hi>Iehovah</hi> is
God the Father; the second word <hi>Elohenu</hi> our God is
God the Son; for so he is called by the Propher, and
Evangelist, <hi>Emanuel, God with us.</hi> The third word <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi>
is God the holy Ghost. And the fourth word
<hi>Echad,</hi> that is <hi>One,</hi> is to shew the Unity of Essence in
this plurality of persons. Many other passages I could
alleadge out of the writings of the ancient Rabbies to
confirme this truth; but this is already performed by
<hi>Galatinus</hi> in his books <hi>de arcanis catholicae veritatis.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A. 6. Menander</hi> a Samaritan also, and a Magician. He
flourished at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of <hi>Titus</hi> about 49. years
afser Christ. He held the same impious opinions that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97888:110"/>
                     <hi>Simon</hi> did; but differed from him in saying that himself
and not <hi>Simon,</hi> was the Saviour of the world; and that
therefore all should be baptized in his name, and not in
the name of <hi>Simon</hi> or Christ, and that all such should in
power excel the Angels, and should live immortally
here; so he denied the Resurrection of the flesh. To
him succeeded <hi>Saturninus</hi> and his fellow Scholar <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides,</hi>
about the fifteenth year of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour,
and after Christ the hundreth. <hi>Saturninus</hi> was of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and infected <hi>Syria</hi> with his poyson, as <hi>Basilides</hi>
did <hi>Egypt. Saturninus</hi> held the same impieties with <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
and <hi>Menander,</hi> but differed from them in saying that
the world was made onely by seven Angels, and not
by all, against the Will and Knowledge of God. He
taught also that some men were naturally good, and
some naturally evil; and that nothing must be eat that
hath life in it, which was the Doctrine afterward of
the <hi>Manichees.</hi> And impiously affirmed that some of
the antient Holy Prophets spake, and were sent by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
<hi>Basilides</hi> also was a <hi>Simonian</hi> Heretick, but differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him in holding there were so many Heavens as
dayes in the year, to wit 365. the chiefe god he called
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, in the letters of which name are contained
365. He held also that this inferiour world and man
was created by the 365th or last Heaven. He taught
also that the superiour god <hi>Abraxas</hi> begot the <hi>Minde,</hi>
this the <hi>Word:</hi> Of the <hi>Word</hi> came <hi>Providence,</hi> and of
<hi>Providence Wisedome:</hi> Of <hi>Wisdom</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> were begot,
the last of which was the God of the Jewes, whom he
calls an ambitious and a turbulent God, who had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temped
to bring all Nations in subiection to his people.
He said that Christ was sent by <hi>Abraxas</hi> to oppose the
turbulent God of the Jewes, and doth not call him
<hi>Iesus</hi> and Saviour, but <hi>Goal</hi> a Redeemer. He held it
unlawful to suffer Martyrdom for Christ; He permitted
Idolatry,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and taught that no voluntary sin was pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and that Faith was not the gift of God, but of
Nature, as also election. The other errours which this

Wives in common. They made no scruple of eating
things offered to Idols. At their meetings or love
Feasts, they used to put out the lights, and commit
promiscuous adulteries with each others wise. They
taught that the world was made by the copulation

which they named Christ. They held that
most things were procreated of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and the <hi>Abysse</hi>
of water and darknesse. They taught also that in
faithful men were two souls, one holy, of the divine
substance, the other adventitious by divine insufflation,
common to man and beasts. These are the souls that
sin, and which passe from man to beast, after the
opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> they held also there were two

an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Antoninus
Pius</hi> Emperor, about a 110 yeers after Christ. He
taught that there were 30 <hi>Aeones,</hi> Ages, or Worlds,
who had their beginning from <hi>Profundity</hi> and <hi>Silence;</hi>
that being the Male, this the Female. Of the Marriage
or Copulation of these two, were begot <hi>Vnderstanding</hi>
and <hi>Truth,</hi> who brought forth eight <hi>Aeones.</hi> Of the
<hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> were begot the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi>
which produced 10. <hi>Aeones.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Life</hi>
brought forth <hi>Man</hi> and the Church, and of these were

produced the Heaven, Earth, and Sea. Out of his
imperfections were procreated divers evils, as darkness
out of his fear, evil spirits out of his ignorance, out of
his tears springs and rivers; and out of his laughter
light. They also taught that Christs body was meerly
spiritual, and passed through the Virgin, as through a
conduit or pipe. Evil was natural (they said) to the
creature, and therefore they made God the author of
evil, which afterward was the doctrine of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees.</hi>
They held that onely the soul was redeemed,
and that there should be no resurrection of the body.
Faith (they taught) was natural, and consequently sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which all did not attain for want of good
works; this was the <hi>Pelagian</hi> doctrine afterward.
They made three sorts of men; to wit, spiritual, who
were saved by faith onely: these they called the sons
of <hi>Seth;</hi> hence the <hi>Sethian</hi> Hereticks. The second sort
are animal, or natural, who are saved by works, and
are of <hi>Abel;</hi> hence the <hi>Abelites.</hi> The third sort are
carnal, who cannot be saved; these are of <hi>Cain;</hi> hence
the <hi>Cainite</hi> Hereticks. They eat of things offered to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols;
slighted good works as needlesse, and rejected
the old Prophets. <hi>Valentinus</hi> his chiefe Scholar and
Successor was <hi>Secundus,</hi> whose Disciples called <hi>Secundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Secundians.</note>
changed the name, but retained the Doctrine of
<hi>Valentinus,</hi> permitting all kind of vicious life, in that
they held knowledge without good works would
bring men to Heaven. <hi>Valentinus</hi> held that the <hi>Aeones</hi>
were only the effects of the divine minde; but <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>

he in the form of a Serpent entred the Virgins Womb.
In the Eucharist they used to produce a Serpent by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting

Heretick,<note place="margin">Cerdon.</note> under <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> Emperor 110 yeers
after Christ; he taught that there were two contrary
gods; the one a god of mercy and pitty, the other of
justice and severity, whom he called evil, cruel, and
the maker of the world. The former God he called
good, and the Father of Christ, and author of the
Gospel; but <hi>Moses</hi> Law they rejected and the old
Testament, as proceeding from the other god, to wit,
of justice. The <hi>Cerdonians</hi> also denyed the Resurrection
of the flesh and Humanity of Christ; Affirming that he
was not born of a Virgin, nor suffered but in shew.
<hi>Marcion,</hi>

the Orthodox Religion, out of spleen because his Father
Bishop <hi>Marcion</hi> excommunicated him for Whoredom,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97888:114"/>
and because he could not without true repentance be
received again into the Church; therefore he professed
and maintained <hi>Cerdons</hi> Heresies at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time
of <hi>M. Antoninus Philosophus,</hi> 133. years after Christ, but
he refined some points, and added to them some of his
own phansies. With <hi>Cerdon</hi> he held two contrary gods,
and denied Christs Incarnation of the Virgin, and
therefore blotted his Genealogy out of the Gospel,
affirming his body to be from heaven, not from the
Virgin. He denied that this world, by reason of the
Ataxie and Disorder in it, could be the work of the
good god. He rejected the Old Testament and the
Law, as repugnant to the Gospel; <hi>which is false, for their
is no repugnancy.</hi> He denied the Resurrection, and
taught that Christ by descending into hell, delivered
from thence the souls of <hi>Cain, Esau,</hi> the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and
other reprobates, translating them into heaven. He
condemned the eating of flesh, and the married life;
and renewed baptism upon every grievous fall into sin.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A. Paulus Samosatenus</hi> was so called from <hi>Samosata,</hi>

were called <hi>Paulinians</hi> and <hi>Samosatenians,</hi> and afterward
<hi>Photinians, Lucians,</hi> and <hi>Marcellians,</hi> from these new
teachers. Their beleef was, that Christ was meerly
man, and had no being till his incarnation. This
Heresie was taught 60. years before <hi>Samosatenus,</hi> by
<hi>Artemon,</hi> and was propagated afterward by <hi>Photinus,
Lucian,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus, Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet.</hi> They
held that the Godhead dwelt not in Christ bodily, but
as in the Prophets of old, by grace and efficacy, and
that he was onely the external, not the internal word
of God. Therefore they did not baptize in his name;
for which cause the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> rejected their

<hi>Canstantius</hi> the Emperor; and before him, <hi>Marcellus</hi>

the sink of almost all the former heresies, for from the
<hi>Marcionites</hi> they derived their opinion of two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
or gods, one good, the other bad. With the
<hi>Encratites</hi> they condemned the eating of flesh, egges,
and milk; they held also with the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi>
that God had members, and that he was substantially
in every thing, though never so base, as dung and dirt,
but was separated from them by Christs comming, and
by the Elect, <hi>Manichea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Earth, whose intestins had in them a cleansing and
separating vertue. They condemned also the use of
wine, as being the gall of the Princes of darknesse.
With <hi>Marcion</hi> also they rejected the Old Testament, and
currilated the New, by excluding Christs Genealogies;
and said, that he who gave the Law, was not the true
God. They babled also, that there was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
between the Princes of darknesse, and of light; in
which, they who held for God, were taken captives,
for whose redemption God laboureth still. With the
<hi>Ophites</hi> they held that Christ was the Serpent which
deceived our first Parents; and with divers of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Hereticks, not onely did they deny Christs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
but his Humanity also; affirming that he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
himself to suffer, die, and rise again; and that it
was the Devil who truly was crucified. With <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi>
they taught that Christs body was fixed to the
Stars, and that he redeemed only our souls, not our
bodies; With the former Hereticks, they denyed the
Resurrection, and with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> held transanimation.
With <hi>Montanus, Manes</hi> held that he was the true <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Idols. With <hi>Anaxago<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be ships; and taught that one <hi>Schacla</hi> made <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve.</hi> They make no scruple to swear by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
they give to every man two contrary souls,
which still struggle in him. With the Poets they held
that the heaven was supported by the shoulders of one
whom they called <hi>Laturanius.</hi> They make the soul of
man, and of a tree, the same in essence, as being both
of them a part of God; with the former hereticks also
they condemned marriage, and permitted promiscuous
copulation; and that not for procreation, but for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
They rejected baptisme as needlesse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
alms-giving,<note place="margin">

the efficacy of the Sacraments to depend upon the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Minister, and not on the Spirit of God;
they rebaptized also the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Christians as if their

kill themselves rather then to fall into the hands of the
Magistrate; and so they made no scruple to kill others
that were not of their faith, when they found any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
They used certarn magical purifications,
and bragged much of Enthusiasms and Revelations.
They also with the <hi>Arrians</hi> made the Son lesse then the
Father, and the Holy Ghost then the Son. This here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
was divided into divers schismes, the chief whereof
were the <hi>Circumcellions</hi> so called from their Cells and
Cottages in which they lived, to shew their austerity;
these made no bones to murther all they met, that
were not of their Religion, so that they were more
dangerous then High-way Robbers. The <hi>Donatists</hi>
were named also <hi>Parmenianists</hi> from <hi>Parmenianus</hi> one
of <hi>Donatus</hi> his disciples. At <hi>Rome,</hi> they were named
<hi>Campates</hi> from the Camp, or Field, and <hi>Montenses</hi> from

like a canker it run through all the West: his heresie
was made up of former heresies; for with the <hi>Manicnes</hi>
he held that the world was made by an evil god.
With the <hi>Sabellians</hi> he confounded the persons of the
<hi>Trinity;</hi> with the <hi>Origenists,</hi> he taught that mens souls
were made before their bodies in some receptacle of
Heaven; and with the <hi>Manichees,</hi> that they were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of the Divine Essence. With Astrologers they
held that all humane events depended on the Stars;
and with the <hi>Stoicks</hi> that we sin necessarily, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actively.
With the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> they condemned marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
with the <hi>Encratites,</hi> the eating of flesh; with the

Christ. They were named also <hi>Caelestiani</hi> from <hi>Caelestius</hi>
one of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his scholars. These taught that death
was not the wages of sin, but that <hi>Adam</hi> should have
died, though he had not sinned. That <hi>Adams</hi> sin was
hurtful onely to himselfe, and not to his posterity; that
concupiscence was no sin, that Infants did not draw
original sin from their Parents, that infants might be
saved without baptisme, that they should have life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
but out of the Kingdom of God; that man after
the fall had the free will to do good, and ascribed no
more to grace, but that by it we had our nature,
and that by our good works wee obtaine grace;
they rejected the Doctrine of predestination,<note place="margin">Praedestinati.</note> 
                     <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
because the Hereticks called</hi> Praedestinati, <hi>made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination

because nature inclined to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not to that. That

                  </p>
                  <p>A. These at first called themselves Apostolicall,<note place="margin">Anabaptists of Moravia.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did imitate the Apostles in going bare-foot,
and in washing one anothers feet, in having also all
things in common amongst them. But though this
custom be now, left, yet at this day in <hi>Moraviae</hi> they
have a common Steward who doth distribute equally
things necessary to all. They will admit none into
their Society, but such as have some trade, and by their
handy worke can get their livings. As they have a
common Steward for their temporals, so they have a
common Father for their spirituals, who instructs them
in their Religion and prayeth with them every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
before they goe abroad to worke. These pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
prayers, are to them instead of Sermons. They
have a generall governour or head of their church,
whom none knoweth, but themselves; for they are
bound not to reveal him. They communicate twice
in the year; the men and women sit promiscuously
together. On the Lords day they walk two and two
through the Towns and Villages, being clothed in
black, and having slaves in their hands. They are
much given to silence; at table for a quarter of an
houre before they eat, they sit and meditate covering
their faces with their hands: the like devotion they
shew after meat. All the while their governour stands
by, to observe their gesture, that if any thing be unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming,
he may tell them of it. When they come to
any place, they discourse of the last judgement, of the
eternall paines of hell, of the crueltie of Divels tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
mens bodies and souls; that so they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
simple people into their religion; then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them by shewing them a way to escape all those

                  <p>A. Besides the Anabaptists already mentioned; there
be <hi>Adiaphorists</hi> of which <hi>Melancthon</hi> is thought to be
author;<note place="margin">Sects sprung out of Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme.</note> these hold the customs and constitutions of
the church of Rome to be things indifferent, and that
they may be professed or not professed without
scruple. 2. <hi>Vbiquitaries.</hi> These hold that Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity

<q>But if Christs humanity be every where, then we must
deny the articles of his Resurrection, Ascention, and
comming again to judge the Quick and the dead; for
what needs there such motions if he be everywhere.</q> 3.
<hi>Majorists,</hi> so called from one <hi>George Maior</hi> one of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
disciples, who taught that no man, (nay not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants)
can be saved without good works. <q>But its
ridiculous to expect good works from Infants who
have not as yet the use of reason,</q> nor organs fit for ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
4. <hi>Osiandrists,</hi> so called from <hi>Andrew Osiander</hi> a
<hi>Lutheran,</hi> who taught that Christs body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
suffered, was corruptible, and died again, <q>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against Scripture saying that Christ being risen from
the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over him.</q> He taught also that we are not justified
by faith or works, but by the essential righteousnesse
of Christ dwelling in us. <q>But the essential righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christ, is the righteousnesse of his divinity,
<q>which is not communicable,</q> nor separable from him.
5. <hi>Augustinians</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> these taught that none
went to heaven or hell, till after the last judgement:
whereas Christ tells the contrary to the good thiefe,
<hi>this day thou shalt be with me in Paradise,</hi> and affirmeth
that the soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried by <hi>Angels</hi> into
Abrahams bosom, and <hi>Dives</hi> into hell. Wherefore
did Christ ascend to heaven but that we might be
where he is. They make also dormice or swallows
of mens souls, saying, that they sleep till the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
if Saint <hi>Steven</hi> when he was dying had known
this Doctrin, he would not have called upon the Lord
Jesus to receive his spirit.</q> The story also of <hi>Lazarus</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:97888:133"/>
and <hi>Dives</hi> doth overthrow this conceit. They say
also that Christs human nature is not as yet ascended
into heaven, which directly overthroweth our Creed in
<q>that article; as likewise, the Scriptures, and withall
the hope and comfort of a Christian.</q> 6. <hi>Stancarians</hi> so
called from one <hi>Francis Stancarus</hi> a <hi>Mantuan,</hi> who

saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> Besides no place, though never so remote

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. The sociable life, because the end of our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not to live apart,<note place="margin">Sociable life preferred to the solitary:</note> like wild beasts, but toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like men. 2. Because we are hound to help each
other, by Counsel, Instruction, Admonition, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to bear one anothers burthens, to comfort the
comfortlesse, to support the weak, to cloath the naked,
to seed the hungry: for as the Orator said, we are not
born for our selves, but our Parents, Country and
Friends challenge a share in us. 3. Because he that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
alone, as he sins against his creation, and humane
society, so he sins against himselfe, in that he debars
himselfe of those comforts and aid, both spiritual and
corporal, which he hath in a sociable life. 4. Because
God is more present with many, then with one. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Church, which he promiseth to be with till the end
of the world, and on which he hath bestowed the Spirit of
Truth, to conduct her into all Truth, and which he hath built
upon the Rock, so that Hell Gates shall not prevail against
her;</hi> his Church I say, is a congregation, and consisteth
not of one but of many; and Christ hath promised that
<hi>where two or three are gathered together in his name, he will
be in the midst of them.</hi> 5. Because God is better praised
and more honoured of many together, then by one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
therefore <hi>David will praise God, and declare his
name in the great Congregation.</hi> Christ will have <hi>our light
to shine before men, that they seeing our good works, may
glorifie our Father which is in heaven.</hi> This cannot be
done by him that lives amongst wild beasts in a Desart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
How can he honour God by the exercise of justice, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:97888:141"/>
charity, humility, and other vertues, chiefly of his
patience in suffering injuries, and of his obedience to
superiours? How shall he find out his own infirmities
and failings, seeing selfe-love is in every man, and no
man can so well pry into himselfe, as another; and <hi>the
heart of man is deceitful above all things?</hi> 6. And lastly
no man alone can be so secure from danger of enemies,
as when he is in company; and therefore <hi>Satan</hi> is more
ready to assault man by tentations when he is alone,
then when he is in the company and society of others.
So he set not upon Christ when he was in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but

rules; to wit, that they should live together in one

should remain three Monks, but should all eat in one
Hall. No man must be forbid to eat or fast; they must
sleep not lying on beds, but sitting in their chaires:
they must wear Goats skins, which they must never put
off but when they communicate; then they must come
only with their hood, with which their heads must be
covered when they eat, that they may not be seen to
eat; for in eating they must neither cast their eyes off
from the Table, nor must they speak. No stranger must
be admitted without three years trial.<note place="margin">

should not live any longer a sunder, but together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the mutual helps, comforts, instructions, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise

<hi>Augustine.</hi> Which of these two Orders was first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by that great light and Doctor of the Church, it

<hi>Rhetorick</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Millan;</hi> but by the
perswasion of <hi>Simplicianus,</hi> and reading the life of
<hi>Antony</hi> the Monk, he became a convert, and in a
Garden with his friend <hi>Alipius,</hi> as he was bewailing
his former life, he heard a voice accompanied with
the Musick of Children, saying to him, <hi>Tolle, lege, Tolle,
lege,</hi> that is, <hi>Take up and Read;</hi> looking about, and
seeing no body, he took this for a divine admonition,

After this having spent a few years in fasting, prayer,
and study in the holy Scripture, he was called to
<hi>Hippo</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> where he was at first Presbyter, and
then Bishop. He built a Monastery within the Church

other places. Now whereas Saint <hi>Austin</hi> was first
an <hi>Eremite</hi> and lived in the Desart, before he erected
a Collegiate life in <hi>Hippo,</hi> it is likely that the <hi>Eremites</hi>
of his Order are more ancient then his Monks or

Orders were instituted by him, as divers other Orders

therefore <hi>David</hi> wished that his Enemies might beg
their Bread, and sheweth that the children of the
righteous shall never be driven to beg. Besides, they
that are able to work, aud will not, but live upon the

voluntary poverty; because he confesseth,

read that he begged, or lived idlely; for he went
about preaching, working miracles, and doing good,

And so if the Monks would take pains in praying
and preaching, they needed not to be Mendicants;

Their chief Governour they called Father; in <hi>Syriack</hi>

and scrips of Goat skins. But in <hi>Egypt</hi> they wore

and <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> the Brothers did serve by turns
weekly; at the end of the week, the servant did
wash the feet of his Brothers, and so resigned up
his office to the next. In most places they observed
the third, sixth, and ninth hours for prayer; none
were admitted into the Monastery till they were

exhorting them to Mortification, Humility, Silence,

were punished with publike humiliation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,

punished with stripes, or expulsion: during their

Hair-trimmers. The Apostle reproves it in men;
therefore the Clergy by the Canons of Councils and
Decretals, are forbid to nourish their Hairs, but to
cut them; yet I do not finde that they used in those
times to shave, or were injoyned to do so, but rather
the contrary: therefore <hi>Optatus Milevitanus, L. Cont.
Parmen.</hi> reproves the <hi>Donatists</hi> for shaving the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Priests:</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, L. 3. Paedag.</hi>
c. II. saith that the Haires are to be clipt with
Scissors, not shaved with a Rasor. And the reason
why shaving was then prohibited among the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
was because it was used by the Gentile Priests
in honour of their Idols; for in the time of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians, were the Priests of <hi>Isis</hi> yet extant,
who used to shave their Heads: for this cause God
would not have the Jewish Priests to shave, seeing he
would not have them to be like the Idolatrous
Priests; nor would he have them to shave in Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 21. Now the reasons why Monks and
Clerks, were shaved among Christians, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the top of their Head, so that their hairs hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about their Ears, represented a Crown, were these.
1. To resemble the Crown of Thorns which Christ
wore. 2. To shew that Christs Priests are also spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Kings. 3. They shave off their Haires to shew
that they should lay aside all superfluities of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:97888:147"/>
flesh, and sinful lusts; but the Crown of the Head
must be bare, to shew that the minde must be free for
contemplation 4. their naked and bare Crowns were
to shew the nakednesse, purity, and simplicity of
their lives.<note place="margin">Con, Agath, can. 11: Tolet. 3. can. 12.</note> 5. To shew their repentance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;

from the Jewish <hi>Nazarites,</hi> who wore long Haire,
as <hi>Moses</hi> did Vaile, to shew that the mystery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption

that accompany long Haire. 8. To shew their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 14. Whence came the custome of shaving, or cutting
the hairs of head and beard among religious persons?</p>
                  <p>A. Some will have Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to be the first
Christian that was shaved on the crown,<note place="margin">Their shaving whence it came.</note> at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
by the Gentiles in derision. Others ascribe this
custome to <hi>Anicetus,</hi> who lived about 165. years
after Christ; but this is rejected by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Others
again will have the Fourth Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> about
the year of Christ 631. to enjoyn this shaving of the
crown; and in the council of <hi>Aquisgran, an Christi
816.</hi> the <hi>Monks</hi> are enjoyned to shave in <hi>Easter</hi> week.
But shaving of the Beard is not so ancient; for it
came in with the Doctrin of Transubstantiation,
taught by <hi>Peter Lombard, Anno</hi> 1160. and established
by <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. in the Council of <hi>Later<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n,</hi> in the year
1200. The reason of this shaving was, left any hairs
of the beard might touch the body or blood of
Christ; or least any crum of the bread, or drop of the
wine might fall upon, or stick to the beard. In the
time of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> about 400. yeares after Christ, it
was not the custome among <hi>Monks</hi> to cut their
beards; for he inveighs against the <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi>
for wearing long hairs like women, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:97888:148"/>
their beards, which also was the custome of the
<hi>Messalian</hi> Hereticks. But that this custome of cutting
the beard was not generally received by the Clergie,
appears in the <hi>French Story;</hi> for <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

the Church-men with a great sum of money to
redeem their beards which he threatned to cut: but
indeed the custome of shaving was used among the
Gentile Priests; for which reason God would not
have his Priests to shave, that they might not seem
to follow the wayes of Idolaters. The Egyptian
Priests, by shaving off all their haires, did signifie that
the Priests should be pure and cleane, and free from
all pollution. They used also in Mourning and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals

of Effeminatenesse; sometimes of Craft; sometimes

(as is said) of Slavery. But however it was
used among the Gentiles, it is expresly forbid to the
Jewes,<note place="margin">Lev. 19:</note> and threatned as a punishment. Yet among

                        </gap>, Eustochium,</hi> and others, who did professe
chastity, and contempt of the world, and an earnest
desire of heavenly things. This retired life they
undertook of their own accord, and not by force;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97888:149"/>
for every one is not capable of perpetual Virginity
nor were they tyed to it by vow: For the Apostle
saith, <hi>That if a Virgin marry, she sinneth not.</hi> Indeed
such Virgins as had dedicated themselves to God
and a single life, if afterward finding their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
to persevere, did marry, these marriages were
thought scandalous, yet lawful; <hi>For it is better to
marry then to burne;</hi> therefore they were not rescinded;
and the parties so marrying were evil reported of for
their inconstancy; for this cause pennance was in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

for any man to marry, or to sollicit a Nun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Donatists</hi> of his time defloured divers Nuns.
Such married couples were Excommunicated by the
Church, perpetually imprisoned, or pur to death,
by the Civill Magistrate, and the marriage absolutely
disanulled as incestuous. Before <hi>Censtantine's</hi> time,
I doe not read of any Monasteries or Nunneries
erected for Women, by reason of frequent persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the uncertain condition of Christians
then: But after that peace was established in the
Church, Houses were built for Virgins, but yet with
liberty to be elsewhere; for <hi>Eustochium</hi> the Virgin
lived with her own Parents, and so did the Virgin
<hi>Demetrias;</hi> and we finde in <hi>Cyprian, Hierom,</hi> and
<hi>Austin,</hi> that such Virgins had liberty to goe abroad,
to heare Sermons in the Church, and to receive the
Eucharist with the rest of Gods people; they were
enjoyned to be modest and frugall in their cloaths
and diet; not to converse with men; not to walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
not to bathe, except their hands and feet;
to fast and pray often; to be vailed; to abstain from
wine; to wash the Saints feet; not to be idle, but
either to sing, pray, hear, or be working with the
needle. And seeing hair was given to the woman
as an ornament and badge of distinction, and for
modesty; therefore Nunnes of old were not shaven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Q. 16. In what account are Monks, at this day in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They are of that high esteeme, that their
very garments are counted sacred, and that there is
power in them to cure diseases, to work miracles, to
drive away evil spirits, to further them towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
so that some Kings and Princes have desired
to dye in a <hi>Francisca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> Hood.<note place="margin">Monks, in what account at Rome at this day.</note> 2. They count this
the state of perfection, the Angelical life, the life that
<hi>Eliah</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist, Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
did embrace, and a life meritorious of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
3. Whereas in the beginning Monks were
altogether Lay-men, and not to meddle with
any other employment but what was proper to
their profession, to wit, prayer, fasting, virginity,
poverty, and obedience: now they are admitted
into, and priviledged with all Ecclesiastick Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
from the Doore-keeper even to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.
4. The married life, amongst many of
them, is accounted pollution, compared with the
Monasticall; <hi>Notwithstanding the Apostle tells us that
marriage is honourable, and Christ honoured it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with his presence and first miracle;</hi> and would be
born of a Virgin, but after shee was espoused to
a Husband. 5. Such is the respect they give to
this life, that they prefer it to all natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and duty between Parents and Children, to
which not onely are wee tyed by nature, but
also by speciall command from God. <hi>Hierome</hi>
commends <hi>Paula</hi> in her Epitaph for abando<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Brother, Kindred, and her owne Children, whose
teares shee slighted, preferring this kinde of life
to them all; but this preposterous zeale is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Council of <hi>Gangra, Can.</hi> 15. 6.
So likewise they prefer it to the mutuall duty
and stipulation that is betweene man and wife,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97888:150"/>
permitting, yea teaching that they may forsake each
other, and enter into a Monastery; which is to
<hi>put asunder those whom God hath joyned together;</hi> to
defraud one another of due benevolence, and
by this meanes occasion adultery. The Apostles
counsell is, <hi>that the married couple should not defraud
one another, except it be for a time, by consent, to give
themselves to prayer, seeing the man hath not power over
his own body, but the woman; and so the man hath power
over the woman.</hi> 7. They will not permit Monks
and Nunnes ever to marry, though they have not the
gift of continency, accounting all such marriages
Sacriledge; <hi>whereas</hi> the first Monks were left to
their owne freedome, and not constrained to stay
longer then their conveniences would permit: And
in the Primitive times of the Church, marriages
contracted after the vow of continency made,
were not dissolved, but held lawful; onely the
parties for their inconstancy were enjoyned pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and the man made incapable of Eccelesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
employment: Neither were their Monks forced
to vow chastity, seeing every one is not capable
thereof, and much mischiefe hath proceeded
from this constrained Vow: but men were left to
their owne freedome. Neither was it at that time
counted a more hainous sinne for a Monk to marry
a Nunne, then to keep a Concubine. 8. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

The Nunnes were consecrated either by the Bishop
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:97888:150"/>
or the Priest, and by them covered with a Vaile;
if the Abbatesse presumed to do this, she was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated:
Twenty five yeares of age was then
held a fit time for Virgins to be Vailed, but now
they may at twelve, or before; the dayes of the
yeare for receiving their Vaile, and Consecration,
were the Epiphany, Easter-eve, and the festival
dayes of the Apostles, except in case of death.
The Virgin to be consecrated was presented to the
Bishop in her Nunnes habit; then before the Altar
with Musick and burning Tapers, the Priest before
hee puts on her Vaile, thus saith, <hi>Behold Daughter,

                  <p>A. <hi>Benet</hi> may be called the founder and author
of all the Religious Orders that were in the West,<note place="margin">

for 666. years together, that is, till the times of
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Mendicants;</hi> so that there were
of <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks reckoned by <hi>Trithemius, L. 1.
c.</hi> 4. above Fifteen thousand Abbies; out of which
proceeded multitudes of <hi>Cardinals, Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, Abbots,</hi> and other eminent men, besides
<hi>Popes.</hi> The <hi>Gregorian</hi> Order was a branch of the
<hi>Benedictine. Gregory</hi> the great, afterward Pope, was
at first a Monk, who, after his fathers death, erected
on his own charges Six Monasteries in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
at <hi>Rome</hi> converted his Fathers house into a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
and dedicated it to Saint <hi>Andrew;</hi> to these
Monks he prescribed the rule of Saint <hi>Bennet,</hi> and
assigned to them a large dark or brown coloured
cloak to be worne, on which was woven a red
crosse in the brest; these did not shave their beards:
The Monks called <hi>Gerundinenses</hi> were after the Order

in <hi>Portugal</hi> about the year of Christ, 610.
He was warned in a dream to build a Monastery;
which he did, and had it ratified by the Pope. He
gave them a white Garment to wear,<note place="margin">Of these passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges see <hi>Platina, Francus</hi> in his Chronicles, <hi>Sabellicus, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterran, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius,</hi> &amp;c.</note> with his own
arms on the breast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereof; they were ordered to
wear four Ribbands, to wit, two red, and two green.
This order was erected under Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the
fourth. The rule which <hi>Bennet</hi> prescribed to his
Monks, was written out by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the great,
and confirmed by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Second.</p>
                  <p>Q. 20. What were the rules which St. <hi>Bennet</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to his Monks?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He first sheweth what the duty of the Abbot
is, namely to be careful of his charge, to be holy,
just, wise, and charitable in his deeds; and to be
powerful in his words,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Benedictines,</hi> their rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by Saint <hi>Benet.</hi>

to beware of partiality, and dissimulation, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of covetousnesse, and pride, not to do any thing of
himself without advice of the Covent; he enjoyneth
all to be obedient, silent, humble, to be watchful to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:97888:152"/>
prayer in the night; he prescribes what Psalms they
are to sing every day and night; and what Psalms in
their canonical hours. That <hi>Haleluia</hi> should be said
continually between Easter and Pentecost, that they
should praise God with <hi>David</hi> seven times a day; to
wit, in the morning, at the first, third, sixth, and
ninth hours; in the evening, and completory, and at
midnight. Particular Psalmes are appointed for each
of these canonical hours; that they must pray with
all reverence. That their be Deanes chosen in each
Monastery to ease the Abbot; That every Monk have
his own bed to sleep in, that a candle burn by them

likewise of the aged and children; That their be
chosen a weekly Reader, to read in time of refection;
That each man be content with a pound of bread
for a day: and that onely the sick be permitted to
eat flesh; That wine be drunk sparingly; That from
Easter to Pentecost the Brothers may have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
at the sixth hour, and their supper in the
evening; in the Summer let them fast every fourth
and sixth day in the week, till the ninth hour. The
other days let them dine at the sixth hour; From
the midist of <hi>September</hi> till Lent, let them have their
refection at the ninth hour; but in the Lent time at
the evening, so it be by day light; That after the

Completory there be no speaking at all; if any come
late to prayers, or to the table, he is to stand apart
by himself; and to be last served, and shortned in his
victuals; if any for some great offence be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
out of the Oratory, he shall make satisfaction
by prostrating himself before the Oratory; that they
shall not onely give themselves to prayer and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
at the appointed hours, but shall also labour
some part of the day with their hands, to keep them
from idlenesse; That they observe Lent with all
strictnesse; that they use strangers with all reverence
and cheerfulnesse, and that the Abbot salute them
with a holy kisse, and wash their feet; that none
receive letters or tokens from their Parents without
the Abbots leave; That the Abbot cloath his Monks
as he findeth the seasons of the year requireth; That
no Novice be admitted into the Monastery, without
sufficient trial of his constancy, and patience; That
if a Priest desireth to enter into a Monastery, he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himself to the Laws thereof; and that he have
the next place to the Abbot; That Noble men, who
offer their Children to God in the Monastery, swear
they will never give them any part of their Estate,
but that it be conferred on the Covent; That if a
stranger Monk desire to continue in the Monastery,
he be not denied, so his life be not scandalous; If
the Abbot desire to have a Priest or Deacon ordained,
let him choose one of his own Covent; That he shall
be Abbot whom the whole Covent, or the greater
and better part shall choose; That the Provost or
Praepositus be chosen by the Abbot to whom he must
be subject; That the Porter be an ancient and discreet
man, who may receive &amp; give answers, &amp; that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery

he must with reverence and submission
excuse his inability; if the Abbot urge it, he must
obey, and trust to Gods assistance; That in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
none presume to defend, or strike, or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

                     <hi>A.</hi> This was the first Monastery of the <hi>Benedictins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Monks of Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note>
where divers Rites were observed, which are not in
<hi>Bennets</hi> Rule. The chief are these. Fourteen dayes
before <hi>Easter</hi> all the Altars are stript of their orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and covered with black; the Images are
vailed; <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> is not sung. Three nights imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
before <hi>Easter</hi> the Night Service continueth till
the morning, and is joyned to the <hi>Mattins;</hi> no hells
are rung; the lights are put out; the Abbot washeth
the Monks feet. In the Parasceue late, a little bread
and water is taken. On <hi>Easter</hi> Eve in the night
time the Tapers are kindled. On <hi>Easter</hi> day, before
<hi>Masse,</hi> there is a Procession with Burning Tapers,
and Holy Water, the Priests singing and praying.
The two next dayes after, Crosses, Holy Water, and
Reliques are carried about with the Gospel, and
burning Tapers, with singing and saluting each other
with holy kisses, the Priests being in their rich Copes.
Six severall times in the yeare they enter into the
<hi>Refectory</hi> singing; namely, on <hi>Christmasse</hi> day; on the
<hi>Epiphany;</hi> on <hi>Palme Sunday;</hi> on the <hi>Holy Sabbath;</hi> on
<hi>Easter day;</hi> and the third day in <hi>Easter</hi> week. Every
Lords day they have 12. Lectures, and so many on
their chief Festivals, namely, <hi>Christs Nativity,</hi> the
<hi>Epiphany,</hi> the <hi>Purification of Mary,</hi> the two Martyrs,
<hi>Faustinus</hi> and <hi>Iuletta, S. Scholastica, S. Bennet, Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
day,</hi> the Festivals of the Apostles, <hi>S. Laurence,</hi>
S. <hi>Mary,</hi> S. <hi>German,</hi> S. <hi>Andrew;</hi> on these Eves they
fast, they doe not kneel, nor work; but on the lesser
Festivals they read but eight Lessons, and afterward
they work. Their meat and drink is measured to
them, according to the discretion of the Abbot.
When they receive new garments, which is about S.
<hi>Martins</hi> day, they march singing, with Tapers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in their hands, into the Vestry, or Wardrobe,
where this Gospel is read <hi>[Be not carefull what you
shall eat, nor what you shall drink; nor for your bodies,
with what they shall be cloathed]</hi> Then having prayed,
they lay down their old garments, and receive new.

What work soever they are about in the kitchin, or

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 24. What is the manner of electing their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Each Monastery is to chuse an Abbot from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves,<note place="margin">Abbots, how Elected.</note> either by generall consent, or of
the better part: If there be none among them fit for
that place, then they may chuse out of some other
Monastery; when he is chosen, it is not in their
power to depose him. If a Clergy-man be chosen
Abbot, he must leave off his former Function. Two
Abbots must not be chosen for one Monastery; nor
must one Abbot be over two Monasteries; they must
not meddle with secular affairs. If an Abbot do
not punish grievous enormities, he is to be sent
to another Covent, where he is to do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
but not in his own, because of the strict sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and obedience, by which the Monks are tyed
to their Abbots: If the Covent chuse an unfit man
for their Abbot, the Bishop of the Diocesse, with
the neighbouring Abbots, or the Prince of the
place, may depose him, and choose another. Now
Princes ordinarily choose such as they please, and
impose them upon the Monks; but the Abbot, when
he is chosen, must be consecrated by the Bishop of
the Diocesse, who hath power to visit the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
within his jurisdiction, and to correct what
is amisse. If the Abbot shall refuse to submit to the
Bishop, he is suspended from the Communion till he
repent. Neither must he alienate any thing that
belongs to the Covent without the Bishops consent;
if he do otherwise, he must be degraded, and the
things alienated restored again by the Bishops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:97888:155"/>
What is conferred by devout persons on the
Monastery, must not be converted by the Abbot to
his own particular use. No man must erect a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
without the Bishops consent; nor must the
Abbot travell into a forrein Country without leave
from his Diocesan, who must not do any thing that
may tend to the prejudice of the Monastery; which
if he doe, he is to be excommuncated; Neither must
he, without the consent of the other Abbots, depose
an Abbot, or alienate the things belonging to the
Monastery, for the Abbots offence. In case of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
the Abbot may appeal from the Bishop to the
Prince, or to a Counel; and some Abbots there are,
who, with their Monasteries, are onely subject to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Cassinum.</hi> The Monastery of S. <hi>Maximinus,</hi>
near <hi>Trevers,</hi> is subject onely to the Emperour in
temporals, and to the Pope in spirituals. Anciently
the Election of the Abbot was ratified by the
Emperour,<note place="margin">Of these pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages see <hi>Brus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> in his <hi>German</hi> Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries; <hi>Baleaus</hi> in his Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; <hi>Hospinian,</hi> and others.</note> or Prince, in whose Dominion the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
was; but afterwards the Pope extorted this
power from the Emperour, and drew all investitures
to himself; to whom the Abbots swear allegeance and
fealty. The Ceremony used by the Emperour in the
Abbots confirmation, was the delivering of a Staff
and Ferula into his hands, to put him in mind of his
Pastoral Office.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 26. What Laws were prescribed for Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries?</p>
                  <p>A. 1. That they should be built in such places,<note place="margin">Monasteries, and their Laws.</note>
where all conveniences may be had, that the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may not have occasion to gad abroad. 2. That
they may not, being once dedicated, be converted to
secular uses; but if the Monks live disorderly, they
may be thrust out, and Secular Canons be put in
their place. So likewise the houses of Secular
Canons may be converted into Monasteries. 3. That
in Synods or other publike meetings, the Abbot of
<hi>Cassinum</hi> take the place before all other Abbots, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the antiquitie and dignity of that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
being the Mother of all other Monasteries in
the West. 4. They were exempted from all civil
exactions, and Secular affairs, that they might the
more freely serve God. 5. Every Monastery was
permitted to have an Advocate, who was a Lawyer,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:97888:156"/>
to maintain the Priviledges, Lands and Revenues of
the Covent, for the ease of the Monks, who were
not to meddle with secular affaires; but the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
was to do nothing without the consent of the
Abbot and his Monks, nor they without him in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
businesse. 6. Most Monasteries were erected
not onely to be houses of devotion, but also Schools
of good learning; in which the learned languages
and liberal sciences were professed. For this cause
<hi>Oswald,</hi> King of the Angles, as <hi>Beda l. 3. c.</hi> 3. witness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in his History, gave large Possessions and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
for building of Monasteries, in which the youth
might be educated; and so <hi>Gregory</hi> the great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
divers Monasteries in <hi>England,</hi> for extirpating of
the Pelagian Heresie. <hi>Balaeus cen. 13. Maidulfus Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
the Philosopher erected the Monastery of <hi>Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
in which he set up a School for the Greek and
Latine tongue, where he read the Arts himself, as
<hi>Balaeus Cent. 14. c:</hi> 16. sheweth. For the same end
were the Monasteries of Saint <hi>Dennis</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> of Saint <hi>Gall,</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> of <hi>Trevers,</hi> and
many more erected; so were the Canons houses, neer
Cathedrals, built for this end, that youth might
there, as in Colledges and Schools, be targht and
educated; that from thence able Divines might be
sent abroad to preach the Gospel. Therefore the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
were enjoyned to maintain Professors of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to assign Prebendaries for their sustinance.
7. Though in the beginning Monks were Lay-men,
and lived not upon Tythes, but on their Lands and
Rents, or on their own labours, yet afterward when
they were admitted into the Priesthood, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to preach, and administer the Sacraments,
they were invested with Tythes, Oblations, first
Fruits, and other Ecclesiastical duties. <hi>Paschalis</hi>
the second, about the yeare of Christ 1100. or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that no Monks should pay Tythes of their
own labours. And afterward Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from paying of Tythes, the <hi>Cistertians,</hi>
Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Knights of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars.
8. Monasteries had the same priviledge
that Lords have over their Vassals, namely, to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:97888:156"/>
demand mortuaries, which was the chiefe horse
or other beast belonging to the party deceased.
9. Great men and Princes thought no prison so
sure as a Monastery; therefore the Greek Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
used to shut up in Moasteries their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Children, and potent Subjects whom they
suspected either of greatness or ambition. So
<hi>Ludovicus Pius</hi> was shut up in a Monastery by
his Sonne <hi>Ludovicus</hi> the second: divers other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
are extant upon Record. 10. Princes had
such a conceit of the sanctity of Monasteries, that
they thought they could not make sufficient satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to God for their sins, except they had
for some time shut themselves up in Monasteries.
11. The <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks by the rule of their
Founder, were not to eat flesh, except birds at
Christmas and Easter; yet they may drink Wine,
except in Lent: But children, aged, and sick
people were dispensed to eat flesh. 12. When
children by their Parents are shut up in Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
though afterwards, when they come to years
of discretion, they should desire to remove, yet
they may not, by the Lawes of the Covent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(say they) who are once dedicated to God,
may not returne to the world again: for this they
alledge the example of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being dedicated by <hi>Hannah</hi> his mother to the
service of God, persisted therein. But this was
not the custome of the first Monasteries, which
left men to their own liberty; and the Pope hath
power to dispense with monastical Vows; so he
did, when he dismissed out of the Monastery
<hi>Casimir</hi> of <hi>Polonia,</hi> whom the people chose for their
King; in memory whereof, the <hi>Polonians</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
by <hi>Clement</hi> 2. to shave their crownes like
Monks, and the Knights at certain Feastivals to wear
white Surplices, like Priests, in time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.<note place="margin">Fraternities.</note>
13. Of Monks and Lay-men were instituted
<hi>Fraternities.</hi> For many devout Seculars, not being
able to use the habit, or be subject to the rigid rule
of the Monks, were notwithstanding willing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of their prayers and merit of their order; so
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97888:157"/>
that at certain times they had their meetings for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of the poor, for prayers and publick supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in which they had their Processions in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
and their faces covered with linnen, whipping
their naked backs in figne of repentance. Of these

which <hi>Odo,</hi> was the first indeed, that revived

the custom of dipping the consecrated bread into the
Cup; which was used in case of necessity to children

                  </p>
                  <p>A. About the yeer of Christ 1030. according to
<hi>Sabellicus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Monks, or Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldulenses.</note> one <hi>Romualdus</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> perceiving how
the rule of <hi>Bennet</hi> was neglected, began to lay the
foundation of a new Order in the Field <hi>Camaldulum;</hi>
whence he gave the name of <hi>Camaldulenses</hi> to his
Monks. He erected, as we said before, a Monastery
upon the top of the <hi>Appenins;</hi> having obtained a
place from one <hi>Modulus,</hi> who dreamed he had seen
in his sleep Ladders, reaching from that place to
Heaven, on which he saw Mortals cloathed in white,
mounting upward; whereupon <hi>Romualdus</hi> procureth
the place, buildeth a Covent, and gave his Monks
white hoods to wear. He enjoynd them also to
silence, except in time of divine service; and yet
some, to keep their rule of silence the more strictly,
will not joyn with the rest, but pray by themselves:
two days every week they feed on bread and water,
which is their fast; and sit bare-footed on the ground.
About half a mile from thence are wooden crosses,
which women must not go beyond, under pain of
the Popes curse. The order of <hi>Vallis Vmbrosa,</hi> or the
<hi>Shadowy Valley,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Monks of the Shadowy Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</note> was instituted <hi>An.</hi> 1060. by one
<hi>Iohn Gualbert,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> as is said: this <hi>Iohn</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forgiven his enemy, who had killed his Brother,
(for which mercy shewed to his enemy, in a certain
Abby Church, whither he went for devotion, he was
thanked (so the story goeth) by a Crucifix there,
which bowed its head to him) resolved to renounce
the world, came to the Shadowy Vally, where there
were two Monks living. In that place he makes up
a like house of boards; but his fame grew so great,
that many both Clergy and Lay-men flock to him;
And the Lady of the soyle being Abbatesse, bestowed
the ground upon him, with other large possessions.
So he being made Abbot, by the consent of the Monks,
who were gathered together there, proposed Saint
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:97888:159"/>
                     <hi>Bennets</hi> rule to be observed; which he enlarged by
causing lights to burn still in the night, both in their
Chappel and Dormitory; and ordering that they
should wear no other cloth, but what they made of
the wooll of their own sheep.<note place="margin">

were so called from the voice that three
times uttered these words in <hi>Grandi Monte,</hi> that is,
in the <hi>Great Hill,</hi> where one <hi>Peter</hi> was advised by the
same voice to build his Monastery. This <hi>Peter</hi> was
disciple and successor to one <hi>Steven,</hi> who in the year
1076. erected this order in <hi>Gascony,</hi> where on the
Hill <hi>Muretum</hi> he built him a cottage, after he had
wandered through many desarts. He prescribes a
rule to his disciples, patched up of <hi>Bennets</hi> rule, and
of the Rites of the <hi>Canons Regular,</hi> of Saint <hi>Austins</hi>
Monks, and of his Eremites. He, as we said
before, wore on his naked body a Coat of Males, his
bed was a hard board, without either straw or cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid;
with often kneeling, kissing of the ground, and
beating it with his forehead and nose, he made his
hands and knees hard like a <hi>Callus,</hi> or Corn, and his
nose crooked. This order at first was ruled by a
Prior; afterward Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. gave them an Abbot.
The <hi>Carthusians</hi> or <hi>Charter</hi> Friers were instituted by
<hi>Bruno,</hi>

<hi>Paris,</hi> about the year of Christ 1080. upon this
occasion; being present at the singing of the office for
his fellow Professor now dead (a man highly reputed
for his holy life) the dead corps suddenly sitteth up
in the Beer, and crieth out <hi>[I am in Gods just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:97888:159"/>
condemned]</hi> these words it uttered three several
days: at which <hi>Bruno</hi> was so affrighted, that a man
held so pious, was damned; what would become of
himself and many more? therefore concluded there
was no safety for him, but by forsaking the world:
hereupon he with six of his scholars betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a hideous place for dark woods, high hills,
rocks, and wilde beasts, in the Province of <hi>Dolphinie</hi>
neer <hi>Grenoble;</hi> the place was called <hi>Carthusia,</hi> whence
his Monks took their name, and there built a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
having obtained the ground of <hi>Hugo,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> who also became a Monk of that order.
By their rule, these Monks should wear sack-cloth,
or a hair shirt next their skin, a long white cloth-coat
loose, with a hood, and a black cloak over, when
they walke abroad. The Lay-Brothers wear a short
coat to their knees. They eat no flesh at all, they
buy no fish, but eat them when offered; they eat
branny bread, and drink wine mingled with water.
On the Lords day, and fifth day of the week, they
feed onely upon cheese and egges. On the third day
or Saturday on pulse, or pot-herbs; on the second,
fourth, and sixth, upon bread and water onely.
Every one dresseth his own meat; they eat apart, and
but once a day. Yet on the chief Festivals of <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse,
Easter, Whitsuntide, Epiphany, Purification,</hi> the
twelve <hi>Apostles, Iohn</hi> Baptist, <hi>Michael, Martin,</hi> and <hi>all-Saints,</hi>
they eat twice a day, and together at one
Table, and then may talk together; at other times,
they must keep silence: every one hath his own cell,

1098. by one <hi>Robert</hi> Abbot of <hi>Molismenia,</hi> who, as we
have said, taking offence at the loose lives of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictines,</hi>
by the perswasion of <hi>Steven Harding</hi> an
Englishman, forsook that society; and being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with one and twenty other Monks, came to
<hi>Cistertium</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where they erected their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
Here they resolved to stick close to the rule
of Saint <hi>Bennet,</hi> and to cut off all the superfluities of
apparrel and dyer, introduced by the loose Monks of
that order: and because they did not find that Saint
<hi>Bennet</hi> ever possessed Churches, Altars, Oblations,
Tythes, and Sepultures, or that he had Mills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Farmes, or that he ever suffered Women to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Covent, or that he buried there any, except his
own Sister; therefore they meant to abandon all
these things, and to professe poverty with Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they would not suffer their Monks to meddle with
Husbandry, or any secular affairs; and with Saint
<hi>Bennet</hi> they ordered, that their Monastery should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
but of twelve Monks and an Abbot. They must
keep silence, except it be to the Abbot or Prior. If
any Monk run away from his Monastery, he must be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:97888:160"/>
forced back again by the Bishop. The <hi>Cistertiant</hi>
must be contented with two coats, and two hoods;
they must work with their hands, and observe strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their fasts; they must salute strangers by bowing
their head and body; and in imitation of Christ,
must wash their feet. No Fugitive is to be received
into the Covent, after the third time. The Abbots
Table must be furnished for strangers. This order
was confirmed by Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the second, <hi>An.</hi> 1100.
and came into <hi>England An.</hi> 1132. Their colour was
gray, whence in the beginning they were named
<hi>Grisei.</hi>

but that, as we said before, they wear a black
coat over a white cloak: Yet on festivals they wear
the <hi>Cistertian</hi> habit, to shew whence they came. The
<hi>Bernardines</hi> and <hi>Cistertians</hi> are not subject to Advocats
or Bishops. And Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, ordered
that if the Bishop refused to blesse the Abbot, he
may receive benediction from his own Monks. The

their succeeding Popes. They wear a plain coat,

They are distinguished into three ranks, to wit,
Priests or Chaplains. 2. Serving men. 3. Knights:
these last must be of noble extraction. When Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes fall at variance, these Knights must side
with neither, but stand neutrals, and endeavour to
reconcile them. Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> the fourth exempted
them from paying of Tythes to the Patriarch of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
who claimed them as his due. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
the third, for their brave exploits against the Infidels,
exempted them also from tythes, and the jurisdiction
of Bishops. At length about the year 1299. when
the Western Princes by reason of their domestick
Wars, could afford these Knights no help, they were
forced by the Governour of <hi>Damascus,</hi> called <hi>Capca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>

have fifty ducars yearly pension for their service; then
they are sent home into their Country, and by the

Thus they continued nine years, till the year 1122.

rule prescribed them, that other Monks had, to wit,
obedience, poverty, chastity, gravity, piety, charity,
patience, vigilance, fortitude, devotion, and such like
vertues. When any of them were taken prisoners
by the Infidels, they were to be redeemed only with

which they are bound, given them by Saint <hi>Austin,</hi>
as they say. The first is that they possesse nothing in
property, but have all things in common; that they be

they shall be cloathed; That none be admitted
without triall; That none depart of carrie any thing

be first reproved, and if not repented of, punished:

Their Second rule contains the times and manner of
their praying and singing; their times of working,
reading and refreshing; of their obedience, silence,
and behavior, both at home and a broad, and how
contumacy must be punished. The third rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

to Religion; and instead thereof gave them a white

was confirmed by Pope <hi>Nicholaus</hi> the fourth. Whilst

with which he beat himself every night, both for his

did frequently weep, and pray whole nights together
in Churches. He offered himself twise as a ransome,
to redeem others. And partly the cause was, his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

Afterward as he was praying, he was warned
by a voice to repair the decayed houses of Christ;
which he did by stealing money from his Father, and
bestowing it on the reparation of Churches; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

                     <hi>Francis</hi> divided his Disciples into three
Classes or Ranks; the first was of the <hi>Friers Minorites,</hi>
whereof himself was one, and whose life was most
rigid, For they were neither to have <hi>Granaries,</hi> nor
two <hi>Coats.</hi> The Second was of Ladies and poor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
who from Saint <hi>Clara</hi> were named <hi>Clarissae,</hi> this
Order was not so strict as the former.<note place="margin">Friers Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</note> The third was
of <hi>Poenitents</hi> instituted for married people, who
desired to do pennance; these might enjoy propriety
in their goods. The first sort was for contemplation
and action too; namely, in preaching; the second for
contemplation onely, the third for action onely. This
third order is not properly called Religious, because
they may continue in their maried estate, &amp; enjoy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.
These are called <hi>Friers Fenites</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
and <hi>Saccii</hi> from their sack-cloath which they wore;
and <hi>Continentes,</hi> not that they vowed continency, but
because certain days every week, they abstained from
carnal Copulation. The Women are called <hi>Sisters
Penitents.</hi> The first order were not to permit any of
the third order to enter their Churches in time of
interdict. This order was condemned in <hi>England An.</hi>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:97888:170"/>
1307. but is again advanced by <hi>Peter Teuxbury</hi> a <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan</hi>
Minister, and allowed in the Chapter at <hi>London.

with their open shooes, and <hi>Servientes. 3. Francis</hi>
himself wore a short coat without any artificiall
tincture; instead of a girdle, he used a cord, and went
bare-footed; hence after long altercation among his
Disciples about their habit and shooes, it was ordered
that they should wear soles onely, having no more
upper leather then to tie the shooes. That they
should travel either on foot, or upon Asses. And
whereas they could not agree about the form, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and colour of their habit, (for Saint <hi>Francis</hi> in
this determined nothing,) the matter is referred to
Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. who leaves it to the arbitrement of
their General and Provincial Ministers. At this day
they wear a long coat with a large hood of gray, or
hair-colour, bare-footed, and girded with a cord. 4.
Such vertue hath been held in a <hi>Franciscan</hi> Garment,
that divers Princes have desired to be buried in it,

their sixth General Minister, <hi>Anno</hi> 1245. Some among
them bragging much of the Spirit, would not live
after <hi>St. Francis</hi> rule, but after their own, accouting
themselves the Saints. These despised a long habit,
and would go in short cloakes. Another schisme they
made in the Province of <hi>Narbon, Anno</hi> 1315. after the
death of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> 5. during the vacancy of the
Popedom almost two years. These Monks chose their
own Ministers and Governours, and flung away the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:97888:171"/>
habit of their order as profane, wearing short Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
imprisoning and excommunicating the <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes.</hi>
Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. condemned these <hi>Minorities</hi> as
Hereticks; and the <hi>Fratricelli</hi> starting up at that time,
condemned the same Pope of Heresie, for saying Christ
and his Disciples had a common stock among them,
whereof <hi>Iudas</hi> bore the bag. Another Schisme they
had about the year 1352. some petitioned the Pope
for leave to live after the letter of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> his
rule, and not after the glosse, as they all did. They
obtain four places to reside in, and in each of them
twelve brothers. But these aiming at liberty, rejecting
the rule of their order, and wearing short undecent
Garments, were suppressed by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the sixth.
Another rupture was among them, during the
Schisme of the Church, begun by <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixth, who
sat at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> at <hi>Avinion;</hi> for the <hi>Minorites</hi>
of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> chose them one General,

<hi>Observantes;</hi> these despising the <hi>Conventual</hi> Prelates,
chose their own Govenours, calling the others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
and impious. These touch no money, eat no
flesh, and wear no shooes: they multipled exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
in all parts, chiefly in <hi>Italy.</hi> They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Councel of <hi>Constance,</hi> and divers Popes.
6. <hi>Francis</hi> prohibited his Monks to meddle with
Ecclesiastical preferments, to be called Lords or
Masters, to hear confessions, to eat flesh, to wear rich
apparell, and to dwell in sumptuous houses. <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

who wast born of a Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. He taught them also to
exhort the people to salute the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at the
ringing of the bell, after the <hi>Completory,</hi> in memory of
the Angel saluting her that hour. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the
eleventh limited the power of the <hi>Minorites</hi> Protectors,
that they should not meddle with any, except he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
the Pope and Church, apostatize from the faith,
and forsake his rule <hi>Honorius</hi> the third decreed, that no
<hi>Minorite</hi> should ever forsake his order. The <hi>Minorites</hi>
obtained this favour, that they might make Masters
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97888:171"/>
of Divinity among themselves; where of <hi>Alexander de
Ales</hi> was the first. 7. The <hi>Franciseans</hi> did increase so
fast in all parts, that from the year 1211, till the year
1380. being the space of 169. years, there were erected
in <hi>Christendom</hi> above 1500. Monasteries of this order.
<hi>Sabellicus</hi> recordeth that in his time were Ninety
thousand <hi>Minorites.</hi> 
                     <q>The cause of this increase was
partly their diligence and sedulity in making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selites,
partly their priviledges, and partly their
pretended sanctity and mortification, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their incredible miracles and visions of Saint
<hi>Francis,</hi> which are obtruded on the peoples beliefe;
as his five wounds, his bearing of Christ in his arms,
his mansion in Heaven next Christ, and much other
stuff to this purpose, with which their Legends are
fraught.</q>

which the <hi>Dominicans</hi> professe; that is to have nothing
in property, yet some things in common, as books,
cloathes,<note place="margin">Of these things see the Authors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove named.</note> and food. The third is and the least, to have
some things both in common and in property, but

                  </p>
                  <p>A. These ascribe the original of their order to
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> our Lords brother,<note place="margin">Knight of the the holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre.</note> and son of <hi>Alphaeus;</hi>
but its more likely that this order began when <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
was taken by <hi>Godsrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloigne;</hi> at this
day, it is quite extinct. When <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was taken
by the <hi>Soldan,</hi> these <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1300. with all the
other religious Knights of Christendom were driven
out of <hi>Syria;</hi> yet the care of the holy Sepulchre, which
these Knights had charge of, was committed to the
<hi>Franciscans</hi> by the <hi>Soldan,</hi> who of all the Christian
profession suffered none to stay in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
but the <hi>Armenians, Syrians, Georgians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans;</hi>
the Pope allows eight of this order with a
Christian Knight, who is their <hi>Guardian,</hi> to keep
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:97888:172"/>
the Sepulchre. The manner of installing the Knights
of the Sepulchre was this: The Knight after prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
being brought within the Sepulchre, where
Hymnes are sung, and prayers said, declares kneeling,
that he is come to be made Knight of the most holy
Sepulchre of our Lord; that he was nobly descended,
and had means sufficient to maintain him; withall
promiseth to hear Masse daily, to expose his life and
estate against the Infidels, to desend the Church of
God and Ministers thereof, from their persecutors, to
avoid unjust Wars, Duells, filthy Lucre, and such like,
to maintain peace amongst Christians, to shun oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
perjury, rapin, blasphemy, and all other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
sins. Then the <hi>Guardian</hi> laying his hand on the
Knights head, bids him be a stout, faithful, and good
souldier of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and of his holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.
Upon this he gives him a pair of guilded
Spurs, with a naked Sword, signing him three times
with the crosse, and bidding him in the name of the
Trinity, use this Sword to his own and the Churches
defence, and to the confusion of the enemies thereof;
then the Sword being sheathed, is girt to the Knight
by the <hi>Guardian;</hi> the Knight riseth, and bending his
knees and bowing his head over the Sepulchre, is by
the <hi>Guardian</hi> struck on the shoulder three times with
the Sword, saying, <hi>Iordain thee Knight of the holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
of our Lord Iesus Christ, in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> This he repeats three times, and
crosseth him three times, then kisseth him, and puts
a Golden Chain about his neck, with a double red
Crosse hanging at it; at last the Knight having kissed
the Sepulchre, the Monks present sing <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and
after a short prayer, he is dismissed. This order was
by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the eighth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1485. made one
with the Knights of <hi>Rhodes.</hi>

<hi>Vrban</hi> the fifth. Her rule was according to that of
Saint <hi>Basils.</hi> The Monks and Nus may have their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
contiguous, and the same Church, but the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
must officiate below, the Sisters above. Both
Sexes must use gray cloaks and coats, with a red cross
thereon. They must have nothing in propriety, touch
no money, must lie onely upon straw. The fashion,
colour, and measure of their cloathes are set down;
on their Vaile they must wear a weite linnen Crown,
on which are sowed pieces of red cloath, representing
drops of blood, and so placed that they may resemble
the cross. The Sisters are enjoyned how to officiate,
and what prayers they shall use every day, to be silent,

to avoid conference with men, except it be at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,

She that openeth not her window at all, shall have
the greater reward in Heaven. Days of fasting are
prescribed them; none must be admitted into the
order, without a years probation: then she must be
examined and consecrated by the Bishop, who is to
bring her into the Church with a red Crosse carried

the Virgins Image on the other, to put her in minde

a Ring, and prayeth. She having testified her
constant resolution to that kinde of life, the Bishop
by putting the Ring on her finger, marrieth her to
Christ, and prayeth; she comes to the Altar and offers,
then returns to her place again. Her new cloathes
are also consecrated, and she is called by the Priest to
come bare-footed to the Altar; the Bishop prayeth
again, and withall puts on her the coat of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
her shooes, hood, and cloak, which he tieth
with a wooden button, in memory of Christs wooden
Crosse, to which her minde should be fastned. Then
her Vaile is put on, the Bishop at every action, and
parcel of her cloathes prayeth, and at last her Crown,
the Bishop praying that she may be Crowned with
joy. She returns to her place, and is called again to
the Altar, where she falls on her face, the Bishop
with his Priests read the <hi>Letanie,</hi> absolves her, and
gives her the Eucharist; her Coffin, which during the
time of the Masse stood there, is carried by four
Sisters, sprinkling dust on it, into the Covent; at the
gate whereof stands the Abbatesse with her <hi>Nuns,</hi> the

in the middest a round piece of white cloth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the host which they daily offer. The four
<hi>Evangelists</hi> shall carry on their cloaks a white circle,
to shew the incomprehensible wisdom of the four
Doctors which they represent. Within these circles
red pieces of cloth shall be inserted like tongues
cloven, to shew their learning and eloquence. The
Lay-brothers shall wear on their cloaks a white
crosse, to shew Christs innocency, with five pieces
of red cloth, in memory of Christs five wounds. The
number of Brothers in the Covent, must not exceed
five and twenty, who are to be blessed by the Bishop,
after the same manner that the Sisters were; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a Ring, the Bishop shall hold the Priest by
the hand, and for a Vail, shall lay his hands on his
head; and instead of a Crown, shall use the sign of
the Crosse. The Abbatesse shall be among the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Priests, as <hi>Mary</hi> was among the Apostles; she
shall have for Confessor, him whom the Bishop al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
Confession must be made at least three times
yearly, and every day if need be, to such Priests as
the Confessor shall chuse; the Priest shall be diligent
in preaching, praying, and fasting. Every Thursday
shall be a Chapter held, wherein the delinquent
Sisters may be punished with fasting, standing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doores in the Church-yard, whilst the other
Sisters are within at Divine Service, and with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
her self on the ground, till the Abbatesse take
her up, and intercede for her absolution. If a Sister
possesse any thing in propriety, and dyeth before she
confesseth it, her body is layed on a Beer at the
Church door, where they all say an <hi>Ave-Mary</hi> for her,
and then is absolved, and after Mass is carried from
the Quite to the Church door by the Sisters, where
the Brothers receive her, and bury her. Neither the
Abbatesse, nor any Sister must receive gifts, or have

any thing in proper. Every one after the first founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

remain over and above the expences, let it be reserved
for the next years expences, or bestowed on the poor,

Every Novice must bring a present or almes
gift to the Covent, but nothing that hath been got
by oppression, cheating, stealing, or any other sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
means; such gifts must be restored again, and
so must gifts doubtfully got be rejected; and if the
Covent stand not in need of any persent, let it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Altars, on each of which one Chalice, but on the
high Altar two Chalices, two pair of Flaggons, so
many Candlesticks, one Crosse, three Censers, one
for daily use, the other two for solemn Feasts, a <hi>Cibory</hi>

Let every one have her office or service Book, and as
many other books as they will, for good arts; Let
each Altar have two Altar-cloths; Let no Sisters be
admitted under eighteen, nor Priest or Brother under
five and twenty years of age; Let the Sisters imploy
their time in devotion, labouring with their hands,
and about their own affairs, after the manner of Christ

be heard, but not seen; but in receiving the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
they may be heard and seen. But they must do
nothing without the leave of the Abbatesse, and some
witnesses, except in time of confession. Priests must
not enter the Nunnery, except to give the Sacrament
in the agony of death, and that with some witnesses;

all the Priests and Brothers may enter to perform
Funerall obsequies. The Bishop of the Diocesse must
be the Father and Visitor of the Monasteries and
Nunneries; the Prince of the Territory shall be the
Protector, and the Pope the faithful Guardian; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whose will no Covent shall be made. Let there
be a hole like a grave still open in the Covent, that
the sisters may pray every day there with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batesse
(taking up a little dust between her fingers)
that God who preserved Christs body from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the grave, would also preserve both their
bodies and souls from the corruption of sin. Let there
be a Beer or Coffin at the Church-door with some
earth, that all commers in may remember they are
dust, and to dust shall return: to the observers of this
rule Christ promiseth his aid, who revealed himself
to Saint <hi>Briget,</hi> and counsels her to convey it to the

neither Wine nor Beere; feeding all the week,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:97888:179"/>
except on Sundays, upon Herbs and Rootes sprinkled
with salt: they abstained altogether from Egges,
Butter, Milk, Cheese, Fish, and Flesh. In the Church
they stretch out their arms in manner of a Crosse,
and praying fell flat on the ground. They stayed
not above four and twenty hours in any place, they
went by couples begging from door to door. Among
them were divers Priests, Deacons, and Subdeacons:
this pennance they undertook voluntarily, some for
three years, others for five or seaven, as they pleased,
and at the end of their years returned home, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themselves again to their callings: they exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  </p>
                  <p>A. This order which is called the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of Iesuites:</note>
(because they take upon them to advance the Name,
Doctrine, and Honour of <hi>Iesus</hi> more then other orders
heretofore,) was instituted about the year 1540. by
<hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> of <hi>Cantabria,</hi> who being at first a
Souldier,<note place="margin">Ignatius Loyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> and receiving some wounds in the <hi>French</hi>
War, of which he lay sick above a year, resolved
upon recovery of his health, to renounce the world,
and wholly to addict himself to the advancing of
the name of <hi>Iesus;</hi> for this cause being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ix and twenty
years of age, he forsakes all, and travels to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
thence (having done his devotion to the holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hre)
returns into <hi>Spain,</hi> where at <hi>Complutum</hi> and
<hi>Salamantica,</hi> he gives himself to study; in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim
he took upon him to preach mortification, both
by his Doctrine and mean habit, <q>though as yet he
was furnished neither with sufficent learning, nor
was he called; wherefore he was imprisoned, and
examined by the Inquisitors, and being found
zealous for the <hi>Roman</hi> faith, was dismissed, and
thence goeth to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he studied ten years
in great poverty and weaknesse of body, and was
at last made Master of Arts.</q> In the year 1536. he
returns to <hi>Spain</hi> with ten more of his profession,
and from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> to have leave of the
Pope to travel to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but finding the peace
broken between the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Venetian,</hi> they go
to <hi>Venice,</hi> and their did dresse the wounds and sores
of poor people in Hospitals. Seven of these ten
companions of <hi>Ignatius</hi> took the Priest-hood upon
them, and preached up and down the territories
of <hi>Venice;</hi> having neither temporal nor ecclesiastical
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:97888:180"/>
meanes to sustain them. After this they all go to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where they are hated and molested by the
Clergy, yet their society increased daily, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
a confirmation of their order from Pope <hi>Paul</hi>
the third, which since was ratified by <hi>Iulius</hi> the
third, <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, and the
Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> 
                     <q>At first they were not to have
above 60. of their society; but afterward the
Pope perceiving how needful this order was to the
decaying <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, permitted all that were
fit to enter into the same.</q> They have their chief
or General, their coadjutors in spiritual things, such
are their Priests, and professors of Divinity, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
and inferiour Arts: Their coadjutors in
temporals, who look to their clothing, dyet, and
domestick affairs; their Scholars and Novices are
maintained, least this order or society might faile,
who are bound to obey their Superiors without
doubting or inquiring into the nature of the thing
enjoyned them. <q>This order differs from others,
in that besides the three ordinary Vowes of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
Poverty, and Obedience, they binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Pope, in undertaking cheerfully,
readily, and without charging him, any journey

the title also of Professor among them is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
then of Priest; for one may be a Priest
many years, before he be admitted Professor. The

not to complain of one superior to another;
To be silent, or else to speak briefly, with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

shew the cause of his going abroad, and what effect
it took, when he doth return; he must also write
down his name, and aquaint the Porter whither

any travelleth he shall lodge no where but in a <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
Colledge, if there be any in that place; and
shall be as obedient to the Superior there, as to his

he may read, or hear them read, once every

wherein is shewed that the end of their Society is
to do good to their own souls, and the souls of their
neighbours, and that therefore they are bound to
travell to and fro in the world; to confesse their
sinnes to the Priest every sixth moneth, and then to
receive the Body of Christ; to cast off all inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
affections of Kindred, Friends, and worldly

to avoid Sutes in Law, yet to maintain their rights by
Law, if need be; to look to all expenses and accounts,
to avoid running in debt, and to have a care of the

Goods be given to the society, the General be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to admit as many into their order, as their General
shall please, whereas in the beginning they were
stinted to sixty onely: he also excommunicates all
such as shall either hinder, or not aid this Society.
He gave them also power to preach, administer the

both spiritual as Priests, and Temporal as Cooks,

them back again without asking leave of the Pope.
They may also absolve all Hereticks confessing, and

with them moveable Altars when they travel, and
may disguise themselves into any habit; he that visits

gave them a priviledge to erect Universities
where they pleased, and to conferr what degrees
they will; to dispense also with fasting, and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
meats. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, confirmeth all the
former priviledges. <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, grants that such

On the consecration day, which is some
Festival, or the Lords day, both the Bishop, and the
Abbot elect, confesse, and fast the day before. In
the Church two Chappels are trimmed up, me bigger
for the Bishop, the lesser for the Abbot. On the
Altar of the greater Chappel, stands a Crosse and
four Candlesticks. At the foot of the Altar the
ground is covered with Turkie Carpets, or Tapestry:
there is also in the Chappel a Table placed for the
Bishop, on which is clean Linnen, two Candlesticks,
Basons with Towels, the Holy Water pot, with the

Masse-Ornaments; there be also three Chaites, one
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or the Elect Abbot, the other two for the two assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Abbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. The Bishop hath three Chaplaines.
In the lesser Chappel for the Abbot, is an Altar with
the Crosse, and two Candlesticks, with the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
and Missal; there is also a Table covered with
clean Linnen, with Basons, and two Candlesticks,
and the Ring which is to be consecrated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The Bishop having prayed at the Altar, ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Chair of State over against the Altar,
with his Mitre on his head; the Elect Abbot
sits in his ordinary cloathes, between two
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tred Abbots his assistants; then the Elect
boweth himself to the Bishop, who riseth, taketh off
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:97888:189"/>
his Mytre, and saith some prayers: after this the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
without his Mytre blesseth the Elects new
cloathes, and besprinkles them with holy water,
then he sits down, puts on his Mytre, and takes off
the Elects secular garment; saying, <hi>The Lord take off
from thee the old man,</hi> &amp;c. and then cloaths him in a
Monastical habit; saying, <hi>The Lord cloath thee with the
new man,</hi> &amp;c. This done the Bishop laying aside his
Mytre, riseth and prayeth, and sits downe againe.
Then the Elect riseth, and beseeching him with ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
knees, and his hands on his breast, that hee
would receive him, the Bishop riseth and prayeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him; then the Elect being now made a Monk,
promiseth Canonical obedience to the Bishop and his
successors, fidelity to the Covent, continency and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
to his own Estate; with this the Bishop
receiveth him into the society of the Monks, and
withal into the kisse of peace. After this the Elect
Abbot goeth into his Chappel, where he is habited
like a Priest, and thence brought between the two Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots
assistants to the Bishop, who uncovering their
heads, bow to him, and the elder of the two presents
him to the Bishop, desiring he would ordain him
Abbot of such a Monastery, according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
authority committed to him. Then the Popes
Mandate is read; the Elect sweareth upon the Gospel,
the Bishop asketh if he will be faithful over the flock
committed to him, if he will reform his life, be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
humble, chast, and patient; if he will be subject,
obedient, and reverent to the Pope and his successors;
if he answereth <hi>I Will,</hi> then the Bishop prayeth that
God will keep and strengthen him; if the Abbot
be not exempted from Episcopal Jurisdiction, he is
to promise obedience to the Diocesan and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.
This done, the Elect kisseth the Bishops
hand, who standing before tht Altar makes confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
kisseth the Gospel and the Altar, which he
doth also incense, and sayeth Masse. After this the
Elect goeth to his Chappel where he is trimmed in
the Abbots ornaments; and is brought againe before
the Bishop, to whom he boweth himselfe, and
then the Musick begins: the Bishop after this takes
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:97888:189"/>
the Pastoral staff, blesseth it and prayeth for the Elect
Abbot, who all the while is on his knees, then the
Bishop layeth both his hands on the Abbots head,
prayeth, and giveth to him the rule of the order,
whereof he is to be head, with an exhortation to be
careful over them. After the Bishop hath blessed
the Staffe, he besprinkleth the Elect with Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
delivereth him the Staffe, with an exhortation to
use it with discretion. Then he blesseth the Ring and
casts Holy Water on it, and puts it on the Ring fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his right hand, and prayeth for him; this done,
the Abbot receiveth the kisse of peace, then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> retireth
to his Chappel, thence returneth with his two assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
and presenteth to the Bishop two burning Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
two Breads, two vessels of Wine, and kisseth his
hand. Then Masse is said, the Sacrament administred,
and the Abbot is solemnly blessed; at length the
Mytre is blessed, and washed with holy water, which
the Bishop puts on the head of the Abbot; saying,
<hi>Lord we put on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

aboninable in the sight of God, <q>
                        <hi>whereas notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
we have diverts set forms, both in the Old and
New Testament, at which they quarrel, and chiefly at the
Lords Prayer.</hi>
                     </q> 12. There be divers sorts of this
profession; some <hi>Brownists,</hi> of which we have spoken;
some <hi>Barrowists,</hi> so called from <hi>Barrow,</hi> their first
Martyr. He called the Church of <hi>England; Sodom, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
and <hi>Egypt.</hi> Some are called <hi>Wilkinsonians,</hi> from
<hi>Wilkinson</hi> their Master, who thought that he and his
followers were truly Apostles, and therefore denyed
communion with such as did not give them that title.
A fourth sort there is of <hi>Anabaptistical Brownists,</hi> who
hold themselves the onely true Church, and condemn
the other <hi>Brownists</hi> for <hi>Pedobaptisme;</hi> therefore they
re baptise such as come to them. They that would

                  <p>Q. 3. What are the Familists?</p>
                  <p>A. The <hi>Familists,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Familists, their Heresies.</note> or <hi>Family of love,</hi> are so called
from the love they bear to all men, though never so
wicked; and their obedience to all Magistrates,
though never so tyrannical, be they <hi>Iewes, Gentiles</hi> or
<hi>Turks.</hi> Their first Founder was one <hi>David George</hi> of
<hi>Delfe,</hi> who called himself the true <hi>David,</hi> that should
restore the Kingdom to <hi>Israel.</hi> He held 1. That
neither <hi>Moses,</hi> nor the <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor <hi>Christ</hi> could by
their Doctrine save the people; but his Doctrine was
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:97888:199"/>
the onely meanes of salvation. 2. That whosoever
spoke against his Doctrine, should never be forgiven,
neither in this life, nor in the life to come. 3. That
he would set up the true house of <hi>David,</hi> and raise
the Tabernacle of God, not by suffering, but through
love and meeknesse. 4. That he was the right Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
the beloved son of the Father. 5. That he
should not die; or if he did, he should rise again.
His Successor, <hi>Henry Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same Doctrine, but in his own name, calling
himself <hi>The Restorer of the World, and the Prophet sent
of God.</hi> To the former Tenets he added 1. That
there is no other Christ but holinesse, and no other
Antichrist but sin. 2. That the <hi>Family of love</hi> hath
attained the same perfection that <hi>Adam</hi> had before he
fell. 3. That there is no resurrection of the flesh. 4.
That the day of judgement is already come, and that
this <hi>Nicholas</hi> is the Judge of the world. 5. That there
hath been eight great Lights in the world, whereof
Christ was the seventh, but himself the eight, and
greatest of all. 6. That none should be baptized till
the thirtieth year of their age. 7. That the joyes of
Heaven shall be onely here on the Earth, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Hell. 8. That they ought not to bury the dead,
not to give almes to such as are not of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
9. That Angels are born of women. 10.
That every day of the week should be a Sabbath.
11. That the Law may be fulfilled in this life. 12.
That there was a world before <hi>Adam</hi> was made. 13.
That there is no other Deity but what man partakes
of in this world. 14. That such wives as are not
of their belief, may be rejected for whores. 15.

opinions, that the Scriptures are but for Novices;

we are assured of Gods love; that wicked men sin

                  <p>A. Of the <hi>Adamites</hi> in Saint <hi>Austins</hi> time,<note place="margin">Adamites.</note> we have
already spoken, as also of the <hi>Bohemian Adamites.</hi>
Of late years there were some of them in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
where the men and women did pray in their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and perform other divine services naked. This
posture they called the state of innocency, and their
meetings Paradise. In their opinions they were
<hi>Anabaptists.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Antinomians.</note> The <hi>Antinomians</hi> are so called from their
opposing and rejecting of the Law, which they say is
of no use at all under the Gospel, neither in regard
of direction, nor correction, and therefore ought not
to be read or taught in the Church. 2. They say
that good works do neither further, nor evill workes
hinder salvation. 3. That the child of God can no
more sin then Christ could, and therefore it is sin in
him to aske pardon for sin. 4. That God never chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his children for sin; not is it for their sins that
any Land is punished. 5. That murther, adultery,
drunknesse, are sins in the wicked, but not in the
children of grace, nor doth God look upon them as
sinners; and consequently that <hi>Abrahams</hi> lying and
dessembling was no sin in him. 6. That the child
of grace never doubteth, after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

salvation. 7. That no man should be troubled in
his conscience for any sin. 8. That no Christian
should be exhorted to performe the duties of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
9. That an Hypocrite may have all the graces
that were in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, and yet be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christ. 10. That Christ is the onely subject of
all graces, and that no Christian believeth, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any good,<note place="margin">See also <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <hi>Edwards</hi> in his Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, <hi>Pagit,</hi> and others.</note> but Christ onely believeth and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
11. God doth not love any man for his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
12. Sanctification is no evidence of a mans
Justification; <q>Of this and such like stuff you may

                        <hi>Arminians,</hi> their Tenets.</note> Divinity Reader in <hi>Leyden, Anno
1605.</hi> published and taught five Articles, which have
occasioned great troubles in <hi>Holland,</hi> being eagerly
maintained by his Followers called <hi>Remonstrantes.</hi>
They hold 1. that election to life, is the will of God
to save such as will believe, and persevere in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
that men may be elected to faith, and yet not
elected to salvation: that election is sometimes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:97888:201"/>
sometimes conditional, that the act of faith
is chosen as a condition to salvation, and that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
to faith, the condition of using the light of
reason is required. That faith and obedience are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
by God, as already performed by those who are
to be chosen peremptorily and compleatly. That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
sometimes is changible, and some elect may
finally perish; and consequently no certainty of our
elections immutability. That God hath not decreed
to leave any man in the state of sin and damnation,
meerly out of his will and pleasure; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is not Gods meer will that one Nation should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Gospel, and not another, but a fore-sight of
the goodnesse and worth of one Nation above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
2. They teach that God so ordained his son to
dye, that he did not determin to save any particular
man expresly, so that Christs death was powerful and
sufficient, in respect of impertation, though there had
been no actuall application thereof to any particular
man: that Christ did not establish a new Covenant of
grace by his blood, but onely procured a right to his
Father, to make with men any Covenant whatsoever:
that Christ by his satisfaction did not merit faith and
salvation to any man in respect of effectual applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but onely obtained power, that the Father
might make what conditions he pleased, with man;
the performance whereof depends upon his free will:
that the Covenant of grace consisteth not in being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and saved by faith in Christ, but in this, that
God esteemeth our imperfect faith and obedience as
meritorious of life eternal, as if we had fulfilled the
Law: that all men are received into the Covenant of
grace, and all freed from original sin: that Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not for those whom God elected and highly loved,
seeing such stood in no need of Christs death. 3. They
teach that original sin of it self was not sufficient to
condemn man kind to temporal or eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
that an unregenerate man is not totally dead
in sin, nor destitute of all strength to spiritual good
things, but that he may hunger and thirst after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
and life: that a natural man can (by using
the gifts of nature rightly) obtain saving grace, and
salvation, and that God affordeth sufficient means to
bring men to the knowledge of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:97888:201"/>
4. They teach that holinesse and righteousnesse could
not be seated in mans will when he was created, and
therefore in his fall, could not be separated from it: that
in spirituall death, spiritual gifts were not separated from
the will of man; seeing the will of it self was never
corrupted, but intangled by the darknesse of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and unrulinesse of the affection: that in mans
conversion no new gifts are infused; and therefore the
faith, by which we are converted, is not a quality infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but onely an act of man: that the grace; by which
we are converted, is onely a gentle perswasion, so that
Morall grace makes naturall men become spiritual: and
that God by moral reason, produceth the consent of the
will: that God in mans conversion, doth not use his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
power to bend the will infallibly, so that man
may and doth oftentimes resist and hinder his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version:
that grace and free will are comperating causes
in our conversion, so that grace in order of causality
doth not precede the action of the will.</p>
                  <p>5. They teach that perseverance is not the effect of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but a condition of the new Covenant to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
on mans part before his peremptory election, and
that by his own free-will: that God furnisheth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
man with sufficient means to persevere, yet it is in the
choice of mans will to persevere, or not to persevere:
that regenerate men may and do fall totally and finally
from grace and salvation; and that they may sin against
the Holy Ghost: that no assurance of perseverance can
be had in this life without speciall revelation: that
the Doctrine of assurance is hurtfull to all holy exercises,
and a means of presumption and security, whereas
doubting is commendable: that temporary, and true
justifying faith, differ onely in continuance: that it is
no absurdity, if man be oftentimes regenerated, his
former regeneration being extinct: that Christ never
prayed for the faithfuls infallible perseverance in faith.

2. That God is not onely the author of sin, but
also of the sinfulnesse or <hi>Ataxie</hi> thereof. 3. That all
men are bound to know God <hi>in abstracto</hi> without Christ,
without Grace or Scripture. 4. They held extreme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to be a Sacrament and necessary for the sick, and of
divine institution: so they held the holy kisse of peace
a religious and needfull Ceremonie. 5. They put down,
singing Psalmes, and set up in lieu thereof singing
prophets, who are to chant out alone in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own hymnes. 6. They teach that the soul is
mortall. 7. That just mens souls go not into heaven till the

whither <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah,</hi> with the Soul of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his resurrection, and the soul of the good thief
went, and no higher: they teach also that the Souls of
the wicked go not before the last judgement into hel, but
remain in the lower region of the air, or in the bottom of
the sea. 8. They say, that after the day of judgement, all
the world shall be hell, except that part of heaven where
God resides with his Angels.<note place="margin">Of these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, see the forenamed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</note> 9. In preaching, they

Church, by his word, sacraments and discipline, we
must conclude that he hath reigned already above

on earth we know not.</q> 2. They build their opinion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                        <q>but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
is ridiculous; for the first Resurrection men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Scripture is spirituall, to wit, a rising from the
death of sinne, of which the Apostle,</q>
                     </hi> if you be risen

to Iudgement, and not to a temporary Kingdome:
for he saith, that some of those shall rise to life eternall,
not to a temporary of a thousand years, and others to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
shame, which yet the Millenaries deny, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the wicked shall not rise till the expiration of the
thousand years; and where they say, that the Saints
shall shine as starres, or the Firmament in the first Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
but as the sun in the second,</hi> it is vain; <hi>for in
the second Resurrection shall be degrees of glory, as the
Apostle sheweth,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. For as one Star differeth
from another star in glory, so is the Resurrection of the
dead, <hi>some shall shine as the Sun, who is the brightest of
all the starres; and some shall be lesser starres an glory;
they do also vainly call their first Resurrection, a hidden
mystery, whereas indeed it is the second Resurrection that
is a mesterie, and so hidden, that the wisest Philosophers

called a hidden mystery.</hi> 3. They misapply divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture to prove this imaginary reign of Christ
here on earth, as <hi>Psalm 102. 16. when the Lord shall
build up Sion, he shall appear in his glory.</hi> 
                     <q>This Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
was fulfilled when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was rebuilt, after
the captivity.</q> So they alledge, <hi>Acts 3. 20. 21. The
Heavens shall receive Christ, till the times of resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of all things,</hi> 
                     <q>but this is spoken of the second
Resurrection; for then shall be a restitution of all
things, and not before; in their thousand years
reign: for they confesse that then all the Jews shall
not rise, nor all Christians, it must then follow, that
there shall not be a restitution of all things, at that
time. That place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. concerning the calling
of the Jews is impertinent; for we deny not, but
they shall be called to the faith of Christ, but that they
shall return, to build <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and be under Christs
earthly reign 1000. years, is not at all spoken in that
place: no lesse impertinent is that place of 2. <hi>Pet. 3.
13. We look for new heavens,</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>and a new earth, wherein
dwelleth righteousnesse;</hi> 
                     <q>for this is spoken of the last
Judgement, wherein all things shall be renewed by
fire, and not before; as the circumstances of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
do shew, and all Jnterpreters do agree: so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any sense or reason, they apply the 65. chapter of
<hi>Isa.</hi> to their Millenary reign, which is plainly spoken
of the calling of the Gentiles, and of Christs first
coming to preach the Gospell, and to gather a Church,
which there, and elsewhere; is called <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and the Prophets usually under the terms of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
building, eating, and drinking, new heavens,
and new earth; the joy of hills, forrests, and trees,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> do expresse the happy estate of the Church of
Christ under the Gospel.</q> 
                     <hi>When the mountain of the
Lords House shall be coealted on the top of the mountains,
and all nations shall flock to it, then</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>that is, the
Church, shall be the throne of the Lord. Then out of</hi> Sion
<hi>shall go forth a Law, and the word of the Lord from</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
<q>then shall the God of heaven set up a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which shall never be destroyed, Christ shall
reign over the house of <hi>Iacob</hi> for ever, to this City
of the Church, shall the Kings of the earth bring
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:97888:203"/>
their glory and honour:</q> 
                     <hi>in that day, he that is feeble
shall be like</hi> David, <hi>and the house of</hi> David <hi>shall be as
God. See Isa.</hi> ch. 2. ch. 55. and ch. 65. <hi>Ier. 16.
Ezech. 21. Dan. 2. Zach.</hi> 12. Luke 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21 and

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 9. Wherein doth the vanity of the Millenaries opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
consist?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1. In giving to Christ a temporall Kingdome of
a thousand years,<note place="margin">The vanity of the <hi>Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> opinion.</note> whereas, his Kingdome is eternall,
it shall stand fast for ever, <hi>of his Kingdome shall be no
end,</hi> saith the angel.</p>
                  <p>2. In giving him an earthly Kingdome, whereas his
Kingdome is heavenly, My <hi>Kingdome (saith he) is not of
this world;</hi> It is not from hence, it is within us.</p>
                  <p>3. In making his Kingdome to consist in earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
in eating, drinking, fighting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are
directly against the nature of his Kingdome: which as
the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom. 14. 17. Is not meat and drink,
but righteousnesse, peace, and joy of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
the end of his coming was to fight with no other weapon,
but with the two edged sword of his word, proceeding
out of his mouth, he was the prince of peace, the dove
that brought the olive branch in his mouth: he brought
peace in his birth, he preached peace in his life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
peace to us at his death: and as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
saith, <hi>pacem nobis reliquit, iturus ad Patrem, &amp;
pacem nobis dabit perducturus ad patrem:</hi> his peace he
left with us, and his peace he will bring again to us.</p>
                  <p>4. In this their imaginary Kingdome, they bring
Christ down from heaven before his time; <hi>for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
must contain him till the restitution of all things,</hi>
which cannot be till the last Judgement: it is an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of our Creed, that Christ shall come down from
heaven to judge the quick and the dead, which shall not
be till the last day.</p>
                  <p>5. He is to sit at Gods right hand, <hi>untill be hath
made his enemies his footst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>l, Ps.</hi> 110. 1. But these men
will bring him from thence before he hath obtained this
conquest and triumph, which is not to be obtained till
the last day, and consummation of all thing. 6. They are
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:97888:204"/>
injurious to Christ, to bring him from his place and
condition of glory; to play the part of a butcher and
executioner in murthering of men with the sword, here
on earth, an office ill beseeming him, and no wayes suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his glorious condition, and mercy, who came to
save sinners; and not to destroy them. 7. The Scripture
mentioneth no other Resurrection of the bodies, but such
as shall rise at the last day, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 39, 40, 44. in the end
of the world, when he shall have delivered up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to God, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 22. where we shall be caught
up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the aire, and shall be
ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 15. but this Millenarie
Resurrection is long before the last day, and end of
the world; neither in it shall we be ever with the Lord,
if we are with him but a thousand years. 8. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth not speak of three comings of Christ, but of
two onely; the first when he came in humility, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
when he shall come in glory: <hi>unto them that look for
him shall he appear the second time without sin unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
Heb. 9. 28. let them shew us out of Scripture a
third coming, and we will believe them. 9. Christ tells
us <hi>Iohn 14. 2. that in his Fathers house,</hi> that is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>are many mansions,</hi> thither he is gone to prepare a
place for us, that <hi>where he is, there we may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>;</hi> but he
is in heaven, in his Fathers house, there doth he prepare
a place for us, and not here upon earth; for so we shall
not be where he is, but he will be where we are; which
is repugnant to his own words. 10. They make the time
of Christs second coming to Iudgement certain, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
it shall be at the end of their thousand years;
but this is repugnant to Christs words, who faith, that
his coming shall be sudden, secret, and unexpected, like
the coming of a thief in the night: like the coming of
<hi>Noahs</hi> stood, or the fire of <hi>Sodom: so that, of that day
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> knoweth no man, no not the angels in heaven;</hi>
nor Christ himself as he is man. 11. Whereas the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christs Church here on earth is mixed, consisting
of Saints and reprobates, of sheep and goats, of good and
bad fishes, of wheat and chaffe, of corn and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ares; they
give Christ such a Church, as is without sinne or sinners,
as need no preaching nor Sacraments, no Pastors and
Jeachers, no Advocate with the Father, no Christ to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:97888:204"/>
for us in the presence of God: and lastly, such
a Church as is not subject to persecution, affliction, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and trouble; all which is directly repugnant to
Gods word; and condition of the Church mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tant here,
which is subject both to infirmities and afflictions.
12. Antichrist shall not be destroyed, till Christs se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
coming to Iudgement, as the Apostle sheweth,
2 Thes. 2. 8. That <hi>Christ shall destroy him with the
brightnesse of his comming;</hi> but the millenaries will have
him to be destroyed before the beginning of their
thousand years, which is flat against Scripture. 13. They
do exceedingly wrong the Martyrs, in bringing their
souls down from heaven, where they have the fruition of
God and his angels, to reign here on earth, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
carnall and sensuall pleasures; the meanest of the
Saints in heaven must be in a far better condition, than
the greatest martyr in this earthly Kingdome. 14. The
reward that is promised to the Saints after this life, is not
a Kingdome here on earth, but the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<hi>a house made without hands, eternall in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;</hi>
a mansion in our heavenly Fathers house: to sit
with Christ in his throne, to be caught up in the clouds,
to meet the Lord in the air; and to be ever with the
Lord; to be with Christ in Paradise, to enjoy life
eternall &amp;c. 15. Whereas they dream that <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
shall be rebuilt, and the Iewes shall reign in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Iudea</hi> a

collapsa cineres,</hi> fallen into everlasting ashes, and
never to rise again. 16. Whereas they dream<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in
the millenarie Kingdome, sacrifices, circumcision, and
all other Iewish ceremonies shall be used, 'tis plainly to
deny that christ ever came in the flesh; or that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself a propitiarory sacrifice, to put an end to all
Iewish rites, which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the substance being come, the shadows were to
vanish: therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>Gal. 4. 9. That they
who turns to these beggarly elements again, desire to be in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:97888:205"/>
bondage again,</hi> and in the next chapter, he tells the
<hi>Galathians, that if they be circumcised, Christ shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
them nothing.</hi> Lastly, this millenary kingdome of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
drinking, and sensuall pleasures, was fitly devised
by <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the heretick, as best suiting with his swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

because he sheweth lying signes and wonders,
and assumes to himself the titles of the onely God, in
that he calls himself <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Melchisedeth,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Iesus Christ; in saying, the three persons in

such blasphemies they ascribe to him.</q> They affirm also
that Christians using the sword of steel, are ignorant
of Iesus, and enemies to his Gospel, and they teach, that
the two uncreated substances of earth and water, were
eternally resident in the presence of God the Creator:
that death was from Eternity: that the person of the
reprobate Angel or Serpent, entred into the womb
of <hi>Eve,</hi> and there died, but quickened in her all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of uncleannesse: that there is no devil at all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the body of man or woman, but what dwells with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them; so that the devil spoken of so often in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is mans spirit of unclean reason, and cursed ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination:
that God the Father, was a spirituall man
from Eternity, and that in time his spirituall body
brought forth a naturall body: that if the very God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
had not died, that is, (say they) the soul of
Christ, which is the eternall Father had not died, all
men had perished eternally: that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> are
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:97888:207"/>
angels, and did represent the person of the Father in
heaven, as they did the person of the Son on earth,
that <hi>Eliah</hi> was made protectour of God, when God
became a child; and that he filled the Lord Iesus with
those great revelations of his former glory which he
possessed in heaven, when he was the immortall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and that it was <hi>Eliah</hi> who spake these words
from heaven, saying, <hi>this is my beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased:</hi> they say also, that all the Ministry
in this world, whether Propheticall or Ministeriall, with
all the worship taught by them, is all a lye, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Lord. Again, they declare, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
<hi>there are three witnesses on earth, water, blood, and
the spirit:</hi> that by water is meant the Commission given
to <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets under the Law: by blood,
the Commission given to the Apostles, and Ministers
of the Gospel: &amp; by the Spirit is meant the Commission
of the two witnesses, that were to come in this last age,
whose ministry is invisible, and spirituall, cutting off all
formall worshipping of an invisible spirituall, personall
God, they say there is hardly a minister in the world,
that confesseth an invisible God, but they preach a God
of three persons, that is a monster instead of one true
personall God: they say, that the true God is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
body or person, as a man is a distinct body or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
again, they say, that there is no Christian Magistrate
in the world, that hath any authority from Christ, to
set up any visible form of worship, and that the spirits
and bodies of men, are both mortall, both begot
together, and both of one nature: that the spirit
is nothing without the body, that it is the Spirit alone,
that walks and works, eats and drinks, and dies, for the
spirit is a naturall fire of reason: they say also that the
bodies or persons of holy men, wherein they lived and
died, shall not appear again any more; but when
the Saints are glorified, they are absolutely of the very
same glorious nature, both in spirit and body, as God
is: and that believing spirits are of the very same divine
nature of God <q>This is the summe of their Divinity,
and Phylosophie, as may be seen in their transcendent
spirituall Treatise, (as they call it) which is full of
transcendent nonsence, and blasphemie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:97888:207"/>
lay their axe to the very root of Christianity, in giving
a new Father to our Saviour Jesus Christ; in calling
the blessed Trinity a monster; in denying the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whilst they make earth and water eternall; in
making angels, and mens souls mortall; in making
weak man, Gods protector, and author of that divine
knowledge which was in Christ; in denying the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the Gospel, and the power of the Magistrates,
and the outward worship of God, and making the
souls of men corporeall: in denying also the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

                        </gap> them;</hi> but this conceit is also frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
for to what purpose did Christ appoint Doctours,
and Pastors, to continue still with his Church, if they
are not to expound Scripture: what the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
briefly, we expound more fully. In their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
there be many intricate, obscure, high and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative
passages, which require a further exposition.
God did never reveal all his truth at one time. Among
the Jews we read that <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
expounded the Law, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. Christ took a Text
and expounded it <hi>Luke</hi> 4. and so did <hi>Philip Acts 8.
3. They will not have Ministers to be called Masters:</hi>
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:97888:209"/>
but I would know of these men, whether they that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the word and Doctrine deserve not honour, even
double honour, that is, honourable titles, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
maintenance; 'tis true, they should not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
affect honours, nor ought they to reject them.
Christ was oftentimes called Master, and yet he never
reproved any for calling him so. 4. They quarrell <hi>with
the word Sacrament, because not found in Scripture;</hi>
but I would know, whether <hi>thing meant</hi> this word sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be not found in scripture: where hath the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
forbid us to call sacred things by significant terms;
they may as well say, that God is not every where, or
that he knows not all things, because these words <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present</hi>
and <hi>omniscient</hi> are not in scripture. 5. <hi>They will
not have Ministers to take tithes,</hi> then they will not have
those who wait at the altar, to partake with the altar,
which thwarts the Apostles words directly, why should
not the Ministers under the Gospel as well receive tithes,
as the Priests under the law; is our burthen easier or
our calling lesse deserving, its too much presumption to
discommend what Christ hath commended; but he
commended the Scribes and Pharisees for paying their
tithes, <hi>Luke 11. 42. 6. They reject infant-Baptisme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Scripture speaks not of it,</hi> but the Scripture
speaks of baptising whole Families, and Nations, <hi>Acts
16.</hi> 33. but infants are included in these: Infants were
circumcised, were admitted to Christ, to them belongs
the Kingdome of heaven. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> an infant, was san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified

was with <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> an infant, and he grew strong in the

not by prayer that our preaching is sanctified, and

why may not we do the same in our language, which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
did in his? besides did not Christ sing a hymne, did
not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> sing Psalms to God at midnight,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. Doth not the Apostle exhort us to Psalmes and

the Psalms as in a store house, all sorts of materialls for
devotion, and for all occasions. 9. <hi>They make faith and
repentance necessary concomitants of Baptisme;</hi> this they
hold to exclude-Infants from baptisme, but they should
know, that though Infants have not faith, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
actually, yet they have both in possibility; the
seed of both are in them, and the actuall faith of their
Parents supplies the actuall defect of the children: besides
<hi>Simon Magus, Alexander the</hi> Copper smith, and others,
were baptised, who neither had true faith, nor repentance;
and repentance is enjoyned to <hi>Simon,</hi> long after his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. 13, 22. &amp; Christ was baptized, who needed
neither faith nor repentance. 10. They say, <hi>That the
Church is in God; therefore, God is not in the Church,</hi>
by the same reason they may say, that God is not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
because heaven is in God; or that Christ is not in
us, because we are in Christ: Christ is in us as the head,
we are in him as the members. The Church is in God,
because in him we live, move, and have both our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

such as hold no small correspondency with the Quakers,
their lives and demeanours are much alike, onely what
the Ranters act upon the stage, by an open profession
of lewdnesse and irreligion, the other do it within the
curtain, by crafty and seemingly innocent insinuations &amp;
pretences of sanctity, and the contempt of the things of
this world. These are they that make a laughing stock of
Christianity by their bitter invectives, &amp; derision at the
ordinances and ceremonies of Christian Religion; These
are they that make no distinction between <hi>Forms</hi> and
<hi>Order,</hi> for having cryed down the former, their dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
will not bear with the later; it being their main
design to bring the businesse of Religion to that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein man was before he had assum'd thoughts
of government, that is to say, into Anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
As for their blaspemies and horrid expressions of
christian things! Mahumetanes, Jews, and Pagans, owne
more modesty, and lesse prophanesse. But to retail
their opinions, or to anatomize this monster, we must
come to particulars. 1. They hold that God, Devils,
Angels, Heaven, Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Fictions and Fables.
2. That <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> are impostors!
and what Christ and his Apostles acquainted the world
with as to matter of Religion perished with them, and
nothing transmitted to us. 3. That preaching and
praying is uselesse, and that it is but publick lying.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:97888:211"/>
4. That there is an end of all Ministry and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
and people are to be taught immediately from
God. 5. They hold Baptisme a pure, legal administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not proceeding from Christ, but from <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. They
jest the Scriptures, <hi>that divine Legacy of our salvation!</hi>
out of all life; reverence and authority, quoting it in
driblets and shreds, to make it the more ridiculous. In
their Letters, they endeavour to be strangely prophane,
and blasphemous, uttering Athiesticall curses and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

grant that we may know the worth of Hell, that we may

and conceives to be so within himself. 8. Ordinances

christian Liberty is, they will tell you that it consists
in a community of all things, and among the rest, of
women; which they paint over with an expression call'd
<hi>The enjoyment of the fellow, creature.</hi> 10. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the Fellow-creature, cannot but be seconded
with lascivious songs, drinking of healths, musick, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and bawdry. Lastly, They are (with the <hi>Anabaptists)</hi>
those that most of all kick against the pricks of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
for Magistracy cannot have in it any thing more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

(as they call them) in private places, to the publick
congregations in Churches, which they flight, calling
them steeple-houses. 3. They hold there is no use of
learning or degrees in Schools, for preaching of the
Gospel; and withall, that maintenance of the Ministry
by Tithes, is Superstitious and Judaicall. 4. They
are against set forms of prayer, chiefly the Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
accounting such forms, a choaking of the spirit.
5. They give power to private men, who are neither
Magistrates nor Ministers, to erect and gather Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
and to these also, they give the power of election
and ordination, (if we may call this ordination) of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
also, and excommunication, even of their own
officers, and finall determination of all Church causes.
6. They commit the power of the Keyes in some places
to women, and publickly to debate and determine Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick
causes. 7. They admit private men to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the Sacraments, and Magistrates to perform the
Ministers office in marrying. 8. They permit divorces in
slight cases. 9. They hold Independency to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Christs Kingdome, which is to be here on
earth a thousand years. 10. They place much Religion
in names, for they do not like the old names of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
of the dayes of the week, of the moneths of the
year; of <hi>Christmasse, Michaelmasse, Candlemasse, &amp;c:</hi>
11. In preaching they will not be tyed to a Text, nor
to prayer, but they make one to preach, another to pray,
a third to prophesie, a fourth to direct the Psalm, and
another to blesse the people. 12. They permit all gifted
men (as they call them) to preach and pray, and then
after prophesying is ended, they question the preacher
in the points of his Doctrine. 13. some of them allow

in divers places communicate every Sunday among

reformed Churches. 16. Whilest they are communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
there is neither reading, exhortation, nor singing,
not have they any preparation nor catechising before
the communion; and either they sit at Table, or have
no Table at all, and because they would not seem to be

and force of argument; <q>in which point, I

fruits; it is onely God that exactly knoweth who are
his: it were uncharitably done of us to expell or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any man from the body of Christ, that professeth

him outwardly; its true, there be many hypocrites,
such as are among us, but are not of us; these we
cannot discern, whilst they continue in their outward
profession, but by revelation; the servants that invited
and compelled all sorts of guests to the wedding feast,
knew not who wanted the inward wedding garment of
grace; it was onely the master of the Feast that could
find that out.</q> 3. They say that we receive divers into
our Churches, which shall not be saved. <q>I answer, that
no man is certain who shall be saved, or not saved, we
are to judge charitably of all men, till we know the
contrary; we receive none into our Church, but such
as prosesse Christianity, and the children of believing
parents, to whom also the Covenant of grace belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
and though we did know such, as were not to be
saved, yet we are not to debarre them from the Church,
so long as they joyn in outward profession with Gods
people. So Christ knew that <hi>Iudas</hi> should not be saved,
yet he received him into the fellowship of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
but I would be informed, how these men can
so exactly know, who shall be saved or not; seeing in
outward profession, the hypocrite can go as far, as
the best Saint, so likewise, the best Saint may for a
time seem to be in the state of damnation: besides,
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> admitted Scribes, Pharisees, and all sorts
of people to his Baptisme, if they confessed their sins
and repented; and so <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8. admits to his
Baptisme all outward professours of faith, which is
many times without the inward grace of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</q>

made an exhortation or speech to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to stir up the Levites and Judges, to discharge
their dutie: Neither do we read, <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 17. that the
Princes did preach or expound the Law, but onely that
they accompanied and countenanced the Levites whilst
they preached. 3. The Disciples were called to the
Apostleship, and to preach the Gospel before Christs
Resurrection: 4. And so were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
called to preach the Gospel. 5. Likewise the Scribes
and Pharises, sate in <hi>Moses</hi> chair, in that confused
time, and they were Doctors of the Law; therefore
Christ wills the people to hearken to them: they
had their Sinagogues, as well as the Levites had the
Temple. 6. In the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> there were
some extraordinary Prophets indowed with infused
gifts and revelations, which can be no warrant
for Lay-men, who want these gifts to undertake the
ordinary function of preaching. 7. We deny not,
but <hi>Moses</hi> wished, that all Gods people were Prophets,
and so do we, but neither he nor we, wish that they
should prophesie without a calling, either ordinary or

of God, as was</hi> Aaron, <q>Heb. 5. 3. much lesse should any
without a call take upon him the office of preaching,
which is more noble than sacrificing: and therefore
the Apostle prefers Preaching to Baptising, 1 Cor. 1. 17.
And surely if Lay-men may Preach, they may also bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise;

but we see how far they are from being sent by God, or
from having the gift of preaching, by the Errours and
Heresies daily hatched among them; and how can it be

in their words and carriage for the most part,
which hath brought this high calling into obloquie and
contempt. They have not that experience, wisdome,
gravity, and knowledge, that are in old men; nor are
they Masters of their passions and affections; and how
are they fit overseers of others, who cannot oversee
themselves? a young Presbyter is a contradiction, and a
young Bishop is incongruous. Young and green heads

little hope there is, that ever peace, Religion, and

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because by <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> they had sent him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,

he would shew, that under these two names of

the Deacon of the Gospel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. and he calls
Christ the Deacon of Circumcision, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. but this

                     </gap>. <q>Let the Elders that rule
well, be counted worthy of double honour, especially
they who labour in the Word and Doctrine:</q> for the
preaching Presbyters thought it too great a burthen to
preach, and to have the inspection of mens manners,
therefore they desired some of the Laity to assist them,
whom they called ruling Elders.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Greek word signifieth both promiscuously,
but we have appropriated the word Minister to a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

usually so called. So <hi>Acts</hi> 20. having called together
the Presbyters, he bids them take heed to the stock,
whereof the Holy Ghost hath made them Bishops: And

that a Bishop must be without reproof.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> We read in <hi>Sozomen, l. 4. c.</hi> 14. that the Bishops

Ministers by the name of Bishops and Priests?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because these Offices have been abused in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

he that is called of God, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was. <hi>Vzza</hi> was

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> were ordinary
Priests and Levites; yet were extraordinary Prophets.
So <hi>Luther</hi> had an ordinary Function in the Church of

of Presbyters or Bishops?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Election was anciently in the Laity and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,

excluded the Emperour, from whom both he, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops were wont to receive their Investiture, by
the Ring and crosier-Staffe; not in reference to their
spirituall Function, but to their temporall means, which
they injoyed by the munificence of Princes; but Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is onely from the Clergy; the Bishop was won<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
to ordain alone, but that was thought rather out of Eccla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
custome, than out of divine institution. <hi>For appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
ordination did belong to the whole Presbytery, 1. Tim
4.</hi> 14. as may be seen also in divers Canons and Councels.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; for if every one that pretends to have the
spirit should be suffered to preach, preaching would grew
contemptible, Heresies, and Sects would multiply. Now
the Church is established, therefore Ordination, and an
ordinary calling must be expected. Indeed in the infancy
of Christianity before the Church was setled, private men
in times of persecution dispersed themselves, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

a private man, who onely knew the Baptisme of <hi>Iohn</hi>
and stood in need of more perfect instructions by <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> yet he taught the word of God, <hi>Acts 18.
25,</hi> 26. but such examples were extraordinary, in a time
when no preachers were found, no ordinary calling to

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Are the names of Apostle, Presbyter, and Bishop
of equal extent?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; for Apostles are called Presbyters, 1. <hi>Pet. 5.
1.</hi> but Presbyters are not Apostles, the higher dignity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the lesser, but not on the contrary; so Apostles
are Bishops, <hi>Iudas</hi> his Apostleship is called his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 10. but all Bishops are not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Because an Elder must be apt to teach, will it
therefore follow that there ought to be none, but preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Elders?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> No; for a Ruling Elder should also be apt to
teach his Children and Family, and likewise apt to
teach, that is, to advise and give Counsel in the
Consistory, though he preach not in the Pulpit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Is a Pastor and Doctor all one?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; For all Pastors are Doctors or Teachers;

                     <hi>Q.</hi> Should there be any superiority of Presbyters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their fellows?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes of order, or at sometimes, as when they
meet in Synods to determine matters, there ought
to be Moderators or Speakers, as we know there
were among the Apostles; sometimes <hi>Peter,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Iames,</hi> see <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and perhaps, such was the
superiority, that <hi>Samuel</hi> had over the Prophets, in
<hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Rama, 1. Sam.</hi> 19. 20. Such Authority
had <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> over the other Prophets in

the inferior Priests was typicall; as it had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

for besides Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he

they are Lay-men?</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> No; For though they be no part of the Clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet
they are a part of the Church, and Members of Christs
mysticall body, as well as the Clergy. And it is for
the Clergies advantage, that there be Lay-Rulers;
for by these means, the Ministers are eased of much
trouble, and they are backed with the greater power;
besides they are lesse obnoxious to envy and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the <hi>Remish</hi> Clergy hath brought upon
themselves, by excluding the Laity from Church
Government; proudly monopolizing all to themselves.
Lastly, many Clergy men, though good Scholars,

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If there were not choice of such Elders, he
could not leave the Church destitute of Government,
with a safe conscience. 2. He may not our of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to the Function, or of his own head, leave it,
but by order and authority he may, where there be
others to supply his place. 3. That Plough in <hi>Luke</hi>
is not meant of the Plough of Ruling, but of
preaching, which no man called thereto may leave
off, seeing it is of such necessity, for the erecting of
Christs, Kingdome.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> No, for preaching and administring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
do not belong to the ruling, but to the
preaching Presbyter; neither is ruling necessarily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to preaching and baptising, but that it may
be separated from them; yea it is fit they should be
separated, for the reasons above alledged; Ministers
shall have more time to study, and to follow their
preaching better, if they be taken off from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ruling, and God who giveth to divers men
divers gifs, and not the same to all men, hath made
some fitter for preaching, others fitter for ruling.
And it is fit that some of the Laity should have
place in the Consistory, that nothing may be there
concluded partially; or prejudiciall to the Laity;
for so they shall avoid all suspition of tyranny.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for the Apostle wills that <q>the Elders
who ruse well, be counted worthy of double honour
especially they who labour in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</q>
in which words, there is no opposition made
between the reaching Presbyters, as if they who teach
and preach, were worthy of double honour, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they who labour in teaching and preaching; for
there is no reaching and preaching without labour;
and where there is no labour, there can be no dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
honour merited; but the opposition is plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ruling Elders, and the other Elders that
labour in the Word. The ruling Elder deserves
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:97888:219"/>
much honour, but much more deserves the preaching
Elder, that labours in the Word; for preaching is a
toilsome labour, compared to ruling; and so this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
doth not force the words, as the forme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
doth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What priority had the High-Priest, or Chief Priests

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The priority of order, but not of authority nad
command, all being equal in the Office of Priesthood;
such a priority was among the Presbyters, but when
the Church began to spread, and heresies to increase,
there was some power or authority given to the chief
Presbyters, whom they called Bishops; but as there was
no distinction of parishes till 267. years after Christ,
as <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> witnesseth, so it is thought there could
not be in that time any Diocesse, or Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It was thought to be in both joyntly: for in the

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They were probably Evangelists who were not
to reside in one particular place, as Bishops or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but to attend on the Apostles, and to perform their
messages, by preaching the Gospel from place to place:
for <hi>Paul</hi> left him with <hi>Silas</hi> at <hi>Berea Acts</hi> 17. 14.
then <hi>Paul</hi> sent for him to <hi>Athens,</hi> vers. 15. from thence
he sends him to <hi>Thessalonica, 1. Thess.</hi> 3. 2. from hence
he returned to <hi>Athens,</hi> and in sent by <hi>Paul</hi> into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
and returns from thence to <hi>corinth, Acts</hi> 18. 5.
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:97888:220"/>
after this he went to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and from thence was sent
by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Maccdonia, Acts</hi> 19. 22. whom <hi>Timothy</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
thence into <hi>Asia;</hi> and then to <hi>Miletum,</hi>
where having sent for the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> gives them
a charge to feed the flock of Christ; not naming <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
at all, to whom the charge should have been given,
had he been a settled Bishop there, which title is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him at all in Scripture. So <hi>Titus</hi> travelled with
<hi>Paul</hi> through <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem, Gal.</hi> 2. 1. through

tim?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for <hi>L. 3. Cont. Cresconium Grammaticum,</hi> he speaks
of Bishops, <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or preaching Elders, Deacons
and Seniors, or Lay-Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>c. 56. ibid.</hi> he speaks of

                        </gap>us</hi> Presbyter, and Seniors, by the one meaning
the preaching, by the others the ruling Elders. And in
his 137. Epistle he speaks of the Clergy, the Elders, and
the whole people; and in divers other places of his works,
he speaks of these Elders, as being distinguished from
the Clergy, and the rest of the Laity, and having a charge
of Church affairs, whence it appears, that to have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Elders is no novelty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What were those Elders which are mentioned 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They were Bishops or preaching Presbyters; for
<hi>Acts 20. Elders</hi> verse 17. are named <hi>Bishops,</hi> verse 28.
so in <hi>Titus Cap.</hi> 1. Elder verse 5. is called Bishop verse. 7.
every City then and Village had their Elder, that is,
their Bishop, and this is witnessed by <hi>Sozomen L.</hi> 7. these
were then parochiall Bishops, not Diocesan, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Whether did the power of Iurisdiction and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
belong to the B shop alone, or to the Church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To the Church, for Christ saith, <hi>Dic Ecclesiae;</hi>
go tell the Church, and to all the Apostles together,
which were then the Church Representative, he gives
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:97888:220"/>
the Keyes or power of binding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
So likewise ordination belongs to the Church or
Presbytery, as we shewed before out of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> It is not lawfull for one Clergy man to exercise
Dominion or Lordly authority over another?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; for Christ will not have any of his Apostles
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im at greatnesse or superiority, but will have such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Ministers and servants, <hi>Mat. 20. 25. Mar. 10. 42.
Luke</hi> 22. 25. for Christs Kingdome is spirituall and nor
of this world, as the Kingdomes of earthly Princes are;
neither did he mean to set up an earthly dominion for a
thousand years, as the <hi>Millenaries</hi> thought; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
themselves had a conceit of an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
when they thought that Christ did purpose to
restore the Kingdome to <hi>Israel:</hi> neither doth Christ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
tyranny or the abuse of dominion, but all kind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;
for the one Evangelist useth the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Yet some respect is to
be given to the Ministers that have the greatest gifts, by
those that have lesser. And a priority of order, though
not of Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What part of the Apostolicall Function ceased with
the Apostles, and what was to continue?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Universality of their Function, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of their authority were to cease with them;
for they were temporary gifts: but the preaching of the
Word, the Administration of the Sacraments, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Discipline, were to continue in their successors;
these gifts were ordinarie, but perpetuall, the other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and temporary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Is the power of the Keyes and Apostolicall authority
the same thing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; for the power of the Keyes is the Church
Discipline, which was to continue for ever in the Church.
But the Apostolicall authority, which consisted in their
immediate calling from Christ, in the U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their Embassage, in the infallibility of their judgements,
In giving of the Holy Gstost by Imposition of their
hands, and such like priviledges, were not to continue
longer than themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Had not <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Tims</hi> the same power of the

                  <p>
                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:97888:221"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They had the same power of the Keyes, that is,
of preaching, administring the Sacraments, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring;
but not the same Apostolicall authority, that is,
an immediate call from heaven, the same infallibility of
judgement, or power of giving the Holy Ghost, that
the Apostles had; nor was their Doctrine otherwise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall,
than as it was conformable to the Doctrine of
the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But was not the Church after the Apostles decease
left an Orphan, being destitute of these extraordinary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall
graces?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; for though she was deprived of the personall
presence of the Apostles, yet she is not destitute of their
infallible judgement left in their writings with her, which
supply the Apostles absence till the end of the World.</p>

the greater authority and satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Can Episcopacy be proved by the Canons of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Those Canons are much doubted, if they be the
Apostles or not; however it is probable to me, that the
parochian, not the Diocesan Bishop is there meant, for
there is no superiority there given, but of order and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
partly because of the eminency of the place or
City where he lived, partly by reason of his own worth
and learning, without whose advice matters of moment
should not be done by the other Bishops or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
nor should he do anything without them; but
should together ordain Presbyters and Deacons, for
that is a matter of moment; yet he is onely named
there, because, he being as it were the head; the rest are
understood.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> Is the Church-Government by Elders or Bishops,
Deacons, Doctors and Teachers, al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erable?</p>
                  <p>A. Not in the substance or essentialls thereof, but In
the circumstances or adjuncts it is alterable,<note place="margin">Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable.</note> as in the
manner, time, place, and other circumstances of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
So the Government by Elders and Deacons is
not to be changed, but that they should be elected by
all the people, and that there should be the strict num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of seven Deacons in each parish is not needfull,
though at first, as <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 5. there were but seven cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,

                     <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein is moderate Episcopacy different from
Presbytery?</p>
                  <p>A. Presbytery, is Episcopacy dilated, and Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is Presbytery contracted;<note place="margin">Episcopacy how different from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</note> so the government is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the same, differing onely as the fist or hand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
from the same hand expanded or dilated; onely
Episcopacy is more subject to error and corruption than
Presbytery, and this more subject to disorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
by reason of parity, than Episcopacy; the peace
of the Church, the suppressing of schisme and heresie,
the dignity of the Clergy are more consistent with Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
than with Presbytery;; but this again is lesse ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:97888:222"/>
to pride and tyranny, than Episcopacy, by which
we see that no Government is perfectly exempted from
corruption in this life, <hi>nihil est ex omni parte beatum.</hi> But
I find that as the <hi>Romans</hi> in their greatest dangers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themselves to the Dictatorship, so hath the Church
in her extremities had recourse to Episcopacy.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Though among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> it was lawfull, as

<hi>Rome,</hi> that were also chief Pontifies: and though

Abraham</hi> was a Prince and a Priest, <hi>Heli</hi> a Judge and a

this was not ordinary; for <hi>Abraham, Melchisedech, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
were Types of Christ; the <hi>Machabees</hi> by usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
undertook both governments, but ordinarily these
Offices were distinct among the <hi>Iews,</hi> therefore <hi>Moses</hi>
who gave Lawes concerning the Priesthood, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
it himself; neither did <hi>Ieshua, David</hi> nor <hi>Salomon;</hi>
but on the contrary, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Vzziah</hi> were severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for medling with the Priests Office; <hi>Saul</hi> for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
sacrifice lost his Kingdome; and <hi>Vzziah</hi> was
struck with Leprosie; but among Christian these Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are much more distinct; for Christs Kingdome is
not of this world; and the Ministry is burden enough
without other addition; <hi>who is sufficient for it,</hi> saith
the Apostle? besides it is Christs prerogative, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
King and Priest of his Church. Yet so far may
the Magistrate meddle with the Ministry, as to reform
what is amisse, both in their life and Doctrine; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

he knew to be unworthy of the Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because the sinne of <hi>Iudas</hi> was not yet known,<note place="margin">Why Christ did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>Iudas.</hi>

nor scandalous; for though it was known to some of
the Priests, yet it was not known to the Disciples;
and though it was known to Christ, as he was God,
or else by revelation, as he was man, yet it was
not publickly known; and though it had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
yet without admonition, conviction, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
he should not have been Excommnnicate.
Therefore Christ bids them all eat and drink; but yet
by this he doth not give way, that such as are notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and scandalously wicked, should be admitted to the
Sacrament without repentance; especially obstinate
despisers of admonition; but onely that such as are
admitted, though Hypocrites; should not refuse to eat
and drink.</p>

2. Of them who were excluded from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

                     <hi>Q.</hi> Was excommunication used onely among Christians?</p>
                  <p>A. No; for the <hi>Iewes</hi> had this punishment among

out of their Synagogue; and threatning to do the

                     <hi>Q.</hi> What benefit hath the Church by excommunication?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By this the Word, Sacraments, and other things
are kept holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vindicated from profanation;
Swine are kept off from treading upon Pearles, and
Dogs from tearing us; the sheep are kept within their
fold, the lost sheep is recovered, the prodigal Son is
brought home, the reputation of the Churches holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is kept up, and all occasion of obloquie cut off;
the body is preserved by cutting off the gangrened
member, and the tree prospers by lopping off the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred
branches; and the contagion is stayed from
creeping further, which without this remedy
would infect others; men by this are deterred
from sinne; by this also Gods anger is appeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and his judgement removed of averted,
and our communion with God is renewed
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:97888:226"/>
and confirmed. Therefore we are commanded <hi>Deut.
13. to remove the evil from amongst us, and to depart out of
Babylon; and not to communicate with the unfruitfull
works of darknesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Are excommunicate persons members of the Church?</p>
                  <p>A. As they are excommunicate, they are not
members; for how can they be members of the
Church, from whose Union and Society they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated;
or how can <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans</hi> be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church, for such are excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to be accounted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet in respect of their faith,
which is not quite extinguished, and as they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the external government of the Church, they
may be called members thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Are we Protestants justly excommunicate by the
Pope?</p>
                  <p>A. 1. No; for we are not Hereticks, but Orthodox
Professors. 2. He hath no power to exclude us out
of the Church, who himself is scarce a member of the
Church. 8. Tis no wonder that we are rejected by
those who seem to be the onely builders, whereas
<hi>Christ himself the chief corner stone, was rejected by the
builders.</hi> 4. By being excommunicate from <hi>Babylon,</hi>
we are made members of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and indeed we
had not been partakers of the true light, so long as
we remained in darknesse; nor had we been the
servants of Christ, so long as we served Antichrist. 5.
<hi>No sooner had the Hirelings cast out Christs sheep out of the
fold, but Christ the true Shepheard found them out, and
brought them home with joy:</hi> So the blind man, <hi>Ioh</hi> 9.
was no sooner cast out of the Synagogue, but he was
received and entertained by Christ. So we have
gained Heaven by being excommunicate from <hi>Rome;</hi>
and <hi>Balaams</hi> curse is turned to a blessing.</p>
                  <p>Q. What hath <hi>Rome</hi> got by Excommunication?</p>
                  <p>A. Though she kept the world a while in awe,
and thereby got wealth, yet by her excommuica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
she hath lost more then she hath got; for she
lost all the Eastern Countries, when Pope <hi>Victor</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately
excommunicated the Eastern Churches
about the matter of Easter. What the Popes got by
excommunicating the <hi>German</hi> Emperors, and <hi>French</hi>
                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:97888:226"/>
Kings, Histories can tell us; they lost <hi>England</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and his Protestant
Children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Who are to be Excommunicate?</p>
                  <p>A. 1. Not <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> but <hi>Christians;</hi> for we
are not to judge them who are without, but if any be
called a brother, who is a fornicator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Not
every sinful brother, but he who sins of perversenesse,
after admonition; for he doth wilfully by his sinnes
separate himself from God, therefore deserves to be
separate from the Church, by excommunication; and
consequently to be delivered over to Satan, who
reignes without the Church, as Christ doth within;
and this delivering over is to the destruction of the
flesh, that is of the Old Man, or body of sin; but that
the spirit may be saved, that is, that Grace or the New
Man may be strengthened. 3. A brother must not
be excommunicate for every sin, but for that which
is publick and scandalous; private sins are to be
punished by him who knowes all secrets. 4. A Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must be excommunicate for his own sins, but not
for the sins of another; every man must bear his own
burthen; therefore Bishop <hi>Auxlius,</hi> was justly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Saint <hi>Austin Epist.</hi> 75. for excommunicating
the whole Family for the Masters offence alone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Can excommunication consist with Charity?</p>
                  <p>A. Yes; for there can be no greater charity then
to save the soul; but the end of excommunication is
to save the soul or the spirit; it is charity to keep a
man from blaspheming; but <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>
were delivered up to Satan, that they might learne
not to blaspheme. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. it is charity to stay an

5.</hi> It is charity to keep a man from eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own damnation, but unworthy eaters of the
Sacrament, eat their own damnation, if they be not
suspended, or kept off by excommunication.</p>
                  <p>Q. Is the Civil Magistrate prejudiced by the censure of
excommunication?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:97888:227"/>
A. No; for the weapon of the Magistrate is the
Sword, but the Minister useth onely the Word. The
end of the Ministers censure is to save the sinner. The
end of the Magistrates is to kill the sinner; The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
is content to receive the sinner into the Church
again upon his repentance; but the Magistrate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
not the repentance and sorrow of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor;
the Minister takes notice of many sinnes,
which the Magistrate doth not, because they are such
as trouble not the State, as private grudges of
Neighbours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There be also Magistrates that
wink many times at great sinnes, as for example
drunkenesse, which the Minister should not forbeare
to censure.</p>
                  <p>Q. May the Minister, or Presbytery excommunicate any
man without the consent of the Church?</p>
                  <p>A. No; for excommunication, or separation from
the body of Christ, is of that consequence, that it
concerns all to take notice of it; but the Minister may
suspend from the Sacrament without the Churches
consent, such as he knows are scandalous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane;
and this he ought to doe though the Church
should refuse to assent; for he is commanded not to
give that which is holy to Dogs; nor must he suffer
any of his stock to eat his own damnation; this is to
put the Sword into his hand that would kill himself;
which is to be guilty of his sin. <hi>Qui no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Q.</hi> From what things can we not be excommunicate?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. From the love of God in Christ Jesus our
Lord no man can separate us; for the foundation of
God remaineth sure. 2. Nor from the practise of
those duties which are grounded on the Lawes of
nature, can we be hindered by excommunication;
such as are the duties of Husbands and Wives, Fathers
and Children, Masters and Servants. Princes and
People; therefore the Popes excommunication can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
loose people from their alleageance to their
Prince. 3. Nor can excommunicate persons be
hindered from practising such things as are grounded
on the Law of Nations, such as traffique and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
for an excommunicate person must be to us
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:97888:227"/>
as a <hi>Publican</hi> and <hi>Heathen,</hi> but with such the <hi>Iewes</hi>
might have commerce and traffique. 4. Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
doth not debar us from exercising the
workes of charity; for we are bound to feed the
hungry, and not suffer them to starve because they
are excommunicate. 5. Excommunication doth
not debar us from hearing the word, except we be
scoffers of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Is the Christian Magistrate subject to the censure of
excommunication?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for though he be a Father as he is a
Prince, yet he is a Brother as he is a Christian; and
therefore lyable to be censered as a brother. Hence
King <hi>Vzziah</hi> was excommunicate by the Priest
<hi>Azariah,</hi> and <hi>Theod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Will it follow that there must be no excommunication,
because Christ will not have the Tares plucked up till
the Harvest?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. No; for Christ speaketh there of Hypoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>its
which cannot be plucked up by the Church, because
she knoweth them not; but in the great Harvest,
they shall be pluckt up by the Angels, at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
who knows the secrets of the heart. 2. If the
place be meant of Hereticks, they are not to be pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up at such times, as may endanger the Churches
peace, but they must be left to a convenient time,
when the Church may excommunicate them without
danger; or else left to the judgement of the great
day. 3. All Tares cannot be pluckt up, whilest the
Church is here Militant; for there will be found still
some Tares amongst the Corn; some Goats among
the Sheep; a <hi>Iudas</hi> among the Apostles; as there
were <hi>Cananites</hi> and <hi>Iebusites</hi> among the <hi>Israelites.</hi> 4.
Christ by this condemns their rashnesse, who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
go to pluck up and flye to excommunication, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they use reproofe and admonition.</p>

of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. He cannot by his own power, but by the
power of him whose Minister he is, 2. He cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any man from Heaven, but he can pronounce
and declare that such a man is excluded thence.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> Can the delivering of a man over to Satan, be a
means to save his spirit?</p>
                  <p>A. Yes accidentally: for God can draw good out
of evil, and light out of darknesse; thus the bufferings
which <hi>Paul</hi> suffered by the Angel of Satan, caused him
to pray heartily: it is the special work of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to save our souls by affliction and misery.</p>

Brother?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for excommunication takes not away true
Brotherly love and affection; an excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may be shut out of Heaven, but not out of hope;
we may exclude him out of our Society, but not of
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are all allegoricall, and written according to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

Holy Ghost. And that the Old Testament is now of
no force. 3. That reason is the rule of faith. 4. That
Scripture binds us no further then the Spirit assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
us that such is Scripture. 5. That Scripture
should not be read to a mixt Congregation without
present exposition. 6. That God is the Author of
the pravity and sinfulnesse of mens actions. 7. That
Turks, Jewes, Pagans, and others are not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

of his divine essence. 11. That God is the onely
Spirit, and that Prince of the aire, who ruleth in the
children of disobedience. 12. That the soul dieth
with the body. 13. That reprobation cannot be
proved out of Scripture. 14. That there is no Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of persons in God. 15. That every creature is
God, as every drop in the River is water. 16. That
Christ is not essentially, but nominally God. 17.
That Christ was polluted with original sin. 18. That
Christ was true man when he created the world, yet
without flesh. 19. That Christ died onely for sinners,
and not for unbelievers; for sins past before our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,

That no man is damned but for unbeliefe, and that
man can satisfie for his own unbeliefe. 21. That Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
have the knowledge of Christ by the Sun,

Christs Divinity. 25. That Christ with the Church
of Jewes and Gentiles shall reigne one Earth a 1000
years in carnall pleasures. 26. That the Heathens
are saved without Christ. 27. That the Spirit of
God neither dwells nor works in any, but it is our
own spirit which both works in the children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
and sanctifies the Elect. 28. That God
seeth no sin in his Elect. 29. That a man baptized
with the Holy Ghost, knows all things, as God doth.

That <hi>Adam</hi> had died, though he had not sinned. 33.

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:97888:229"/>
not so much as in our natural estate. 38. That the
moral Law is of no use among Christians. 39. That
we are not justified by faith; and that neither
faith nor holinesse, nor repentance are required
in Christians. 40. That the childe of God can
no more sin, then Christ himselfe can. 41, That
there should be no fasting days under the Gospel. 42.
That God doth not chastise his children for sin. 43.
That God loves his children as well when they sin,
as when they do well, and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
his Wife sinned not. 44. That Gods children
ought not to ask pardon for their sinnes, for though
they have sin in the flesh, they have none in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
45. That the body of iniquity is the great
Antichrist mentioned in Scripture. 46. That men
shal have other bodies given them in the resurrection,

Heaven is empty of souls till the resurrection. 48. That
Infants shall not rise at all, yet Beasts and Birds shall
rise againe. 49. That after this life, there is neither
Heaven nor Hell, nor Devil; but Hell is in this

the Gospel. 52. That now many Christians, have
more knowledge then the Apostles had. 53. That
miracles necessarily attend the Ministry. 54 That
there ought to be no Churches built, nor should men

59. That the people should receive the Lords
Supper with their hats on; but the Ministers in giving it
should be uncovered. 60. That the Church of <hi>England</hi>
is Antichristian. 61. That there is no divine right

That it stands not with Gods goodness to damn his

That Christ hath not purchased eternal life for man,

84. It is not the Law, but the Gospel which

A woman committeth not adultery, in lying with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

90. There is no other seale but the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Sacraments are no seales at all. 91. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
may not put to death a murtherer, being a
member of the Church, till first he be cast out of the
Church. 92. The promises belong to sinners, as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and not as repenting sinners. 93. Apocrypha
books are canonical Scripture. 94. To use set forms
of prayer, even the Lords prayer, is Idolatry, 95. Bells,
Churches, and Church-yards, preaching in Pulpits,
in Gowns, by an hour-glasse, the names of our months
and days are all idolatry, 96. That the Apostles

100. That some in this life are perfect without all sin,
and need not pray for pardon. 101. That in God there
is some composition, and corporiety, and mutability

<seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
at this day, and first of the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>A. Though they maintain the same
Scriptures with us, the same Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Lords Prayer, and the three
Creeds, of the Apostles, of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:97888:231"/>
yet in many points they differ from other Churches,<note place="margin">Church of <hi>Rome</hi> different from other Churches about the Scriptures.</note>
which briefly are these. 1. They hold that <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thal</hi>
Books are for regulating our faith and manners,
of equal authority with the Canonical Scripture; such
are <hi>Iudith, Tobias,</hi> third and fourth of <hi>Esdras,</hi> the
Book of <hi>Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch,</hi> the Epistle of
<hi>Ieremie,</hi> the thirteenth and fourteenth Chapters of
<hi>Daniel,</hi> the Books of <hi>Macchab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is from the tenth verse of the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
2. They preferr the vulgar Latine Edition to
the Hebrew and Greek Texts. 3. They hold that
there is no necessity to translate the Scripture into
Vulgar languages. 4. That the Scripture is not to
be read of Lay-people, except of such as are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
judicious, and learned, and are authorised by
the Ordinary. 5. That the Masse is not to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in the Vulgar tongue. 6. That the sense and
interpretation of the Scripture depends upon the
Churches approbation. 7. That the Scriptures by
reason of their difficulty and obscurity, are not fit to
be read by the Laity, or to be judges of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
8. That the Scriptures have four different sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
namely the <hi>Literal, Allegorical, Tropological,</hi> and

9. That the Scriptures are not of absolute necessity
for the being of a Church, seeing there was a Church
from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> for the space of two thousand
years, without any Scripture, being onely guided and
instructed by traditions, without which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not perfect, as not containing all Doctrines
necessary to salvation.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 2. What are their Tenets concerning predestination, the
Image of God, Original sin, and Actual, and Free-will?</p>
                  <p>A. 1. They hold election mutable,<note place="margin">Romane Church different from others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> because the
Elect may totally fall from faith and righteousnesse.
2. That sin foreseen, was the cause of reprobation, in
respect of the positive act of condemnation; and some
of them hold that foreseen works were the cause of
election.<note place="margin">Gods Image, and Sinne.</note> 3. concerning the Image of God, they
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:97888:232"/>
hold that it consisteth most in charity, and that this
is, <hi>Gratia gratum faciens, Grace which makes us accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
and that it is a habit infused; whereas they say,
that <hi>Gratia gratis data,</hi> is the gift of Miracles. 4. That
man in the state of innocency, did not stand in need
of any special assistance, by which he might be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to good workes. 5. That original sin is not in
the understanding and will, but in the inferiour part
of the soul onely, which they call the flesh; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
and ignorance are onely infirmities, and
remainders of original sin. That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
was without original sin. That Infants dying in
original sin onely, are punished with the paine of
losse, not with the paine of sense. That original fin
is taken away by baptisme, and that in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it is remitted, and not imputed, or to be called
a sin, but onely as it is the cause and punishment of
sin; that some actual sins are of their own nature ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,
and some mortal. That the sin against the
holy Ghost is pardonable. 6. They hold that in
free-will is required, not onely a liberty from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
but also from necessity; that an unregenerate
man, can by his own strength, without Gods special
help,<note place="margin">See the above named Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and the Catechism of the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                     </note> perform some moral good, in which there may
be no sin found. That an unregenerate man hath
freedom of will in matters of salvation, though not
without the help of grace, so that he may hinder or
further his conversion, and may by his natural power
cooperate with grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 3. What are their opinions, concerning the Law of
God, concerning Christ, faith, justification, and good
works?</p>
                  <p>A. 1. They divide the two Tables so,<note place="margin">Romanists dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer about the Law of God, Christ, Faith, Iustification, and good works.</note> that they
make but three commandements in the first, and seven
in the second; making one commandement of the
first two, and two of the last. They hold that Idols
and Images are not the same, and that the Images of
Christ, and of the Saints may be worshipped without
Idolatry. That equivocation may be used in some
cases, and an officious lye. 2. Concerning Christ
they hold that he was not ignorant of any thing, and
that he did not attain to knowledge by learning:
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:97888:232"/>
That he descended truly into Hell, in respect of his
soul, and there preached to the Fathers in prison, and
delivered them from their <hi>Limbus,</hi> so that they had
nor as yet entered into Heaven, till Christ by his
death had opened the gates thereof, which <hi>Adam</hi>
shut by his sin: That Christ did merit by his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
not onely for us, but also for himself that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which he enjoyes after his Ascension: 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
faith, they say that Historical, miraculous, and
saving faith are one and the same; that the special
application of the promises of grace belongs not to
faith, but to presumption; That faith hath its resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
onely in the intellect, and not in the will.
That faith is an assent, rather then knowledge: That
justifying faith may be totally lost in the regenerate;
That true faith may be without charity: That we
are not justified by faith alone: That man by the
natural strength of free-will, can prepare himself for
future justification, being assisted by the holy Spirit.
In his preparation are contained these acts; namely,
<hi>Fear, Hope, Love, Repentance, a purpose to receive the
Sacrament, a resolvtion to live a new life, and to observe
Gods Commandements.</hi> 4. Concerning justification,
they say, that the first is when a sinner of a wicked
man is made good, which is by remission of sins, and
infusion of inherent righteousnesse. The second
justification is, when a just man becomes more just,
and this is in doing of good works, by the merit of
which, he can make himself more just. They say
Christ is the meritorious cause of our justification, but
the formal cause is either intrinsecal, and that is the
habit of infused grace; or extrinsecal, to wit, the
righteousnesse of Christ; or actual, which are our good
workes; so that here is a threefold formal cause: they
teach that justification consisteth not in the bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins, but also in the inward renovation of
the mind. That we are not onely justified, but also
saved by good works, as efficient causes. 5. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
good works, they teach that the good works of
just men are absolutely just, and in a manner perfect;
that a just man may fulfil the Law; that a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by works, not in the first, but second justification;
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:97888:233"/>
yet not without the assistance of grace.<note place="margin">See the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism of <hi>Trent,</hi> with <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and the other writers of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note>

                     </gap> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
man by the works of repentance may merit
the grace of justification <hi>ex congruo,</hi> as doing works
agreeing to the law of God; that they who are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the first justification, do merit life eternal by
their works <hi>ex condigno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. 4. What are their Tenets concerning pennance, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
prayer, and almes?</p>
                  <p>A. They teach that faith is no part of pennance;
That repentance may be totally lost:<note place="margin">Differ about Pennance, Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Prayers, and Almes.</note> That the parts
thereof are not mortification, and vivification, but
confession, contrition, and satisfaction. That pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is a Sacrament, that contrition is to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
partly to grace, partly to free-will. That it is
necessary to justification, and the cause of remission
of sins, and that by it all sins are pardonable. That
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ricular confession to the Priest is necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
us to God. That a sinner before baptism is
received into grace without his own satisfaction, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the satisfaction of Christ, but after baptisme, he
must make satisfaction himself. That after the fault
is forgiven, there remaines often times the guilt of
temporary punishment either here or in purgatory,
which must make satisfaction; that the punishments
of purgatory may be redeemed by fasting, prayers;
almes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Concerning fasting, They hold it a
sin, and deserving death, to eat of meats prohibited
by the Church. That fasting consisteth onely in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
from meat, not from drink. That the times
of fasting, chiefly Lent, are of Apostolical institution.
That fasti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g is satisfactory and meritorious. That the
tradition of the Church in such indifferent things,
obligeth the conscience. 3. Concerning prayer, They
say that it is meritorious, that the Canonical hours
of prayer should be observed, that they are to be said
or sung in Latine by the Clergy and Monks. That
the titles given to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> are true and holy.
That to prayer in the Quite ought to be joyned sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Organs, Trumpets, and other musical instruments.
4. Concerning almes, They hold that the giving
thereof is meritorious. That there is not onely a
corporal, but also spiritual almes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consisting in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:97888:233"/>
counselling,<note place="margin">See the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors above named.</note> teaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That almes may
be raised of ill gotten goods, and filthy lucre, as of
Whore-houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. 5. What opinions do they hold concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments?</p>
                  <p>A. They teach that the efficacy of the Sacraments
depends upon the intention of the giver.<note place="margin">Differ from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about the Sacrament.</note> That the
Sacraments are not seals to confirm the promises of
grace. That grace is contained in, and conferred by
the Sacraments <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and that the receivers
thereof, by their justifying vertue are saved: That
three Sacraments, namely, <hi>Baptisme, Confirmation,</hi> and
<hi>Order,</hi> do imprint an indelible character, form, or
figure, in the very substance of the soul; the cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of <hi>Baptisme</hi> is <hi>Passive,</hi> making a man capable of
all other Sacraments; that of <hi>Order</hi> is <hi>Active;</hi> that of
<hi>Confirmation</hi> is partly <hi>Active,</hi> partly <hi>Passive.</hi> That
there are seven Sacraments of the New Testament.
That all the Ceremonies used by them in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are necessary. 2. Concerning Baptisme, They
say that Lay-men and Women in case of necessity,
may Baptise. That the Baptisme of <hi>Iohn</hi> was not the
same with that of Christ, nor had the same efficacy,
and that after <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptisme, it was necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christs Baptisme. That to Water in Baptisme
should be added Oyle, Spittle, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The signe
of the Crosse, Exorcisme, Exsufflation, a White Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Baptized Infants have, if not Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
yet Habitual Faith infused into them. That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
cannot be saved without Baptisme; that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
began to be absolutly necessary on the day of
Pentecost. That it totally abolisheth original sin. 3.
Concerning the Eucharist, They say, that onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened
bread is to be used. That Christ by way of
<hi>Concomitance</hi> is wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lly in the Bread; that is, his
Body, Blood, Soul, Divinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the whole
Essence of the Sacrament is in the Bread alone. That
there is no necessity to communicate under both
kinds. That the Wine ought necessarily to be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Water. That the Priest may participate
alone. That the Eucharist is profitable for the dead.
That the Bread should be dipt into the Wine, that
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:97888:234"/>
it should be elevated, carried in Procession, adored,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That there is no trope in these words, <hi>This is
my body,</hi> &amp;c. That Christs Body is not onely really,
but substantially in the Sacrament. That it may be
at one time in many places. That the Bread is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiated
into Christs body. That the form of
consecration consisteth in these words, <hi>This is my body.</hi>
That the Mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the
quick and the dead. 4. Concerning <hi>Confirmation,
Pennance, Extream Vnction, Orders,</hi> and <hi>Matrimony.</hi>
They teach that these are Sacraments properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
that there is vertue in <hi>Extream Vnction,</hi> either
to cure the body, or to do away the remainders of
sin; for this cause they anoint 6. parts of the body, to
wit the Eyes, Ears, Mouth, Hands, Reins, and
Feet.<note place="margin">See the former authors.</note> That <hi>Ordination</hi> is a Sacrament, as well in
<hi>Deacons, Sub-Deacons, Acoluthi, Exorcists, Readers</hi>
and <hi>Door-Keepers,</hi> as in Priests.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 6. What Ceremonies do they use in the five controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>A. In <hi>confirmation</hi> the Bishop anointeth the childs
forehead with chrisme,<note place="margin">Ceremonies used in the five con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> making the signe of the Crosse
thereon, and saying; <hi>I signe thee with the signe of the
Crosse, and confirme thee with the chrisme of salvation, in
the Name of the Father</hi> &amp;c. Then he strikes him on
the cheeke, to shew he must not refuse to suffer for
Christ. In <hi>Pennance,</hi> the Bishop goeth to the Church
door where the Penitents lie prostrate on the ground,
saying: <hi>Children come to me, and I will teach you the feare
of the Lord.</hi> Then he kneeleth and prayeth for them;
and having used some words of admonition, he brings
them into the Church; this is done on the day of
the Lords Supper, that they might be partakers
thereof; all the Church doors are then opened to
shew that all people have accesse to Christ. The
Penitents being received into the Church, cut their
Haire and Beards, and lay aside their penitentiall
garments, and put on clean cloathes, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he was delivered out of pris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n.
This casting off their old cloathes puts them in minde
of putting off the old man. In <hi>Extream Vnction</hi> the
Priest first besprinkleth the sick person, and the whole
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:97888:234"/>
roome with holy water; then he anointeth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of the five senses, because by them sin infecteth
the soul; the reines also and feet are anointed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
the sins that are in the concupiscible and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
faculties. They onely must be anointed of
whom there is no hope of recovery. Of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
used in <hi>Sacred Orders,</hi> we will speak hereafter.
In <hi>Matrimony</hi> the Priest blesseth the married couple
with prayers, and oblations if they were never
married before; but they are not to blesse the second
marriage. The Woman is covered with a vaile,
after the example of <hi>Rebecca;</hi> and to shew her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the man, she is united to the man by a
Lace or Ribband tied in a knot,<note place="margin">See besides the above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med authors <hi>Eckius</hi> in his homilie upon this subject.</note> by a Ring also put
on the fourth finger of the left hand, because of the
veine that reacheth from thence to the heart; signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the mutual love that ought to be between
them; but marriages are not to be celebrated in
Lent, and other times of humiliation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 7. What are their Tenets concerning the Saints in
Heaven?</p>
                  <p>A. They register their names in their Calendars
after the Pope hath canonised them,<note place="margin">Roman Church differeth from others about the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> or given a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their Sanctity, and decreed honours for
them; namely publick Invocation, dedication of
Altars and Temples to them, oblation of Sacrifices,
celebration of Festival days, setting up of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
and reservation of their Reliques. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
they give to God is called by them <hi>Latria,</hi> that
of the Saints is <hi>Dulia;</hi> but the honour which
they give to Christs humanity and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is
<hi>Hyperdulia.</hi> 2. They say that the Saints make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
for us, not immediately to God, but
through Christ they obtain their requests. 3. That
we ought to invocate both Saints and Angels. 4.
That their Images are to be worshipped; that the
Images of Christ, and of the Saints are not Idols, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Idols are representations of that which is not,
and in Scripture the word Idol is spoken onely of
Heathen Images; that it is not unlawful to represent
God by such Images as he hath described himself;
therefore they pain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> God in the form of an old man,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:97888:235"/>
the Holy Ghost in the form of a Dove. That though
the Images of Christ and the Apostles, are to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in relation to the persons which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
yet we must not think there is any Divinity in
them, or that they can help us; or that we ought to
aske any thing of them. 5. That the Images of
Christ and the Saints should be placed in Churches,
because the Images of the <hi>Cherubims</hi> were placed in
<hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, and before in the Tabernacle. 6.
That the Reliques of Christ and of the Saints are to be
honoured, and kissed, as holy pledges of our Patrons,
yet not to be adored as God, nor invocated as Saints.
7. That the true Crosse of Christ, the Nailes, the
Thornes,<note place="margin">Of these passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges see <hi>Thomas</hi> in his summes, <hi>Gregory, de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anine,</hi> and the others above named.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by way of of analogy, and reduction
are to be worshipped with the same kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
or <hi>Latria</hi> that Christ is; that the signe of the
Crosse in the forehead, or in the aire, is a Sacred and
venerable signe, powerful to drive away evil spirits.
8. That Pilgrimages ought to be undertaken to those
holy places, where the Images and Reliques of Christ
and of the Saints are kept. 9. That days should be
kept holy in memory of the Saints, the observation
of which is a part of divine worship.</p>
                  <p>Q. 8. What is their Doctrine concerning the Church?</p>
                  <p>A. They teach that the government of the Church
is Monarchical,<note place="margin">Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church.</note> as being the most excellent form of
government. That the government of the Church
was founded on the Person of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> That
<hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so continued till his
death. That the Pope is <hi>Peters</hi> Successor, and Christs
Vicar, by whom he is made head of the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant.
That the Pope is not Antichrist, but that
the great Antichrist shall be a particular man, of the
Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> who shall reign in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> three
years and a half, and shall be acknowleged by the
<hi>Iewes</hi> as their Messiah, whom he will make believe
that he is of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and descended of
<hi>David.</hi> 2. They hold that the Pope is the supream
Judge in controversies of Faith, and manners; that
his judgement is certain and infallible; that he can
erre in particular controversies of fact, depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mans testimony, and that he may erre as a private
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:97888:235"/>
Doctor in questions of right, as well of faith as of
manners; but that he cannot erre, when with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council he makes decrees of faith, or general
precepts of manners; and that the Pope is to be
obeyed, though either by himself, or by a particular
Council<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, he erre in some doubtful matters: but they
generally now believe, that though the Pope were
an Heretick, yet he cannot prescribe or define any
Heretical Doctrine, to be believed by the whole
Church. That the Pope hath a spiritual coactive ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
in making Laws to bind the conscience, by
his sole authority, without the consent of Priests or
people, and that he can judge and punish the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
of his Laws. That as, the Apostles had
their immediate authority from Christ, so the Bishops
have the same immediately from the Pope. That
the Pope hath a supream power over the temporal
estates of Christians, to depose Kings, and dispose of
their Kingdoms in order to spiritual things, and so
far, as it is necessary to the salvation of souls. That
it is not repugnant to Gods word, for the same man
to be both a Political and Ecclesiastical Prince, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Melchisedech, Moses, Eli, Samuel,</hi> and the <hi>Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi>
exercised both powers. 3. They believe that
the true Church of Christ is onely that Society which
acknowledgeth the Pope to be head thereof, and
Christs Vicar upon earth. That they which are not
baptized, and the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> are not properly and
actually members of the Church, but onely in possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
That Hereticks, Schismaticks, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
persons are not members of the Church.
That reprobates are members of the militant Church,
<hi>Because in</hi> Noah's <hi>Ark were unclean beasts, in the same
Net are good and bad fishes, at the same Wedding-feast, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were called, but few chosen; in the same Sheep-fold are
same Goats; in the same house are vessels of dishonour,</hi>
Judas <hi>was one of the Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. That the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church is always visible; for it is compared to
a Mountain, to a Candle, to a City on a Hill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
That the true visible Church can never fail totally,
<hi>Because it is built on a Rock, against which, Hell Gates
cannot prevaile</hi> &amp;c. That the true Church cannot
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:97888:236"/>
fall into errour, <hi>Because it is the Pillar and ground of
truth,</hi> &amp;c. That the true notes of the Church are, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversality,
Antiquity, Continuance, Multitude, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Bishops from the Apostles Ordination, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in Doctrine, Unity among the members them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and with their head, soundnesse of doctrine,
power and efficacy of doctrine holinesse of life, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
the light of prophesie, the testimony of her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,<note place="margin">See the above named au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</note>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 9. What do they hold concerning Councils, Monks,
Magistrates, and Purgatory?</p>
                  <p>A. They teach that Diocesan Councils are to be
convocated by the Bishops;<note place="margin">Romanists dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer about Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Monks, Magistrates and Purgatory.</note> Provincial by Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
National by Patriarchs or Primates, but General
Councils by the Pope alone, and not by the Emperor
without the Popes approbation; except it be when
the Pope is either imprisoned, or dead, or mad; in
such cases the Cardinals may call a Council. That
ordinarily Bishops have the power of decisive suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages,
but by custome and priviledge; Cardinals, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots,
and Generals of orders, have the same power,
though they be not Bishops. That in a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
should be present all Bishops, at least of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Provinces, except any be excommunicate. That
the Pope and the four Patriarchs, of <hi>Constantinople, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,
Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or their Deputies, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
present, and at least some of the greater part of
Provinces. That the Pope is the supream President, and
Judge of Councils. That Christians are bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the decrees of Councils. That General and
particular Councils confirmed by the Pope, cannot
erre. That the Scripture is above Councils, as it is
the infallible word of God, but in respect of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
it is dependent from Councils. That the
Pope is above Councils, and not to be judged by any.
2. Concerning Monks, they teach that their original
is of Divine right; That their institution is grounded
upon Evangelical Counsel, not precept. That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
are not commanded but commended to us; that
commands are of things easie to be performed, and
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:97888:236"/>
taken out of the principles of nature; Counsels are
of things difficult, and above nature, and of things
better then those of commands. By precepts we are
tied to obedience, by Counsels we are left to our
Free-will; Precepts have their rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but Counsels have no punishments, but great
rewards: <hi>Hence arise the works of Supererogation.</hi> That
children if they be come to years of puberty, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a Monastery without their Parents consent, if
so be their Parents need not their help. And so may
Wives, without their Husbands consent. That Vowes
though of things not commanded,<note place="margin">Who would see more at lenght the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> let him read the above named au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; and withall <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, P. Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, Canus, Canisius, Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander, Alphen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus de Castro, Coccius, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brard, Gerson, Gretzerus, Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez, Turrianus, Vasquez, Hugo de</hi> S. <hi>Victore,</hi> and others.</note> are a part of Gods
worship. That the promise made in baptisme, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Devil, the VVorld and the Flesh, is not
properly a Vow. That the Vows of poverty, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and continency, are lawful. That the Pope may
dispense with Vows. That the habits and shaving of
Monks, are of great use and antiquity. 3. Concerning
Magistrates, they teach that their Laws doe no lesse
bind the conscience, then Divine or Ecclesiastick
Laws. That Magistrates are subject and inferiour to
the Clergy in matters of Religion. That Magistrates
may inflict death on Hereticks. 4. Concerning Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
they say, that it is one of these four contigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Roomes under ground; the lowermost is hell,
where the pain of losse and sence is eternal. The next
above that is Purgatory, where pain of losse &amp; sence
is temporary. Above that is the Receptacle of Infants,
where onely is the pain of losse eternal. The upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
was that of the Fathers, where was onely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
pain of losse; now it is empty since Christs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
thither. That in Purgatory are those souls which
depart hence with venial sins, or whose sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
but not the punishment. That the suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so called from <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> the country where it
was first woven, is a garment with long and large
sleeves, representing the Crosse; <hi>Chiro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hecae</hi> are white
gloves of Kids skins; <hi>Mitra</hi> is the Mytre or Ornament
of the head; <hi>Annulus</hi> is the Ring which the Bishop
wears, to shew he is betrothed to Christ; <hi>Baculus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storalis,</hi>
is the Bishops crosier staff; <hi>Pallium,</hi> or the
<hi>Pall,</hi> is the Ornament of Arch-Bishops and Patriarchs.
The <hi>Pall</hi> is not to be worn but in the Church, and in
time of Masse; yet Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> permitted it to be
worn in solemn Letanies out of the Church: upon it
are four red crosses, signifying the four Cardinal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
justice, prudence, fortitude, &amp; temperance, which
ought to be in Prelates, which vertues are not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God, but as they are sanctified by the crosse
of Christ, in which onely they should glory with the
Apostle; for the Gentiles had these vertues, but knew
not Christ nor his crosse. There are also in the <hi>Pall</hi>
three pins or bodkins, signifying the three Christian
vertues of faith, hope, and charity, without which he
cannot justly claim or retain his <hi>Pall;</hi> they may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
also a three-fold pricking, or compunction
which ought to be in Prelates. 1. Of compassion
towards those that are in miserie. 2. Of care in the due
and conscionable execution of their office. 3. Of
feare to offend God. 4. Their worship consisteth in
the Masse, where we have many ceremonies; first the
Bishop or Priest before he begins, sings five Psalmes:
then he combs his head, and washeth his hands, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the aspersion of holy water, then is the <hi>Introi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

or singing at the Priests approaching towards the
Altar; whilest the <hi>Introitus</hi> is singing, the Priest or
Bishop walketh towards the Altar between a Priest
and a Deacon, before whom walketh the Sub-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
carrying the Book of the Gospel shut; before
whom march two Taper bearers, and before them is
carried the Censer with incense. When the Priest or
Bishop comes to the Altar, he takes off his Mytre,
makes confession, openeth the book and kisseth it.
Over the Bishop also, a linnen cloth full of pictures is
carried by four Ministers in form of a canopy. In their
four solemn Processions, to wit, at <hi>Candlemas, Palme-Sunday,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:97888:238"/>
Easter,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ascention</hi> day, they have crosse in ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
seven Tapers borne by seven <hi>Acolyths,</hi> seven <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>
following, then seven <hi>Priors,</hi> three <hi>Acolyths</hi> with
incense, one <hi>Sub-Deacon</hi> carrying the Gospel, then the
<hi>Bishop</hi> in great state, whom the people follow with
the <hi>Porters, Readers, Exorcists, Singers,</hi> &amp;c. Before the
Bishop or Priest ascends the Altar, he boweth himself
to the ground, and then confesseth; and during the
time of the Masse, he boweth his body eight times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Altar. After confession and absolution, the
Priest blesseth the incense, and puts it in the censer;
then he kisseth the Altar and the Book, and takes the
censor from the Deacon, with which he sumeth the
Altar, and then removeth to the right side of the
same, and withal <hi>Kyrie Eleeson</hi> is said, not lesse then
nine times in the Masse. <hi>Gloria in Excelsis</hi> is also sung,
which was the Angelical Hymne at Christs Nativity;
then the Priest turning to the people, salutes them in
these words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>The Lord be with you;</hi> to whom the Quire
answereth, <hi>And with thy Spirit.</hi> Seven times in the
Masse the Priest salutes the people, but turneth to
them onely five times. Then the collects or prayers
are said, and after them the Epistle is read, with the
face towards the Altar; its the Sub-Deacons office
to read the Epistle; which done, he delivers the
Book (shut to the Bishop, who layeth his hand on
the Sub-Deacon) which he kisseth. Alter the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
is sung the <hi>Gradual,</hi> so called from the steps of
humility, by which we ascend to Heaven; it's called
also the <hi>Responsory,</hi> because the matter thereof an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
the matter of the Epistle. Next to this, <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah</hi>
is sung, but from <hi>Septuagesima</hi> Sunday till <hi>Easter,</hi>
in stead of <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> the <hi>Tractus</hi> is sung, so called a
<hi>Trabend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> because it is sung with a long drawing tone,
as containing the mournful condition of man in this
life, as <hi>Hallelujah</hi> is the joyful song of Heaven. After
<hi>Hallelujah,</hi> is sung the prose which by them is called
<hi>Sequentia,</hi> it is a song of exaltation. This done, the
Priest removeth from the right to the left side of the
Altar, whence the Deacon takes the Gospel, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
into a high place, where he reads it, with his
face to the North; the crosse, the censer, and two lights

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 11. What is their manner if dedicating Churches?</p>
                  <p>A. In the Church to be dedicated or consecrated,
are painted twelve Crosses on the walls, before which
burne twelve Tapers. The Bishop in his Pontificalls
with his Clergy; and the people come to the Church
door being shut, where he prayeth, and then besprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the walls with holy water, whilest the Clergy
and people goe singing about the Church. The holy
water is sprinkled out of a bundle of Hysope. Then
the Bishop with his whole Traine returning to the
Church-porch prayeth again, and with his crosier
staffe knocketh the door thrice, saying these words:
<hi>Lift up your heads O ye Gates, and be ye lift up ye ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
doors,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Romanists their manner of dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of Churches.</note> 
                     <hi>and the King of glory shall come in.</hi> Of whom
the Deacon within the Church asketh, <hi>Who is the
King of glory?</hi> to whom the Bishop answereth: <hi>The
Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battell.</hi> Then
the door is opened, the Bishop with three of his
servants entereth, the rest remain without; after-the
Bishop hath wished peace three times to that
house, the door is shut again, and he on his knees
before the Altar prayeth, whilest the Clergy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sings the Letanie, and the Priests carry on their
shoulders a Chest, or Coffin, containing the Reliques
of that Saint to whom the Church is dedicated. The
Altar with all belonging to it are sanctified, the
walls with certain letters are painted; Salt, Water,
Ashes and Wine are exorcized, and mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
into which he dipps his thumb, and makes
the signe of the Crosse on the Altar, Walls and Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Then he offers incense, and blesseth the Church
in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> this
being done, the Bishop before the Church door
preacheth to the people concerning the anniversary
dedication of that Church, of honour due to the
Clergy, of tenths also and obl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tions. After Sermon
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:97888:239"/>
all are admitted into the Church singing. The
twelve Lights and twelve Crosses, do signifie the
Doctrine of the twelve Apostles which shineth in the
Church, by which they preached the Crosse of Christ:
The Bishop representeth Christ making intercession
for his Church, and by the Staffe of his word knocking
at the door of our hearts. His compassing the Church
three times, and his three times knocking at the
door, signifie his three fold power, in Heaven, Earth;
and Hell. And his threefold right or interest he
hath in us, to wit, by Creation, by Redemption, and
by the gift of life eternal promised to us. The mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Greeke and Latine Letters with a Crosse on the
Pavement with ashes, shew that the Gentiles are
made partakers of the Crosse of Christ, but not the
Jewes; besides that the rudiments and alphabet of
Christianity must be taught to the weaker sort; the
Oyle, Salt, Water, Ashes, and VVine which are used
in the dedication, have mystical significations. The
VVater and VVine represent the two Sacraments of
Baptisme and the Eucharist. Oyle sheweth our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
unction; Salt that wisdome which should be in
us; Ashes our mortification; Hysop our purity and
sanctification; and the Incense our prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 12. What else is Observable in the dedication of
Churches?</p>
                  <p>A. 1. They hold that no Church is to be dedicated
till it be endowed;<note place="margin">What observable thereupon:</note> for he that buildeth a Church, is,
or should be like a Husband that marrieth a Maid, on
whom he ought to bestow a joynter. 2. That the
Feast of dedication which from the Greeke, they call
<hi>Encaenia,</hi> ought to be kept every year; for so it was
kept among the Jewes, which if it had been unlawful,
Christ would not have honoured it with his presence.
3. They say that the dedication of Churches is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to evil spirits, and incitment to devotion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence;
a meanes to move God to hear our prayers
the sooner; a testimony of our zeal, that Christians
are not in this point inferiour to Jewes and Gentiles,
who would not presume to make use of their
Temples for prayer, and sacrifice, till first by their
Priests they had consecrated and dedicated them to
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:97888:239"/>
their Deities. 4. That what is in the dedication of
Churches visibly acted, ought to be in us invisibly
effected, namely, that if Churches be holy, we should
not be profane; shall they be consecrated to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, and not we? shall their Churches be
filled with hallowed Images, and our souls defiled
with unhallowed imaginations? shall the Church be
called the house of prayer, and our bodies (which
ought to be the Temples of the Holy Ghost) denns of
Theeves? we are lively stones, but those of Churches
are dead; we are capable of grace and holinesse, so
are not Churches; for it is confessed on all sides, that
Temples by consecration are not made capable of
actual holinesse, but onely made more fit for divine
service. Is it not a great shame that in their Churches
lights continually shine: and in the Temples of the
holy Ghost, there is nothing but darknesse? That
they should burne incense on their Altars: and we
be quite destitute of Zeale and Devotion in our
hearts? They make use of outward unction, but
we use neither the outward unction of the Church,
not the inward of the spirit? VVhen we see them
make use of Salt and Holy VVater, we should be
careful to have salt within us, and that water of the
spirit, without which we cannot be regenerated. 5.
They teach that Churches may be rededicated if
they are burned down or fallen down,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>But of this subject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, read</hi> Durandus &amp; Durantus, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recremata, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiensis, Hugo de S.

or if it be doubtful whither they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
heretofore; but if they be polluted by adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
or such like uncleannesse, they are only to be
purified with holy water. 6. That Churches must
not be consecrated without Masse, and the Reliques
of some Saint, and that onely by the Pope or a
Bishop, not by a Priest or any inferiour order; and
that gifts or presents which they call <hi>Anathemata,</hi> be
given to the new Church; after the example of
<hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, who endowed with rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
and ornaments the Church which he built at
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> to the honour of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Q. 13. How doe they Dedicate or Consecrate their
Altars?</p>
                  <p>A. The Bishop having blessed the water, makes
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:97888:240"/>
with the same four Crosses on the four Hornes of the
Altar,<note place="margin">Their consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Altars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> to shew that the Crosse of Christ is preached
in all the four corners of the earth. Then he goeth
about the Altar seven times, and besprinkleth it seven
times with holy water and hysop; this is to signifie
the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, and the seven-fold
shedding of Christs Blood; to wit, 1. VVhen he was
circumcised. 2. When he sweat blood in the Garden.
3. When he was scourged. 4. When he was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with thorns. 5. When his hands. 6. When his
feet were nailed to the Crosse. &amp; 7. When his side was
lanced. The Bishop also makes a Crosse in the middle
of the Altar, to shew that Christ was crucified in the
middest of the earth; for so <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is seated. At
this consecration is used not onely water, but salt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
wine, and ashes, to represent four things necessary
for Christianity; namely, Purity, Wisdom, Spiritual
joy, and Humility. The Altar must not be of wood,
or any other materiall, but of stone; to represent
Christ the Rock on which the Church is built, the
Corner Stone, which the builders refused, the stone
of offence at which the Jewes stumbled, and the
little stone cut out of the mountain without hands;
this stone Altar is anointed with oyle and chrisme,
so was Christ with the graces of the spirit, and the
oyle of gladnesse above his fellowes. This anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also of the stone Altar, is in initation of <hi>Iacobi</hi>
anointing the stone on which he sleept. So the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the holy water is poured out at the
foot of the Altar, because the Priests of old used to
pour out the blood of the Sacrifice at the foot of
their Altar. The holy Reliques are layed up in a
Coffin with three graines of incense, as the Manna of
old was layd up in the Ark; our hearts should be the
Coffins in which the vertuous lives of the Saints
with faith in the Trinity, or with the three Cardinal
vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, should be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
kept. These Reliques are layed under the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;
because <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. the souls of these who suffered
for Christ were seen by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> under the Altar.
It is also to be observed that as the Altar is besprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with water, so it is anointed in five places with
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:97888:240"/>
oyle, and then with chrisme, to signifie the five
wounds of Christ which did smell more fragrantly
than any Balsame, and by which we are healed; the
five sences also are hereby signified, which ought
to be sanctified. After unction, incense is burned,
to shew that prayers and supplication follow sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
At last after the Altar, and all that belong
to it are hallowed, the Altar is covered with white,
Masse is said, and Tapers lighted; to shew that our
holinesse and devotion must be accompanied with
good works,<note place="margin">See the former Authors.</note> which must shine before men here, if
we would shine like stars in the Firmament here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Q. 14. What else do they consecrate besides Temples and
Altars.</p>
                  <p>A. Besides these they consecrate all the ornaments of
the Altar; the <hi>Patinae,</hi> for making the body of Christ;
the <hi>Corporal</hi> for the covering thereof; the <hi>Chalice</hi> for
the blood; the <hi>Linnen</hi> with which the Altar is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
the <hi>Eucharistial</hi> or Pix where Christs body is
kept, representing Christs sepulchre; the <hi>Censer, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,</hi>
and <hi>Capsae,</hi> that is Chests or Coffins wherein the
bones of the Saints are kept. They consecrate also
their Crosses and Images, and <hi>Easter Tapers,</hi> their
<hi>Fonts, First-fruits, holy Water,</hi> Salt, Church-yards, Bells,
&amp;c. Every one of which have their peculiar prayers;
besides, washing, crossing, anointing incense, &amp;c. They
hold that Bells succeeded the Jewish Trumpets; by
which we are awaked, and admonished to put on the
armour of God, to fortifie our selves with prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our spiritual enemies. Bells are more durable
then Trumptes, and their sound louder, by which is
signified that the preaching of the Gospel exceedeth
that of the Law, both in continuance and efficacy.
<q>Bells have clappers, and Preacher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> have tongues;
it is a shame that the one should be vocal, and not
the other; how is that congregation served, which
hath sounding Bells, and dumb Preachers? or that
which hath sounding brass, and tinckling cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
for their Preachers; such as have clappers, but
no hands; good words, but no good works; which
preach to others, and are cast away themselves;
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:97888:241"/>
like Bels, they call upon others to hear Sermons, but
are not thereby bettered or edified themselves.</q> In
the Roman Church they baptize their Bells and give
them names, for this alledging the example of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
who gave the name of <hi>Bethel</hi> to <hi>Luz,</hi> the place where
he had the vision of the Ladder. Their Bells seldom
are heard in Lent, and three days before Easter are
quite silent, to shew the sadnesse of that time. Church
yards in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, Dormitories (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our bodies sleep there till the resurrection) are
consecrated with crosses, holy Water, fumigation and
prayers, as the Churches are; they be also as well as
Churches, Sanctuaries, and places of refuge; none
must be buried here, but Christians who have been
baptized; such as die without baptisme, or without
repentance after murther, adultery, selfe-homicide, or
any other grievous sin, though baptized, must not be
buried there. In the Church-yard are set up five
crosses, one whereof stands in the middle; before each
of them are placed three burning Tapers, fifteen in
all; the Bishop beginning at the middle crosse, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a speech, then prayeth, and puts the three Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
on the top of the crosse: the like he doth to all
the rest, and in the interim the Letany is sung, and
each crosse be sprinkled with holy Water and fumed
with incense.</p>

and to shew the spiritual light of knowledge, which

for the Eucharist. The Bishop doth instruct them in

Arch-Deacon delivereth to them a candlestick with
a wax light in it, and an empty tankard, to shew their

                  <p>A. These are three;<note place="margin">Their sacred orders.</note> the first is the Sub-Deacon whose
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffice is to read the Epistle, to receive the peoples
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:97888:242"/>
oblations, and to bring them to the Deacon; to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
also the Patin and Chalice to the Altar; to hold
the Bason whilest the Bishop, Priest, or Deacon wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
their hands before the Altar, to wash also the
Altar linnen. When the Bishop ordains him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
into his hand the empty Patin and Chalice, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>See whose ministration this is, which is delivered to
thee.</hi> From the Arch-Deacon he receiveth then the
Tankard with Wine and water, and the Towell. He
wears a Surplesse and Belt, as the four former orders
do. His Coat is girt to him, and he holds a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchef,
or towel. They say that Christ performed
the Sub-Deacons office when he turned water into
wine in <hi>Cana,</hi> and when after Supper he poured wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in to a Bason, and washed his Disciples feet. Their
second Sacred order is the Deacon, or Minister, whose
office is to preach to the people, and to serve o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

assist the Priest at the Sacraments; to cover the Altar,
to lay the oblations thereon, to read the Gospel, and
the Epistle also in the Sub-Deacons absence; in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
to carry the Crosse, to say the Let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nies;
to rehearse the names of those who are to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and baptized, and to name the holy days &amp;c. They
must not administer the Sacraments, but in case of
necessity, and by permission of the Bishop, or Priest;
nor must they without leave sit in the presence of a
Priest. VVhen the Deacon is ordained, the Bishop
alone layeth his hands on him, and blesseth him, and
delivers (using certain words) the Book of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and the <hi>Stola</hi> to him. VVhen he reads the Gospel
the <hi>Acolyths</hi> hold two Tapers before him; not to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate
the aire, by day, but to shew what joy and
Spiritual illumination we have by the Gospel. The
Censer also with the Incense is carried, not onely
to represent Christ, in the sweet smell of whose
Sacrifice the Father is well pleased; but also to she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Preachers that their prayers must like Incense ascend
before God, and that the good fame of their life and
Doctrine, must be like the fume of Incense smelling
sweetly among all men. The Deacon also reads the
Gospel in a high place, that it may be heard the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and to shew that it ought not to be preache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

corners, but as Christ saith, on the house topps; this
is also in imitation of Christ, who when he would
reach his Disciples went up into an high mountain.
The Gospel is read with the Deacons face against
the North, that the frosen and cold hearts of the
Northern Nations, might be warmed and melted by
the comfortable heat of this bright Sun of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
When the Deacon salutes the people, he signes
himself with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rosse on the forehead, to shew,
he is not ashamed of the Crosse of Christ; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
on the breast, to put us in minde that we
should be ready to crucifie our affections with Christ.
At the reading of the Gospel all stand up bare-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to shew their reverence; Swords and Staves are
laid aside, to shew their peacable mindes, and the
Book is kissed, to declare by this their love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Gospel. They say that Christ performed
the Deacons part when he preached and prayed for
his Apostles. Their third and highest Sacred order
is Priest-hood; when the Priest is ordained, the
Bishop with some other Priests lay their hands on his
head, and anoint his hands with oyle, to signifie
that not onely must the Priest have his head stuffed
with knowledge, but his hands must be supple and
ready to do good workes; the Bishop also delivers
into his hand the Chalice with the VVine, and the
Patin with the hoaft saying, <hi>Receive power to say Masse
for the quick and dead, and to offer Sacrifice to God in the
name of the Lord.</hi> Then the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

to shew he is his equal in respect of order; whereas,
the Deacon and Sub-Deacon kisse the Bishops hand,
to shew they are of an inferiour order. The Priest
must not say Masse, till he first have washed, and
confessed if he be guilty of any deadly sin, and have
put on first the <hi>Amictus,</hi> which like a vaile covers his
head and shoulders, to shew how Christs Divinity
was vailed by his humanity: 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

purity that ought to be in the Priests lives. 6. The
<hi>Casula</hi> over all the other garments, signifying charity
which is above all vertues. Christ exercised the
Priests office when he administred the Eucharist,
when he offered the Propitiatory Sacrifice of his body
on the Altar of the Crosse, and yet whilest he is mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intercession for us in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Q. 17. Wherein consisteth the office of the Bishop?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Under this name are comprehended Popes,
Patriarchs, Primats, Metropolitans, Arch-Bishops
and Bishops. Some will have the Bishop to be a
particular order; but indeed the order of Priest and
Bishop is all one, in respect of catechising, baptising,
preaching, administring the Eucharist, binding and
loosing. The Bishop then is an office of dignity, not
of order; he hath nine priviledges above the Priest,
namely, of Ordination, Benediction of Nuns, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of Bishops, and imposing hands on them,
Dedication of Churches, Degradation, holding of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
making of Chrisme, hallowing of Cloathes
and Vessells. Because Bishops are Superintendents
and Overseers, therefore they have the highest Seat
in the Church; they are consecrated on the Lords
day only, and at the third hour, because then the holy
Ghost descended on the Apostles,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See also</hi> Guli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. Durand. l. 2. c. 10.</note> to whom Bishops
have succeeded. At the Bishops consecation, there
must be present at least three, to wit two Bishops, and
the Metropolitan; that the gifts of the Spirit may not
seem to be give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> by stealth and in corners;<note place="margin">Office of the Bishop.</note> in this
they follow the example of Saint <hi>Iames;</hi> who was
made Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iehn.</hi>
In the Bishops consecration two hold the Bible over
his head, one pouring the benediction on him, and
the rest laying their hands on his head. By this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
is signified not onely the conferring of the
gifts of the spirit, but also the knowledge which the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:97888:243"/>
Bishop must have of the Gospel, and the care he must
undergoe to support it. On the Saturday in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
he is examined concerning his former life, and
the Trinity is three times called upon for a blessing.
The next morning he is examined concerning his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
conversation and faith; and then his head and
hands are annointed, and the Mytre is set on his head,
the Staffe also and Ring are given him. The Priest is
annointed with oyl, but the Bishop with chrism, that
is, Oyl and Balsome, to shew that the higher he is in
dignity, the more fragrant must his fame and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
be. He must excel in knowledge and good
works, represented by the annointing of his head
and hands. <q>Christ performed the Bishops office,
when he lifted up his hands, and blessed his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;</q>
saying, <hi>Receive the holy Ghost; whose sins you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
they are forgiven, &amp;c.</hi>

of the Star tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

day of the Lords supper, because then the chrisme is
consecrated; on the holy Sabbath till the eighth day
of the Ascension; on the Resurrection, because of the
Angel that appeared in white; on the Ascension day
because of the bright cloud that carried up Christ to
Heaven, and the two Angels then in white; on the
feast of dedication, because the Church is Christs
Spouse, which ought to be innocent and immaculate.
The Red colour is used in the Solemnities of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
Evangelists, and Martyrs, for they shed their
blood for Christ; in the Festivity of the Crosse, also
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:97888:244"/>
in Pentecost week, because the holy Ghost appeared
in fire: in some places white is worn on the Festivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Martyrs, because it is said <hi>Cant. 5. My beloved
is white and red.</hi> VVhite in his Confessors and Virgins,
Red in his Martyrs; these are the Roses and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the Valley. Black is worn upon Good Friday,
on all fasting days, on the Rogation days, in Masses for
the dead from Advent till the Nativity, and from
Septuagesima till Easter Eve; on <hi>Innocents</hi> day some
wear black, because of the mourning in <hi>Rama;</hi> some
red, because of the blood of those young Martyrs.
Green which is made up of the three former colours,
white,<note place="margin">See Durands Rationale, L. 3. c. 18.</note> red and black, is used between the 8. of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany</hi>
and <hi>Septuagesima;</hi> likewise between <hi>Pentecost</hi> and
<hi>Advent;</hi> but in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> the violet colour is
worn sometimes in stead of black and red.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 19. Wherein consisteth the other parts of the Masse?</p>
                  <p>A. The second part begins with the offertory
which is sung,<note place="margin">The other parts of the Masse.</note> and so called from the Priests offering
of the Hoast to God the Father, and the peoples of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of their gifts to the Priest. Then the Priest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he offereth the immaculate Hoast, washeth his
hands the second time; in the interim the Deacon
casteth over the Altar a fair linnen cloth, called <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porale,</hi>
because it covers Christs body, and represents
his Church the mystical body; it's called also <hi>Palla,</hi>
from palliating or covering the mystery above named.
There is also another <hi>Palla</hi> or <hi>Corporal,</hi> with which
the Chalice is covered. Then the Deacon present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>Patina</hi> with the round Hoast on it, to the
Priest or Bishop; the Deacon alone can offer the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
but the Priest consecrates it; who also mixeth
the Wine and VVater in the Chalice, which the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
cannot doe; the Priest poureth out a little on the
ground, to shew that out of Christs side, water and
blood issued out, and fell on the ground. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is blessed by the Priest when it is mixed, but not
the wine, because the wine represents Christ, who
needs no blessing; the Hoast is so placed on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
that it stands between the Chalice and the Priest,
to shew that Christ is the Mediator between God,
(who is represented by the Priest) and the People,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:97888:244"/>
which the water in the Chalice resembleth. Then
the Priest fumeth the Altar and the Sacrifice three
times over, in manner of a crosse, to shew <hi>Maries</hi>
three-fold devotion in annointing Christs feet, then
his head, and at last her intention to annoint his
whole body; then the Priest boweth himself, kisseth
the Altar and prayeth, but softly to himselfe; this
prayer is called <hi>secreta,</hi> and <hi>secretella;</hi> but though it
be said in silence, yet the close of it is uttered with
a loud voice, <hi>per omnia saecula saeculorum:</hi> then follows
the <hi>Praefatio,</hi> which begins with thanksgiving, and
ends with the confession of Gods majesty; the minds
of the people are prepared with these words, <hi>Lift up
your hearts;</hi> the answer whereof is, <hi>We lift them up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord:</hi> then is sung this hymn, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,
&amp;c. Heaven and Earth is full of thy Glory, &amp;c.</hi> then
follows <hi>Hosanna,</hi> and after this the <hi>Canon</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
the Regular making up of that ineffable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Eucharist; it is also called <hi>Actio</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta,</hi>
because in it is giving of thanks, and the Canon
is uttered with a low voice. The Canon by some is
divided into five parts, by others into more: in it are
divers prayers for the Church, for the Pope, for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Kings, all Orthodox Christians, for Gentiles,
also Jewes and Hereticks; those in particular are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
for whom the sacrifice is to be offered,
whose names are rehearsed; for those also that be
present at the Masse, and assistant, and for himselfe
likewise: then is mention made of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
of the Apostles, Evangelists and Martyrs; but the
Confessors are not named, because they shed not their
blood for Christ: then follows the Consecration af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many crossings, these words being pronounced,
<hi>For this is my body;</hi> the people answer <hi>Amen;</hi> then
the Hoast is elevated, that the people may adore it,
and that by this might be represented Christs Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and Ascension: when the Priest mentioneth
Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Passion, he stretcheth out his armes in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a crosse; the Hoast is crossed by the Priest five
times, to shew the five wounds that Christ received;
but indeed, in the Canon of the Masse, there are seven
several crossings of the Hoast and Chalice; in the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:97888:245"/>
first the signe of the crosse is made three times, in
the second, five times; in the third, twice; in the
fourth, five times; in the fifth, twice; in the sixth,
thrice; and in the seventh, five times; so all makes
up twenty five crossings: prayers are also made for
the dead. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Deacon washeth his hands, to shew
how <hi>Pilate</hi> did wash his hands, when he delivered
Christ to be scourged. The third part of the Masse
begins with the <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> and some other prayers;
the Sub-deacon delivereth the <hi>Patina</hi> covered to the
Deacon, who uncovereth it, and delivers it to the
Priest; kisseth his right hand, and the Priest kisseth
the <hi>Patina,</hi> breaks the Hoast over the Chalice, being
now uncovered by the Deacon, and puts a piece of
it in the wine, to shew that Christs body is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blood. The Hoast is broken into three parts, to
signifie the Trinity: then the Bishop pronounceth a
solemn blessing: then is sung <hi>Agnu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>O Lamb of God that takest away the sins of the world,</hi> &amp;c.
and then the kisse of peace is given according to the
Apostles command, <hi>Salute one another with a holy kisse.</hi>
In the fourth part of the Masse, the Priest communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
thus, he takes the one half of the Hoast for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the other half he divides into two parts; the one
for the Deacon, the other for the Sub-deacon: after
these three, the Clergy and Monks communicate, and
after them, the people: the Priest holdeth the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
with both hands, and drinks three times, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the Trinity; the Hoast must not be chewed with
the teeth, but held in the mouth till it dissolve; and
after the taking thereof he must not spit, but must
wash his hands least any of the Hoast should stick to
his fingers. The three washings of the Priests hands
in the Masse doe signifie the three-fold purity that
ought to be in us,<note place="margin">Of these and other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies see the above named Authors, and <hi>Gabriel Biel de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>canone Missae.</hi>

this done, the Priest kisseth the Altar, and removes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the right side thereof, where having uttered
some prayers for the people, and blessed them, the

                  <p>A. The fifth part of their Worship consisteth in
their divine Service or Office,<note place="margin">Other parts of their worship.</note> as they call it, whereof
be two sorts; one composed by S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> for the
Church of <hi>Millan;</hi> the other by Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> which
the Angel in the night by scattering the leaves up
and down the Church did signifie, that it was to be
spread abroad through the world. In the sixth part,
they place much religion in the observation of their
canonical hours of prayer, whereof at first were eight;
four for the night, and four for the day; the diurnal
hours are, the first, third, sixth, and ninth; the night
hours are, the <hi>Vespers, Completory, Nocturnals,</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>
or morning prayses: but now these eight are
reduced to seven, to signifie the seven gifts of the holy
Ghost, or the seven deadly Sinnes, or the seven-fold
passion of Christ; the Nocturnals are now said with
the Mattins, and not apart, as heretofore: every one
of these canonical houres begins and ends with a
<hi>Pater noster:</hi> the <hi>Nocturnall</hi> Office is the first, and is
sung at mid-night, in memory that about that time
Christ was born, and apprehended by <hi>Iudas,</hi> and that
about mid-night he shall come to judgement: the
<hi>Mattins</hi> or <hi>Prayses</hi> are said and sung in memory of
Christs Resurrection, and the Creation of the world
about that time; the first hour is kept in memory of
Christs being delivered by <hi>Pilate</hi> to the Jewes about
that hour, and that then the women who came to the
Sepulchre were told by the Angel that Christ was
risen: the third hour is in memory of Christs being
at that time condemned by the Jewes, and scourged;
at that time the holy Ghost was given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who then spoke the great works of God: the
sixth hour is in memory of Christs Crucifixion
at that time, and of the Suns miraculous defection:
the ninth hour Christ gave up the Ghost, his side was
then pierced, and then he descended into hell, the
Vaile of the Temple was rent, and the graves ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
at that hour also <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> went up into
the Temple to pray; and so did <hi>Peter</hi> into an upper
chamber, where he fell into a trance: the <hi>Vespers</hi>
                     <pb n="458" facs="tcp:97888:246"/>
are observed, because in the evening Christs body was
taken down from the Crosse, at that time he institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Sacrament, and did accompany the two Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to <hi>Em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

because the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> who compiled this song, is
the bright evening Star of the world. Then also
the Tapers are lighted, to shew we must have our
Lamps ready with the wise Virgins. The <hi>Completory</hi>
is so called, because in it are compleatly ended all the
diurnal services; it is observed in memory of Christs
sweating of blood at that time; he was then also put
in the grave. The song of <hi>Simeon, Nunc dimittis,</hi> &amp;c.
is sung in the <hi>Completory;</hi> because as he before his
death sung it, so should Christians before they sleep,
which is a resemblance of death. In each one of
these Canonical or Regular hours are sung <hi>Gloria
Patri,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See <hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Durantus.</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> In observation of Festival days,<note place="margin">Days Festivall in the Church of Rome.</note> to every one
of which are appropriated Divine Services or offices.
They begin their Feasts from the four Sundays in
Advent; kept to put us in minde of Christs fourfold
comming, to wit, in the flesh, in the mindes of the
faithful, in death, and in judgement at the last day.
In the third week of <hi>Advent</hi> begins the first of the
four Fasts called <hi>Iejunia quatuor Temporum:</hi> and
this Fast is for the Winter quarter; the Vernal Fast
is in the first week of Lent. The Aestival is the first
week after Whitsuntide; and the Autumnal in the
third week of <hi>September.</hi> These four seasons of the
year resemble the four ages of mans life, to wit, his
Childhood, Youth, Manhood, and Old Age; for
the sins of which we ought to fast. They observe
also the Fasts of Lent, and of Fridays, and on the
Eves of the Apostles. Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> alone of all the
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> and Saint <hi>Martin</hi> of all the Confessors, have
their Fasts. On the Eve or Vigil of Christs Nativity,
a lesson is read out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. concerning the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
that fell in the Desart;<note place="margin">Festival days of Christ.</note> to prepare the people,
for the due receiving of the true <hi>Manna,</hi> Christ Jesus
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:97888:246"/>
the next day; in which are sung three Masses, to
shew that Christ was born to save those that lived
before, under, and after the Law: The first is sung
at mid-night with the Angelical Hymne; the second
at the breaking of the day, in which mention is made
of the Shepheards that came to see Christ; The third
Masse is at the third hour, in which are read Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
Gospels, and Epistles, shewing Christs Nativity.
On the Sunday following, are lessons of the same
Nativity: The first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> being the eight day
after the Nativity, is observed in memory of Christs
Circumcision, who in this would be subject to the
Law; would teach us humility, and mortification,
and would shew himself to be true Man, and the
Messiah. The <hi>Epiphany</hi> is kept in memory of the Star
that appeared, and of the three wise men that offered
him guifts; and because on the same day Christ was
baptized, when the whole Trinity appeared, it is
called <hi>Theophania;</hi> and because on the same day
Christ turned water into wine at the marriage in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
it is called <hi>Bethphania</hi> from the house where the
miracle was done. The eight day after the <hi>Epiphany,</hi>
is kept in memory of Christs baptisme. Every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
throughout the year hath its peculiar Service or
office; chiefly <hi>Septuagesima, Sexagesima, Quinquagesima,</hi>
and <hi>Quadragesima,</hi> Sundays. Their Lent-Fast, which
is kept in memory of Christs forty days fast, begins
on Ash-Wednesday, in which consecrated Ashes are
put on their heads in signe of humility, and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and to shew we are but dust and ashes. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Lent every day in the week, as well as the
Sundays, have their proper service and devotion; on
the fifth Sunday in Lent, they begin the commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christs passion. <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> is kept in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the branches of trees cut down by the people
and born by them, when Christ was riding in triumph
to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> therefore this day the Priest blesseth
and distributeth branches of trees. The three days
immediatly going before <hi>Easter</hi> are kept with much
sadnesse and devotion; their <hi>Matti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

the Bells are silent, all lights are put out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Three sorts of Oyle are blessed this day, to wit, that
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:97888:247"/>
of Baptisme, that of the Sick, and that of the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumeni;</hi>
the Bishop breatheth on the Oyle three
times, to signifie the Trinity, whereof the Holy Ghost
represented by the Oyle is one of the Persons. After
evening service the Altars are stript naked, to shew
Christs nakednesse on the Crosse. In some places
also they are washed with Wine and Water, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with Savin leaves, to represent the blood and
tears, with which Christ, our true Altar, was wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the thornes he was crowned with. In the
<hi>Parasceve</hi> is kept a strict <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ast and silence, no Masse is
said this day: Christs passion is read in the Pulpit
uncovered; the dividing of Christs Garment is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the <hi>Sub-Deacons,</hi> much adoration is given
to the Crosse. Christs body is carried by two Priests
to the Altar, which body was consecrated the day
before; for on this day, and on the holy Sabbath,
the Sacrament is not celebrated, because the Apostles
those two days were in great fear and sadnesse: And
so there is no divine office this Sabbath. On this day
the <hi>Agni Dei,</hi> or Lambs of Wax are consecrated, to
defend those that carry them, from Thunder and
Lightning. The <hi>Paschal</hi> Taper is also consecrated,
and the fire which was put out, is renewed by new
sparkes out of a flint, to represent Christ the true
Light of the world, and that stone cut out of the
mountain: on the Taper (being lighted) are fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
five pieces of frankincense, to represent the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
brought by the Women, and Christs five wounds.
The Taper hath three things in it, representing Christ.
The cotton or week signifieth his Soul: the wax his
Body: and the light, his Divinity. It also putteth
the people in minde of the firie Pillar which went
before the <hi>Israelites</hi> to <hi>Canaan.</hi> The light of the Taper
also signifieth both the light of the Gospel here, and
the light of glory hereafter. The Lessons are read
without title or tone; the Fonts or <hi>Baptisteria</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
blessed this day, to shew that by Baptisme we are
buried with Christ: the Priest in consecrating the
water toucheth it with his hand, dips the Taper in
it, bloweth on it, and mixeth the chrisme with it:
Baptisme is to be administred but twice a year; to
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:97888:247"/>
wit, at this time, and on the day of Pentecost, except
in case of necessity: besides divers ceremonies used
in Baptism, the Priest bloweth three times on the
Infant, gives him <hi>chrisme,</hi> and a white garment. Four
sorts are excluded from being witnesses in Baptism;
namely, religious Persons, Infidels, such as are not
confirmed, a man and his wife together; for becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spiritual parents, they are not to know one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
carnally any more. They say divers Letanies
in Baptism; Confirmation is done by the Bishop,
who anoints the child with <hi>chrisme</hi> on the forehead,
as the Priest had done on the crown of his head in
Baptism. The reason why the child is twice anointed
with <hi>chrisme,</hi> is, because the holy Ghost was given
twice to the Apostles; once here on earth before
Christs ascension, and once from heaven in a fuller
measure after Christs ascension. By the first they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a new birth or regeneration; by the second
growth strength and perfection. Therefore this
Sacrament of confirmation is called by the Greek
Fathers <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> perfection or consummation. The
chrisme wherewith they are anointed, is made and
consecrated on the day of the Lords Supper, because
two days afore Easter <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> anointed Christs
head and feet. The Priest must not confirme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by delegation from the Pope; this belongs one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Bishop, because it is an Apostolical
Function, and Bishops are the Apostles successors.
Confirmation is not to be given to those that are not
baptized; because the character of this Sacrament,
presupposeth the character of Baptisme. Neither must
children be confirmed till they be able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their faith. Then the Bishop strikes the
childe on the cheek with his hand, to shew he must
be content to suffer for Christ. On the holy Sabbath,
the Altars begin to be covered again, <hi>Gloria in excelsis</hi>
is sung, the Bells are rung, as preparatives for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;
but before the Gospel incense is carried
instead of light, to shew that the light of the world
was supposed to be yet in the grave by the women
that went to embalme him. And the Post-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is not sung, to shew how the Apostles were
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:97888:248"/>
silent,<note place="margin">Of these and other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, see the afore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Authors.</hi>

observe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The chief is the Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> in which their
Churches, Altars, Crosses, and Priests, are cloathed
in their best Ornaments; nothing this day must be
eat or drunk without the Priests benediction, and
signed with the Crosse. In <hi>Easter</hi> week the custome
was in Salutations, to say <hi>The Lord is risen,</hi> and to
answer thus: <hi>Thanks be to God,</hi> and then to kisse each
other; which custome is yet observed by the Pope to
the Cardinals when he sayeth Masse this day. The
next Sunday to <hi>Easter</hi> is called <hi>Dominica in albis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they that are baptized on the holy Sabbath, lay
aside on this day their white Garments. The second
Sunday is called <hi>Expectationis,</hi> the day of expectation
or looking for the comming of the Holy Ghost. On
<hi>Easter</hi> day before Masse, there is a solemn procession
of the Priests cloathed in white, singing the Resu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
before whom are carried Tapers burning,
Crosses, and Banners. There are also Processions all
the week after to the Fonts singing, in imitation of
the <hi>Israelites</hi> rejoycing for the drowning of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in the read sea: Baptism is the sea, and our sins are
our enemies; every day also this week the <hi>Neophytes</hi>
are led to the Church by their god-fathers and
god-mothers, with wax Tapers before them, which
on the next Sunday, called in <hi>albis,</hi> they offer to the
Priests. From the <hi>Octaves</hi> of <hi>Easter</hi> till <hi>Whitsunday,</hi>
are sung two <hi>Halellujahs</hi> every Sunday, and one every
working day, to shew that the joyes of heaven are
represented, which the soul onely participates till
the Resurrection, and after that, soul and body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which is a double <hi>Hallelujah:</hi> every day i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Easter week hath its peculiar Epistle and Gospel,
mentioning the Resurrection of Christ, and our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
in heaven: to this same purpose hath every
Sunday after Easter its peculiar Masse and service.
<hi>Rogation</hi> Sunday, which is the fifth after Easter, is so
called from praying or asking; for being Ascension
day is neer, and we cannot follow Christ corporally
into heaven, therefore we are taught to follow him
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:97888:248"/>
by our prayers: three days then before Ascension
day, are <hi>Rogations, Letanies,</hi> or prayers both for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and temporal blessings; the Letany used at this
time, is called the Lesser, invented by <hi>Mamertus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> in a time when Wolves and other wild
Beasts had broke out of the woods, and killed divers
people; the greater Letany was the invention of
<hi>Gregory</hi> the first, when <hi>Rome</hi> was afflicted with a great
Plague, caused by the poysonable breath of serpents;
on these Rogation daies there use to be processions,
with Crosses, Reliques, and Banners carried before,
singing also and praying for divers blessings; among
the rest, for the fruits of the earth: the Vigil or Eve
of Ascension hath its proper Mass; on Ascension
day is a soleum procession; on the Sunday after, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are read concerning the coming of the holy
Ghost: on Whitsun Eve Baptisme is celebrated as it
was on Easter Eve; for as we are dead with Christ i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
baptisme, so we are baptized with the Holy Ghost,
which was accomplished when he came down on the
Apostles: the Feast of Pentecost is kept seven days,
at which time, because of baptisme, white is worn;
this colour signifieth that all who are baptized, are
made Priests to God the Father; for the Priests gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is white; it sheweth also the innocency and
purity that ought to be among Christians; and it
puts them in mind of the resurrection, and glory of
the life to come. They pray standing, in sign of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
obtained by the Spirit; <hi>Hallelujah</hi> and <hi>Gloria in
excelsis</hi> are sung often this week; from Easter till this
time, no man is bound to fast: this feast is observed
seven days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to shew the seven gifts of the holy Ghost;
and every day three Lessons are read, because all the
seven gifts are included in these three, Faith, Hope
and Charity. The next Sunday is kept to the honour
of the Trinity; for as Christmasse was ordained to
be kept in honour of God the Father, who sent his son
into the world, and Easter to Christ the second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Whitsunday to the third Person; so this
Sunday was instituted to the three persons together;
and from this day are named the other Sundaies till

                        </gap>ns thereupon.</note>
because they are prescribed by the Canons of the
Church, and regularly observed by devout people.
These hours they ground upon the practise of <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Daniel,</hi> who prayed three times a day. These
hours are seven, because <hi>David</hi> speaketh of calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God seven times a day, because the gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost are seven; and the foul spirit bringeth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
spirits worse then himself; there be seven deadly
sins; the walls of <hi>Ierico</hi> fell down at the blowing of
the seven Ram horn Trumpers; there were seven A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersions
in the Levitical Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. &amp; 16. We
read also of seven Lamps, and seven golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.
These canonical hours are not onely for the
day, but also for the night, after the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and Christ, who spent some part of the night in
prayer; and of the Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> which
sought Christ in the night. The Prince of darknesse
is most busie in the night to assault us, therefore we
ought to watch and pray, that we may not be slaine
with the Egyptian first born in the night. The <hi>Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi>
or night praises, are said at midnight, because at
that time <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> praised God: and so did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
About that time Christ rose from the grave, as
the Greek Church believeth, but the Latine Church
holdeth that he arose in the morning. The first hour
of the day is dedicate to prayer; that whilest the
Sun riseth, we may call upon the Sun of righteousness
who bringeth health under his wings. About that
hour he was mocked, spit upon, &amp; buffeted: and at that
hour after his resurrection, he was seen by his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
standing on the Sea shore. To whom the first
fruits of the earth were offered in old time; to him
also should the first fruits of the day be offered. The
third hour is consecrated to prayer, because then
Christ was crowned with thorns, and condemned by
<hi>Pilate.</hi> It was the third hour also that the holy Ghost
descended on the Apostles. The sixt hour is canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
because then Christ was crucified; at that houre
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:97888:249"/>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> went up to the top of the house to pray, <hi>acts</hi> 10.
and then it was that Christ asked water from the
woman of <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>atia.</hi> The ninth hour is for prayer,
because then Christ gave up the ghost; so <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Iohn</hi> went up into the Temple at the ninth hour of
prayer <hi>acts</hi> 3. The evening also is a time for prayer;
then they have their <hi>Vespers,</hi> because the <hi>Iewes</hi> had
their evening Sacrifice:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Of these hours</hi> Cassianus <hi>spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,</hi> Rabanus Maurns, Isidor, Amalarius, Fortunatus Rupertus Tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> then it was that Christ insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the Sacrament of the Eucharist at his last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
And then was his body taken down from the
Crosse. The hour of the <hi>Completory</hi> about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the night is Canonical also; in memory of
Christs buriall. And because <hi>David</hi> would not go
up into his bed, nor suffer his eye-lids to slumber,
till he had found out a place for the Temple. Then
is sung the song of old <hi>Simeon, Nunc dimittis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 24. What else may we observe about these Canonical
hours?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That all Priests, Deacons, and Sub-Deacons,
are bound to observe these hours; so are also Monks
and Nuns, if they be not Novices. But the inferiour
orders of Clergy that are not beneficed, as they are
not debarred from Marriage, so they are not tied to
these Canonical hours. They also that are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
and degraded, are to observe these hours,
for the character is indelible; but sick persons and
such as have any natural impediment are excused.
Again, these Canonical prayers are not to be said
everywhere, but in the Church, because the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of petitioners makes prayers the more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
otherways, they acknowledge that private
prayers may be said anywhere. The times also, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and reverence, must be observed in saying of
these prayers, and diligent attention must be used
without wandering thoughts; the attention must be

the things that are above. Beneficed men who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
in six moneths time to say the Canonical prayers,
are to lose their benefices. In the first Canonical
hour the <hi>Kyrie Eleeson</hi> is said; so is the Lords Prayer,
and the Creed, but with a low voice, to shew that
prayer and faith consist rather is the heart then in
the tongue. In the third hour prayers are said for
the dead, as well as for the living. The sixe hour

Christs side was peirced, out of which flowed water
and blood, the two Sacraments of the Church, then
the Vaile of the Temple rent asunder, the graves ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and Christ descended into hell; all which do
furnish sufficient matter for prayers and praises that
hour. In the end of the day are said the <hi>Vespers</hi> or
evening service, to signifie that Christ came in the
end of the world. In the evening Christ washed
his Disciples feet and was known to the two Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

brought forth Christ, in whom is our cheifest rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
And then are Lamps lighted to put us in minde

Namely on the Purification of the Virgin, on Palm-Sunday,

had their armes and colours carried before them, so
here are carried Crosses and Banners. Their <hi>Levites</hi>

have culled out: They have also holy days for some

                  <p>Q. 27. What Ornaments and Vtensils doe they use in their
Churches dedicate to Christ and the Saints?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They have in them their reliques, pictures,<note place="margin">Their ornaments and utensils used in Churches dedicate to Christ and the Saints.</note> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
crosses also, and crucifixes, the images also of
Angels, which they paint with wings to signifie their
swiftnesse, and sublimity of their nature; with white
garments also to shew their purity. The images of
Christ and of the Saints, are painted with the sunne,
beams about their heads, to represent the glory they
are in. God the Father is represented like an old
man, because he is described by <hi>Daniel</hi> like the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
of daies. The Holy Ghost is painted like a Dove;
because in that form he appeared on Christ. They
have Chalices not of Glasse, because subject to
breaking; not of wood, because that is porous and
drinks in the liquor; not of brasse nor copper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the bad smell thereof, and rust, or canker,
but of silver or gold. They have also candlesticks,
tapers and lamps, which they burn to the Saints by
day, to shew they are not in darknesse, but in light.
Their censers and incense represent Christ, and the
prayers of the Saints which like incense ascend before
God; these odors are burnt in their Churches, both
to expel bad vapors, and to refresh the sences. They
have also their flaps or fans to drive away flies from
the Chalice, after the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who drove
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:97888:253"/>
away the birds from his sacrifice; and to teach us
that we should drive away all wandring thoughts
when we pray. Their <hi>Patin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and other vessels shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
bright, put us in mind how we should shine in
out conversation. The Corporal is the linnen cloath
in which the Eucharist is covered, signifying how
Christs body was wrapped up in fine linnen; for as
linnen is first washed, then wrung, and lastly dried;
so must our souls be first washed in tears, then wrung
by repentance, and lastly dried by the heat of the
love of God. Organs are also used in Churches to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the minde, and to stir up devotion. Yet in the
Popes Chappel there are none, <q>perhaps to shew that
he needs no such helps.</q> Their Altars are inclosed
with railes, to keep off the people, for the Priests on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have accesse to them; they were anciently places
of refuge, and are covered all the year, except in the
passion week; then they are stript, to represent Christs
nakednesse on the crosse. Ordinarily the Altar is
placed towards the East, yet in the Church of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi>
it was placed towards the West. On the Altar
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for strangers, sick persons and travellers; but it must
not be kept above seven dayes, least it mould; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Priest must eat it himselfe, and put in a fresh
one. They have Fonts, called <hi>Baptisteria,</hi> of stone, in
which the water of Baptisme is consecrated by the
Priest, who poureth oyle into it; he also by breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and by certain words exorciseth the evil spirit.
<hi>Salt</hi> is consecrated, and put into the childs month, to
shew that he must have spiritual Salt within him:
Then the Priest layeth his hand on the childs head,
in sign he is reconciled and made a member of the
Church. Then he signeth his forehead with the sign
of the crosse, that hereafter he may not be ashamed
of Christ crucified. He puts his finger into his eare and
into his nostrils also with spittle; saying to his right
eare <hi>Epph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nature we are deaf in spiritual things, as was that man
whom Christ after this manner cured in the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The touching of the Nostrils sheweth that the child
must remember his vow in baptisme, so long as he
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:97888:254"/>
hath breath in him. Then he anoints the Child two
times, that he may renounce the devil and all his
works, &amp;c. The breast is first anointed, then the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to shew the strength of our love, and faith in
the Trinity, and that withall we must be wrestlers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all spiritual wickednesse. The childe is three
times dipe in the water, and in some places onely
sprinkled; to shew Christs three days burial, and our
faith in the Trinity. After baptisme the child is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed

because the Altar represents Christ, therefore the

kisseth the Altar; by which also he sheweth the great
desire the Church hath to enjoy Christ when she
saith, <hi>Let him kisse me with the kisses of his mouth.</hi> The
Vestry is the place where the sacred Vestiments (of
which we have already spoken) are kept. Here the
Priest before Masse puts on his holy garments; this

                  <p>A. They have a peculiar office or service for the
dead in Purgatory,<note place="margin">Their office per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the dead.</note> which some perform every third
day, that they might be partakers of Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Others perform this office the thirtieth day, because
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:97888:255"/>
the <hi>Israelites</hi> mourned for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> thirty days.
Others again the fortieth day, because <hi>Ioseph</hi> and his
brethren bewailed <hi>Iacob</hi> forty days. Others the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
day, because the fiftieth year is the Jubilee, or
year of liberty, which they wish these imprisoned
soules may partake eternally. Others perform this
office yearly, and make it anniversary; but if this day
fall upon Sunday or any other solemn festivity, then
it must not be kept, nor put off till the next day, as
the feasts of the Saints are, but must be kept the day
before, that the souls may the sooner partake the
fruits of our devotion. No Masse must be said on fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival
days for the dead, except the body be present.
And although in the Masse for the living incense is
burned, to shew that their prayers like incense ascend
before God; yet in the Masse for the dead incense is
not burned, because their prayers are of no efficacy;
for <hi>do the dead praise thee?</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> The corps may
not be brought into the Church, whilest Masse is say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the living, but must be set in the Porch till
Masse be done, and the Mass for the dead be begun,
in which Masse the kisse of peace must not be given,
because there is no communion between us and the
dead, neither can they answer us; the dead corps is
washed and anointed; then it is carried to the Church;
but by the way the bearers rest three times, to signifie
Christs three days rest in the grave. Holy water and
Frankincense is put in the grave with the corps, to
keep off evil spirits thence, and to shew that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
party hath offered to God the incense of his
prayers and good life whilest he lived. He is buried
with green bayes, to shew that his soul is alive, and

The prayers that are made for the dead, are not for
the Saints in Heaven, for they need not our prayers,

the child three times over head and ears in a tub of
warm water, holding it necessary that every part of
the child be dipped. They use the same words that

him a good Christian, &amp;c. This done, the child being
now made a Christian, is carried from the Porch
into the Church: The Priest marching before, who
layeth him on a cushion before the feet of the chief
Image in the Church, to which he is recommended
as to his Mediator. After baptisme the childs hair
is cut off, wrapped up in wax, and reserved as a
relique in the Church. The <hi>Russians</hi> use to re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptise
their Proselyte Christians, and in some Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
to instruct them in their religion; first they
cloath the new convert with a fresh <hi>Russian</hi> Garment,
then they crown him with a Garland, anoint his
head with oyl, put a wax light into his hand, and
for seven days together pray over him four times
a day; all which time he is to forbear flesh, and white
meats. After the seventh day he is washed, and, on
the eighth day is brought into the Church, and there
instructed how to bow, knock his head, and crosse
himself before their images. The <hi>Russians</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 7. What is the Doctrine and Ceremonies of the <hi>Russi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Church at this day?</p>
                  <p>A, They hold that the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> (except <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis)</hi>
are not to be read in Churches,<note place="margin">Their Doctrine and Ceremonies.</note> and are of no
use since Christs comming; nor the Prophets, nor the
Revelation. 2. They teach that their Church tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are of equal authority with the word of God. 3.
That the Greek Church, chiefly the Patriarch and his
Synod, have full authority to interpret the Scriptures,
and that their interpretation is authentick. 4. That the
Holy Ghost proceedeth not from the Son. 5. They
hold Christ to be the onely mediator of redemption,
but not of intercession; this honour they give to the
Saints; chiefly to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and Saint <hi>Nichola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
who they say is attended upon by three hundred of
the chief Angels. 6. Their doctrine and practise is to
adore the Images or Pictures of the Saints, whereof
their Churches are full, and richly adorned. 7. They
teach that in this life there can be no assurance of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
8. And that we are justified not by faith only,
but by works also; which consist in prayers by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
on their beads, in fasts, vows, almes, crossings, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
to Saints, and such like. 9. They ascribe great
power to auricular confession in doing away sin. 10.
They hold al to be damned, that dye without baptism.
11. Extream Unction is with them a Sacrament, though
not of such necessity as baptisme, yet they hold it a
cursed thing to dye without it. 12. They re-baptise
Christians converted to their Church. 13. They e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
some meats more holy then others, and are very
strictly superstitious in their fasts. 14. They disallow
marriage in their Clergy; yet they permit their Priests
to marry once. 15. They place such vertue in the cross
that they advance it in all their high ways, on the
tops of their Churches, on the doors of their Houses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="487" facs="tcp:97888:260"/>
and are upon all occasions signing themselves with
it on their foreheads and breasts: They adore it, they
use the signe thereof in stead of prayers and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the morning and evening, when they sit down
to meat and rise from table; when they swear, they
swear by the Crosse, &amp;c. 16. Such vertue they place in
holy Water, that after the Bishops have consecrated
the Rivers on the <hi>Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pbany,</hi> as their custome is then
every year, people strive who shall first plunge their
children, and themselves therein, and think their meat
is blessed that is boyled in that water; and that the
sick shall either recover, or be made more fit and holy
for God, if they drink thereof. 17. They have their
solemn Processions on the <hi>Epip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>any,</hi> in which go two
Deacons bearing banners in their hands, the one of
our Lady, the other of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> fighting with the
Dragon; after them follow the other Deacons and
Priests two and two in a rank, with copes on their
backs, and images hanging on their breasts. After
these march the Bishops in their robes, then the Monks
and their Abbots: and after them the Patriarch in
rich attire, with a ball on the top of his Mytre, as if
his head supported the world; at last comes the great
Duke with his Nobility; when they are come to the
River, a hole is made in the Ice; then the Patriarch
prayeth, and conjureth the Devil out of the water;
which done, he casteth salt, and censeth the water
with incense, and so it becomes holy. This is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
at <hi>Mosco;</hi> where the people are provident, least
the Devil (bring conjured out of the water) should
enter into their houses, they make crosses with chalk
over their doors. In their Processions also they carry
the image of Christ within a Pix upon a high pole,
which they adore, &amp; think this image was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hands. 18. Such holinesse they place in their Priests
benediction, that when they brew, they bring a dish
of wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to the Priest within the Church, which he
consecrates, and this makes the whole brewing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
In harvest they do the like, by bringing the first
fruits of their corn to the Priest to be hallowed. 19.
On Palm Sunday, when the Patriarch rideth through
the <hi>Mosco,</hi> the Great Duke holds his horse bridle,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:97888:261"/>
and the people crie <hi>Hosa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>a,</hi> spreading their
upper garments under his horse seet. The Duke hath
for his service that day a pension from the Patriarch
of 200. Rubbels. 20. Besides their Wednesdays and
Fridays fasts, they have four Lents in the year: The
first and great Lent is as ours, before Easter, the second
about Midsummer, the third in Harvest time, the fourth
about All-Hollow-tide; the first week of their great
Lent they feed upon bread and salt onely, and drink
nothing but water; in this Lent they have three <hi>Vigils,</hi>
in the last whereof which is on good Friday, the
whole Parish watcheth in the Church from nine a
clock in the evening, till six in the morning; all which
time they stand, except when they fall down and
knock their heads against their Images, which must be

every day of the year, which is held the Patron of that
day. The Image whereof is brought every morning
with the crosse into the Great Dukes Chamber, by the
Priest his Chaplain; before which Image the Great
Duke prayeth,<note place="margin">

delivery of the Brides hand into the Bride-groomes
by the Priest, who stand both at the Altar, opposite
to each other. The Matrimonial knot being tied, the
Bride comes to the Bride Groome, and falleth down
at his feet, knocking her head upon his shooe, in sign
of her subjection; and he casteth the lap of his upper
garment over her, in token of cherishing and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
then the Brides friends bow low to the Bride-Groome,
and his friends likewise to hers, in sign of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity

offers to the Priest a loaf of bread, who delivers it
to the Brides Father, with attestation before God and
their pictures, that he deliver the Dowry wholy at

the appointed day, and keep love with one another;
hereupon they break the loaf and eat it. This done,
the married couple walk hand in hand to the Church
porch, where the Bride-Groome drinketh to the
Bride, who pledgeth him; then he goeth to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, and she to hers, where either entertain
their friends apart. In token of plenty and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
corn is flung out of the windows upon the Bride
and Brid-groom, at their entring into the house. In the
evening the Bride is brought to the Bride-Groomes
Fathers house; there she lodgeth that night in silence
and obscurity; she must not be seen by the Bride-Groome,
till the next day; for three days she must say
little or nothing; then they depart to their own house,
and Feast their friends. Upon any small dislike the
man may enter into a Monastery, and so forsake his

4. They hold that the blessed souls enjoy Gods

By divers reasons it is proved that Religion of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealths, and humane societies, is the foundation. 3.
That Princes and Magistrates ought to have a special
care, in setling and preserving of Religion. 4. That one
Religion onely is to be allowed in a Common wealth pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.
5. In what respects different Religions they be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
in private. 6. A Christian Prince may not dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his Religion. 7. Why God blesseth the professors of
false Religions, and punisheth the contemners thereof. 8.
False Religions are grounded upon policy, &amp; what use there
is of Ceremonies in Religion. 9. The mixture and division
of religions, and of Idolatry. 10. How the Gentile Religion
in worshipping of the Sun, seems to be most consonant to
natural reason; with divers observations concerning Sun-worship,
and the knowledge the Gentiles had of a Deity,
&amp; the Vnity thereof, with some glimmering of the Trinity.
11. That the honour, maintenance, and advancement of a
Priest hood, is the main supporter of Religion. 12. That
the Christian Religion is of all others the must excellent,
and to be preferred for divers reasons, being considered in
it selfe, and compared with others; with an exhortation to
the practice of religious duties, which is true Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

and obey God; who commands <hi>Rom. 13. That every
soul be subject to the higher Powers, for there is no power
but of God.</hi> 3. There is in all men naturally a desire

without the knowledge and worship of God;
whom we can neither know nor worship without
Religion, which prescribeth the rules and way
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:97888:268"/>
of worshipping him; and likewise sheweth us that
there is a God, that he is one, invisible, eternal,
omnipotent, the maker of all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. The
Essence and life of a Common-wealth consisteth in
Love, Unity, and Concord; but it is by Religion
that these are obtained; for there is no band or tie so
strict and durable, as that of Religion, by which all
the living stones of the great buildings of Kingdoms
and States are cemented, and like the planks of
<hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
but the means to retard and keep off destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ruin from them is Religion; hence those
States continue longest where Religion is most
esteemed and advanced; whereas on the contrary,
the contempt of Religion is the fore-runner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
this we see that when the whole world
was united into one corporation and society, for
slighting Religion, were all overthrown in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Cataclysme, except eight religious persons, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

and States know and are assured that they
cannot subsist without the protection of Almighty
God, who is the Author of all humane societies, so
likewise they know, that God will not owne and
protect them who either cannot or will not serve,
worship, and honour him, which without Religion
is impossible to be done by man; for as all Nations
know, even by the comely order and harmony, the
strange operations of Nature, and the beauty of the
world, that there is a Divinity, which is also plain
by the actions of Providence; so likewise they know
that this Divine power must be honoured and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
except they will shew ingratitude in the highest
degree, to him, whence they have their living,
moving, being, and all they enjoy; but without
Religion they can neither know how nor where, nor
when to worship him. 7. Every man knows he hath a
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:97888:268"/>
spiritual, reasonable, and heavenly soul, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
delights in the knowledge and contemplation
of heavenly things, which shew that he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all Religion, except he will shake off nature and
humanity. 8. The veriest <hi>Atheists</hi> in the world, who
denyed God, (at least in his providence, though
they could not in his essence) yet affirmed that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was necessary in all societies, without which
they cannot subsist, as is already said. 9. As sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
will not obey their Princes, but fall into rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
so Princes will not protect their Subjects, but
become Wolves and Tyrants, if it were not for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that keeps them in awe, and assures them that
there is over them a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,

are not ignorant how much religion is preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
with the people, therefore they delivered them
no Laws, but what either they received, or said they
received from some Deity; so <hi>Lyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

because there is but one God, who is the Object of
Religion; therefore as his Essence is most simple
and indivisible, so should his worship be, because di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of Religion breed diversities of opinions
concerning God. 2. As there is but one truth, so there
ought to be but one Religion; for false Religions ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
teach to worship false Gods, or else in a false
manner to worship the true God; therefore God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
prescribed to the Jews the rule and manner of
his worship, strictly commanding them not to alter
any thing therein; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, <hi>That the
Gospel which he taught, was the onely true Gospel, so that if
an Angel from Heaven should preach any other Gospel, let

which is the ground and pillar of truth, and one
faith to lay hold on that truth, and one spirit to lead
the Church into the way of truth, so there should be
but one Religion, which is the Doctrine of that truth.

but the wayes to destruction are many; therefore
there ought to be but one Religion to conduct us in
that way to eternal happinesse. 5. Religion (as is said)
is the Foundation of all States and Kingdoms; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of the State is preserved; if this band be broken into

and preserve their unity, either amongst themselves,
or with their Princes and Governours: As therefore
<hi>a City divided against it self cannot stand;</hi> neither can that
State subsist, which is divided into different Religions,
which occasioneth diversity of affections, and withall
many jars and contentions. 7. As in bodies natural,
contrary qualities cause destruction; so in bodies Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
contrary Religions; for if there be but one true
Religion, the rest must needs be false; and what can
be more contrary then truth and falshood? so that the
belly of <hi>Rebecca</hi> must needs be tormented, where such
opposite twins do struggle: Hence proceed heart-burnings,
emulations, strifes, proscriptions, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
and such like distempers, by which the
seamlesse coat of Christ is torne in pieces. 8. Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of Religions beget envy, malice, seditions, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
rebellions, contempt of Superiors, treacheries,
innovations, disobedience, and many more mischiefs,
which pull down the heavy judgements of God upon
that State or Kingdom where contrary Religions are
allowed, because whilest every one strives to advance
his own Religion above the other, all these distempers

among the <hi>Iewes:</hi> but into the way of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
they must not yet go till his ascension. It falls out
many times that the remedy is worse then the disease;
and while we go about to cure the State, we kill it;
and instead of purging out the peccant humours of the
body Politick, we cast it into a <hi>Calenture</hi> or <hi>burning</hi>
Feaver. This was not unknown to that wise and good
Emperor <hi>Theodesius,</hi> who could not be perswaded by
the <hi>Catholikes</hi> to extirpate, or use violent courses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Arrians,</hi> but permitted them to enjoy their
Churches and opinions, knowing how dangerous it
would prove to the State, if the quietnesse thereof
should be disturbed; this had been to kindle the fire
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:97888:271"/>
which was lately extinguished, and to raise a con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

in the Empire, which could not be quenched
without an inundation of blood; this had been <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merinam

cause though the <hi>Turk</hi> is zealous in his Religion, yet
he permits <hi>Christians, Iewes, Persians, Aethiopians,</hi> and
others to enjoy their several Religions. The like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is permitted in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for avoiding further mischief; For this purpose
that there may not be a breach of peace, and disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the government of the State. The <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Moscovites</hi> inhibit all disputations in points of Religion
upon pain of death. The like inhibition was made by
the Emperor and Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> after their Civil
Wars, that there should be no dispute or contention
between the Catholickes and Protestants; for indeed
by such disputes, Religion it self is weakned, and the
State indangered; for if it be not tolerable to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Laws once established, how can it be safe either
for State or Church to call in question Religion once
setled and confirmed by authority? By questions and

                     </gap>tes the Majesty of Religion is slighted; and that
made dubious, which ought to be most certain; The
objects and high mysteries of our faith, are not to be
measured by our shallow reason. The many disputes
about Religion, commonly overthrow the practise of
Religion, which consisteth not in talking, but in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the one indeed is more easie then the other, as
<hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>Omnes disputare malunt quam vivere; We had
rather dispute of salvation, then work it out with fear and
trembling.</hi> If Heaven could be obtained with wrangling
and disputing, a profane Sophister should sooner have
it then a Holy Christian, who knows that life eternal
is not obtained by talking <hi>of,</hi> but by walking <hi>in</hi> the
ways of Gods Commandements. But to return to
our former discourse, and to end this question,
as we began; diversity of Religious, with the
limitations aforesaid, may be connived at; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when it cannot be avoided without the
danger and ruin of the State; and the rather,
because the Conscience cannot be compelled, nor
faith forced. There never was a wiser State than
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:97888:271"/>

a <hi>Pantheon,</hi> or Temple for all gods. And though they
abhorred the <hi>Iewes</hi> above all other people, yet <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
that wise and happy Emperor, permitted
them to exercise their own Religion. Princes and

condemneth a double heart, and rejecteth

himselfe into an Angel of light; <hi>Malus, ubi se bonum
simulat, pessimus est,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca.</hi> 2. God is the chief
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:97888:272"/>
good, in whom is no impurity nor guile; therefore he
requires of us pure and sincere love; he is omniscient,
<hi>there is nothing hid from him, he knoweth the hearts, and
searcheth the reins, and knoweth our thoughts long before:
all things are naked and open to his eyes;</hi> Therefore though
we can delude men, we cannot deceive God; he
knows what is within painted sepulchres, and in those
platters that have washed outsides. God is truth it
self, therefore is an enemy to falshood. He is zealous
of his glory; but there is nothing wherein he is more
dishonoured, then by dissimulation and Hypocrisie.
3. Never was there any good Prince a dissembler, nor
did ever any dissembler prove a good Prince; but
cruel, tyrannical and impious; as we see by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Herod, Tiberius, Nero,</hi> and many more, who at
first made great shew of Religion and Vertue; but
when the Visard was taken off, they proved monsters
and not men, and Wolves in Sheeps cloathing; nay
there is more hope of him that in the beginning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
his own infirmities, then in him that conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them; for the one is more corrigible then the other:
as <hi>Bodin</hi> instanceth in King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who could
not hide his weakness, yet never committed any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
act. And indeed dissembling Princes fall into this
inconvenience and mischief, that they cannot-be long
hid under the visard of Religion and vertue; but their
nature will break out, and then will become more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to their people, than if they had at first dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
their natures. <hi>Dienysius</hi> the younger, so long as
<hi>Plato</hi> was with him, played the counterfeit egregious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
making shew of sobriety, temperance, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princely vertues; but as soon as <hi>Plato</hi> was gone,
his wicked nature brake out, like a running streame
that hath been dammed up. And how can a people
put confidence in that Prince, who dissembleth with
God? he that is not true to his maker, but playeth
fast and loose with him, can never be true to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And indeed for a Prince or State to dissemble
with God, who had raised them out of the dust, to
make them rulers over his people is ingratitude in the
highest degree; and much worse than of any private
man, by how much the higher he is advanced above
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:97888:272"/>
others. To be brief, among all the wicked qualities
of <hi>Catilin,</hi> there was none that was more exaggerated
by the Historian, then his dissimulation, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting;

                  <p>Q. 7. Seeing there is but one true Religion, why doth
God blesse the professors of false Religions, and punisheth the
contemners thereof?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Because in false Religions there is the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of a Divinity,<note place="margin">False religions why blessed, and the contemners punished.</note> though the conceptions
men have of this Deity be erroneous, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
they give be superstitious. 2. Because by false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
men are kept in awe and obedience to their
Superiours, and in love and concord among themselvs;
therefore God, who is the author of all goodnesse, and
tender of the welfare of mankinde, will rather have
a false Religion then none, and Superstition rather
then Atheisme; for even in false Religions both Prince
and people are taught their duties to each other. The
<hi>Romans</hi> stood so much in awe of their heathenish su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,
that they would rather lose their lives,
then falsifie the oaths they took in presence of their
gods; and were more moved to the performance of
their duties, by the hope of rewards, and fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
hereafter, then of any they could expect
or endure here. Humane society, fidelity, justice, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
fortitude, and other vertues, are upheld even
by false religions: therefore the defenders of such have
been outwardly rewarded by God, and the enemies
thereof punished. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> for defending
<hi>Apollo's</hi> Temple against the <hi>Phocenses,</hi> who came to

in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was slain by his own sword in the midst of
his age, glory, and army. God punished the Sacriledge
of <hi>Xerxes</hi> the son of <hi>Darius,</hi> for robbing the <hi>Delphick</hi>
Temple, with the losse of his innumerable army, by
a handful of Grecians, and the overthrow of his 4000.
sacrilegious souldiers, with lightning, hail, &amp; storms, so

Brennus,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> had the like judgement

for robbing <hi>Iuno's</hi> Temple, was exercised ever

without Ceremonies, is like solid meat without

Christ deals not so niggardly with his Church, as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford

Thus he dealt with his first spouse of the

thy face, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautifull
crown upon thine head,</hi> Ezek. 16. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If God was so
bountifull to his first Wife why should he be so sparing to
his second, as to afford her no outward Ornaments at

Jews did, though not of so many, not of the like nature.
I observe, that where are no Ceremonies, there is small
reverence and devotion, and where some cost is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
even on the outside of Religion, there some love is

light and motion of the Sun, they painted him like a
man, holding with both his hands a flaming wheel: when
they did represent the martiall courage, and military heat
of souldiers, excited in their hearts by the heat of the
Sun, they set him out like an armed man, holding a
banner in one hand with a rose in it, in the other a pair
of scales; on his breast was the picture of a bear, on his
target a lion; the field about him full of flowers, by which
they signified valour and eloquence, both requisite in a
Commander; the arms, bear and lion were to shew
the fiercenesse, courage and defence, that is, or ought to
be in military men; the rose and flowery field, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present

they expressed how the sun by his heat and influence, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
up <hi>Venereal</hi> love in living creatures, they painted
him like a woman, for that passion is most impotent in
that sex; on her head she wore a mirtle garland, to

Meridian and Evening; in her breast she had a burning
torch, to shew both the heat and light of the Sun, and
the fire of love which burneth in the breast;

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Christian Religion; which may be proved:
first from the excellent doctrines it teacheth,<note place="margin">Religion which is best.</note> as that there
is a God, that he is but one, most perfect, infinite, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
omniscient, omnipotent, absolutely good, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour

of God is a broken and contrite heart:</hi> That he is better

of our flesh, with the mortification of the body of sin,
than of the body of nature. <hi>He ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of sin, than
the works of of our hands: and to wash our hearts in
innocency, rather than our hands in water. The service
he expects from us, is the presenting of our bodies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sacrifice and holy, which is our reasonable service.
No Religion like this doth teach us the true object of
our faith and hope, which is God: of our charity, which
is our neighbour: of temperance, which is our selves:
of obedience, which is the Law: of prayer, which is the
Kingdome of Heaven, and the righteousnesse thereof in
the first place; and then things concerning our worldly
affairs in the second place: no Religion but this, teacheth
us to deny our selves, to forgive our enemies, to pray for
our persecutors, to do good to those who hurt us, to forget
and forgive all injuries, and to leave vengeance to God,
who will repay: no Religion like this, teacheth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
chastity that ought to be between one man and one
wife; for other religions permit either plurality of wives,
or divorces upon light occasions, or fornication amongst
young people unmarried; <hi>Crede mihi, non est flagitium
adolescentem scortari, Terent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or that which is worse, and
not to be named: but Christianity forbids unchast talk,
immodest looks, and even unclean thoughts. Other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
forbid perjury, this swearing at all, except be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Judge to vindicate the truth. No Religion doth so
much urge the mutual justice or duties, that ought to be
between masters and servants, parents and children,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:97888:287"/>
Princes and people, and between man and man; all these,
oppression, extortion, usury, bribes, sacriledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are

of Christianity may be proved from the multitude
of witnesses, or martyrs, and Confessors, who have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forsaken father and mother, lands and possessions, and
whatsoever else was dear to them, but likewise their lives,
(and that with all chearfulnesse) for the name of Christ:
and which is most strange, in the midst of flames and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
torments, they did sing and rejoyce, and <hi>account it no

the glory that should be revealed; and that after they had
fought the good fight, and finished their course, a Crown
of righteousnesse was laid up for them.</hi> 6. The excellency
of the author commends Christianity above all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
which have been delivered by men onely, and
those sinfull men too; as <hi>Moses, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as he died for sinners, so he rose again for them the third
day, ascended into Heaven where he now sits at the right
hand of his father, and will come again to judge the

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have here presumed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you with a strange and
bloody <hi>Tragedy</hi> of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
and <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in <hi>Latine</hi> by a most ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
pen, by one who hath concealed
his name, as I conceive out of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that, living near the times and places
of this representation, it might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
dangerous to him to have published
it. Here you have <hi>Religion</hi> brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the stage in very strange disguises, nay
they make her act parts the most contrary
to her nature, imbruing her white and
innocent hands in blood, and Massacres.
But as she hath met with <hi>Wolves</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
and tear in pieces, so hath she also
met with <hi>Shepheards</hi> to heal and protect,
and among those the most laborious

Authour of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ANZEBEIA hath not bin
the least considerable. His severe and
most indefatigable labours in most parts
of <hi>Learning,</hi> are consummated in this
piece of Religion, wherein like an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Anatomist, he hath left no vein
un-cut up. To fall into excessive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
of him, were to commit a
moral absurdity, by praising one whom
the general Trumpet of Fame hath
blaz'd abroad for so great an advancer of
Vertue and Learning; But to trouble
<hi>you</hi> with them, were yet to be so much
the more importunate, whose conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with him was so great, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I may say of him, I shall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with so much as your self
know. Nor did the influence of your
Patronage raise and animate only him,
but there are so many other monuments
of your great encouragements to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it will be thought modesty in
me not to mention all. But your excessive
Benefactorship to the Library of S. <hi>Iohns</hi>
Colledge at <hi>Cambridge</hi> (whereof I have
sometimes had the honour to be an
unworthy member) I cannot passe over,
as a thing, which will stand upon the file
of memory, as long as learning shall find
professors or children. And that which
<pb facs="tcp:97888:298"/>
increases the glory of your munificence,
is, that that Library may hoast that it is
furnished with the works of its owne
sonnes, which, being the greatest act of
retribution and gratitude that may be,
must be accordingly acknowledged by
all that shall come after. But that which
hath the most engaged and satisfied
the <hi>English</hi> world, is, that your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
have displayed themselves in their
clearest light, in that <hi>one thing that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>Religion,</hi> not only by
being a constant assertor of her purity here
in <hi>England,</hi> but in that, after more then
<hi>Ulyssean</hi> Travels throughout most parts
of <hi>Europe,</hi> you have returned to your
former enjoyments of that chast <hi>Penelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi>
when others either out of weaknesse
or surprise, are ensnared and besotted
with the Tenets of other Countries,
whereby they are both ingrateful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to their own, by preferring the
prudence and policy of another before
hers. Religion certainly, if well impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is the <hi>Talent,</hi> that felicifies the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover,
if not, condemnes him. It is
that universal <hi>Patrimony,</hi> which entitles
us to be the sonnes of God, and by which
we are adopted into the assured hope of
eternal happinesse. It is the <hi>Loadstone</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:97888:299"/>
wherewith when our soules are once
touched, they are directed to the right
pole of the eternally beatifical vision;
and without which, we must infallibly
expect to split against the rocks and
shelves of perdition. It is the consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of heavens indulgence to Mankind,
that which doth familiarize us, and
makes good our Interest in the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and cause of all things. It is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of nature, since that whatsoever
we know of the divinity by her comes
only by the assistance and mediation of
our sences, but the other furnishes us with
a more evident assurance, (and that, in
things, which can be neither <hi>seen, heard,</hi>
nor <hi>conceived,)</hi> by the more particular
providence of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby
he is pleased to <hi>bow down the heavens,</hi> and
descend unto a familiar conversation
with our very spirits.</p>
                  <p>But that which ought further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear
all men to Religion, is, that she on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
next to God may pretend <hi>Ubiquity,</hi> as
being a thing written in such indelible
characters in the hearts of all men, that
even the most barbarous nations, and
the greatest strangers to civility and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
have acknowledged some divine
worship, though their pravity or want
<pb facs="tcp:97888:299"/>
of instruction, may have blinded them
from the <hi>true,</hi> but yet that eclipse of
the true God hath not been total, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
as they have still retained a sense
and veneration of Religion, so that to the
best of their imaginations, they have
created something like God to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
To make this yet more evident,
we are to note, that most people, though
they had not so clear apprehensions of
the immortality of the soul, as we have;
yet were they not only perswaded of the
impossibility of its annihilation, but
have also acknowledged rewards and
punishments to be expected after this
life.</p>
                  <p>To ascend yet a little higher; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
and preheminence of Religion is
demonstrated, in that it exerciseth that
Empire and Soveraignty over the mind
of man, that no blandishments of the
flesh, no temptations, no torments have
been able to dispossesse it. It hath tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd
in the midst of its persecutions,
and by her sufferings hath conquered her
persecutors. Her pleasing Ravishments
can stifle for a time all sence of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
elude flames, and racks, and so arm the
delicacy and tendernesse of virgin-puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as to overcome the hardiest Tyrants.
<pb facs="tcp:97888:300"/>
It is she that raises our soules to a holy
boldnesse and intimacy in our addresses
to heaven, being indeed rapt into the
heavens of divine contemplation, by
her extasies and illuminations. It was
her inspiring communication, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
your pious soul, when you descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the divine perfections of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
THEOPHILA. These
things can she do and greater, when
there is but one grain of true <hi>Faith;</hi> but
when she is defiled and adulterated with
humane ceremonies and inventions, she
is deformed, and looses all her grace and
beauty. And among these hath she met
with two most importunate pretenders,
<hi>Atheisme</hi> and <hi>Superstition;</hi> the one strips
her stark naked, the other meretriciously
prostitutes her in the disguises of humane
Inventions. And that she hath been thus
evill entreated, in all places and times,
this book gives but too great testimony,
whether you look on the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or this
small appendix, treating for the most, of
what happened in High and Low <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
I would not draw any excuse for
our own gyrations of Religion here,
from their madnesse; but rather condem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
them as things that would have out-vy'd
the extravagance of the former. But to
<pb facs="tcp:97888:300"/>
draw any argument against Religion
from either were impious; for if we did,
we must in consequence, deny all, both
particular and universal <hi>providence</hi> of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God; we must deny the Scriptures,
the heavenly Legacy of eternal salvation;
we must deny <hi>Heaven, Hell, Eternity,</hi> nay
take away the <hi>Cement</hi> of all humane soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
and expect to see the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi>
of the <hi>universe</hi> hurried into <hi>darknesse</hi> and
<hi>confusion,</hi> since it ought not to out-last
man, for whom it was created. Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but let us rather professe humanity, and
make this use of the failings and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of others in matters of Religion;
To humble our selves to a relyance on
that immense Being, who hath thought
fit to plant Religion in the heart of man,
to direct him in his voyage to eternal
happinesse, wherein that every man
might take the right way, is the earnest
prayer of</p>

that Ornament of his <hi>Carthage,</hi> lib. 11.
Epist. 8. to <hi>Cornelius</hi> then Bishop of
<hi>Rome) We needed not any relations
to be sent to us of him, since that
from us you were to expect a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account of</hi> Novatus, <hi>a man that
is a constant Advancer of novelties, of
an insatiable avarice, furious in his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
blowne up with arrogancie and
pride, even to astonishment; a man
not admitting any good understanding
with the Bishops: the end of his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
is to betray, of his flattery to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
his love is dogg'd by his infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
he is the fuell and fire-brand that
heightens the combustions of sedition,
and the hurrican and tempest which
causes the shipwrack of Faith, an
opposer of Tranquility, and an enemy
to peace.</hi> These were his thoughts of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus,</hi>
which what wise man but will
allow us to attribute to our <hi>Novators?</hi>
Certainly, if <hi>John</hi> that <hi>Botcher</hi> of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
the ulcer and deformity of that gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
City, were to be drawne in his own co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
we need borrow them no where else.
You therefore, Orthodox Doctors, reduce
those erroneous and miserably seduced men,
which yet are so, into the way of Truth,
Deliver them, I beseech you out of this

help to recover them out of this imaginary
disease to which they are so accustomed.

Upon this weighty businesse, the Magistrates and

preached in six Parish Churches, and that the Church
of <hi>our Lord</hi> only should be absolutely reserved to them.
These conditions were readily subscribed to by both
sides, and thereupon all things laid asleep in peace. But

The King and his Courtiers being gotten into a body,
drove back the enemy to the Gates, which the citizens
had by that time shut again: whereupon the rest of
them that were without, were forced to set Engines to
force open the Gates, which being once broken open,
they flourished and set up their Colours. The citizens
stiffely resisted the first assault, and made a strong body
in the Market place, where the fight became very hot
and bloody. The <hi>King</hi> himself, <hi>Knipperdoling</hi> and
<hi>Krachting</hi> fell into the enemies hands; but <hi>Rotman</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was no possibility of safety, rushing where the
enemy was thickest, was trod to peeces; he it seems
placing all hopes of life in death. The Anabaptists
upon the taking of their King being quite cast down

by those of the Kings Guard at the Royal Palace as much

This sad fate did that City suffer in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

might be made capable of the priviledges of the City,

have in him all the ingredients of honesty, modesty and

but deceit, fraud, and dissimulation; in a word,
an ingenouous Anabaptist. Having already felt the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Senate and divers of the Citizens, coming
with his whole family to <hi>Basil,</hi> he and his are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by a certain Citizen. Having nested a while in
<hi>Basil,</hi> he purchased certain houses in the City, as also a
Farm in the countrey and some other things thereto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertenant,
married his children, and by his good offices
procured to himself many friends. For, as long as he
remained at <hi>Basil,</hi> he so much studied Religion, was so
great an Alms-giver, and gave himself so much to other
exercises of devotion, that suspicion it self had not
what to say against him. By these cunning insinuations
(this is beyond a young fox, and smells more of the
<hi>Lybian</hi> wilde beast) many being surprised, came easily
over to his party, so that he arrived to that esteem and
reputation in matters of Religion, he pleased himself:

To which some made answer unanimously, that they
had left their countrey for the true Religions sake,
nor did they acknowledge themselves any other than
the professors and practisers of the lawfull Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That for his name, he had not called himselfs
by any other than his own proper name; and for his
doctrine, they had acknowledged none either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
or publickly, save what he had privately some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
suggested, which was not disconsonant to the

to bring forth into publick view some bookes and

hath been said of him.</p>
                     <p>6. But he further affirmed, That these things should
not come to passe according to humane ceremonies, but after
a <hi>spiritual</hi> dispensation, and after such a manner as ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>7. To make good and prove all these things, he wrested

effectuall for the obtaining of salvation; the <hi>Church</hi>
which they had by their doctrine built up and confirmed
could not possibly have been broken to peeces, for (as <hi>Christ</hi>

himself testifieth) against the <hi>true</hi> Church, the gates of
Hell shall not be able to prevaile: But that building
of Christ and his Apostles is overturned and pulled down to
the very foundation by Antichrist, as may be evidently
seen in the Papacy, according to the Testimony of the same
Christ; It therefore necessarily followes, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Apostles is imperfect and interrupted: whence
he concluded his own doctrine and faith to be the only solid
and sufficient doctrine.</p>
                     <p>9. Moreover he maintained himself to be greater than
<hi>John Baptist,</hi> yea than all the <hi>Saints</hi> that had gone before
him, for that the least in the Kingdome of God (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the suffrage of Truth it self) is greater than <hi>John:</hi>
But he said <hi>David George</hi> was one whose kingdome was
heavenly and most perfect; whence he makes himself not
only greater than <hi>John,</hi> but also sets himself above <hi>Christ,</hi>
since that he was born of flesh, and that himself was
born of the spirit according to a heavenly manner.</p>
                     <p>10. He further allowed with <hi>Christ,</hi> that all sinnes
committed against God the <hi>Father,</hi> and against the <hi>Son</hi>
may be forgiven, but those that are committed against the
<hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that is to say against <hi>David George,</hi> shall
be forgiven neither in this world, nor in the world to come;
by which means it is apparent that he conceiv'd himself
greater and higher than Christ, admitting Christs own
Testimony.</p>
                     <p>11. He declared Polygamy to be free and lawfull for
all, even for those that are regenerated by the spirit of
<hi>David George.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These heads [without any brains] did the Magistrate

but that as to that doctrine and the fore-recited Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
they unanimously affirmed that they had never
heard not read of any such thing. Neverthelesse they were
to acknowledge the doctrine expressed in those Articles,
to be pestiferous, execrable, and derived not from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97888:330"/>
but from Hell, and that it was heretical, and to
be banished with an eternal Anathema; and withall, as
men miserably seduced, yet desiring for the time to
come, to be reduced into the right way, they were, with
good reason, to implore forgivenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Among those that
were in close prison, there was one formerly of <hi>Davids</hi>
greatest confidents,<note place="margin">An ingenuous confession and resolution.</note> who confessed, that indeed he had
been infected with that Religion, but that since by the
illumination of the grace of God, he discovered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
the errours springing from it, and avoyded them
as he would do a cockatrice. But there were others who
were civilly acquainted with this man, who denied that
they had knowne any such thing by him, and cried out
against the fore-mentioned Articles as impious and
blasphemous. These passages, the Judges appointed by
the Magistrate, gave him an account of, who perceiving
that some that were in custody were not so extravagant,
but that they had some remainders of discretion left, he
sent to them some learned and able preachers of the
word, who, having diligently weeded out the tares of
their errors,<note place="margin">A pious act.</note> should sow into their hearts the saving seed
of true faith. Those who were sent, sifting them with all
the humanity, mildnesse, meeknesse and charity possible,
could scrue nothing out of them, more than what the
Judges who had been employed before, had done. In
the mean time a report was spread about the City,<note place="margin">A lying report raised.</note> that
it was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>David George,</hi> nor any eminent person of any
other name that had been buried, but that a meer swine,
calfe, hee-goat (haply an Asse) had been carried out and
buried, and that the dead carkasse embalmed with
the strongest spices, was worshipped and adored
with great devotion and religion. But this was but a
report, and was not true. Those that were in custody
abhorring that doctrine, as unheard of, and such as
deserved to be anathematized, and desiring to renew
their acquaintance with discretion and their sences, are
delivered out of those habitations of Iron which they
had kept possession of for two moneths, upon these
conditions,<note place="margin">Conditions whereupon the imprisoned are set at liberty.</note> That none should make any purchases

subscribe, with all the reverence and gratitude
they could possibly expresse. These things being
thus managed, the most renouned Senate, returning
