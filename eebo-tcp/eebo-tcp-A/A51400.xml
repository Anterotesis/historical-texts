            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Mornings Ramble: OR, Iſlington Wells Burleſqt.</head>
            <l>SAted with <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> laſt Night,</l>
            <l>The Joys that yield us moſt Delight.</l>
            <l>I took my Leave, and ſtole to Bed,</l>
            <l>But Roſe this Morn with <hi>Aching-Head.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To eaſe my Pain, and take the Air,</l>
            <l>I did to <hi>Iſlington</hi> Repair;</l>
            <l>Where every Whore, and every Rogue,</l>
            <l>Meet at the <hi>Wells</hi> ſo much in Vogue:</l>
            <l>Reſolving with my ſelf to ſtay,</l>
            <l>And drive an Hour or two away.</l>
            <l>I entred in, and viewed the Place,</l>
            <l>With every ſqueamiſh Breeding Face,</l>
            <l>Of City Wives, who thither come,</l>
            <l>Whilſt their poor <hi>Cuckolds</hi> wait at Home.</l>
            <l>Hoping the <hi>Springs</hi> may do them Good,</l>
            <l>To Purge their Veins, and clear their Blood.</l>
            <l>When they alas have no Deſign,</l>
            <l>Only to tipple off their <hi>Wine</hi>:</l>
            <l>And treat thoſe Brawny Lads they Hire,</l>
            <l>To do the Drudgery they require.</l>
            <l>But walking on, I chanced to ſee</l>
            <l>A pretty piece of Comedy.</l>
            <l>A Spark in Gown and Slippers ſtood,</l>
            <l>Courting a Wench who'd newly Spew'd:</l>
            <l>Madam I Grieve, or I'me a <hi>Turk,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To ſee the <hi>Waters</hi> upwards Work.</l>
            <l>And fear your Stomach is too Cold,</l>
            <l>Since Purging Streams you cannot hold.</l>
            <l>Take my Advice if you are ill,</l>
            <l>To enter in, and take a Gill</l>
            <l>Of cooling <hi>Nants,</hi> that may ſupport</l>
            <l>The weakneſs of your Stomachs Fort:</l>
            <l>And Faith and Troth I'le Treat you freely,</l>
            <l>With that which I am ſure will Heal ye.</l>
            <l>This offer was no ſooner made,</l>
            <l>But being Miſtris of her Trade,</l>
            <l>She ſoon accepts; when of a ſudden</l>
            <l>She ſhook and Quak'd like any <hi>Pudden.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The reaſon ſtrait I could not tell,</l>
            <l>But ſoon perciev'd her Guts Rebell:</l>
            <l>And that which made her Spew before,</l>
            <l>Now through her Tail Work't three times more.</l>
            <l>With that ſhe Curs't the fatal Hour,</l>
            <l>And trudg'd away to Secret Bower.</l>
            <l>In hopes when once ſhe had done her Stool,</l>
            <l>Back to return and catch the Fool.</l>
            <l>But powerful <hi>Waters</hi> Work't ſo faſt,</l>
            <l>She thought ſhe ſhould have Purg'd her Laſt,</l>
            <l>And e're ſhe reach't the place deſign'd,</l>
            <l>As <hi>Cotton</hi> of his <hi>Dido</hi> feign'd,</l>
            <l>A Yellow Aromatick Matter,</l>
            <l>Dropt down her Heels comix't with Water.</l>
            <l>When this I'de ſeen, away I ſtray'd,</l>
            <l>And met a <hi>Quack</hi> in <hi>Pluſh</hi> array'd,</l>
            <l>With Crouds of People at his Heels,</l>
            <l>Like a <hi>Scotch Meeting</hi> in the Fields.</l>
            <l>With Looks Demure he made a ſtand,</l>
            <l>Taking his Hat into his Hand;</l>
            <l>And to the People thus held forth,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>My Friends</hi> did you but know the worth,</l>
            <l>The value of theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spaws,</l>
            <l>With nothing elſe you'd fill your Maws.</l>
            <l>So Medicinal, and ſo good,</l>
            <l>'Tis better for you than your Food.</l>
            <l>At which a general Hum went round,</l>
            <l>That made the Neighbouring Fields Reſound.</l>
            <l>The Doctor when the noiſe was done,</l>
            <l>Made Reverend Scrape, and thus went on,</l>
            <l>If Barren Womb does want ſpecifick,</l>
            <l>To make her Fruitful and Prolifick;</l>
            <l>Theſe <hi>Waters</hi> will effect the Cure</l>
            <l>In nine Months time you may beſure.</l>
            <l>They eaſe the <hi>Gout</hi> and alſo <hi>Claps,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Beyond the danger of <hi>Relaps.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>People may talk of <hi>Epſom Wells,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or <hi>Tunbridge Springs</hi> which moſt Excells;</l>
            <l>I'le tell you by my ten years practice</l>
            <l>Plainly what the matter of fact is.</l>
            <l>Thoſe are but good for one Diſeaſe,</l>
            <l>To all Diſtempers this gives Eaſe.</l>
            <l>But in the midſt of this Oration</l>
            <l>A Roguiſh Cheat had fixt his Station,</l>
            <l>Cloſe by the Learned Doctors ſide</l>
            <l>Whoſe Pocketts both were well Suppli'd.</l>
            <l>And in a trice he ſtole a way</l>
            <l>The ready Caſh he'd gain'd that Day.</l>
            <l>I had no ſooner left this Place,</l>
            <l>But walking on with gentle pace,</l>
            <l>And Muſing Thoughts that oft do Clog us,</l>
            <l>I ſtep'd into the Womens <hi>Boghouſe</hi>:</l>
            <l>Where four or five together fat,</l>
            <l>Like Hunted <hi>Hares</hi> upon the Squat.</l>
            <l>But ſtrait endeavouring to retire,</l>
            <l>They flew upon me with ſuch Ire;</l>
            <l>Threatning my Carkaſs down to fling,</l>
            <l>And make me favour worſe than <hi>Ling.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With much ado I ſcap'd the Danger,</l>
            <l>And fled like <hi>Lightning</hi> from their Anger:</l>
            <l>Reſolving when I had reacht the Door,</l>
