            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ARithmetick is the Art of Numbers which teacheth to put the true value upon any figure or figures, and doth conſiſt of theſe following Parts, which are as Branches.</p>

Units, as two is compoſed of two Units, Three is compoſed of three Units, Four, of four Units, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore one unite is no number, but the beginning of number, for one doth neither multiply nor divide, for if you multiply or divide an unite by it ſelf, it admitteth of neither increaſe nor decreaſe, but number admitteth of both, Increaſe by Addition or Multiplication, and Decreaſe by Subtraction or Diviſion, as 6 is a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber compoſed of ſix units, and admitteth of Increaſe firſt by Addition, as 1 unit and 6 make 7, ſecondly by Multiplication, as 3 times 6 make 18, and 6 admitteth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Decreaſe, firſt by Subtraction, as, take 1 from 6 and there remains 5: ſecondly by Diviſion, as how many 2 can I have in 6, the anſwer is 3 times.</p>

                  <p>NUmeration is that part of Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, by which is taught rightly and juſtly to value, declare and write any Number or Sum propounded. All Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Sums are expreſſed by theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Characters or Figures, which are

                  <p>Nine of theſe figures, <hi>viz.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, are ſignificant figures, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each figure ſo many Unites, but the Cypher is of no value nor ſignification, as as it ſtandeth alone, but being joined with other figures it increaſeth the value of thoſe figures which ſtand to the left hand of him.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe nine ſignificant figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, have a double Value, whereof the one is certain, according to its own ſignification as before. But the other value is uncertain, it being according to the place that the ſaid Figure doth ſtand in and poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>A Place is a ſeat or room that a figure ſtands in, and how many figures there are in any ſum, ſo many places of value doth the ſaid ſum contain, and that is the firſt place of any Sum, which is next the right hand, every place being ten times the value of the next right hand place.</p>

Set the ſeveral Sums as you ſee one under the other. Having drawn a Line, begin at the lower end of that row next your right hand; ſaying, 5 and 7 is 12, and 8 is 20, ſetting under that firſt row 0, and carry 2 for ſo many tens to the next row; ſaying, 2 as I carried and 8 is 10, and 4 is 14, and 2 is 16, ſetting down 6 under that row, and carry 1 for the 10 to the next row; ſaying, 1 as I carried and 4 makes 5, and 1 is 6 and 3 is 9, ſetting down 9 under that row; ſo you have under the Line theſe figures 960, which is the total Sum of thoſe three. So that A oweth in all to B, C, and D, 960 Pounds.</p>
               <p>When you have any Sum to ſet down which you are to add up, you muſt be ſure to ſet down the ſeveral ſums ſo orderly one under the other as the units may ſtand under themſelves, tens under themſelves, hundreds under themſelves, and thouſands under themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> According to theſe following Examples.</p>

For the Proof of this Sum, whether it be caſt up right or not, the common way is to draw a line under the firſt ſum, and then ſum up again, only leaving out the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt row, which ſum being added to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt row or line, then if the ſum be the ſame as before, the work is right caſt up. But it is as eaſie or better to caſt up the whole ſum again, and if you think by doing ſo, you may commit the ſame error again, or fall into the ſame miſtake as before, you may caſt it up the contrary way, <hi>viz.</hi> begin at top and go downwards, for the Accompt will amount to one and the ſame ſum, if it be right done.</p>
                  <p>But Tradeſmen and Merchants being moſt concerned herein, have another help, which is in writing out Bills by their Books, if they find the ſums in both Accompts do not agree, they conclude there muſt be a miſtake in one or the other, which they find out by caſting the Accompts over again.</p>
                  <p>In caſting up long Bills, where many ſhillings, are in the pence, it is a good plain way to make a prick or ſome ſmall mark at every ſhilling, and ſo ſetting down the odd pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66445:14"/>
pricks you have made, and carry ſo many Shillings to the place of Shillings.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch as are ready and expert, count how many Pence are in the whole Column, then by getting without Book ſuch a Table as here followeth, can readily tell how many Shillings and odd Pence are in any Number of Pence.</p>

                  <p>When your Subtraction is ended, if you deſire to prove your work, whether you have done right or wrong; add the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainer to the Number that was to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and if the ſum of thoſe two Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be equal to the greater Number, or numbers from whence the Subtraction was to be made, then your Subtraction was true, otherwiſe falſe. Thus let us prove the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Example of this Chapter, where after Subtraction is ended, the Numbers ſtand as you ſee, the Remainder or difference being 3311 <hi>l. 16 s. 09 d.</hi> ½, now to prove the work I add this remainer 3311: 16: <note place="margin">

                  <hi>M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltiplication</hi> is a Rule which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by two Numbers given to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a third Number, which ſhall contain one of the given Numbers ſo often as there be Units in the other; and it ſerveth inſtead of many Additions, being a Compound of many equal numbers into one Sum, by multiplying one Sum into another. For it increaſeth one Number ſo often as there are Units in the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Multiplication</hi> doth conſiſt of three parts or numbers. That is to ſay, the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicand, the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicator, and the <note place="margin">

               <p>The Multiplicand is the Number to be multiplied. The Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicator is the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber given by which the Multiplicand is to

be multiplied. And the Product is the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which cometh of the Multiplication; as you ſee in the Margent: 384 is the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicand or Number to be multiplied; 23 is the Multiplicator or Number by which the Multiplicand is to be multiplied; and 8732 is the Product or Number that ariſeth and cometh by the ſaid Multiplication, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Multiplicand ſo often as there are Units in the Multiplier, that is 23 times. For the Product contains the Multiplicand as many times as there be Units in the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicator.</p>
               <p>It maketh no difference which of the two given Numbers you make the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicand or the Multiplicator, for 8 multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by 6, is as much as 6 multiplied by 8; but commonly the greateſt Number is made the Multiplicand, ſtanding upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and the leſſer Number the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicator, ſtanding under the Multiplicand.</p>
               <p>The Learner muſt get the following Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compleatly by heart, before he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further in Arithmetick, becauſe there is no Rule in Arithmetick but hath a great dependance upon <hi>Multiplication</hi> and <hi>Diviſion.</hi>

               <p>The uſe of this Table is not difficult, in the top of the Table you have theſe Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12; and likewiſe down the firſt Column to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your left hand you have the ſame Figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12; and in their reſpective Columns you have all thoſe Numbers multiplied by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that if you would know the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of any two given Numbers from 1 to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66445:31"/>
12 multiplied together, look for either of the two given Numbers in the top or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt Column, and for the other in the ſide Column, guiding your eye in the ſame until you come under the other Figure or Number in the uppermoſt Column, and in the common Angle or Meeting, you ſhall have the Product required. Example, I deſire to know the Product of 9 multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by 7. In the uppermoſt Column I find 9, and in the ſide Column 7; and carrying my eye along the row or Column againſt 7, until I come under 9 in the uppermoſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, I meet with 63, which is the Product of 9 and 7 multiplied together. And if you look for 7 in the top, and go down the ſame Column until you come againſt 9 in the ſide you will find 63 as before; ſo it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not which you look for in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Column, or which in the ſide Column.

Then 7 times 4 is 28, and 6 as I carried is 34; ſetting 4 and 3 after him as you ſee. So the firſt Product will be 3407173. Then I proceed to the next Figure, of the Multiplier which is 8, for a new Product. Saying, 8 times 9 is 72; now I muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the former Inſtructions for placing the ſeveral Products, <hi>viz.</hi> to place the firſt Figure or place of Units of your ſecond Product, under the ſecond Figure or place of tens in the firſt Product. Therefore for 72 I ſet down 2 under the ſecond Figure of the firſt Product being 7, and carry 7. Then 8 times 3 is 24, and 7 as I carried is 31; ſet down 1 and carry 3. Then 8 times 7 is 56, and 3 as I carried is 59; ſet down 9 and carry 5. Then 8 times 6 is 48, and 5 as I carried is 53, ſet down 3 and go 5.

Next I proceed to the third Figure of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier; ſaying, 3 times 9 is 27; ſetting

down 7 under the 1, which is the ſecond Figure of the laſt Product, and I carry 2. then 3 times 3 is 9, and 2 as I carried is 11; ſet down 1 and carry 1.

Then 3 times 8 is 24, and 2 as I carried is 26, ſetdown 6 and carry 2. Then 3 times 4 is 12, and 2 as I carried is 14; I ſet down 14 being the laſt Figure multiplied in that Product. Then I next proceed to the fourth Figure of the Multiplier, which is 4. Saying, 4 times 9 is 36; ſetting down 6 under 1, according to the former Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and I carry 3. Then 4 times 3 is 12, and 3 as I carried is 15; ſet down 5 and carry 1. Then 4 times 7 is 28, and 1 as I carried is 29: ſet down 9 and carry 2. Then 4 times 6 is 24, and 2 as I carried is 26: ſet down 6 and carry 2.

If you divide 8743168495 by 67832, the Quotient will be 128894, and there doth remain 30687, as by the foregoing Example doth appear.</p>
                     <p>By this way of multiplying your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor by the nine digit Numbers, you may, Firſt obſerve to be very uſeful, not only in this way of dividing downward, but in all other ways of <hi>Diviſion,</hi> whereby you may certainly know by ocular inſpection how many times your Diviſor is contained in your Dividend, without running the danger of miſtake, by reaſon whereof you may be conſtrained to begin your work again</p>

               <p>The great difficulty is to know which of theſe three given Numbers are to be placed in the firſt place, which in the ſecond, and which in the third.

If 3 Yards are worth 9 <hi>s.</hi> what ſhall 6 Yards be worth? here you ſee a demand made upon 6 Yards, for it is demanded what ſhall 6 Yards be worth? therefore 6 Yards muſt be in the third place, and 3 Yards in the firſt place, and then by conſequence the number 9 muſt be in the ſecond place, and they will ſtand in order thus.</p>

Multiply your ſecond and third Number together, and divide by your firſt, the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is the fourth Proportional or Number ſought.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Having placed my given numbers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former directions, as you ſee, I multiply the ſecond number 9 by my third number 6, the Product will be 54 which by the fifth Chapter I do divide by the firſt number 3, and the Quotient giveth 18 for ſo many Shillings, becauſe the ſecond num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was Shillings. So 18 Shillings is the price of 6 Yards, being the fourth Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional number, for the fourth number 18 doth contain the third number 6, as many times as the ſecond number 9 doth contain the firſt number 3.</p>
               <p>Therefore if 3 Yards coſt 9 Shillings, 6 Yards will coſt 18 Shillings.</p>

               <p>To obſerve the former Rules in placing the given numbers, I conſider that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is made upon 27 <hi>C.</hi> of Sugar, which muſt be the third number; next I conſider <hi>8C.</hi> to be of the ſame Denomination, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I put that in the firſt place, and by conſequence I put 32 Pounds in the ſecond place, being of the ſame Denomination as that number which is ſought, as you ſee in the following Example.</p>
               <p>Next I proceed and <note place="margin">

Now if any thing do remain after you have divided the Product of the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſecond and third number by the firſt number, the remainder of your Diviſion muſt be multiplied by the number of Units of the next leſſer Denomination as are equal to a Unite or Integer of the ſecond number in the queſtion, the Product of this Multiplication divide by the firſt number in your queſtion, and the quotient of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſhall be the ſame denomination as the parts by which you laſt multiplied, and part of the fourth number ſought, and if any thing remain of this Diviſion, multiply ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainer by the parts of the next inferior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination equal to a unite of the laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and divide the Product by the ſame Diviſor, and this Quotient ſhall be of the ſame denomination as your laſt multiplier, and ſo proceed either till nothing remain of your diviſion, or till you have reduced your remainer into your loweſt denomination.</p>

               <p>By the following Example you will find according to the former Inſtructions the numbers, and alſo multiplied and divided, the Quotient of the Diviſion gives 217 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:66445:73"/>
becauſe the ſecond number is Pounds, but there remains 9, by which I underſtand the price or value of 86 <hi>C.</hi> of Tobacco to be ſomething more than 217 <hi>l.</hi> and to know how much more I proceed according to the foregoing Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>As by this Example, <hi>viz.</hi> I multiply the Remainer 9 by 20, becauſe 20 Shillings is equal to an Integer of the ſecond number, the Product of this Multiplication is 180, which I divide by the firſt number 17, and the Quotient is 10 Shilling, becauſe the laſt Multiplier was of the Denomination of Shillings. But here yet doth remain 10, which I multiply by 12 Pence becauſe the laſt quotient was Shillings, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that Multiplication is 120, which I divide by 17 the firſt number, and the quotient is 7 Pence, becauſe the laſt Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier was Pence. But here yet doth remain 1, which if I multiply by 4, cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by 17, therefore I ſet it next after the Pence, and over the Diviſor with a Line between thus, 1/17. By which I do find that 86 <hi>C.</hi> of Tobacco will coſt 217 <hi>l. 10s. 7d.</hi> 1/17, if 17 <hi>C.</hi> coſt 43 <hi>l.</hi> which Fraction is one ſeventeenth of a Penny, which is an exact anſwer to the queſtion propounded.</p>

               <p>As you may diſcern by the enſuing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. I have placed the numbers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former Inſtructions, and likewiſe multiplied the ſecond and third numbers together, and divided by the firſt number, of which Diviſion there doth remain 12, and the Quotient is 205 <hi>C.</hi> weights, becauſe the ſecond number is of that denomination, <hi>viz.</hi> Hundred weights, now becauſe there doth remain 12, I underſtand thereby I can buy more than 205 Hundred weight of Sugar for 124 Pound; which to find out I thus proceed according to the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, <hi>viz.</hi> I multiply the remainer by 4, becauſe the ſecond number is Hundred weights, and 4 Quarters makes one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight, and the Product is 48, which I divide by 32 the firſt number, and the Quotient will be 1 Quarter, becauſe the Multiplier was ſo; but of this Diviſion there doth remain 16.

Quotient was Quarters, and 28 Pounds make 1 Quarter, and the Product of this laſt Multiplication will be 448, which I divide by 32, and the Quotient giveth 14 Pounds, becauſe the laſt Multiplier was Pounds, but of this laſt Diviſion there doth remain nothing. Finding by the Operation that for 124 Pound I can buy 205 <hi>C. 1 qu. 14 l.</hi> if 53 Hundred weight coſt 32 Pound, being the anſwer to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>

Next I conſider the nature and quality of the ſecond number which is Mony; but it likewiſe doth conſiſt of ſeveral denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, as Pounds, Shillings and Pence, <hi>viz. 32 l. 14 s. 6 d.</hi> which by the ſixth Chapter of Reduction of Mony, muſt be reduced into Pence, being the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination named, and it will produce 7854 Pence.</p>
               <p>Having thus reduced the three given numbers, as you ſee in the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I proceed according to the former Inſtructions of this Chapter, multiplying the ſecond number reduced 7854 by the third number reduced 9234, the Product of which Multiplication is 72523836, which I do divide by the firſt number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced 1428 by the inſtructions of the fifth Chapter, and the Quotient maketh 50787, which are Pence, becauſe the ſecond num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 7854 by Reduction was made Pence, which Quotient 50787 is the fourth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional required, and the number of Pence anſwering to the Queſtion, which by Reduction makes 211 <hi>l. 12 s. 3 d.</hi> And ſo much will 82 <hi>C. 1 qu 22 l.</hi> coſt, if 12 <hi>C. 3 qu.</hi> coſt 32 <hi>l. 14 s. 6 d.</hi> as was required.</p>

To prove the <hi>Rule of Three</hi> is to ſtate the Queſtion quite backward, by putting the fourth number found out, firſt, the third number put ſecond, and the ſecond number put third; ſo have you three new given numbers to find a fourth by the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which fourth number when it is found will be the ſame as the firſt number in the queſtion firſt ſtated.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Double Rule of three Direct.</head>
               <p>THE Rule of Three Double or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed is ſo called, becauſe it is a Compoſing or Joyning of two Queſtions of operations of the common Rule of Three into one, which doth much abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate Work.</p>
               <p>And as in the Rule of Three there is the Direct Rule and the Backward Rule, ſo here alſo the two Queſtions may require a Direct or Reverſe Proportion.</p>
               <p>The Double Rule of Three being either Direct or Reverſe, which is Backward.</p>
               <p>In the Double Rule of Three Direct there are 5 numbers given to find out a ſixth Proportional, which ſixth Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional may be found out by two ſingle Queſtions of the Rule of Three Direct.</p>
               <p>In theſe five given numbers of the Double Rule of Three Direct, are two Species or Kinds, firſt a ſuppoſition, ſecondly a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion or Demand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:66445:83"/>
The Suppoſition is contained in the three firſt of the five given numbers, the Demand in the two laſt.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion being ſtated, the five num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers given muſt be diſpoſed in ſuch order as the firſt and the fourth may be of one Denomination, the ſecond and the fifth number of another Denomination, and the anſwer in the ſixth will be the ſame with the third, and then the manner of operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be thus, multiply your firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond numbers, the Product ſhall be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor, then multiply the other three num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one by another, and the Product there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall be the Dividend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. If 100 <hi>l.</hi> in 12 months gain for Intereſt 7 <hi>l.</hi> what will 80 <hi>l.</hi> gain for 8 months?</p>
               <p>In the following Example of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion you ſee the three firſt numbers, <hi>viz.</hi> 100 <hi>l.</hi> 12 months, and 7 <hi>l.</hi> do contain a ſuppoſition, and the two laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 80 <hi>l.</hi> 8 months do contain a Demand or Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>And theſe five numbers are ſo diſpoſed and placed, that the firſt number 100 <hi>l.</hi> and the fourth number 80 <hi>l.</hi> are of one kind or Denomination, <hi>viz.</hi> Money, the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66445:83"/>
ſecond number 12 months, and the fifth number 8 months, are both of another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, <hi>viz.</hi> months, and the ſixth number required will be the ſame kind or ſpecies as the third number, <hi>viz.</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>Now according to the former Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Chapter, I multiply the firſt and ſecond numbers together, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct 1200 is the diviſor, then I multiply the three other numbers 7, 80, and 8 one by another as you ſee, whoſe Product com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to 4480 for the Dividend, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by 1200 the Diviſor, the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient giveth 3 for ſo many pounds, becauſe the third number was pounds, but of this Diviſion there will remain 880, which I multiply by 20, and the Product giveth 7600 for a new Dividend, which divided by 1200, the Diviſor, the Quotient gives 14 ſhillings, but there yet doth remain 800, which multipled by 12 gives 9600 in the Product for another new Dividend, which divided by the former Diviſor 1200, the Quotient giveth 8 pence, as by the former Example, ſo the ſixth number found is 3 <hi>l. 14 s. 8 d.</hi> being of the ſame Kind or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as the third number, <hi>viz.</hi> money,

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:66445:84"/>
therefore by the foregoing Operation 80 Pound for 8 Months will gain 3 <hi>l. 14 s. 8 d.</hi> if 100 Pound for 12 Months gaineth 7 <hi>l.</hi> being the true anſwer to the queſtion, as was required.</p>
               <p>This queſtion is done at two Operations by the <hi>Rule of Three Direct,</hi> but this is the quicker and ſhorter way by much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt Operation.</hi>
If 100 <hi>l.</hi> gain 7, what will 80 <hi>l?</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer 5: 12: 0.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Operation.</hi>
If 12 Months give 5 <hi>l. 12 s.</hi> what will 8 Months? anſwer 3: 14: 8.</p>
               <p>This Example will be ſufficient for the explanation of this Rule, but to make it ſo plain, that the Learner may meet with nothing to obſtruct his cheerful proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Art of Arithmetick, I will exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie theſe two Operations, as followeth, according to the Rules and Inſtructions laid down in the ſeventh Chapter.</p>

               <p>In the diſpoſing of the five given num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers you muſt always remember to make the third and fifth numbers of one and the ſame Kind or Species.</p>

               <p>In the following Example of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion you find the three firſt numbers, 100, 12 and 7 do contain a ſuppoſition of the queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuppoſe 100 <hi>l.</hi> in 12 months to gain 7 <hi>l.</hi> and the other two numbers 8 Months, and 3: 14: 8 contain the demand of the queſtion upon thoſe ſuppoſitions, <hi>viz.</hi> how much Mony in 8 Months will gain 3: 14: 8? which is according to the Inſtructions of the laſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>And according to the Inſtructions of this Chapter, I have made the third number 7 <hi>l.</hi> and the fifth number 3 <hi>l. 14 s. 8 d.</hi> both of one Species or Kind, that is to ſay, they both do ſignifie Mony gained, although one of them doth contain three denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the other but one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:66445:86"/>
Here you muſt note that if any of the five numbers given are of different denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, you muſt reduce all the numbers of the ſame Kind or Species into the loweſt denomination named, as here in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Example, the fifth number con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains three denominations, <hi>viz.</hi> Pounds, Shil ings, Pence, as 3: 14: 8, therefore I do not only reduce that fifth number into Pence, but the reſt of the five numbers, that are of the Species of Mony, 100 <hi>l.</hi> and 7 <hi>l.</hi> and afterwards I proceed according to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as by the following Example.</p>

               <p>BEFORE we treat of Reduction of Fractions, it will be convenient to ſhew the Learner what a Fraction is.</p>
               <p>A Fraction or Broken Number is a part or many parts of any whole number, and it is uſually expreſſed by two numbers in ſmaller figures, one above the other, with a little Line drawn between them, thus ¾ the figure or figures, ſtanding above the Line, are called the Numerator, the other
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66445:89"/>
underneath the Line are called the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator, as by Example, 3 quarters is a Fraction, and muſt be thus expreſſed, whereof 3 ſtanding above the Line, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Numerator, and 4 which ſtands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Line is called the Denominator, it being always convenient that the Numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor be always leſs than the Denominator, for if the Numerator be either greater or equal to the Denominator, it is then an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Fraction.</p>

               <p>IN the Direct Rule of Three in Fractions there are four things to be obſerved and practiſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Fractions of the firſt and third places be of one Denomination, as Mony, Weight, or Meaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if any of the given Fractions be Compound, they muſt be reduced to ſimple of the ſame value.</p>

Chapter and the ſeventh, I proceed to the Solution thus. Multiply the Numerator of the firſt Fraction which is 3 by 12, and 12 the Denominators of the ſecond and third Fractions, the Product will be 432 for a new Denominator. Then multiply 8 the Denominator of the firſt Fraction by 5 and 9 the Numerators of the ſecond and third Fractions; the Product thereof is 360, which is a new Numerator. So I have found the fourth proportional Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction 360/432 for anſwer to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and by abbreviation is found equal to ⅚ or 16 <hi>s. 8 d.</hi>

When you have a Queſtion to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by this Rule, then the third Term is the Diviſor, then having exactly reduced the Terms given according to the Rules of the laſt Chapter, then multiply the Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the third Fraction by the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators of the ſecond and firſt Fractions, and the Product gives a new Denominator, Then multiply the Denominator of the third Fraction by the Numerators of the ſecond and firſt Fraction, and the Product gives a new Numerator, and this new Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is the fourth proportional Fraction and anſwer to the Queſtion propounded.</p>

Here you ſee in this Queſtion the ſecond and third Fractions are mixt Fractions, there you ſee they are reduced to improper Fractions, ſo the three given Fractions are ⅞, 7/4 and 7/5. Now according to the former Inſtructions of this Chapter, I multiply the Numerator of the third Fraction being 3, by the Denominators of the ſecond and firſt Fractions, which is 4 and 8, the Product thereof is 224, which is a new Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator. Then I multiply the Deuomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the third Fraction 5 by the Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators of the ſecond and firſt Fractions, which is 7 and 7, the Product thereof will be 245, which is a new Numerator. So I have found out the improper Fraction 245/224, which reduced is 1 21/224 equal to 1 3/32, which is the anſwer to the propounded Queſtion.</p>

I would likewiſe adviſe the Learner to get the two foregoing Tables by Heart, the firſt containing the even parts of a Shilling, the ſecond the even parts of a Pound.</p>
               <p>When a Queſtion is propounded to be reſolved, you muſt conſider whether the price of the Integer be parts of a Shilling, or parts of a Pound.</p>
               <p>And whether the ſaid price be either the even part of a Shilling, or the even part of a Pound; if it be neither the even part of a Shilling, nor the even part of a Pound, you may divide the ſaid price into ſo many parts that each part may be the even part either of a Shilling or Pound, as 5 <hi>d.</hi> ¾ may be divided into three even parts of a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>viz. 3 d.</hi> which is ¼ of a Shilling, 2 <hi>d.</hi> which is ⅙, and ¾ which is 1/16.</p>
               <div n="1" type="proposition">
                  <head>Propoſition 1.</head>
                  <p>If the price of a Unite of the Sum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded be a Farthing, I find by the Table a Farthing to be the 1/48 of a Shilling, but becauſe the 48. part of any Sum is not ſo ſoon taken as the ½, the ⅓, the ¼, the ⅙, the ⅛, and the like, therefore becauſe 8 Farthings make 2 <hi>d.</hi> I divide the given
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66445:109"/>
number by 8, that is to ſay, I take the eighth part, and if any thing remain they are all Farthings. Then by the Table I find that 2 <hi>d.</hi> is ⅙ of a Shilling, therefore take the ſixth part of them for Shillings, and what remains is ſo many two Pences; now theſe Shillings reduce into Pounds, by cutting off the firſt figure to the right hand, with a ſmall ſtroak with your pen; then draw a line underneath, and take half of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining figures, which I ſet under the line for ſo many Pounds; but if the laſt figure you are to halve be an odd figure, take the half and add 10 to the figure cut off, for that figure and the 10 added together makes ſo many Shillings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi> Let it be required to know how much 9783 <hi>l.</hi> at a Farthing <hi>per</hi> Pound cometh to. Firſt, as you ſee in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Example, take the eighth part of 9783, and it is 1222 two Pences, and 7 Farthings remaining, which is 1: ¾ I ſet a little diſtance to the right hand, next by the Table of the even parts of a Shilling, I find 2 <hi>d.</hi> to be the 1/0 part, therefore I draw a line under 1222, and take the ⅙ part thereof, which is 203 Shilling, and 4 remaining which is ſo many two pences; therefore I
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:66445:109"/>
ſet down 8 under the laſt Remainer, I draw a line under theſe Shillings 203, and reduce them into Pounds, according to the Inſtructions hereof, and of the ſixth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of Reduction of Mony, by cutting off the firſt figure towards your right hand, which is 3, and drawing a line I take the half of the Remainer 20, which is 10 Pounds, and the figure 3 cut off ſignifieth ſo many Shillings. Now I add all theſe odd Remains together, <hi>viz.</hi> 1: ¾, 8 <hi>d.</hi> unto 10 <hi>l. 3 s.</hi> So the whole Sum is 10: 3: 9: ¾, the Reſolution of the propounded Queſtion, as by the following Operation.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt Example it is propounded 65937 <hi>l.</hi> at a Farthing <hi>per</hi> Pound, the ⅛ thereof is 8242 two Pences, and ¼ Farthing remaining, the ⅙ of 8242 two Pences is 1373 Shillings, and 4 two pences remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is 8 <hi>d.</hi> Next the 1/20 of 1373 Shillings is 68 Pounds, and 13 Shillings remaining; ſo taking all the Remains to this laſt Sum, it makes 68: 13: 8 ¼, and ſo much doth 65937 <hi>l.</hi> come to at a Farthing <hi>per</hi> Pound;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66445:110"/>
and in the ſame manner is the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample explained. The reaſon why I take the ⅛ and ⅙ in theſe Examples of a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and not 1/48, is becauſe the ⅙ of ⅛ is equal to 1/48.</p>

The adding together of theſe fourth proportionals found is the proof of the ſingle Rule of Fellowſhip, for if they make up the ſame Sum as was gained by the whole Stock, or loſt, then your ſeveral Operations have been right worked, if there be any difference you may certainly conclude you have committed ſome errour.</p>

                     <p>But by the firſt Example of the Double Rule of Three, you do this and ſuch like queſtions at one Operation. Thus</p>
                     <p>Say, if 100 <hi>l.</hi> for 12 Months gains 6 <hi>l.</hi> what ſhall 450 <hi>l.</hi> gain for 9 Months?</p>
                     <p>Set down the ſeveral numbers given in order as follow with their denominations over head.</p>
                     <p>The Operation is thus, you have here five numbers given to find out a ſixth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional, wherein 100 <hi>l.</hi> is the firſt Term, 12 the ſecond, 6 the third, 450 and 9 the fifth Term.</p>
                     <p>Therefore multiply the two firſt Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> 100 and 12 together, the Product
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:66445:135"/>
thereof is 1200, then multiply the three laſt Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> 60, 450 and 9 into one <gap reason="math">

                     <p>But to avoid Fractions in this manner of working, and to find out the true and

                     <p>Take away the two figures towards the right hand, or elſe make a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and then it will be 74 <hi>l.</hi> and 21 hundred parts now to find out the value of this 21 hundred parts, you muſt multiply it by 20, and by taking two figures from the Product it makes, 4 Shillings 20 parts, multiply this 20 parts by 12, doing as before, you have 2 <hi>d.</hi> and 40 parts. Laſtly multiply this 40 parts by 4, and your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will be 1 Farthing, 60/100 parts of a Farthing. So the exact Intereſt of 1236: 16: 8 for a Year is 74 <hi>l. 4 s. 2 d. 1 f.</hi> 60/100.</p>

Laſtly, I multiply 215731 by 106, the the Product is 228674 (86, cutting off two figures as before there remains 228674 Farthings, which reduced gives 238 <hi>l. 4 s.</hi> ½ for the Principal and Intereſt upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>200l.</hi> for three years.

                  </p>
                  <p>The 300 <hi>l.</hi> paid at 6 Months is the time equated or found out.</p>
                  <p>The other 300 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid at 9 Months is to be now paid at 6 Months, which is 3 Months before his time of Payment, the Intereſt whereof for 3 Months is 4 <hi>l. 10 s.</hi> as before, therefore 6 Months is the exact time for payment of the whole Sum of 900 <hi>l.</hi>

                  <p>It is required to extract the ſquare Root of 22429696, ſet a mark or prick with your Pen, under the firſt figure towards your right hand, and ſo under every ſecond figure as you ſee, ſo will your given num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

be divided into four parts or points, whereby you muſt note that the Root will admit of four figures, for the ſquare Root of the given number doth always admit of as many figures as the given number doth admit Points. Then proceed to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction thus, beginning at the left hand the firſt Point being 22, by the former Table of Squares, I find 16 to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Square number contained therein, whoſe Square Root is 4, therefore I ſet down 4 in the Quotient, and the Square thereof 16 I ſet underneath 22, and I ſubtract one from the other and there remains 6, which I ſet underneath; to this remainer 6 I draw down the next Point 42, which doth make the number 642; next I double the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient 4 which is 8, which I ſet down one figure ſhort of the right hand as you ſee; then do I ſeek how many times 8 will go in 64, which is 7 times, ſet down 7 under that vacant figure towards your right hand 2, and likewiſe ſet down 7 in the Quotient, and multiply 87 by 7, whoſe Product 609 ſet under the line, and ſubtract it from the number made of the laſt remainer, and the Point laſt brought down 642, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainer of this ſubtraction will be 33, to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:66445:179"/>
which remainer draw down the next point 96, and it makes the number 3396; next double the Quotient 47, it makes 94, which ſet under the number 3396, that it may ſtand one figure ſhort towards the right hand, as you ſee in the following Example; then ask how many times 94 is contained in the number or figures ſtanding over them 339? anſwer is three times, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſet down 3 to the right hand of 94, alſo I ſet down 3 in the Quotient, then do I multiply 943 by 3 the laſt figure in the Quotient, and the Product of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication 2829 I ſet underneath the line, and ſubtract it from the number made of the laſt remainer, and the point laſt brought down which is 3396, and of this ſubtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction there doth remain 567; laſtly to this remainer I draw down the next point 96, and it makes the number 56796, now double the Quotient 473, which makes 946, and ſet it under the number 56796, that it ſtand one figure ſhort towards your right hand as you ſee, and ask how many times 946 is contained in the figures ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over him 5679? anſwer is 6 times, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down 6 to the right hand of 946, and alſo in the Quotient, and multiply 9466 by
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:66445:179"/>
6 the laſt figure ſet in the Quotient, and the Product of ſuch multiplication I ſet down under the line being 56796, which I ſubtract from the number compoſed of the laſt remainer, and laſt point brought down which is 56796, and there will remain 0, and having no more points to draw down, I therefore conclude I have finiſhed my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, wherefore the ſquare Root of the given number 22429696 is 4736, as was required, as by the following Example doth appear.</p>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:66445:181"/>
Firſt point the given number as you ſee, ſetting a prick under the firſt figure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your right hand, and ſo under every third figure as you ſee, every prick except the laſt towards the left hand containing three figures, and that containeth the two figures 42: therefore in the foregoing Table, find out the greateſt Cube number in 42, which I find to be 27, whoſe Cube Root is 3, which place in the Quotient, and ſubtract the Cube number 27 from 42, and there will remain 15, which place under neath; to this remainer bring down the next point 144, ſo have you the number 15144, which call your Reſolv. draw a line under; ſquare the Quotient 3 which is 9, multiply the ſaid Spuare 9 by 300, and the Product thereof 2700, place under the Reſolvend, and call it the Treble Square. Again, multiply the Quotient 3 by 30, which makes 90, place 90 under the Treble Square, and call it the Treble Quotient, add the Treble Square and Treble Quotient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one Sum, and it makes 2790, which call your Diviſor, then examine how often you can take your Diviſor in your Reſolvend, which is four times, ſet 4 in the Quotient, then multiply the Treble
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66445:181"/>
Square 2700 by the 4 laſt placed in the Quotient, and ſubſcribe the Product un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath your Diviſor, ſquare the laſt ſaid figure in the Quotient 4, which is 16, thereby multiply the Treble Quotient 90, and the Product thereof 1440 place under the laſt Product 10800, cube the figure 4 laſt placed in the Quotient, which by the foregoing Table is 64, and place it under the preceding Products, then add theſe three Products into one Sum, and ſubtract the Sum thereof 12304 from your Reſolv. and there will remain 2840, to this remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der draw down the next point 192, and the number 2840192 is a new Reſolvend, under which draw a line, then ſquare the Quotient 34 which is 1156, which Square multiply by 300, and the Product 346800 ſet under the Reſolvend, and call it the Treble Square as before; then multiply the Quotient 34 by 30, and the Product thereof 1020, ſet under the Treble Square, and call it the Treble Quotient, and the Sum of the Treble Square and Treble Quotient is 347820, which call your Diviſor, and examine how often you can take your laſt Diviſor in your laſt Reſolvend, which will be 8 times, therefore ſet 8 in the Quotient,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66445:182"/>
multiply your laſt Treble Square by the laſt figure in your Quotient 8, the Product thereof 2774400 ſubſcribe under your laſt Diviſor, ſquare the laſt figure in your Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient 8, which is 64, by which multiply the laſt Treble Quotient, the Product 65280 ſet under the laſt Product, then cube the laſt figure of your Quotient 8, which by the foregoing Table you will find to be 512, which place under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Products, and add all theſe three Products into one Sum, which makes 2840192, which if you ſubtract from your laſt Reſolvend there will remain 0, and in ſuch manner muſt you proceed by reiterating the work by ſquaring the Quotient, until all the figures are brought down.</p>
