            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Theſe matters of fact are ſelf-evidences, and clearly ſhew that our <hi>Grievous Oppreſſions</hi> by our <hi>King</hi> are the effects of the united <hi>Councils</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Intereſt,</hi> whereof the <hi>French King</hi> is the <hi>Chief.</hi> That the <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> againſt true <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> that now appears in <hi>England,</hi> Comprizes all the <hi>Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>States</hi> in <hi>Europe; England</hi> is only firſt attacked as the principal Fortreſs of the <hi>Proteſtant Profeſſion,</hi> if the <hi>three Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> can be reduced into the pattern of the <hi>French King</hi> in <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and the ſtrength of them be united againſt any ſingle <hi>Proteſtant State</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> they ſhall think fit to aſſault, if they can by Artifices keep the reſt divided, which will not be hard for them; for there is little hope of any long defence of ſuch a State.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French King</hi> ſeems not unwilling to have it known that the <hi>Popiſh deſign</hi> is General againſt all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> tho eſpecially againſt <hi>England,</hi> he hath allowed the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Coſnaes</hi> ſpeech to him at <hi>Verſailes</hi> in 1685. to be publiſhed, who was authorized to be the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom</hi>; he magnifies the <hi>King</hi> for ſuppreſſing the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of his own <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and asks what they may not yet expect: <hi>England,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is juſt offering to your Majeſty one of the moſt glorious occaſions that you can deſire</hi>; the <hi>King of England</hi> by the need which he will have of ſuccour and of the ſupport of your <hi>Arms,</hi> to maintain him in the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> will make you quickly find occaſion to give a protection wholly of your ſelf. We know very well before the <hi>French Clergy</hi> declared it by that <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that the ſame head that contrived the pervertion of deſtruction of ſo many millions of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the ruin of the <hi>Engliſh Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty:</hi> but it ſurpriſed us, to ſee that ſpeech publiſhed by the <hi>French Kings Authority,</hi> and that our King ſhould ſuffer the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of it to paſs freely in <hi>England</hi> and thorow the <hi>World.</hi> We thought it beneath the Majeſty of a <hi>King of England</hi> to be content that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould be told, that he was to come under the protection of a <hi>King of France,</hi> over whoſe <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> his <hi>Anceſtors</hi> had ſo often triumphed; but it ſeems nothing is to be eſteemed inglorious that may ſerve the General <hi>Popiſh deſign</hi> of Extirpating the <hi>Proteſtant Profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We need not put <hi>your Hſs.</hi> in mind that the ſame ſpeech acknowledges that the <hi>Popiſh Councils,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy</hi> againſt <hi>England</hi> intend the like ruin to the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>United Provinces</hi>; that <hi>Biſhop</hi> tells the <hi>King,</hi> that he hath undertook the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> of new <hi>Countries</hi> there to re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip</hi> and the <hi>Altars,</hi> that <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> have been the Theater of his Victories only that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might triumph there, that is, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> might trample upon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and their <hi>Religion,</hi> and this he ſpeaks, (as he ſays) in the very Spirit of the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſignifies their hopes of ſucc<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>We muſt freely Confeſs we were too ſlow to believe this deſperate <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> againſt the whole <hi>Proteſtant Profeſſion,</hi> and in our particular Caſe we have been deluded with our <hi>Kings</hi> promiſes to protect and maintain our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> until we ſee them all undermined, and the train laid to blow them up by a packed <hi>Convention</hi> of men preingaged, perverted or corrupted to ſerve the <hi>Kings</hi> will and <hi>deſigns,</hi> that ſhall aſſume the name of <hi>Parliament</hi>: we were not utterly inſenſible of the danger of our <hi>Liberty</hi> in our <hi>Religion,</hi> and our <hi>Government</hi> from the time his <hi>now Majeſty</hi> declared his <hi>late Majeſty</hi> to have been a <hi>Papiſt</hi>; but who ſaw that by their ſecret Conjoyned Councils they had not been able to prevent the making ſome Laws to ſecure the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by Excluding <hi>Papiſts</hi> from our <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and all <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Imployments,</hi> and we hoped that our <hi>Kings</hi> life would not be ſufficient to overturn by degrees (as they had begun to proceed,) the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent foundations of our <hi>Civil Government,</hi> nor to Extinguiſh the clear light of the truths of <hi>Christ</hi> Profeſſed in our <hi>Religion</hi>; and we were aſſured that <hi>your Hſs.</hi> minds were clearly inlightened in the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and adorned and accompliſhed with all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Royal Vertues</hi> fit to poſſeſs the higheſt throne.</p>
            <p>Thereupon we incouraged each other to ſuffer with patience his <hi>Majeſties</hi> attempts againſt our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> preſuming that <hi>your Hſs.</hi> would ere long be our joyful deliverers to the Everlaſting Confuſion of the <hi>Popiſh deſigns</hi> againſt our <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and to the Vindication of the Innocency of the <hi>Proteſtant Martyrs</hi> in all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as <hi>your Hſs.</hi> were the greateſt objects of our earthly hopes, ſo the thoughts of her <hi>Royal Highneſſes</hi> ſucceſſion to the <hi>Crown</hi> in Conjunction with <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> Virtues and <hi>Military</hi> proweſs and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47926:6"/>
were matters of the greateſt horror and dread to all the Popiſh Councils of <hi>Europe.</hi> They have therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to various conſultations; ſometimes it hath been propoſed, by his Majeſty's Power with a Parliament by the deluding Names of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> and a <hi>Magna Charta</hi> therein, to Fetter Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Your acceſſion to the <hi>Crown</hi> with ſuch Conditions as were obtained in Parliament in the caſes of <hi>Queen Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which they hoped to ſtrengthen by his Majeſty's putting the Papiſts into poſſeſſion of all the ſtrength and Authority of the Kingdom, united with all the power of the French King, that your quiet Admiſſion to the Throne might not be poſſible, unleſs you ſhould ſubmit unto, and depend upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the Conditions that they ſhould impoſe. But they found it of greater difficulty than they at firſt imagined, to get a Parliament that would joyn with his Majeſty in ſuch a project againſt your Highneſſes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of the more cautious <hi>Papiſts,</hi> of conſiderable fortunes, ſtumbled at the abſolute force of a mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Army, and the French Power, to put a force upon the <hi>Heireſs</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi>; they propounded, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould rather try the force of his Paternal Power with her Royal <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and uſe all the arguments of intereſt to induce her either to change her ſentiments in her <hi>Religion,</hi> or at leaſt to moderate her thoughts concerning them, and incline her to concur in their full Liberty.</p>
            <p>If ſuch Endeavors ſhould be hopeleſs, that then Your <hi>Highneſſes</hi> ſhould be at leaſt prevailed with to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your Conſents to his Majeſties Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, and your concurrence in his deſires to a <hi>Parliament</hi> for the repeal of all the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in matters Eccleſiaſtical, and the <hi>Teſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was preſumed, That Your <hi>Highneſſes</hi> might have been perſwaded, that the Laws ſuſpended and diſpenſed with by his Majeſty were only two or three Laws againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> holding their Conventicles, and ſome Laws made ſince the Reformation, only to <hi>Compel Papiſts</hi> by great penalties to come to Church, and to keep their Prieſts out of the Kingdom, and it was hoped that Your Highneſſes Compaſſion to all Chriſtians, and a tenderneſs of the Liberty of Conſciences, would have moved you, without further Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to have complied with his Majeſties Requeſt.</p>
            <p>It was believed Your Highneſſes would never have inquired after the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in Matters Eccleſiaſtical, made by the Ancient <hi>Papiſts</hi> many hundred years ſince, againſt the horrid Invaſions by the Romiſh Church on the Rights of the Crown and the Realm, whereby they had impoveriſhed, inſlaved, and almoſt ruined the Kingdom; nor that your Highneſſes would have underſtood that the King hath opened a return to all thoſe wicked practices of that <hi>Popiſh Church,</hi> and that the repeal of thoſe Laws would ſettle them.</p>
            <p>It was ſuppoſed that Your Highneſſes had not known that the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in matters Eccleſiaſtical contain moſt of the cleareſt authoritative Declarations that are extant in any Records of the rights of the <hi>Engliſh Crown,</hi> of the Form and Conſtitution of our <hi>Government,</hi> and of the Rights and Liberties of the Subject; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s claims, Uſurpation and intolerable abuſes and oppreſſions having put a neceſſity upon the Kings and <hi>Parliaments</hi> to make thoſe Declarations of Law that are now antient Evidences of the Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kings and People, of ineſtimable value.</p>
            <p>It was imagined, That Your Highneſſes would not have diſcerned the conſequences of a General repeal of the Penal Laws in matters Eccleſiaſtical; that enacting only his Majeſties Declaration, (as he propounds there) would be the moſt abſolute and compleat Eſtabliſhment of Popery that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church can wiſh. All the Canons or Laws of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall then have greater legal force in <hi>England</hi> than they have had in five hundred years paſt, and all her Authorities and Juriſdictions over our Perſons and Eſtates will be in the ſame manner legal by ancient uſage, and approved by <hi>Parliament,</hi> as ever they were heretofore in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; part of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf will be repealed, that makes it <hi>Penal</hi> to ſuch as the Prieſt ſhall delude to give their Lands to <hi>Religious</hi> Houſes.</p>
            <p>There was ſuch a Confidence of deceiving your Highneſſes, and obtaining your Conſent to the repeal of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> that the Prieſts ſpread a rumor, that you had agreed, and that his Majeſty underſtood you well therein; a falſe Jeſuit had the impudence to whiſper it as a ſecret, that their general deſign could not miſcarry, ſeeing they were ſecretly aſſured that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> would Concur in it when it was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to declare himſelf.</p>
            <p>We were certain of the falſneſs of thoſe rumors, ſome of us knowing of applications that were contrived by his Majeſties order to your Highneſs in that matter; and we were much ſurpriſed when a friend of ours at <hi>Whitehall</hi> told one of us about the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, that the rumors of Your Highneſſes concurring with his Majeſty, were ſuddenly huſhed, and that he heard a whiſper that it was ſaid with much anger, that Your Highneſſes were obſtinate in your Errors, and thought to make your ſelves popular with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and he would trouble himſelf no more with you, but you ſhould repent it.</p>
            <p>Some few of us, who had often Conferences, concluded that the King had changed his meaſures, but could not imagin what was deſigned to offer to a <hi>Parliament</hi> in lieu of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Succeſſors conſent, to oblige them to repeal the Penal Laws deſired by his Majeſty. It was not long before we heard it muttered, that the Queen was with Child; and then the <hi>Papiſts</hi> began to Triumph, and the Prieſts gave out boldly, that it would ſet aſide her Royal Highneſſes right to the Succeſſion, tho it were a Daughter; and ignorantly and impudently Affirmed, that if the <hi>Queen</hi> had a Daughter Born after the King came to the Crown, it ought to Succeed before a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Born when he was but a Duke. But none but the Papiſts gave any Credit to the reports that ſhe was with Child; and the Fable of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Modena</hi>'s requeſt in Heaven or Purgatory, and the Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi>'s helping her to Conceive a Son for the ſake of a fine preſent, made all but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> believe it a meer invention of the Prieſts, whatever ſhould inſue.</p>
            <p>The ſtory of it ſhewed it to be of the lineage of the Popiſh Legends, and was a matter of laughter and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion amongſt the People, and a ſubject for Poets lampoons, which were ſo common that they were in <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> it ſelf, and no doubt they came to the knowledg of his Majeſty and moſt of his Court. The more
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47926:7"/>
ſerious <hi>Proteſtants</hi> preſently apprehended, that a ſuppoſititious Son was deſigned to abate <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi> growing <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> then juſtly looking upon her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> as <hi>Heireſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh Crown,</hi> and <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi> in all reſpects to be the fitteſt head for the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> againſt the <hi>General Popiſh Deſign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They knew this device to be neceſſary for ſupporting the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Terror</hi> of the <hi>French King,</hi> againſt the greatning <hi>reputation</hi> of <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi> by the Expectancy of the <hi>Engliſh Crown</hi>; 'tis known that he dreads <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi> Vindication and <hi>recovery</hi> of your own <hi>rights</hi> from his manifeſt <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>rapine,</hi> and your <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> in all <hi>Europe,</hi> againſt his <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Bloody Deſigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He knows that if her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> ſucceeds to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> he will be quickly incapable of proſecuting his cruel Intentions againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of other <hi>Countries,</hi> and, it may be ſcarce capable of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting his grandure and triumph over his <hi>miſerable Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very Expectation for 8 or 9 <hi>Months,</hi> that the <hi>Queen</hi> might bring ſorth a Son, was greatly for the <hi>Popiſh</hi> advantage, if the trick ſhould have failed in the <hi>Iſſue</hi> by any unlucky accident; it made a ſtand for a time of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of all <hi>Countries</hi> in the great Expectations from <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi>; it raiſed Triumphant hopes in all <hi>Popiſh Countries</hi>; it ſtrengthened the <hi>Engliſh Papiſts</hi> hands and hearts to proſecute their deſign Vigorouſly; it incouraged Corrupt and Time-ſerving <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in Profeſſion to fall in with their <hi>Party,</hi> and prevailed with many weak <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to make them believe a Succeſſion of <hi>Popiſh Princes,</hi> and that their <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is only to be expected from them, and that therefore they ought to ſerve in their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>When we ſaw the <hi>Incredulity</hi> and <hi>Mockery</hi> of the multitude at the ſtory of the <hi>Queens great Belly,</hi> and the ſad apprehenſions of the more Conſiderate, that for the politick ſupport of the <hi>Popiſh deſign</hi> a <hi>Counterfeit Son</hi> of the <hi>King's</hi> might be impoſed on the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> we reſolved to obſerve and keep <hi>memorials</hi> of the <hi>riſe, progreſs</hi> and <hi>iſſue</hi> of the whole matter (as far as we could get intelligence). We preſently perceived that the <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> were the prime reporters and moſt Confident <hi>Aſſerters</hi> of the undoubted truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and they boldly took upon them to preſage, that the <hi>Queen</hi> was with <hi>Child</hi> of a <hi>Boy,</hi> that was to finiſh the <hi>ſettlement</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as Certainly as if they had ſeen the <hi>Foetus</hi> perfectly formed in her <hi>Womb,</hi> or rather as if they had been privy to the <hi>Plot</hi> of a <hi>Suppoſititious Boy,</hi> and had their <hi>Cue</hi> in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
            <p>Their manner of <hi>talk</hi> and <hi>boaſting</hi> increaſed the <hi>general ſuſpition</hi>; we knew that ſort of <hi>Prieſts</hi> maintained the vileſt wickedneſſes to be lawful for their <hi>Church's ſervice,</hi> and that they have been notorious for <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures</hi> and <hi>Forgeries</hi> of all ſorts; they once Forged an <hi>Eternal Goſpel,</hi> (as they called it) to ſupport the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Mendicant Fryers</hi>; and if we may believe ſome of themſelves, they have a <hi>Father Titler</hi> in ſome <hi>rich Convents</hi> to forge titles to any mans land adjoying to theirs when the <hi>Convents</hi> have a mind to them: thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> contrived <hi>Queen Marys</hi> great belly for a <hi>counterfeit Heir</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> to have Carried on their <hi>Catholick cauſe</hi>; and as great <hi>publick Triumph</hi> and <hi>ſolemn Prayers</hi> for her <hi>Belly</hi> were made at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in all <hi>Popiſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> as have been made in our <hi>Queens Caſe</hi>; but their deſign was unluckily croſſed when her <hi>Deliverance</hi> was Expected, and their <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> vaniſhed in ſmoak.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> were the <hi>Agents</hi> for the Bloody and unnatural <hi>Uſurpation</hi> of our King <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>third.</hi> A <hi>Prieſt</hi> Preached at <hi>Paul's Croſs</hi> to make the People believe that <hi>King Edward</hi> 4. his elder <hi>Brother,</hi> whoſe <hi>Sons King Richard</hi> had Murthered, was a <hi>Baſtard,</hi> not the lawful <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Rich.</hi> D. of <hi>York,</hi> and that <hi>Richard</hi> was the true <hi>Legitimate Son,</hi> and had been a long time wronged of the <hi>Crown</hi> belonging to him.</p>
            <p>It was a <hi>Priest's</hi> invention and management, to ſet up <hi>Lambert Symnel,</hi> a <hi>Bakers Son,</hi> againſt <hi>King H.</hi> 7. Counterfeiting him to be <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and laying claim to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and was Proclaimed <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and marched into <hi>England</hi> with a good <hi>Army</hi> to maintain his Pretence: and by the like advice <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin Warbeck,</hi> another <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> was ſet up againſt the ſame <hi>H.</hi> 7. by <hi>Margaret Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to be <hi>Richard</hi> the younger Son of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. and made ſuch a conſiderable party in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was ſo received and aſſiſted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he bid fair for the <hi>Crown</hi>: and we could not forget what a cheating trick the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> invented and practiſed of later <hi>years</hi> about procuring an <hi>Heir</hi> to a <hi>Crown</hi> that is become their <hi>chief ſupport</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Remembrance of theſe, and many other wicked <hi>frauds</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> of the like import, to change the <hi>Succeſſions</hi> of <hi>Crowns</hi> to ſerve their <hi>Church,</hi> and ſeeing them ſo buſie and induſtrious to prepoſſeſs the <hi>Peoples</hi> minds with an opinion that the <hi>Queen</hi> had a <hi>great belly,</hi> and that it was a <hi>Son,</hi> when it was impoſſible in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be known, if ſhe had been then really pregnant; theſe things, we ſay, put together, confirmed our <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions</hi> that they acted a part as they were influenced, and that a <hi>Counterfeit</hi> Son might be reſolved on to be ſet up for <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> as common ſame confidently reported.</p>
            <p>The Collections and Obſervations we have ſince made of the things that occurred during the <hi>Queens</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed pregnancy, and about her pretended <hi>Delivery</hi> of this <hi>Son,</hi> have made the truth of the matter ſo plain in our apprehenſions, that now we no more ſuſpect, but conclude and believe this pretended <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> to be a meer Counterfeit, and we hold it our Duty to <hi>Your Highneſſes,</hi> to our <hi>Country,</hi> and to the whole <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> (this <hi>Child</hi> being ſet up againſt all theſe) to ſet before you all the <hi>Memorials</hi> we have taken in the whole matter, ſeveral of us at leaſt having been very near the <hi>Court</hi> during the whole Tranſaction.</p>
            <p>We crave leave to put <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi> in mind, that before we can convincingly ſet forth the ſpecial, and particular <hi>Facts</hi> and Circumſtances that we have remarked in this matter, 'tis neceſſary that we firſt remember and evince the truth of ſome general Concluſions about the Proofs and Evidences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47926:7"/>
a true Judgment ought to be made of this ſuppoſed <hi>Prince</hi>; and if <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> ſhall be clearly ſatisfied in the truth of thoſe Concluſions, whereof we cannot doubt, you may be fully convinced by them alone, without further heſitation or Inquiry, that this ſuppoſed <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> cannot be juſtly judged by any kind of <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> whatſoever to be in truth born of the <hi>Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt certain Concluſion to be remembred is this, That by the Univerſal Rules of Juſtice and Equity, any <hi>Child</hi> of our <hi>Queens</hi> (that was expected or hoped to be the <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>three Kingdoms,</hi> and to poſtpone or ſet aſide an undoubted <hi>Heireſs</hi> apparent, and alſo the right Expectance of a warlike <hi>Prince,</hi> and divers <hi>Princeſſes</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi>) we ſay, ſuch a <hi>Child</hi> ought to have been atteſted to be born of the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Queen,</hi> of the perſonal certain knowledg of proper <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſuitable to the caſe and concern, in ſo great a <hi>number,</hi> and of ſuch unſpotted fame, undoubted Authority, and perfect indifferency, that the Proofs of its <hi>Birth</hi> could never have been reaſonably drawn into doubt or queſtion, either in <hi>England</hi> or any other <hi>Chriſtian Kingdoms</hi> or <hi>States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Son of the <hi>Queens</hi> Body had naturally and really made an entry in the moment of his <hi>Birth,</hi> upon the apparent right of her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi>: She had thereby rightfully ceaſed to be <hi>Heireſs</hi> apparent to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and no Rules of natural <hi>Civil Juſtice,</hi> nor the <hi>Law</hi> of any <hi>Civil Government,</hi> will allow or ſuffer entries to be made, and perſons to be outed of the Rights they apparently had in <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> without ſufficient proof either of right Paramount to the others, or a determination of thoſe former Rights apparent.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Engliſh Laws,</hi> and ſpecial <hi>Statutes</hi> for that purpoſe, abhor any Entry upon the apparent legal <hi>Right</hi> of another, either of the Will of the <hi>King,</hi> or of any <hi>Subject</hi>; the Admiſſion of ſuch a Practice is abſolutely deſtructive of <hi>Property</hi> and all <hi>Civil Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Government</hi>; it diſſolves the whole <hi>Civil Government,</hi> and turns all into the confuſed courſe of <hi>natural Right</hi>; whereſoever a <hi>Civil Government</hi> and Property is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed on Entry of Will upon the Legally apparent Right of others, without ſufficient Manifeſtation of their own greater or better Rights, is directly contrary to <hi>Gods Eternal Law,</hi> and that of all <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> amongſt men.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe certain infallible Foundations we build our Concluſion, That this ſuppoſed <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> Born of the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Queen,</hi> ought by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Fundamental Rules</hi> of all <hi>Civil Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and by the unalterable <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to be manifeſtly proved by them that pretend it, beyond all poſſible Contradiction, in ſuch manner as is deſcribed and ſpecified in the preceding Concluſion, and ſuch proofs ought to have been publickly divulged and made known to <hi>England,</hi> and the World, before his <hi>Patrons</hi> ought to have entred in his name upon her <hi>Royal Highneſſes</hi> Right, in the <hi>Judgment</hi> of our <hi>Laws</hi> to be ſtiled and reputed the <hi>Heireſs</hi> apparent to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to aſſume to him that Honour and Glory, which her <hi>Highneſs</hi> juſtly had in <hi>England,</hi> and all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> to be apparently the next <hi>Succeſſor</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſtionleſs all the Civilized <hi>Kingdoms</hi> in the World, that are <hi>Hereditary,</hi> have purſued theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Juſtice and Reaſon in their <hi>common Cuſtom,</hi> to have their <hi>Princes</hi> born in the preſence of the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> the chiefeſt Men of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> in the higheſt <hi>Truſts</hi> for the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>foreign Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>States:</hi> That the <hi>Heirs</hi> o thoſe great Inheritances might be ſo known and manifeſt, that it might not be poſſible for any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies to ariſe about their Births, and their being the <hi>Lineal Heirs</hi> of the Reſpective <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Rights of any kind are obtained meerly by virtue of Birth, thoſe that claim them are bound to prove by <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſuitable to the Reſpective <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of every Caſe, the reality of their pretended <hi>Birth</hi> at their Peril of being juſtly excluded from the Rights they demand; yet Juſtice does not always require the like <hi>Witneſſes</hi> and <hi>clearneſs</hi> of <hi>Teſtimony</hi> about the <hi>Birth</hi> of all common Perſons; the Circumſtances of their caſes being ſo different, that Witneſſes of ſuch qualities and in ſuch a number as may be ſufficient proof for the birth of one Heir, may juſtly be judged inſufficient for the birth of another.</p>
            <p>But the Birth of the pretended <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> was attended with ſuch Circumſtances, that Juſtice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that his Birth of the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould have been teſtified by a plenty of ſuch <hi>Witneſſes</hi> as their proof might have amounted to the higheſt degree of Certainty that is poſſible to be built upon humane <hi>Teſtimony</hi>; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of his pretended <hi>Birth</hi> were very extraordinary.</p>
            <p>It was generally reputed and believed, that the <hi>Queen</hi>'s ſickneſſes and infirmities had diſabled her to bring forth a living <hi>Child.</hi> The famous Phyſician Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſhewed that opinion to his <hi>Brethren,</hi> of one of her <hi>Children,</hi> when her <hi>Majeſty</hi> was much ſtronger, ſaying, there were <hi>mala ſtamina vitae</hi>; and the popular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therein was confirmed by ſeveral <hi>years</hi> experience.</p>
            <p>It was notorious that two hundred to one throughout the <hi>Kingdom</hi> did not believe the report that her <hi>Majeſty</hi> was with <hi>Child,</hi> notwithſtanding all that was ſaid of it by the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the <hi>Prayers</hi> injoyned thereupon.</p>
            <p>That her <hi>Majeſtys</hi> pregnancy was as little believed in foreign <hi>Proteſtant Countries,</hi> as in <hi>England</hi>; and <hi>Pamphlets</hi> were publiſhed in ſeveral <hi>Countries</hi> as well as in <hi>England,</hi> that declared the Report of the <hi>Queens</hi> being with <hi>Child,</hi> to be nothing more than an <hi>Artifice</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> by thoſe hopes of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> to encourage their <hi>Catholicks</hi> in their Deſigns, and to gain Proſelytes.</p>
            <p>It was publickly known, that there was a jealouſie in the greateſt part of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that the <hi>Popiſh Councils</hi> had deſigned to impoſe upon them a counterfeit <hi>Prince of Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:47926:8"/>There were alſo Circumſtances about the Birth of this ſuppoſed <hi>Prince,</hi> of another ſort, and no leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. It was the general opinion, that the Security or Danger of the Profeſſion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> not only in <hi>England,</hi> but in all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> would be the certain conſequence of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties bearing or not bearing a <hi>Prince of Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Birth of ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> was to be a great diminution of many <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Princeſſes</hi> in their Expectancy and Right to the Succeſſion to the three Crowns, and threatned <hi>England</hi> with the Danger and Miſery of falling under an Infant <hi>Prince</hi> in name, and in truth under the Domination of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe ſpecial Circumſtances attending the birth of this ſuppoſed <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> being of ſuch nature, import and number, as the like never met together before in the Expectations of the birth of any Prince in the world. In this Caſe Natural Juſtice, common to all Nations, and the practical reaſon of the ſpecial Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Law of <hi>England</hi> in the proof of Matters of fact, we ſay, both univerſal Juſtice and the Peculiar Law of <hi>England</hi> required indiſpenſibly, that there ſhould have been ſuch proper proof that this ſuppoſed Prince was born of the <hi>Queen,</hi> as was anſwerable unto all the ſpecial Circumſtances in the caſe, ſuch proof as had comprehended the objections that might ariſe from every of them, as fully as was poſſible in the nature of the things, that the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of his <hi>birth</hi> might have been ſufficient to have ſatisfied the moſt jealous and diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about it in our <hi>own</hi> and foreign Countreys, and to have removed all the prejudices againſt it that were known to have been ſpread far and near by Common fame.</p>
            <p>It was abſolutely neceſſary in Juſtice, Law and Prudence, to have had ſuch proof of his birth as our prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent concluſion hath aſſerted: that is,</p>
            <p>That there had been Teſtimony of it, of perſonal and abſolutely certain knowledg. Women to have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their Perſonal ſight and perception of that very individual Child coming naturally out of the <hi>Queens</hi> womb, and men to have witneſſed their immediate free and full ſight and inſpection of that very Child by the womens aſſiſtance in his pure natural nakedneſs, with all the known marks and tokens of his being juſt ſeparated from the womb, and from thoſe other things that are natural to the birth of a Child, the effects of ſuch ſeparation being there viſible, and impoſſible to be hidden; ſuch Teſtimony is always provided for in the birth of every Prince of the blood in <hi>France,</hi> tho never ſo remote from the Crown.</p>
            <p>That the witneſſes of thoſe matters had been fit and proper witneſſes, ſuitable to the greatneſs of the Perſons and things that might be in queſtion, and to the vaſt Extenſive Conſequence that may enſue thereupon. Nature or the firſt light from God Created in the minds of mankind, dictated the equity of thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> imperial Laws that appointed thoſe which aſſerted filiation or marriage, to prove them by fit or proper and moſt unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble witneſſes; moſt of the Writers about thoſe Laws ſerve themſelves therein of theſe Words ſeverally, which we will for ſhortneſs put together; <hi>Matrimonium &amp; filiationem qui aſſerunt, debent probare per teſtes ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neos omni Exceptione majores,</hi> they that alledg a marriage or a Child being, by virtue whereof they claim, ought to prove it by witneſſes that are above or beyond all poſſible Exception; in this caſe there ought to have been ſuch fit witneſſes that nothing could have been objected againſt them in any reſpect either by Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Foreigners.</p>
            <p>That the witneſſes that Law and Prudence required of both ſexes, had been fit and proper in reſpect of their years, or age; that the women had been Matrons, whoſe gravity and ſobriety were fit to attract ſome decent reverence from the men of like quality, in their Expoſing to them nakedly the works of nature as was unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary.</p>
            <p>That they had been fit and proper in regard of their ſufficiency of knowledg and underſtanding in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Child-bearing, ſuch as knew by Experience all thoſe works of Nature, in what manner the Mothers ought to be and are Cuſtomarily treated in their real travel and Child-bearing, and immediately after it, and what are the natural Symptoms in the Mother, that Accompanie the real bringing forth of a Child before it hath been its natural time of nine Months in the womb, and at its due natural time, and alſo the ſigns of a Child perfectly grown in the womb, or brought to light before its time of perfection: it was of neceſſity that the witneſſes had been of ſuch knowledg and experience in all theſe Matters, or ſo ſufficiently informed about them by others of skill and faithfulneſs, that it might have been Evident to the Kingdom that ſuch witneſſes could not be impoſed upon, deluded, or deceived by any Cunning Artifices to believe this pretended Prince to have been born of the <hi>Queen,</hi> if he were in truth ſuppoſititious and Counterfeit.</p>
            <p>The General Rules of our Canon Law required, that the Witneſſes had been publickly known to the Kingdom by their Perſons or their Names, their Intereſts, Concerns or Imployments; our Fundamental Laws have taken care that all matters of Fact ſhould be decided by Juries of the Neighbourhood where the Facts are done, that the Witneſſes that teſtifie them, may be known to the Jurors; and Fraud is always ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, if perſons unknown to the Neighbourhood of the Facts be produced to witneſs them, unleſs there be manifeſt reaſon for their knowledg of the Fact better than thoſe that were near to the place, and known to the Jurors.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of our Law is of impregnable force in the caſe of the ſuppoſed Prince, that the Witneſſes of his Birth ſhould be perſons publickly known, on whoſe knowledg, truth and credit, the whole Kingdom and the Chriſtian World ſhould rely in a matter of ſuch vaſt conſequence. Obſcure unknown perſons never publickly named or heard of in this or any foreign Kingdom, and above all obſcure foreigners, <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> or others, ought not to be deemed fit or competent Witneſſes to ſatisfie the Kingdom in this Fact: indeed when Circumſtances are conſidered, it will be evident that their pretended Teſtimony ought to be rejected; and if it be offered, it juſtly puts a prejudice upon their pretences, in regard there was a whole Kingdom, beſides all the Eminent Miniſters of Foreign Princes and States, out of which Witneſſes might have been
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47926:8"/>
ſelected that were publickly known and heard of by all the People; and the neceſſity of it was never ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in any caſe, it being known to <hi>his Majeſty</hi> and his whole <hi>Court,</hi> that the <hi>Queens</hi> being with <hi>Child,</hi> was not generally believed either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Foreign Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Common Juſtice</hi> required that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> had been fit and proper, in reſpect of their high diſtinguiſhing Quality; either that they had been dignified with ſome of the higheſt <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Dignities,</hi> as <hi>Arch-biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi>; or had been by <hi>Birth</hi> or <hi>Creation</hi> of the degree of the greateſt <hi>Nobility</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi>; or that their extraordinary Worth had raiſed their Reputation, and had been honoured with the great and eminent Offices of Truſt in the Realm.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Laws</hi> are impartial to High and Low in hearing the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in every Caſe; and therefore they duly conſider both the Circumſtances of every Fact to be proved, and of every Witneſs, and his Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to prove it. Our Laws indeed judge not Truth and Integrity to be annexed and intailed to Dignity, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Greatneſs; yet they juſtly claim the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of perſons of great Dignity in the Church, or of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Birth, and raiſed Knowledg and Fortunes, and independent upon others, as more free from exception (which this Caſe requires) than thoſe that are of weak underſtandings, without the advantage of excellent Breeding and Inſtruction, or indigent, and bound to depend upon Favour of others for their ſupport, like <hi>Nurſes</hi> and <hi>Midwives,</hi> and other <hi>Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore (<hi>Caeteris paribus</hi>) (the Capacity and Probability of knowing the Facts and the Indifferency of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of High and Low degree being equal) our Laws juſtly allow moſt Weight and Credit to the Teſtimony of dignified and noble Witneſſes, and they are therefore required to prove the Fact of a <hi>Prince's Birth,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon depends the Right and Title to <hi>Kingdoms</hi> to exclude the apparent Right of one, and to put another into poſſeſſion of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Laws</hi> preſume Perſons of ſuch high degree to have greater ſenſe and regard to Conſcience, more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity and contempt of Falſhood, and more tenderneſs of their Honor than thoſe of <hi>Low Condition,</hi> and upon that preſumption, <hi>Noblemens Affirmations,</hi> upon their Honor, are in many Caſes accepted by our <hi>Laws</hi> in lieu of their Oaths, unto which all others are obliged in the ſame or like Caſes; and for that reaſon their <hi>Declarations</hi> of the <hi>Birth</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> without their making Oath thereof judicially, have been as certainly relied upon by the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the Deſcent of the Inheritance without Diſpute, as if they had ſworn their knowledg in the forms of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>There are alſo other <hi>circumſtantial Reaſons</hi> (unto which our <hi>Laws</hi> have regard) for the greateſt value to be put upon the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Nobility</hi> of both Sexes about the <hi>Birth</hi> of a <hi>Prince</hi>; they are moſt accuſtomed to the preſence and converſation of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such <hi>Ladies</hi> are juſtly preſumed to be free from too great awful Diſtances, Common to thoſe of <hi>lower Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>; and to have more Audacity and Confidence to make ſuch near Approaches to the <hi>Queen</hi> in her Travel and bringing forth, as are neceſſary, that they may be ocular Witneſſes that they have ſeen the <hi>Child</hi> in its very <hi>Birth</hi>; and ſuch <hi>Nobles</hi> are more bold and free to take ſuch a ſearching view of the <hi>Child</hi> in its naked Naturals as may make them knowing <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of its <hi>Birth</hi> and abſolutely certain that they are not deluded with a <hi>Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such <hi>Noble Witneſſes</hi> are alſo known to have greater Obligations upon them than others, to prevent all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Diſputes</hi> that may ariſe by any uncertainties about the Succeſſion to the <hi>Crown,</hi> which may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and deſtroy the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and their <hi>great Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Poſterities</hi>; their <hi>Conditions</hi> are <hi>Fortunes</hi> are ſuppoſed, by our <hi>Laws,</hi> to be above temptations by <hi>Bribes</hi> of <hi>Wealth,</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> to connive at falſhood, or to ſtoop to ſerve a <hi>Counterfeit Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon all theſe <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Birth</hi> of every <hi>Engliſh Prince</hi> ought to be of ſuch <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Noble Quality</hi>; and it was known to have been infinitely more neceſſary, that the reaſon of our <hi>Law</hi> had been exactly obſerved in the caſe of this <hi>Suppoſed Prince,</hi> than ever it was ſince the <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi>; there never was any ſuch occaſion to have ſtopped the mouth of <hi>Publick fame,</hi> or to have ſhewed the juſtly <hi>jealous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> that there were ſuch <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>proper Witneſſes,</hi> that a <hi>Prince</hi> was now born of the <hi>Queen,</hi> as were unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, without any poſſible exception, whoſe truth and faithfulneſs might be relied upon ſecurely. <hi>Juſtice</hi> alſo required, for full ſecurity, that there had been competent and ſufficient numbers of thoſe <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>proper Witneſſes</hi>; at leaſt that there had been ſo many of them as were able to obviate all ways and practices of deceit, that it could not have been ſuppoſed to be poſſible that a <hi>Fraud</hi> had been put upon them.</p>
            <p>This ſort of <hi>Caution</hi> is always juſt and neceſſary in the <hi>Birth</hi> of our <hi>Princes</hi>; but in the preſent caſe there could have been no <hi>honeſt end,</hi> intention, or pretence to have confin'd themſelves to a <hi>ſmall number</hi> of <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of a <hi>fact,</hi> wherein a Kingdom, known to be filled with juſt ſuſpitions of an Impoſture to be put upon them, were to be ſatisfied meerly by the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> averrment, and a <hi>Noble Princeſs</hi> alſo to be excluded from being <hi>Heireſs</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Laws</hi> require <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of <hi>Facts</hi> anſwerable to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of them, and always require <hi>ample Teſtimonies,</hi> when the <hi>Parties</hi> that are obliged to prove them, had it in their powers and choice, without charge or burden to themſelves, to have multiplied their <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to what number they had pleaſed, and could not be ignorant of the <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> or <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it; and yet more eſpecially if the <hi>fact</hi> were ſuch, whereby <hi>Great Benefit</hi> was to accrue to them, and <hi>Anſwerable Loſs</hi> unto others; in ſuch a Caſe it would much abate the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the <hi>proof</hi> in the courſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> if there were ſuch a <hi>ſmall number</hi> of <hi>Witneſſes</hi> as might leave room for any <hi>objection,</hi> or the leaſt doubt of the <hi>fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Roman Imperial Laws</hi> in the Caſes of <hi>Subjects,</hi> when there was a <hi>Poſthumus</hi> to be born that might exclude another <hi>Heir apparent,</hi> We ſay, thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> in common natural Equity to prevent a <hi>ſuppoſititious Child,</hi> appointed <hi>thirty days</hi> notice to be given to the <hi>apparent Heir,</hi> and all others whoſe Right was concerned, of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47926:9"/>
time of her Travel, and delivery, that on the behalf of the Heir apparent, Women might be ſent to be preſent to ſee the <hi>Birth of the Child</hi> that might become the Heir; that Law confined the number to five free Women to be ſent, allowing her that was to be delivered to have alſo five Women of her own chuſing, and no more; ſo that the number to be preſent at her delivery ſhould not exceed Ten, beſides <hi>two Midwives,</hi> and ſix Maid Servants that were no Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>This Rule was ſet down poſitively in the Empire, as the Dictate of natural Equity and Prudence; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>England</hi> hath no poſitive written Law, that preſcribes any ſet number of Friends to be ſent in ſuch a caſe by the Heir apparent, to ſee the Birth of ſuch a Child, yet the Cuſtom and Practice is in every ſuch caſe (tho' no Fraud be ſuſpected) to give notice to the next Heir, and that ſome of their Friends are cuſtomari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent (to what number they pleaſe) to be preſent at the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Child,</hi> that may be an Heir to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of another.</p>
            <p>That practice with us is not of Favour, but of Legal Right; our Common Law generally Binds all that ſet up a claim to any thing that another hath, to give ſuch Notice of his pretence as is needful to make his juſt defence if he can, and to prove the Fact whereby he claims, by ſuch a number of Witneſſes as may put the Truth of it out of doubt to the Court of Judicature; but that number in the Courſe of our Law is greater or ſmaller, according to the Cauſe that appears of jealouſy or diſtruſt of the Truth of the Fact pretended.</p>
            <p>Theſe Rules of our Law, and the Reaſons of them fully include the caſe of a Pretence of a Child to be born to exclude an Heir apparent; and if there were many known grounds of ſuſpition in any ſuch caſe, that it was deſigned to ſet up a <hi>ſuppoſititious Child,</hi> and a notorious Common fame of it, and no notice were given of the time expected of the <hi>Childs Birth,</hi> hoped to be <hi>Heir,</hi> to the then <hi>Heir apparent,</hi> or to any that had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectances of the Inheritances; We ſay, in ſuch a caſe, by the Rules and Practices of our Laws, a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Birth of a Child</hi> ought not to be believed, ſince they that ſhould claim for ſuch a <hi>Child,</hi> might by due notice to the Parties concerned have had ſuch <hi>Witneſſes</hi> as had put the <hi>Childs Birth</hi> beyond all queſtion.</p>
            <p>Certainly by the reaſon of our <hi>Common Law,</hi> there ought to be a much <hi>greater number of Witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Birth</hi> of every of our <hi>Princes,</hi> than of the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Subjects Heirs</hi>; but our <hi>Law</hi> requires that the <hi>Birth</hi> of this <hi>pretended Prince of Wales</hi> ſhould have been proved by a <hi>greater number of Witneſſes</hi> than was ever needful heretofore, in the caſe of a <hi>Prince</hi>; there ought to have been ſo many fit and proper Perſons preſent at his <hi>pretended Birth,</hi> that it might have been manifeſt to all that had heard it, that the Eyes of ſo many <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of ſuch Condition, Knowledg and Judgment, could not have been deceived in what they had teſtified to have known, and ſeen; the <hi>number</hi> ought to have been ſo conſiderable, that there could have been no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Suſpition, that ſo many of both <hi>Sexes,</hi> and of various Dignities, Honours and Intereſts (and ſome of them of <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> with the former <hi>Heireſs apparent</hi>) had made a Confederacy amongſt themſelves to abuſe the <hi>Kingdom</hi> with a <hi>Counterfeit Prince,</hi> and that ſo many had kept each others Counſel in a <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Falſhood</hi> ſo odious and injurious.</p>
            <p>It had been common <hi>Prudence</hi> as well as <hi>Juſtice</hi> to the <hi>Realm,</hi> that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Birth</hi> had been very many, that amongſt ſuch a <hi>Number</hi> ſome of them might have been known in one part of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and others in another Part, and that ſome of their Names and Qualities might have been known in <hi>Foreign Countries,</hi> and for that Reaſon the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Foreign Princes</hi> (according to Cuſtom) ought to have been ſome of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi>; the Peoples knowledg of the <hi>Names, Qualities,</hi> or <hi>Perſons</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> had much conduced to their fuller aſſurance of the Truth; it would have appeared to them <hi>incredible</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>impoſſible</hi> that the Integrity of ſuch, and ſo many <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> could have been attacked either <hi>ſeparately</hi> or <hi>jointly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary, ſeeing <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> required a good number of <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>proper Witneſſes</hi> to have made up a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Birth</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> that might have been truely ſaid to have been <hi>omni Exceptione majus,</hi> above all poſſible Objections againſt it; and ſeeing the wit of Man cannot invent a reaſon why the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Patrons</hi> of this <hi>pretended Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> did not provide ſuch ample and unqueſtionable <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> that he was <hi>born of the Queen,</hi> when they could not be ignorant that it was the voice of common Fame in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Foreign Countries,</hi> that her <hi>Majeſties Conception</hi> of a <hi>Child</hi> was meerly <hi>Fictitious,</hi> and that a <hi>ſuppoſititious Prince</hi> was deſigned; and ſeeing no Excuſe or Pretence is publiſhed for the <hi>neglect</hi> or <hi>failure</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of his <hi>birth,</hi> we ſay (the Circumſtances of the Caſe being conſidered) it's moſt unjuſt to expect, or demand of Your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> or of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or of <hi>Foreigners,</hi> a belief and acknowledgment that this <hi>pretended Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> was born of the <hi>Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As our <hi>Common Law</hi> informs us, who are <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>proper Witneſſes,</hi> whoſe <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in this Caſe, and in the proof of all Matters of Fact reſpectively; ſo the ſame declares who are deemed to be unfit, and diſabled to be <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in all the various and reſpective <hi>Queſtions of Fact</hi>; it ſhews whoſe <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> ought not to be heard, and much leſs believed in divers ſorts of <hi>Facts</hi> that come into queſtion. If <hi>your Highneſs</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> be told of the preſence of ſuch perſons to have been at the <hi>Birth</hi> of this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prince,</hi> as ought not by our <hi>Laws</hi> to be accounted <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> nor their averrments in the caſe to be heard by <hi>your Hſs.</hi> or the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and much leſs to be allowed to be of any Validity in the Common courſe of out <hi>Courts of Judicature</hi>; if parties concerned to prove a <hi>Fact</hi> do knowingly offer for <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> ſuch as our <hi>Laws</hi> reject in the <hi>Facts</hi> in queſtion, it turns to the prejudice of their other proof; we are therefore obliged to acquaint <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> with the <hi>Actions, Qualities, Reſpects</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that have diſabled many by force of our <hi>Common Law</hi> to be heard as <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Birth</hi> of this <hi>pretended Prince of Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Our Laws</hi> utterly diſable all thoſe to be heard in the Caſe, that have received either <hi>gifts of Money,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:47926:9"/>
or <hi>Honours,</hi> or any other <hi>Reward,</hi> or <hi>Benefits</hi> whatſoever for their pretended Aſſiſtance about his <hi>Birth,</hi> or by reaſon or occaſion of that pretence; 'tis the <hi>Common Practiſe</hi> of our <hi>Law,</hi> that when a <hi>Witneſs</hi> is produced, the <hi>adverſe Party</hi> may examine him upon his Oath whether he hath had <hi>Money</hi> or other <hi>Reward</hi> or <hi>Gift, directly</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,</hi> for or by reaſon of the matter in queſtion, or from the Party in whoſe behalf he is produced to teſtifie, or from any of his <hi>Friends</hi>; if he cannot acquit himſelf thereof by his Oath, though it cannot be proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, our <hi>Impartial Law</hi> deems ſuch a perſon not only to be <hi>partial</hi> in the Caſe, but <hi>corrupted,</hi> and <hi>bribed,</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> to be <hi>heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Law</hi> will not admit thoſe to be <hi>Witneſſes</hi> for the <hi>Birth</hi> of this <hi>ſuppoſed Prince of Wales,</hi> that have any <hi>Promiſe, Expectation</hi> or <hi>Hopes</hi> of any <hi>Advancement, Office, Place,</hi> or <hi>Benefit</hi> by or under him, if he ſhall be received and allowed by the <hi>Kingdom</hi> to be <hi>Prince of Wales</hi>; they that cannot purge themſelves by their Oaths from all ſuch <hi>Promiſes, Expectations</hi> and <hi>Hopes,</hi> are not in the <hi>Judgment</hi> of our Law perſons <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>unconcerned</hi> in the Event of the Matter in queſtion, nor fit to be heard as <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> their <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> being partly for themſelves, and their own Benefit; and the allowance of ſuch <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> in Judicature would in conſequence ſubvert all Civil Juſtice and Government. Our <hi>Law</hi> excludes all from being <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to ſupport the pretence of the <hi>ſuppoſed Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> as have ſuch dependance on the <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers</hi> of him, that they are in danger of damage and loſs by them of any kind, if they ſhould diſpleaſe them in their <hi>Teſtimony.</hi> Our <hi>Laws</hi> judg all ſuch not to be free and of their own <hi>Right</hi> in the Caſe, but bound to ſerve and pleaſe the <hi>Patrons</hi> of the Cauſe, and therefore preſume that they may be corrupted by fear of loſing the Advantages they love, if they ſhould impartially declare the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth of the matter.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Laws</hi> ſeek to know the naked and entire Truth of all <hi>Facts</hi> that come into legal queſtion or Conteſt, and will not admit of any to be <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of them, unleſs they appear to be free from <hi>Fears</hi> of any <hi>Prejudice</hi> to themſelves by ſpeaking the Truth impartially. We are inforced by the <hi>Concern</hi> of all the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to ſpeak more plainly than we would; we muſt ſay, that all that hold <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> during the <hi>Kings Will,</hi> are by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> excluded out of the Number of <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>competent Witneſſes</hi> about the <hi>Birth</hi> of this <hi>Child,</hi> whom <hi>His Majeſty</hi> hath proclaimed and maintains to be <hi>Prince of Wales</hi>; our <hi>good Laws</hi> have regard to humane infirmities, and will not put a temptation upon men to ſuffer them to be <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein they may damnifie themſelves in the loſs of their Offices, if they happen to diſpleaſe their <hi>Maſter</hi> in his concern in the caſe, by teſtifying clearly the whole Truth of it; they are not free in the Judgment of our <hi>Laws,</hi> to ſpeak the Truth without fear, and for that reaſon are not to be received by the <hi>Kingdom</hi> as <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Laws</hi> will never allow or ſuffer any to be <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in this Caſe, who are known, or may be proved to have Enmity or Prejudice of any kind upon any account whatſoever to Her <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> againſt whom moſt immediately this <hi>ſuppoſed Prince</hi> contends; ſhe having been moſt unqueſtionably the <hi>Heir apparent</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and juſtly ſo remaining until the <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhall be ſatisfied by a ſufficient Number of <hi>lawful Witneſſes,</hi> that there is a <hi>Prince</hi> born, whereby her claim to the next Succeſſion ſhall be poſtponed. The queſtion of Fact to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Witneſſes</hi> is apparently between her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> and this <hi>ſuppoſed Prince</hi>; and 'tis a legal unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and concluſive Exception againſt any to be received for <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt her in his behalf, that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Enemies to <hi>her,</hi> and the <hi>Profeſſed Proteſtant Religion,</hi> the deſtruction whereof they are bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to endeavour; and for that reaſon ſuch known Enemies to her right of Succeſſion to the <hi>Crown,</hi> that their <hi>Church</hi> have decreed and declared <hi>her Right,</hi> and the <hi>Right of all Proteſtants</hi> to any Authorities, to be abſolutely forfeited to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Hereſie.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, that all that are ſincerely <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and believe their own <hi>Church,</hi> do judg Her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> to be an <hi>Excommunicated Heretick</hi> by their <hi>Church,</hi> and that all Her Rights in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reverſion are thereby confiſcated, and that they are all obliged by the Law of their <hi>Church,</hi> in Conſcience of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and by the hope of Pardon of their ſins, to <hi>defeat</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> by all ways and means in their Power, all Her <hi>Pretenſions</hi> to the Deſcent of the <hi>Crown</hi> upon her, and to aſſiſt to the inveſting the Right to the Succeſſion in a <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi> We might here add, that our <hi>Engliſh Papiſts</hi> are all in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Pope,</hi> as appears by his <hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>London</hi>; and he is by the ancient <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> of this <hi>Realm</hi> declared the <hi>Publick</hi> or <hi>Common Enemy</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> near two hundred years before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
            <p>Tis manifeſt that the <hi>Engliſh Papiſts</hi> are declared Enemies to Her <hi>Royal Highneſſes</hi> Right in this Caſe between her and the <hi>pretended Prince of Wales,</hi> and therefore by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> they cannot be Witneſſes of the Fact in queſtion, neither ought their <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> therein to be offered to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> to <hi>Delude</hi> the <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Civil Law</hi> ſo fully concurs with our <hi>Common Law</hi> in rejecting Enemies to be Witneſſes in the cauſe of their Enemy, that it denies to give credit to what they may teſtifie in the cauſe of their Enemy with their dying Breath after they have received the <hi>Euchariſt</hi>; that is the General Concluſion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of that Civil Law, <hi>Inimicus etiamſi in articulo mortis conſtitutus, &amp; accepiſſet Euchariſtiam, repellitur a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio cauſae ſui inimici.</hi> We mention this chiefly to ſhew, that 'tis not only by our <hi>Engliſh Laws</hi> that our <hi>Papiſts</hi> are rejected from being Witneſſes of the Birth of this <hi>pretended Prince</hi> againſt Her <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> but by the ancient approved Rules of the Civil Law which they generally acknowledg, and by the Judgment of their own <hi>Doctors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein are only ſet forth to Your <hi>Highneſſes</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that you may juſtly inſiſt upon as your Right to prevent the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome's Conſpiracies</hi> againſt you: we reflect not on the credit or truth of any <hi>Roman Catholick Lords,</hi> or others, in giving their Teſtimonies in Matters of private Intereſts, wherein the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47926:10"/>
cauſe of their <hi>Church</hi> is not in queſtion, and the <hi>Laws</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> bind them not to either party; but ſince they are bound in this caſe to be <hi>Enemies</hi> to <hi>Her Royal Highneſs,</hi> our <hi>Law</hi> will not allow them to be believed to her prejudice; and they muſt openly renounce that <hi>common Honeſty</hi> to which they pretend, if they offer themſelves to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> to be <hi>competent Witneſſes</hi> againſt <hi>Her</hi> in behalf of this <hi>pretended Prince,</hi> when they are conſcious to themſelves, that not only our <hi>Laws</hi> but <hi>Natural Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> abhors ſuch a <hi>practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt ſay with all due reverence, and moſt humble ſubmiſſion, that <hi>Our Laws</hi> will not allow that the <hi>Declaration,</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> or the <hi>Queen,</hi> ſhould be accepted, and believed in this caſe as <hi>lawful proof,</hi> that this <hi>pretended Prince</hi> was <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Queen</hi>; 'tis ſufficient for us, that our <hi>Laws</hi> will not ſuffer our <hi>Kings</hi> to deſcend into the Place of <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> they will not admit them to teſtifie their own <hi>knowledg</hi> of the <hi>Facts</hi> in any caſe whatſoever, <hi>Criminal</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi>; but there is abundant reaſon alſo from <hi>Natural Equity</hi> and <hi>Civil Juſtice,</hi> that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhould not receive and rely upon the <hi>King's Affirmation</hi> about the <hi>Birth</hi> of this <hi>ſuppoſed Prince</hi>; their <hi>Majeſties</hi> have publickly Eſpouſed his Cauſe for their own in all reſpects; and none on Earth, <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Subjects,</hi> may juſtly expect, or be ſuffered to ſupply the Place of <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in their own caſe, ſince <hi>Civil Government</hi> is eſtabliſhed; if they might lawfully be their <hi>own proof</hi> for their cauſe, they might as juſtly be <hi>Judges</hi> of their <hi>own proofs,</hi> which in Conſequence would turn up the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government</hi>; one of its chiefeſt original intentions being to introduce a <hi>courſe</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that none might be their <hi>own Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We would not ſpeak thus plainly, if it were juſtly avoidable; we caſt no <hi>Scandal</hi> hereby upon His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> nor any way come near the <hi>crime of detraction</hi>; we barely relate the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this caſe of His <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Affirmation</hi> of the <hi>Birth</hi> of this <hi>pretended Prince,</hi> that it hath not the force of <hi>legal proof,</hi> or of the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of one <hi>Legal Witneſs,</hi> and His <hi>Majeſty</hi> is obliged in <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> by his <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> not to impoſe upon his <hi>Subjects</hi> to believe, and rely upon <hi>his Affirmation,</hi> or <hi>Word,</hi> in this caſe (nor on the <hi>Queen's,</hi> that's neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in his) he cannot deſire the <hi>People</hi> diffuſively to change their <hi>ancient cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> to ſubſtitute their <hi>King's Words</hi> or <hi>Aſſertions</hi> in the <hi>room</hi> of <hi>ſworn Legal Witneſſes</hi> to prove the Matters of the <hi>Higheſt moment</hi> about the <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhould allow the <hi>Affirmation</hi> of their <hi>Kings</hi> to be ſufficient to make a <hi>Lawful Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> without ſuch <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of his <hi>Birth</hi> as our <hi>Law</hi> requires, they ſhould conſent to Change the ancient Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Engliſh Monarchy,</hi> and ſo deſtroy the eſtabliſhed <hi>Legal Security</hi> of their <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Eſtates.</hi> The <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this caſe are not diſſonant from the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>other Kingdoms,</hi> and the moſt <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Empires</hi>; the <hi>Civil Law</hi> now received in moſt <hi>Chriſtian Kingdoms,</hi> that was ſo adapted to abſolute Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that it was one of its <hi>principles,</hi> That <hi>Principis verbum pro lege habendum eſt,</hi> the word of the <hi>Prince</hi> was to be taken for a <hi>Law</hi>; we ſay, that <hi>Law</hi> never aſcribed <hi>abſolute credit</hi> to the <hi>Prince's Affirmations</hi> of Matters of <hi>Fact</hi> wherein the <hi>Subjects Rights</hi> were concerned; it paſſeth for a Rule of that <hi>Law</hi> in ſuch caſes, <hi>Princeps indiſtincte non creditur</hi>; the <hi>Emperour</hi> is not to be believed intirely without <hi>limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>reſtrictions,</hi> in his affirming Matters of <hi>Fact</hi> relating to his <hi>Subjects</hi> Legal <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>Doctors</hi> in that <hi>Law</hi> determine, that the <hi>Emperor's Affirmation</hi> that a <hi>Subject</hi> hath committed Treaſon, or <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt <hi>him,</hi> ought nor to be believed, or taken for a <hi>proof</hi>; they ſay expreſly, <hi>Regi fides non adhibetur ſi atteſtatur talem fuiſſe proditorem</hi>; likewiſe if he pretends and declares a cauſe why he deprives any <hi>Subject,</hi> or <hi>Feudatory</hi> of his <hi>Intereſt,</hi> he is not to be believed, there muſt be <hi>proof,</hi> and the <hi>parties</hi> intended to be prejudiced muſt be cited and heard in their <hi>defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They generally reſolve, that when a <hi>King</hi> aſſerts or atteſts any thing to the prejudice of another, he is not to be therein believed, eſpecially when his <hi>Affirmation</hi> is for his <hi>own advantage,</hi> and to the <hi>Subjects damage,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience:</hi> Theſe are their words, <hi>Quando ex aſſertione Principis, ipſe Principaliter ſentiret commodum &amp; ſubditi incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum, tum ipſi Principi non creditur.</hi>

            <p>We believe the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and other maintainers of this <hi>ſuppoſed Prince</hi> will claim (as is their common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice) againſt theſe our Laws, whoſe force detects and defeats their Impoſtures, they will pretend that 'tis unreaſonable to expect a Teſtimony of his Birth from ſuch Witneſſes, and in ſuch manner as are herein deſcribed excluſive of all <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> but the reaſon and wiſdom of theſe Laws are irreſiſtible, and its a great Circumſtance, ſhewing their guilt that they are diſpleaſed with the Laws that prevent Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Impoſtures, and require proofs of Facts as clear as the Sun.</p>
            <p>The juſt and innocent are never offended at any Law, that provide for Truth and Righteouſneſs, they cannot but be conſcious to themſelves, that it was more eaſie to have provided ſuch Witneſſes as our Laws requires of a <hi>Princes Birth</hi> then to have had ſuch as they provided, that would Counterfeit to be Spectators, and be content (as 'tis now ſaid they were) to ſee nothing of the Fact of which they were to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Kingdom to have been the knowing Eye Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>'Tis notorious that the preſence of ten of the <hi>Proteſtant Nobility</hi> of either Sex and other perſons of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Quality might have been as eaſily procured as one of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> if it had been intended to deal juſtly and fairly with the Kingdom, and they know that the Proteſtants throwout <hi>Europe</hi> (not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts) wanted and deſired ſatisfaction about the <hi>Queens great Belly</hi> and her delivery, the ſuſpitions of a <hi>Counterfeit Prince</hi> were ſtrong amongſt them, and decryed by all the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they knew the Friends and thoſe of Conſanguinity with her <hi>Royal Hſs.</hi> were as ready to attend if they had been called as any <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> whatſoever; and they were not ignorant that Cuſtom, Law and <hi>Natural Justice</hi> required, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient notice ſhould have been given to her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> above all others of the Expected time of the <hi>Queens Delivery,</hi> that ſuch <hi>Noble Matrons</hi> as ſhe had thought Neceſſary might have been ſent to have Continually attended near her <hi>Majesty,</hi> and to have been impartial Witneſſes of the Birth beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: they underſtood the cuſtom of calling <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> to be preſent at the <hi>Queen Delivery,</hi> and that a Common fame of a <hi>deſigned Impoſture</hi> was ſpread in <hi>forraign Protestant Countries,</hi> and that there were, <hi>Envoys</hi> and <hi>Publick Ministers</hi> from ſome of them, Eſpecially that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> there, and Expected to have been called: they know that thoſe Proviſions for legal, unqueſtionable proof of the Birth that was pretended, have been no hindrance of the preſence, or aſſiſtance of as many <hi>Papiſts</hi> of each Sex as Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> had deſired, and ſhe might have as intirely depended upon their only help, if it had been her pleaſure, as if thoſe lawful Witneſſes had not been preſent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popiſh Councils</hi> delude his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> if they perſwade him that any pleas of <hi>Inadvertency, Neglect,</hi> or <hi>Ignorance</hi> can ſatisfy the <hi>Kingdom</hi> inſtead of the proofs in the Caſe that the Cuſtom and Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> require; 'tis a Rule of our Law that none ſhall make advantage of their own lachez, that is their Failers or neglects of what they ought to have done; leſs evidence is never to be accepted in our courſe of Judicature, becauſe the Party concerned was negligent in ſeeking it, or ignorant, when he might have known his duty.</p>
            <p>We preſume <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> in reading this may be ſatisfyed in the Truth of our firſt Preliminary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which is neceſſary to be always remembred in order to a juſt Judgment to be made of this <hi>ſuppoſed Prince of Wales,</hi> and of the things proper to be done by <hi>Your Highneſs,</hi> by reaſon or occaſion of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; we doubt not <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> will clearly perceive what you may in juſtice demand of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in the Caſe, preſerving nevertheleſs a moſt <hi>pious ſenſe of a fillial Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may more remember <hi>Your Highneſs,</hi> that as the caſe now appears, no acknowledgment of that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prince</hi> can juſtly be required of <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> by his <hi>Majeſty.</hi> Its contrary to Juſtice and our Laws, that her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> ſhould depart from her place and claim of <hi>Heireſs apparent</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> and reſign it to a <hi>Child,</hi> who is not yet lawfully witneſſed to have been born of the <hi>Queen.</hi> VVe therefore put your <hi>Highneſs</hi> in remembrance of a ſecond Concluſion fit to be premiſed in this Caſe as an abſolute certainty to be inſiſted on; that is,</p>
            <p>That neither the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> nor any natural or Civil Juſtice do require of <hi>your Highneſs</hi> any kind of Teſtimonies or proofs, that the pretences of this ſuppoſed <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> are falſe and feigned, or that he was not born of the <hi>Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoſoever claims to be the natural and <hi>legitimate Son</hi> of any Family, its wholly and ſolely incumbent on him, to prove it by the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of all <hi>Civil Governments,</hi> and by the manifeſt Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thoſe two Rules of the Civil Law are adopted by all Countries into their courſes of Judicature, <hi>Qualem quis ſe facit, pro fundamento intentionis ſuae talem ſe debet probare</hi>; and, <hi>Filius qui petit haereditatem tanquam filius debet probare filiationem</hi>; if Sonſhip or other quality or relation be the ground of a demand, that Foundation muſt be always proved by the demandant; if he that pretends to be Heir by his Birth to any inheritance, fails of ſuch ſufficient Witneſſes as the reſpective Laws of Countries require to prove his proximity of Blood, there needs no Teſtimony on the part of thoſe that deny his Linal Deſcent. The Courſe of the Law of <hi>England</hi> is known to moſt <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in the Tryal of all claims by Birth; the claimant is always put to prove all that he ſets forth of his Deſcent in his Declaration, and the leaſt defect of proof is fatal to his proceſs if the Defendant perceives the piantiff to want ſufficient legal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his Deſcent and Birth, he never troubles the Court with proofs on his behalf, 'tis enough for him that denies the <hi>Deſcent pretended,</hi> to ſhew the inſufficiency of the Witneſſes and their Teſtimony pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> is not obliged either by our Laws or Natural Juſtice, to have VVitneſſes to prove the <hi>pretended Prince of VVales</hi> to be an <hi>Impocture,</hi> Her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> having been the legal acknowledged

            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Popiſh League</hi> endeavoured to ſet aſide the claim of your <hi>Highneſs's Anceſtor Henry</hi> 4. to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and proclaimed the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Bulloign</hi> to be <hi>King,</hi> he ſent Agents to the <hi>Pope</hi> (though he was then a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>) and to all the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> to manifeſt himſelf to be the right lawful Heir of that <hi>Crown,</hi> and the <hi>Venetian State</hi> (to his vaſt advantage) conteſted it with the <hi>Popes Nuncio</hi> that they ought ſo to acknowledg him becauſe it appeared that he was the right <hi>Heir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Right indeed was to be <hi>King</hi> in <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> but there is the like reaſon and juſtice to ſupport her Royal Highneſs Title to the <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>reverſion,</hi> ſince another is ſet up, and declared throughout the World to be the right Heir of it, immediately after his now <hi>Majeſty.</hi> 'Tis undoubtedly juſt and reaſonable for her to demand, and expect, that the pretenders Birth (ſo much and ſo juſtly ſuſpected) ſhould be made manifeſt to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> by Witneſſes, without exception according to the Law and Cuſtom of <hi>England</hi> and to <hi>natural Equity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be of dangerous conſequence, to ſuffer a falſe Opinion of him in the Kingdom, and the <hi>world</hi> to gain ſtrength by time, and neglect: yet neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Equity</hi> puts any burden of proof in the Caſe upon your Highneſs: 'tis only incumbent upon your Highneſs, to declare the wrong to your ſelves and the Kingdom by the <hi>pretended Prince,</hi> and to take care that no illegal imperfect or fallacious Teſtimony in the Caſe be invented or obtruded upon your ſelves and the Kingdom to ſupport his pretences, her Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs claim and right to be the next in reverſion after his now <hi>Majeſty</hi> in the legal deſcent of the <hi>Crown,</hi> ought to ſtand unſhaken, and unqueſtionable in the Judgment of <hi>our Law</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> notwithſtanding any thing to the contrary, that hath been hitherto lawfully publiſhed or declared.</p>
            <p>We cannot doubt, but 'tis here made manifeſt that your Highneſs publick refuſal to acknowledg this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prince of Wales</hi> may be built upon ſuch ſure Foundations of Law and Juſtice as can never be overturned; we would not therefore trouble your Highneſs, with all the Circumſtances of the Caſe which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked in our Obſervations, that make it to us not only <hi>improbable,</hi> but <hi>incredible,</hi> that he was <hi>born of the Queen.</hi> Since 'tis not poſſible for us to ſend Witneſſes perſonally to prove to your Highneſs every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that we have noted, and 'tis not juſt that <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> ſhould take them up upon unknown Authority, ſince we cannot in prudence ſubſcribe our Names to this Memorial, nor ſo much as the Names of our Witneſſes to the Facts, ſince the Proof of the Circumſtances can never be a Foundation of poſitive unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable certainty, but can only ſerve to make the Falſehood and Jeſuitical contrivance in this impoſture more infamous and odious: ſince 'tis undoubtedly <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> Intereſt never to depart from the manifeſt Principle of Law and Juſtice, which put it wholly and entirely upon the Maintainers of the <hi>ſuppoſed Prince</hi> to prove him to be ſuch as they pretend with the higheſt human certainty that can be acquired by Witneſſes, and to the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> full Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And ſince 'tis notoriouſly know that above all others of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> (which in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will moſt earneſtly contend againſt <hi>Your Highneſs</hi>) have the greateſt effronted Confidence to deny and forſwear Matters of Fact however certainly proved and known, and they would be glad to have any thing offered in this Caſe that might give them room, or a poſſibility for diſpute and ſeeming doubtfulneſs of Fact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they might obſcure the Truth, and deceive ſome of the People with their Equivocal Affirmation and impertinent Cavils at <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> Witneſſes, or their Teſtimonies and their bold Aſſeverations of Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe Conſiderations we ſhall reſtrain from the relation of many very pregnant Circumſtances that we had collected, which if they were taken jointly in their natural Order and due Connexion, would by their united force ſtrongly induce impartial Judges to conclude, that the <hi>Queen</hi> could not be the Mother of the <hi>ſuppoſed Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We could give very great circumſtantial aſſurances to <hi>Your Highneſs,</hi> that there never was or appeared to be any reaſonable natural grounds for a belief that her <hi>Majeſty</hi> had <hi>Conceived a Child.</hi> She never had the firſt <hi>moſt natural, known,</hi> and common ſign of <hi>Conception</hi>; her <hi>menſes profluvium,</hi> or <hi>Terms,</hi> continued their uſual uncertain Courſe as formerly during the whole time of her <hi>pretended great helly</hi>; She did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal that it was with her after that manner of Women in her <hi>journey to Bath,</hi> nor that they continued ſome days after the <hi>King</hi> left her there; and all the induſtry uſed afterward to hide them in their Seaſons, proved in-effectual, becauſe thoſe things come to the knowledge of more then were made privy to the whole Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture deſigned.</p>
            <p>Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> having not that <hi>natural Sign</hi> of her <hi>Termes stopping,</hi> whereby Women uſually conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have conceived, from whence ſhe could make a reckoning, it ſeems by the <hi>Kings Speech</hi> in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that their <hi>Majeſtys</hi> had both thought fit to publiſh her Conception to have been at the time of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> made to the <hi>Lady's Image at Loretta,</hi> upon the <hi>Kings</hi> return to the <hi>Queen</hi> at <hi>Bath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was then too ſoon for them to be provided of a <hi>ſuppoſititus Child,</hi> and ſo might name <hi>any time</hi> they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of her <hi>Conception,</hi> and then ſeek for a Child that might agree with it, and it appeared pious and great to make her <hi>Conception</hi> one of the Miracles of the <hi>Lady's Image,</hi> tho it happened <hi>Unluckily</hi> afterward, that they could not make the times of her <hi>Conception</hi> and <hi>ſuppoſed delivery</hi> to agree with natures moſt conſtant time of <hi>Nine Months.</hi>

            <p>There's another known ſign and teſtimony of a Womans pregnancy, that is, the ſenſible ſtirring of the Child in the womb, that was expected <hi>her Majeſty</hi> ſhould have ſhewn to the Ladies with Joy, eſpecially to thoſe <hi>Proteſtant Ladies</hi> of her bed Chamber, that doubted (with the Proteſtant Dr. her then Phyſitian) her being with Child, as far as they durſt (when the quickening of a Child in her womb was pretended, and publiſhed throughout the Kingdom; it had been a Pleaſure to <hi>her Majeſty,</hi> and no trouble (if it had been real without deceipt) to have ſhewn the motion of a Child in her womb to honorable Matrons of her Bedchamber, that might have been in all reſpects lawful VVitneſſes of that truth to the <hi>Juſtly Jealous Kingdom</hi>; theſe might have touched her belly, and had been proper Judges from their Experience of the true motions of an infant in the womb, and ſome of Conſanguinity to the Heyreſs apparent might have been admitted to that favour as our Laws and common prudence directed for removing the cauſes of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; but however induſtriouſly her <hi>Majeſties</hi> quicking with Child was ſpread abroad, yet the feeling of its motions was never vouchſafed to any competent VVitneſſes of it, to give the ſuſpitious Kingdom a ground to believe, that ſhe was with Child.</p>

            <p>Thoſe two circumſtances explained each other, and plainly ſhewed that the natural naked and true ſhape of <hi>her Majeſties</hi> Body, as it was then, was not to be ſeen by thoſe that were not of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy in the <hi>intended Impoſture</hi>; thoſe that were only capable of being lawful VVitneſſes for her <hi>Majeſty</hi> againſt common Fame (if Fame had belyed her) thoſe were all excluded from a poſſibility of ſeeing whether her belly was truly and naturally great, and a few foreigners of no Quality were only to keep the Secret of what Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> was to make the copling belly.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more manifeſt then it is by all theſe Circumſtances taken as they ought in connexion each with other, that there hath nothing appeared of the natural plainneſs and ſimplicity that always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company truth in the whole Demeanor of her <hi>Majeſty</hi> from the time of her <hi>pretended Conceiving a Child</hi> to the very time of her <hi>feigned delivery</hi> of this ſuppoſed <hi>Prince of Wales</hi>; all that hath been acted in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath plainly imported <hi>Trick</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> to hide and ſmother Natures VVorks, that ought to have been moſt freely expoſed to the whole World, if there had been any truth in the pretences that could have born the Light, we may ſecurely affirm to <hi>your Highneſs,</hi> that in all the <hi>eight Months and four Days</hi> firſt rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to have been the time of her <hi>Majeſties Pregnancy,</hi> or from the time of her going to <hi>Bath</hi> in the new Reckoning, there never hath been any of theſe conſtant natural ſigns in her Majeſty that could afford to any underſtanding Man or Women a ground to believe that ſhe conceived a Child.</p>

               </gap>, nor any appearance of that open freedom and naturally plain proceeding that ought to have ſhewn that they did not fear the Kingdom, or the World knowing the truth of all that ſhould be done in that pretended natural work of Bearing a Child, wherein the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſo much of the World was concerned; if the Cuſtoms and Laws of <hi>England,</hi> or natural Equity had been conſulted in the Circumſtances of the Caſe about the preparations needful for <hi>her Majeſties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected deliverance of a Prince,</hi> the firſt of all Adviſes had certainly been to give early notice to <hi>your Highneſs</hi> and to others in the neareſt poſſibility or expectance of ſucceeding to the <hi>Crown</hi> of the time of her expected travel and deliverance of a <hi>Prince</hi> and of the place of her reſidence at ſuch time. That <hi>proper Noble Matrons,</hi> and others, might have prepared themſelves, and attended there, and have been preſent in their behalf, which might have ſuppreſſed and ſilenced for ever by their Teſtimonies, all Suſpitions of Fraud or Impoſture.</p>
            <p>But 'tis not only undeniable, that no ſuch notice was given either to her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> or to any of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity with her, nor to any other of the <hi>Noble Matrons of England,</hi> but ſuch Artificers were uſed as might moſt conceal the time and intended Place of her <hi>pretended Travel,</hi> ſuch feigned time of her ſuppoſed Conception was <hi>publiſhed by the King and Queen,</hi> that neither her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> nor any of the Nobility could poſſibly foreſee the time when the Comedy that is now ſaid to have been acted was to begin.</p>
            <p>The Place where her <hi>Majeſty</hi> was intended to lye in was kept in ſuch uncertainty, and often publiſhed ſo variouſly, ſometimes that it ſhould be at <hi>Richmond,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Windſor,</hi> another time at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> that none of the <hi>Nobles</hi> of either Sex, that were of the Kindred and Friends of the Heir Apparent, nor of the <hi>Proteſtant Nobility,</hi> could know how to prepare themſelves for attendance on her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as was their duty to <hi>Their Majeſties, Her Royal Highneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Publication of the place was often changed, as if a ſurpriſe in the place was deſigned, ſo at laſt ſuch a ſudden and ſeeming haſty Reſolution was taken a day or two before her <hi>pretended Delivery,</hi> that her lying in ſhould be at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, tho none expected the time to be near by above three Weeks, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were given for preparing her Lodgings there ſo haſtily, that when <hi>her Majeſty</hi> ſaid on the <hi>Friday,</hi> She would lye there on <hi>Saturday,</hi> and it was told her it was not poſſible her Lodgings ſhould be ready, She then ſaid, She would lie there on the floor.</p>
            <p>It was hoped by all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> would have been a faithful watcher for her own ſake, when the time of <hi>her Majeſtys</hi> deliverance of her great belly ſhould come; tho ſhe had not been able, or ſhe durſt not give them advice of the occurrences in the time of <hi>her Majeſtys</hi> ſuppoſed pregnancy, it was thought that ſhe could not be avoided but ſhe would be preſent to ſee what was brought forth, whether any thing or nothing; but care was taken, that adviſe ſhould be given her when ſhe wanted <hi>aſtringent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decines</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47926:12"/>
to go to the <hi>looſening Waters</hi> of the <hi>Bath,</hi> to keep her fourſcore Miles diſtant till the <hi>pretended Prince</hi> ſhould be born.</p>
            <p>At the firſt Notice we had of her <hi>Majeſties paſſionate Declaration,</hi> that She would lie at St. <hi>James</hi>'s on the <hi>Saturday Night,</hi> we could not conjecture that there was to be a <hi>pretended Prince</hi> brought forth on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> nor was there any Whiſpers of it, or the leaſt natural, Feigned or Counterfeit ſign of fore-running Pains of a Woman, whoſe time of Travel approacheth. <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> was late in the Night at Cards, and no appearance of an indiſpoſition then, nor is any pretended to have been in the Night; but we learned by the Event on the <hi>Sunday</hi> the reaſon of Her <hi>Majeſtys</hi> fixed and immoveable Reſolution to lie at <hi>Saint James</hi>'s on the <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, ſhe was to ſeem to bring forth a <hi>Prince</hi> on the <hi>Sunday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a cunning contrivance to chuſe a fit time of that day; it was to be between the hours of nine and ten in the Morning, that all or moſt of the <hi>Proteſtant Ladies</hi> might be at <hi>Church,</hi> and the Trick be over before their return, and that the Midwife Mrs. <hi>Labady,</hi> and the Favourite Mrs. <hi>Tourain,</hi> might have Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Secrecy, as they had, to act their Parts in the bringing forth of a <hi>ſuppoſititious Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Room alſo that was choſen, wherein the <hi>Trick was to be acted,</hi> was fit for the purpoſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of <hi>Common Prudence</hi> in a Caſe ſuſpected for ſetting up a <hi>ſuppoſititious Child</hi> and ought to have been avoided, if their meaning had been juſt and good; there was a private Door within the Rail of the Bed into a Room, from whence a Child might be ſecretly brought and put into the Bed, unſeen by any that ſhould attend in the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Room, tho at the feet of the Bed (none of them coming into the Rail) and by that Door the three Confidents, the Midwife, Mrs. <hi>Labady,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Tourain</hi> brought into her <hi>Majeſties</hi> Bed what they pleaſed unſeen.</p>
            <p>If they had wanted no ſecret conveyance by that Door, common Prudence required that they had nailed or ſealed it up to avoid confirming and increaſing the <hi>Kingdoms juſt and known Jealouſies,</hi> of impoſing upon them a <hi>Counterfeit Prince,</hi> when it ſhould be known, that there were ſuch ſecret ways as made it ſo eaſy to be done by Confederation, undiſcerned by others that were in the Room; but it appeared by the Event that the privy Door was ſo neceſſary for the <hi>deſigned Impoſture,</hi> that all the Tranſactions of it were managed by that Door, as is well known to all thoſe Lords of the Council that were brought for a ſhew, not to ſee any thing that was done, but only to be ſeen in the Bed-Chamber with His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that their Names might be publiſhed to the People, as if they had been Witneſſes of the <hi>Queens</hi> being <hi>delivered</hi> of this <hi>pretended Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Civil Law provided as a Rule of common natural Equity, that when a Woman was to be delivered of a <hi>Poſthume Child,</hi> that might defeat another appearing Heir, that the Chamber wherein ſhe was to be delivered ſhould have but one Door, and if there were more, that they ſhould be ſealed up with the Seals of both Parties, and that Keepers ſhould be ſet at the ſingle Door, and no Woman ſuffered to enter until ſhe was ſearched in all kinds, that no Child might be conveyed to the Woman in her real or ſuppoſed Travel; and tho' we have no expreſs Statute that gives direction in ſuch Caſes, yet our Common Law abhors all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Fraud about Inheritances, and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

            <p>We have faithfully ſhewed <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> what were the Preparations for <hi>her Majeſties ſuppoſed time of Travel,</hi> wherein there appeared no Marks of an Intiention to deal uprightly and openly with her <hi>Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> as <hi>Heireſs</hi> apparent of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and with the Subjects of the <hi>Kingdom</hi>; nor were there any natural ſigns that <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> really feared or expected the common <hi>Sorrows, Pains</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> of a <hi>Woman in Travel,</hi> or made any ſutable Proviſions.</p>
            <p>We cannot learn, that there were in readineſs ſo much as the uſual <hi>Inſtruments of Midwives,</hi> whereupon they commonly place all Women of Quality in their time of Travel, that ſuch Aſſiſtance may be given them by the <hi>Matrons</hi> and <hi>Midwives,</hi> as is not poſſible to be given on their Knees, which is the common Poſture of meaner Women; and leaſt of all, as they lie in their Bed, which is ſeldom uſed until the length of the Travel, and Failures of Strength enforce it: There being many natural Reaſons for the Poſture of the Womens Bodies helping them in their Travel.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other ſuitable Proviſions, it had been certainly fit that a <hi>Colledg</hi> of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> had been called to attend ſomewhere near to Her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> if She had not known there could be no need of them, and had not been ſure there could be no hour of danger to her ſelf in a <hi>feigned Travel,</hi> nor any ſudden need of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> Advice or help to a ſtrong lively <hi>ſuppoſed Prince,</hi> that was intended then to be brought forth.</p>
            <p>As all the Preparations for her <hi>Majeſties ſuppoſed time of Travel,</hi> diſcovered to knowing and obſerving People that there was no reality in her pretences made of a great Belly, ſo the <hi>Fiction</hi> and <hi>Fraud</hi> was made more manifeſt when the <hi>Trick</hi> came to be acted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> lying in Bed with all the Curtains round cloſe drawn, all that was provided belonging natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to a Child, and intended to be uſed by them, in their bringing forth the <hi>ſuppoſititious Prince,</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and ready within the inner Chamber, then Her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s feigned Travel began; and all theſe things were, by the help of the Midwife, Mrs. <hi>Labady,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Tourain,</hi> the Confederates, brought through the Door in the Wall by the <hi>Queen</hi> Bed, and put between her Sheets, that is, a Child, and all that naturally attends a Birth. Then the Midwife and the Confidents ſeemed very buſy about <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> in the Dark, none ſeeing what they did, and being afraid, as appeared by the <hi>Midwife's Words</hi> that the Child, which was prepared to ſleep, to prevent its crying before it was got into the Bed, ſhould be ſtifled by the Cloſeneſs of the Bed, they were forced to haſten the <hi>Queen's pretended Delivery</hi> even beyond what was reaſonably to be believed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47926:13"/>
all that could be ſaid of the <hi>Lady of Loretto,</hi> or any <hi>other Saints</hi> Aſſiſtance; therefore the <hi>Queens ſuppoſed Deliverance</hi> was in very ſhort time.</p>
            <p>But nothing appeared in <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> like the <hi>real natural Travel of a Woman in Child-bearing</hi>; there were none of the uſual natural Signs in Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> of being in real Travel, which cannot be hidden; there was no appearance of an approaching Travel by various intermitting Pangs uſually very great by the Infants ſtruggling to free it ſelf of the Womb; no ſhew of the Pains naturally and gradually increaſing, as more of the Ligatures came to be broken, or rent, whereby every Infant is ſafely retained in the Womb, until its full growth and appointed time; there were no Signs of Her <hi>Majeſties</hi> known Weakneſs in bearing ſuch Pangs in her State of Body, debilitated with long lingring Infirmities; there were no Signs of a violent Eruption of an untimely Birth from the <hi>Womb of eight Months and four days,</hi> as Her Majeſty then reported it to have been.</p>
            <p>All that was to be feigned was ſuddenly diſpatched, and the Midwife delivered ſomething cloſe covered to Mrs. <hi>Labady,</hi> which could be nothing but the Child they had put in, and went with is together through the privy Door in the Rail of the Bed into the next Room in ſo great haſte, that it was not conſidered how plainly it might diſcover that it was a meer <hi>feigned counterfeit Travel</hi> of the <hi>Queens,</hi> if the Midwife durſt quit her attending and aſſiſting <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> in thoſe moments, when there was the <hi>greateſt Neceſſity</hi> of her <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> in <hi>her Office,</hi> and the moſt extream danger of her <hi>Majeſties</hi> Life by any neglect of her if ſhe had really brought forth any Child, as they were obliged to pretend.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of fair open freedom in ſhewing that the <hi>Queen</hi> was really delivered of a <hi>Prince,</hi> which our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and Laws, and natural Equity required, that all thoſe works of Nature might have been ſeen, and teſtified by <hi>noble Matrons</hi>; their pretended Birth of a <hi>Prince,</hi> and all that they did about it, was done in the dark, with the Curtains cloſe drawn round about the Bed, and under the Coverings of it, and none of either Sex permitted to ſee any thing done about <hi>Her Majeſty,</hi> or her <hi>ſuppoſed Child</hi> ſave only the Confederates; no others of thoſe in the Bed-Chamber, that drew as near as they might, were ſuffered to ſee what was taken out of the Bed, being ſomething wholly covered, and immediately carried away by the private Door.</p>
            <p>All hearkned after the common and moſt conſtant natural Sign of the Birth of a living Child, that is, its crying; but we are fully aſſured from <hi>divers Lords</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> and others that were in the Bed-Chamber, that the crying of a Child was heard by none there when the pretence was that a Child was born, tho' the <hi>Midwife</hi> would not at firſt ſay it was a <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have related to <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi> no Circumſtances but ſuch as are notoriouſly known, or could be judicially proved before any impartial Court of Judicature; and therefore we will not offer to <hi>Your Hſs.</hi> thoſe Conjectures (tho we have them from good hands) of what was acted about the <hi>pretended Prince</hi> in the Room from whence he was brought, and to which he was carried, before the Lords of the Council, or any others were told that there was a <hi>Prince born</hi>; but we have it of certainty from thoſe that were preſent, that during the whole <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">

               </gap> far from the feet of <hi>her Majeſties</hi> Bed, that were cloſe ſhut up, and they neither ſaw nor heard any thing about the Birth of the <hi>ſuppoſed Prince</hi> whereof they can be lawful Witneſſes to the Kingdom; yet the Actors of this whole Impoſture had the Confidence to publiſh forthwith to the Kingdom by Authority, that <hi>thoſe Lords</hi> and <hi>many Ladies</hi> of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were preſent at the <hi>Queen's Delivery</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> equivocating therein like the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and falſely inſinuating to the People, that <hi>thoſe Lords,</hi> and many <hi>Matrons</hi> of the Nobility had been ſuch ocular Witneſſes as our Laws require of the <hi>Queens</hi> being delivered of a <hi>Prince,</hi> whereas in truth all that were not of the Confederacy waited to no more purpoſe than if they had been ten Miles off her Bed-Chamber.</p>
            <p>After long waiting <hi>His Majeſty</hi> left them, and retired into the inner Room where was Mrs. <hi>Labady</hi> and the Confidents with the <hi>ſuppoſed Prince,</hi> and it was ſoon after ſaid to the Lords, that a <hi>Prince</hi> being born there was no more need of them, whereupon ſeveral of them went away, and whatſoever was done in <hi>ſhewing a Child</hi> to thoſe that ſtaid, was not worthy of our Inquiry, ſince it could be of no uſe to <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi> or the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Yet we carefully obſerved and inquired after the <hi>Queens ſuppoſed Deliverance</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> whether there were any natural demonſtrable ſigns in her <hi>Majeſty</hi> that ſhe had newly born a <hi>Child</hi> that had broke its way by Violence into the World before Natures time, as ſhe then affirmed. Some of us know well the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and neceſſary Conſequences of ſuch force upon Nature in Women of ſuch tenderneſs, and weakneſs as <hi>her Majeſty</hi>; we expected to have heard of her great Weakneſs, and danger of her Life by a <hi>Feaver</hi> that commonly attends ſuch untimely Births; we inquired after the danger of her <hi>Majeſties Breaſts</hi> by the uſual redundancy of Milk, becauſe one had reported ſo long before that ſhe had plenty of it in her Breaſts; we imployed proper Perſons to ask what Woman had the Honour to draw her Breaſts, or whether any applications were made to her Breaſts to repel, or dry the Milk; and alſo to ask after the good progreſs of her <hi>Majeſty</hi> in the <hi>natural Cleanſings</hi> that follow Child-bearing; and of her ſtrength in bearing theſe unavoidable Conſequences, whereby all Women of her <hi>Majeſties</hi> Tenderneſs and Weakneſs are greatly debilitated; but we could never learn by our moſt diligent inquiry that there was any appearance of theſe natural Effects of Child-bearing, tho a good Doctors skill might have eaſily feigned all thoſe to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of all about <hi>her Majeſties</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>We have now given <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> an abſtract of many of the Circumſtances which we had collected in this Affair, and muſt freely affirm, that we cannot obſerve from the beginning to the end of it one
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47926:13"/>
footſtep of ſincere plainneſs; all that hath been done therein from the <hi>Queens pretended Conception</hi> to her <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Delivery</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> hath ſhewed deſires, and intentions to hide the truth of thoſe natural things which they were obliged by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>natural Juſtice,</hi> and by their own <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> to have made demonſtrable or proveable by ſufficient Witneſſes to all the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> if there had been truth in their pretences.</p>
            <p>There hath been ſuch a total neglect, ſlighting and diſregard of all the neceſſary Rules of Law and Juſtice about needful Witneſſes of the Birth of a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Heir</hi> to the Crown (when they knew that moſt of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſuſpected their ſetting up a <hi>Counterfeit</hi>) that it looks like a contempt of <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi> and the whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as if no Satisfaction were due to her <hi>R. Highneſs</hi> in her admiſſion of an Heir to the Crown before her, nor to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in their acknowledgment of a <hi>Prince</hi> to be the next Succeſſor to the Crown.</p>
            <p>The moſt modeſt Judgment we can make of it, is to think that a blind Zeal (always nouriſh'd by the <hi>Romiſh Church)</hi> to ſettle a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> hath made them break through all the Rules of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſtifle and extinguiſh all the natural Affections of a <hi>Father</hi> to a <hi>Child,</hi> to do a Service to their Church, which is by <hi>their Doctrine</hi> ſo meritorious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Highneſſes</hi> will the better conſider all theſe Circumſtances mentioned, if you will pleaſe to call to mind the Occaſion and Time when this Deſign was firſt reſolved on to ſet up a <hi>Prince</hi> to bar her <hi>R. H</hi>'s of the immediate Succeſſion to the Crown.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed to remember, that 'tis before obſerved, that the going to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and the viſit to St. <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifreds Well,</hi> and the Preſent made to the <hi>Lady,</hi> were preparations for a Report of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s being with Child, and were all concluded upon about the <hi>end of Auguſt and beginning of September</hi> 1687, and then was <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> compliance with the <hi>Popiſh Deſign</hi> deſpaired of.</p>
            <p>The abſtract of Mr. <hi>Steward</hi>'s Letters to <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel,</hi> which we juſt now find printed, confirms all our Memorials in that Matter. He was <hi>Pardoned and choſen</hi> by the <hi>King</hi> to have perſwaded <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> to a conſent, that the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſt</hi> ſhould be repeal'd, which had been a full eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of <hi>Popery</hi>; in his two firſt Letters of <hi>July,</hi> he ſeeks to perſwade <hi>your Hſs.</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to preſerve, and obſerve the true right of Succeſſion to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and was very deſirous of <hi>your Hſs</hi> conſent and concurrence in his Deſign, and troubled to find them ſo averſe from it: in his next Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſame <hi>July</hi> he preſſed, that <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> ſhould have been diſpoſed to hearken to a well-choſen Informer to be ſent by his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to perſwade your concurrence with him; and he preſſeth extreamly for a haſty Anſwer; the new Councils for ſetting up a <hi>Suppoſititious Prince</hi> ſeem then to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
            <p>That Letter ſeems to threaten what we now ſee if <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> refuſed; he doubled his aſſurance to him that was to ſollicit <hi>your Highneſſes,</hi> that if you were obſtinate (as they call it) it will be fatal to the Diſſenters, and he feared productive of Ills yet unheard of: And his Letter of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5. ſeems to give <hi>your Highneeſſs</hi> your laſt time to chuſe the <hi>Settlement</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> or to reſolve to be true to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As theſe Letters threaten that the King would deſtroy your Highneſſes greateſt Intereſt if you refuſed, ſo the attempt of it ſoon after appeared.</p>
            <p>It's now known, that in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> the Reſolutions were taken to publiſh that the <hi>Queen</hi> was with <hi>Child</hi>; but before it was publickly declared, that is <hi>October</hi> 8.

            <p>Theſe Letters, by the help of time, ſhew the Deſign when it was in <hi>Embrio,</hi> and help to make a Judgment upon all the other Circumſtances that we have mentioned; and no doubt if an Evidence made up of all the Circumſtances we have mentioned, in their order and connexion, were given to any impartial Judges, it would be judged as ſtrong a preſumptive Evidence as ever was given; and in the proceedings of our <hi>Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Criminals,</hi> Judgment hath paſſed againſt the Lives of many upon far leſs Evidence, this being as full as the nature of the thing can poſſibly ſuffer in your <hi>Hſs.</hi> and the Kingdom's Caſe.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this ſort of Circumſtantial Evidence be ſufficiently forcible and convincing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted Perſons, to prove this <hi>ſuppoſed Prince</hi> to be an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> and it may be more Circumſtances of the ſame nature are known to <hi>your Highneſs,</hi> yet we moſt humbly pray <hi>your Highneſs</hi> to wave inſiſting upon any

of them, as entirely, as if you could neither prove nor knew more about this <hi>pretended Prince</hi> than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame hath proclaimed without contradiction.</p>
            <p>It no ways belongs to <hi>your Highneſſes,</hi> nor to the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to prove the <hi>Falſhood of his Pretences,</hi> or any Circumſtance about his Birth; and it would be very prejudicial for <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> to take upon you the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of producing Witneſſes and Proofs, and admitting <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> Adverſaries to diſpute their force and ſufficiency, when it belongs to them wholly and only, to bring forth ſuch lawful Witneſſes in due numbers, as may ſatisfy <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the Truth of their Pretences; and 'tis an infinite wrong to <hi>your Highneſſes</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that they have not done it long ſince, if there had been a <hi>true Prince born of the Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since 'tis the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> great concern as well as <hi>your Highneſſes,</hi> we are the bolder to propoſe, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Defence againſt the publick Injury be made according to the known Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England</hi>; that is, That an open free demand be made in the name of her <hi>R. Hſs.</hi> as <hi>Heireſs apparent</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and in behalf of all the People of the Realm, that there be forthwith declared and publiſhed to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Number for this Caſe, of lawful Witneſſes of either Sex, ſuch as the <hi>Laws of England</hi> and <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Juſtice</hi> require in the Caſe, who do teſtify, that according to the uſual practice of their reſpective Sexes at the Birth of <hi>Princes, Heirs</hi> to <hi>Crowns,</hi> they were Eye-Witneſſes that the Child now called the <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> was naturally <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Queen's Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis but juſt, regular, and modeſt for <hi>your Hſs.</hi> to make that Demand, and your inſiſting upon it to be done immediately, without the leaſt delay, is no more than the Right of <hi>your Hſs</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as muſt be confeſſed by all that either know the Rules of natural Juſtice, or the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Our Laws require and demand an entry to be made upon all Intruders into the Rights or Inheritances of another; there ought to be legal Interruptions made of all wrongful Poſſeſſions however obtained. A long permiſſion of an <hi>illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Child</hi> to paſs for a <hi>legitimate Heir,</hi> is of dangerous conſequence to the <hi>true Heir</hi> of an Inheritance; 'tis a known Rule both in our <hi>Engliſh Laws,</hi> and the <hi>Civil Laws, Tacens longo tempore praeſumitur conſentire,</hi> he that remains long without anſwering any thing to an Intruders claim, ſeems to allow it.</p>
            <p>We crave pardon that we muſt freely tell <hi>your Hſs,</hi> that it hath been our aſtoniſhment that <hi>your Hſs</hi> have been ſo long ſilent, and have deferred to make your juſt demand, and that you have ſo long ſuffered her <hi>R.

            <p>When a wrongful Claimer to be Heir of any Inheritance cannot prove his true Deſcent, the Court wherein he ſues his Claim, not only rejects and damns his falſe Pretences, but openly declares the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Tricks or Forgeries that they obſerve to have been attempted to ſupport the falſe Claim, and our Laws enable the Heir that hath been diſturbed, to demand by his Action againſt the falſe Pretender, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the <hi>Scandal</hi> of <hi>his lawful Title</hi>; and our Laws further require his proſecution for Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the known Confederates in that intended Wrong and Fraud, for their ſeveral Crimes therein committed.</p>

juſtly expected inheritance, and the very being of our Civil Government are in the moſt extream danger of utter ruine.</p>
            <p>We are and have been truly <hi>Loyal</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and never refuſed obedience to any of his legal Commands, or any whatſoever that could conſiſt with all our other Duties to <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>fellow Subjects.</hi> We have been content to ſuffer perſonal wrongs and manifeſt Injuſtice, and conſidered the Corruption of Men, that abuſes and particular wrongs will happen in all Governments, and ought patiently to be born, whilſt the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Civil Government and Juſtice are ſacredly preſerved. Our Chriſtian Charity taught us, that 'tis better that a few ſuffer wrongs, than to hazard for their juſt Relief more effuſion of Blood, or other Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs than can be recompenſed by their obtaining Right.

            </p>
            <p>We are ſenſible that the <hi>King</hi> hath uſed the Name of the <hi>Royal Authority</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> in all the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs powers</hi> that he hath exerciſed, and we durſt not pray your Hſs. aid againſt his doings, if there could be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably any doubt or queſtion, whether the things he hath done and daily doth, might be authorized by the <hi>Royal Powers</hi> and <hi>high Prerogatives</hi> which belong to the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis moſt unqueſtionable, that the <hi>Noble Engliſh Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> had a <hi>legal Foundation,</hi> and was and is eſtabliſhed upon <hi>Cuſtoms, Franchiſes</hi> and <hi>Laws peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh Nation.</hi> It was always free and independent upon all the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> on Earth; the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> are, and of right were always free and abſolute to bind themſelves by their own Laws, made by their joynt conſent, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; they could never be bound by any others than themſelves, ſave only by the Laws of the <hi>moſt high God.</hi>

            <p>A <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ceaſeth to act by the <hi>Engliſh Kingly Authority,</hi> or as a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> if he yield up himſelf or his Subjects to be bound or ſubjected to any other <hi>Laws, Canons</hi> or <hi>Juriſdictions,</hi> than ſuch as are made or freely received by the mutual agreement of the <hi>King</hi> and the repreſentative Body of the Realm in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis declared in the <hi>St.</hi> 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2.5. that the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had been ſo free at all times, that it hath been in Subjection to no Realm, and that the ſame ought not in any thing touching the Regality to be ſubmitted to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Laws and Statutes of the Realm to be by him fruſtrated or defeated at his Will, to the perpetual deſtruction of the <hi>Kings Soveraignty, Crown</hi> and <hi>Regality,</hi> and of all the <hi>Realm.</hi> The Commons then prayed the King, and him required by way of Juſtice, to examine all the States of the <hi>Realm</hi> how they would ſtand to defend the Rights of the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Realm</hi> againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>; and it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ordained, that all that ſhould purſue or bring any <hi>Bulls</hi> or Inſtruments from <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the Kings Regality or his Realm, ſhould be put out of the Kings Protection, and incur a <hi>Premunire,</hi> which, as the Law then was, made it lawful for any man to kill them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>King John</hi> indeed unworthily ſurrendered the <hi>Crown</hi> and Regalities to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3d, and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> falſely put into that Charter that it was by the conſent of his Council of <hi>Barons,</hi> he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to hold the Kingdom of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that by yearly rent again; but when Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth in the third of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. ſent for that pretended Rent, that Noble <hi>Prince</hi> juſtly anſwered,<note place="margin">See Rol.

            </p>
            <p>In the 40 of <hi>Edward the Third,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> demanded the ſame Rents, and the <hi>King</hi> propoſed it in <hi>Parliament,</hi> but they declared, that neither <hi>King John</hi> nor any other <hi>King</hi> had any power to put himſelf or the Realm and People into ſubjection to the Pope without their conſent in Parliament; and that if it were done by <hi>King John,</hi> it was done contrary <hi>to his Oath</hi> in his <hi>Coronation</hi>; and if the Pope attempted any thing thereupon againſt the <hi>King</hi> or his Subjects, they would reſiſt him to their utmoſt power.</p>
            <p>The ſame King <hi>Edward</hi> the third had only negligently ſuffered the <hi>Popes power</hi> to be too much uſed in the Kingdom, contrary to the Statute of <hi>Carlile</hi> 35 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. as appears by the <hi>Parliament Roll</hi> 17. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 59.

and the Commons in <hi>Parliament</hi> complained that the Treaſure of the Realm was tranſported to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Secrets of the Realm diſcovered by the Foreign Prieſts ſent hither, and they required of the King ſome Mercy for that they neither could nor would any longer bear thoſe ſtrong Oppreſſions, or elſe that he would help them to expel out of this Realm the <hi>Popes Power</hi> by Force, and thereupon were enacted againſt many of the <hi>Popes Powers</hi> in this Realm thoſe ſevere <hi>Penal Laws of</hi> 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.1.38 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Stat.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. all which our King hath now declared ſhall never hereafter be put in Execution.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Victorious Prince</hi> Edw. 3. tho a Papiſt, yet pretended to no <hi>Regal Prerogative</hi> of ſuſpending the Laws made by the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> he confeſſeth in that Statute <hi>of</hi> 35 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. againſt the <hi>Pope's Power,</hi> that it held its Force being not annulled by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and therefore he was bound by his Oath to ſee the ſame kept as a Law of the Realm, tho by Sufferance and Negligence it had been attempted to the Contrary.</p>
            <p>If the Effects of the <hi>Romiſh Juriſdictions</hi> in the Realm were looked upon as they are related in that 38 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.1. It would be manifeſt that the King that would put the Kingdom into ſuch a ſtate, lays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide thereby his <hi>Kingly Office</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> whilſt he purſues theſe Intentions; that Statute ſaith, that by the Powers exerciſed by the <hi>Pope</hi> and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Dependants thereof, the good ancient <hi>Laws, Cuſtoms,</hi> and <hi>Franchiſes</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi> were greatly impeached, blemiſhed, and confounded, the <hi>Crown</hi> abated, the Treaſure and Riches of the <hi>Realm</hi> carried away, the Inhabitants and Subjects of the <hi>Realm</hi> impoveriſhed and troubled, and the great Men and Commons in Bodies and Goods damnified; ſurely there can be no doubt whether the <hi>King</hi> hath any Royal Prerogative to enable him either to ſtop the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe <hi>Penal Laws</hi> that prevent the <hi>Kingdom</hi> from falling back into ſuch a forlorn Eſtate, or to attempt by pretence of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> for the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> and Emiſſaries, and their Practices, to enable them to work all the miſchief they can againſt thoſe that would ſave the Kingdom from ſuch Miſeries.</p>
            <p>Your Highneſſes may be abſolutely certain, that the <hi>King</hi> acts not by vertue of the <hi>Engliſh Regal Office</hi> or <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> in his authorizing <hi>Treaſons</hi> to be daily committed againſt the Realm. By the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. they that give or receive any Abſolution or Reconciliation to <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority, or any of his <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> licenſeth and authorizeth to be done continually, thoſe are declared <hi>high Traytors</hi> to the King and the Realm; and no doubt <hi>Treaſons</hi> declared by a Statute againſt the Realm are common Nuſances of the <hi>higheſt Nature</hi> and <hi>Miſchief</hi>; 'tis the truſt of the Regal Office to prevent and puniſh them, and 'tis directly Contrary to the <hi>Kingly Office</hi> to aſſume Power to authorize or licenſe ſuch Crimes.</p>
            <p>'Tis unqueſtionable that no <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ever had power to grant Offices to perſons diſabled to bear them by poſitive and direct Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> made for that very purpoſe, and declared to be for the peoples ſecurity; nevertheleſs the <hi>King</hi> hath put moſt of the <hi>Offices</hi> of the Kingdom in the hands of thoſe that are ſo diſabled.</p>
            <p>Its as certain it never was in the power of our Kings to diſpoſſeſs at their Wills any of the ſubjects of thoſe intereſts and profits which they had for their lives; nor to Commiſſion any to judge his Subjects finally in matters criminal or civil by their diſcretion without any regard to the <hi>Laws, Cuſtoms</hi> and priviledges of the Realm.</p>

            <p>Nothing can compleat his Majeſtys renuntiation of the Truſts and Obligation of the Engliſh Regal Office, ſave only that he aſſume (as he now doth actually) to take from the <hi>Citys</hi> and <hi>Boroughs</hi> intirely all their <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>free Election</hi> of their <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> confirmed to them expreſſely by the great <hi>Charter,</hi> and many other Laws; and that he deprive all the reſt of the people of their Liberty to chuſe ſuch perſons as they pleaſe according to the Statutes to Conſent for them to the Laws that ſhall bind them their Eſtates and Lives, as he hath declared he will, and intends, and is every day doing; and then the <hi>antient rightful</hi> and <hi>Free Engliſh Government</hi> will be manifeſtly and intirely diſſolved, and <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſhall have no Legal right to their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> their <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> or their <hi>Lives.</hi>

            <p>There will be then no legal <hi>Engliſh Monarchy</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> truſted by the Laws with high <hi>Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> for the joynt ſafety and benefit of the <hi>King</hi> and the ſubjects, acknowledging themſelves to be bound by an Oath to maintain the <hi>Cuſtoms, Laws</hi> and <hi>Franchiſes</hi> of the Realm; and to take <hi>continual care</hi> for the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of the Laws impartially for that purpoſe; every man ſhall then have equal and eternal right to every hing as <hi>this King</hi> will, and his <hi>Popiſh forces</hi> ſhall diſpoſe of it, and ſo long only as he ſhall pleaſe to continue in the ſame mind with the ſame force.</p>

            <p>If you ſuffer them to be deſtroyed, or to be diſuſed and deemed to be of no force, but as the King ſhall pleaſe by his <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Courts,</hi> and by all that he ſhall poſſeſs of the Power of the Kingdom, Your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes claym</hi> and <hi>rights</hi> as <hi>Expectant</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> is in like manner deſtroyed, and ſet aſide; and the whole arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Magiſtracy ſerving his Will, and all his <hi>Popiſh forces, Foraigners</hi> and <hi>Natives,</hi> will be ingaged in Intereſt and miſguided Conſcience to oppoſe your Highneſſes claim; by the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England</hi> there will be indeed in the State to which the King hath brought the Kingdom, no legal <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> nor <hi>Government</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uſe unto which her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> can immediately ſucceed according to the Cuſtoms and Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; the <hi>Kingdom</hi> muſt be a confuſed Multitude, and the ſtrongeſt may ſubdue the reſt to their Will.</p>
            <p>As your Highneſſes have a right to ſave the Government by reaſon of your great Intereſt in it, ſo all the People have an unqueſtionable right to ſeek your Highneſſes Aid therein; and 'tis one of the principal Duties of the Chriſtian Religion, and will be one of the beſt outward Expreſſions of their Love to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to aſſiſt your Highneſs in all your righteous ways, defending their Juſt <hi>Civil Government,</hi> being inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God for preſerving Juſtice among humane Societies.</p>
            <p>The People that love their Neighbours, and Countries, as Chriſtian Religion commands, ought not careleſly nor irreligiouſly to ſuffer their Civil Government, their Laws, and all their Rights and Intereſt that their Country hold by them for themſelves and Poſterities, to be deſtroyed by any Man's Will, Superſtition or Ambition.</p>
            <p>He that was at firſt a Legal <hi>Supream Magiſtrate,</hi> and ought to have been obeyed if he would have ſo continued, tho he had done many Injuſtices to particular Perſons, he may caſt off the Quality and Uſe of the Power of <hi>a Legal Supream Magiſtrate,</hi> and uſe and exerciſe Power deſtructive to all the <hi>Legal Truſts</hi> and <hi>Office</hi>; and then he deveſts himſelf of that <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> of <hi>a lawful Magiſtracy</hi> unto which the Laws of God and the Kingdom require Obedience.</p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> acknowledged the Peoples Right to ſave their <hi>Free Government</hi> if any of the <hi>Kings themſelves</hi> would have diſhonorably parted with the Rights of the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Realm.</hi> We men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the Letter of H.
