         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

good acceptance of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

<hi>The cleare refutation of that pestilent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,

<hi>in</hi> LONDON, <hi>the odious note of
bondage, and the barbarous penaltie of losse
of Gentry:</hi> to the great reproach of our
Kingdomes policie, and to the manifold
damage of the publike. In this one act
of his, the Aduocate therefore doth not
onely seeme to be the Patron or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of birth-rights, and of the rights of
fortunes, but the Champion also of ciuill
Arts, &amp; of flourishing Industrie among
you: the sinewes, and life it selfe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.
The occasion which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to enter the lists single against
a multitude, in this good quarell, was
priuate, as appeares by the Letters at the
end of the worke, but the cause, is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
such (according to his best vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding)
as he should not refuse to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett
&amp; second with his sword, the strokes
of his pen, to that purpose. For, though


<pb facs="tcp:6612:4"/>
the Schooles, and Camp, are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for Honor and Armes, yet the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
wisedome, and the like ancient boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of Honor open to City-Arts, and to
the mysteries of honest gaine, as fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall

of externall splendor: according
to the most laudable examples of rising
<hi>Rome,</hi> vnder her first Dictators, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls.
By which their such moderation
and iudgement, they happily auoided
two opposite rockes; tyrannicall appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation
of Gentry to some certaine old
families, as in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and the confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of allowing hereditarie Noblenesse,

               <p>IF hauing beene at no small charge, and some care, to breed my sonne
vp in Gentleman like qualities, with purpose the rather to enable
him for the seruice of God, his Prince, and Countrey, I am very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to remoue from him as a Father, all occasions, which might either
make him lesse estemed of others, or abate the least part of his edge; I say,
not towards the honesty of life onely, but towards the splendor thereof,
and worship also, my hope is, that I shall not in your worthy iudgement,
seeme either insolent, or vaine glorious.</p>
               <p>Truth and Iustice are the onely motiues of my stirring at this present.
For, as I mortally hate that my Son should beare himselfe, aboue himself
so should I disclaime my part in him, if being vniustly sought to be emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
he sillily lost any inch of his due. He hath beene disgraced as no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
borne, when yet not hee but I his Father was the Apprentise,
thankes be to God for it. They cannot obiect to him want of fashion; they
cannot obiect to him the common vices, badges rather of reprobates then
of Gentlemen: They cannot obiect to him cowardise, for it is well knowne
that he dares defend himselfe: nor any thing else vnworthy of his name,
which is neither new, nor ignoble: But mee his poore father they obiect
vnto him, because I was once an Apprentise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6612:9"/>
Wise Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> teacheth vs, vnder the names, and persons
of his <hi>Eutopians,</hi> that victories, and atchieuements of wit are applauded,
farre aboue those of forces: and seeing reuerence to God, &amp; to our Prince,
commandeth vs, (as his Maiesties booke of Duells doth affirme (not to
take the office of iustice from Magistrates, by priuate rash reuenges, I
haue compelled my sonne, vpon Gods blessing, and mine, to forbeare the
sword till by my care he may be found not to be in the wrong. For if it be
true, <hi>that by Apprentiship we forfeit our titles to natiue Gentrie:</hi>
God forbid that my sonne should vsurpe it. And if it be not true, then
shall be haue a iust ground to defend himselfe, and his aduersaries shall
stand conuicted of ignorance, if not of enuie also.</p>
               <p>These are therefore very earnestly to pray you, to cleare this question.
For, in the City of <hi>London</hi> there are at this present many hundreds of
Gentlemens children Apprentises, infinite others haue beene, and infinite
will be: and all the parts of <hi>England</hi> are full of families, either origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
raised to the dignity of Gentlemen out of this one most famous
place: or so restored, and enriched as may well seeme to amount to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
raising. And albeit I am very confident, that by hauing once
beene an Apprentise in <hi>London,</hi> I haue not lost to be a Gentleman of
birth, nor my sonne, yet shall I euer wish, and pray rather to resemble an
heroicke <hi>Walworth,</hi> a noble <hi>Philpot,</hi> an happie <hi>Capel,</hi> that learned
Sheriffe of <hi>London</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fabian,</hi> or any other famous Worthies of this
royall City, out of any whatsoeuer obscurest parentage, then that being
descended of great Nobles, to fall by vice farre beneath the rancke of
poorest Prentises.</p>
               <p>In requitall of your care in this point, you shall shortly receiue (if I
can obtain my desire) out of the records &amp; monuments of <hi>London,</hi> a Roll
of the names, and Armes of such principall friends as haue beene aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to Honor, and Worship, throughout the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> from the
degree of Citizens. A warrantable designe, by the example of the Lord
chiefe Iustice <hi>Cooke,</hi> who hath bestowed vpon the world (in some one
or other of his bookes of reports) a short Catologue of such as haue beene
eminently beholding to the Common Lawes, and if I should faile in that,
yet doe I promise you a list or Alphabet of Apprentises names, who by
their enrollments will appeare vpon good Record, to haue beene sonnes
of Gentlemen from all the parts of <hi>England.</hi>

Neither let your approued vertue doubt, but that in the meane time
you shall finde vs very ready to shew our free, and honest mindes, in all
commendable, and disenuious emulations, with the best Gentlemen who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.
Which disposition measure not by the few Angells you receiue in

               <p>If this my sute, and request, cary the lesse regard, because it comes
but from a priuate Citizen, be pleased I pray to vnderstand, that in me,
though being but one man, multitudes speake, and that out of a priuate
pen, a publike cause propounds it selfe. And yet I come not single. For

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE present question, <hi>Whether
Apprentiship extinguisheth Gentry</hi>
being now not so much a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox,
as growne in secret to
be of late a common opinion,
I am bold to call a weighty and
important question vniustly grounded vpon the
learned folly of <hi>Erasmus</hi> of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumspection
of Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> Knight, in his
booke <hi>de Republica Anglorum,</hi> and out of certaine
wandring conceits hatcht among trees &amp; tillage,
as shall appeare hereafter. Weighty and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
I am bold to call it, and it is so. Because in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out vpon the concernings of the case, I finde
that prospect so spacious, that within the compass
thereof, as well the greater as the lesser Nobilitie
of <hi>England</hi> are very notably, and very inexplicably
enwrapped. What doe I say of the subalternall
Nobilitie, when the Royall name it selfe (with all
humble reuerence be it spoken) was deeply inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed
in the proposition? For Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
though a free Monarch, and chiefe of the English
in her turne, was a party of the cause, which shee
ingenuously, and openly acknowledged, calling
Sir <hi>Martin Calthorpe,</hi> kinsman, (as indeed he was)


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6612:12"/>
being at that time Knight, and Lord Maior of
<hi>London:</hi> Yea Sir <hi>Godfrey Bullen</hi> (Knight also and
Lord Maior of <hi>London)</hi> was lineall Ancestor to
Queene <hi>Anne</hi> her mother (saith <hi>Camden</hi> in his
Annals) no longer before then in the reigne of
<hi>Henry</hi> the sixth King of <hi>England.</hi> Both which
Knights (being also Gentlemen borne, &amp; of right
Worshipfull Families) ascended by due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
from the condition of <hi>Apprentises</hi> to the
greatest annuall honor of this Kingdome. It is
weighty and important, because without much
impropriety of speech, it may be called <hi>quaestio sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
which in the ancient phrase of the Emperour
<hi>Iustinian,</hi> is as much to say as a tryall, whether one
is to be adiudged bond, or free, seruile, or ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and implieth that odious, and vnnaturall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel,
which by <hi>Textuists</hi> hath to name, <hi>Capitis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutio:</hi>
wherof though the Romane lawes make
a threefold diuision, yet in this our question, if but
onely the third and lowest degree were incurred,
which hapneth, <hi>cum qui sui juris fuerunt, coeperunt
alieno iuri subiecti esse,</hi> that alone should keepe vs
from neglect. It is weighty and important, and
can appeare none other, because it directly tends
to darken, and as it were to intercloud the lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
body of that beauteous planet HONOR,
with not onely foule but lasting spots. For what


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6612:12"/>
can lightly be a more disparagement, then for the
free to become a kind of bondmen, or to be come
of such? Nay, there is nothing without vs, which
can bee of so great disparagement. Finally, it is
weighty, and important for very many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and particularly because it is not onely fit
that states of opinions should be rectified in this
kinde, as breeding bad affections among people
of the same nation (from whence great mischiefes
often rise, euen to hatred, quarrels, and homicides)
but that such also, as through vanity, or other sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the wit, or iudgement, disdaine to seeme
either Citie-borne, or Citie-bred, or to owe any
thing of their worship, or estate, either to the City,
or to Citizens, may vnderstand their owne place,
and true condition, lest they be conuinced to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, who are vnworthy of so honest ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

There needs no greater demonstration of the
Cities ancient honor, and of her peoples free qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
then this, that a principall Baron of the Realm
of <hi>England</hi> was by tenure her Standard-bearer.
The figure of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (titularie patron of <hi>London)</hi>
aduanced it selfe in the Standard, and vpon the
shield those famous well-knowne Armories of
the Crosse, and Weapon. The like picture of
which Apostle was also embroidered in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
of that horse of warre, which for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Cities seruice he receiued of gift at the
hands of the Lord Maior. Vpon the Standard-bearers
coat armour are painted the hereditarie
ensignes of his owne illustrious Familie, that is to
say, <hi>Or, a Fesse betweene two Cheuerns Gules.</hi> Which
kind of field the ancients called <hi>Claurie,</hi> perhaps <hi>à 
claritate,</hi> because such fields as were all of one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
made their charges the more clearely seene,
and perspicuous. And as they gaue to that species
of blazon a peculiar name for the dignitie, so did
they also assigne to this manner of bearing two
<hi>Cheuerns,</hi> the terme <hi>Biallie,</hi> or a coat <hi>Biallie, a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
binario.</hi> In which braue times had that noble
Gentleman, but slightly, and farre off suspected,
that he displayed that banner, for a kind of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or as for their seruice, his great heroick spirit


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6612:14"/>
would rather haue trodden such an office vnder
foot. In good assurance therefore of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
causes iustice, we proceed.</p>
               <p>Sound opinion (meaning doctrine) is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
of the world, and opinion (meaning a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
conceit of this or that person) is the principall
ingredient which makes words, or actions relish
well, and all the <hi>Graces</hi> are, without it, little worth.
To take the fame from any man that hee is a
Gentleman-borne is a kind of disenablement, and
preiudice, at leastwise among the weake (who
consider no further then seemings) that is to say
among almost all. Consequently a wrong. And
if a wrong then due to be redressed. To find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,
we must first enquire</p>
               <p>Whether Apprentiship extinguisheth Gentrie.</p>
               <p>4 The maine reason, certainly the most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
vsed to proue, that it doth, is, <hi>That Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is a kinde of bondage,</hi> and bondage speciallie
voluntarie (in which case the Imperiall law-rule,
<hi>non officit natalibus in seruitute fuisse,</hi> may bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
defectiue) extinguisheth natiue Gentrie. But
I denie that <hi>Apprentiship</hi> is either <hi>vera seruitus,</hi> or
<hi>omnino servitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For explication of this difficultie, I will set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your eyes the case as it is. A Gentleman hath


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6612:14"/>
a sonne, whom he meanes to breed vp in an Art
of thrift, not rising meerely out of a stocke of wit,
or learning, but out of a stocke of money, and
credit, managed according to that Art; and for
this cause hee brings his child at 15. or 16. yeares
old, more, or lesse, to the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> prouides
him a Master, and the youth, by his fathers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
willingly becomes an Appre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tise, that is to say,
interchangeably seales a written contract with
his Master by an indented instrument. That he,
for his certaine yeares true and faithfull seruice,
shall learne that precious mystery of how to
gaine honestly, and to raise himselfe. Let the legal
and ordinarie forme of that instrument (extant in
<hi>Wests Precedents,</hi> and familiar euery where) be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pondered, and it will appeare a meere ciuill
contract, which as all the world knowes, a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is vncapable of. If you would know vnder
what kinde, or species of contract that doth fall;
I answer: That it seemes to be a contract of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation,</hi>
or <hi>interchange:</hi> In which mutuall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
or conuention, the act of binding is no
more, but that (as reason and iustice would) the
Master might be determinately for the time, and
sufficiently for the manner, sure to enioy his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentise.
Appre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiship being therfore, but an effect


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6612:15"/>
of a ciuill contract, occasioned, and caused by that
prudent respect which the Contrahents mutually
haue to their lawfull and honest commodity, and
such onely as are free-borne, being capable to
make this contract with effect, <hi>Apprentiship doth
not extinguish Gentry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the contrarie, it is vrged: That although
Apprentiship bee not a true bondage to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
and purposes, yet, that it is a temporary
bondage, and equall (for the time it lasteth) to
very seruitude. In which opinion <hi>Erasmus</hi> is, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his Etymologie of our Prentises to be, for
that they are like to such as are bought with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<hi>pares emptitijs,</hi> which conceipt, as it is more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
then happie, so, if it were set to sale, would
find few Chapmen, but to laugh at it. For <hi>Erasmus</hi>
is aswell proued to be <hi>errans mus in obscurorum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum
Epistolis,</hi> as Apprentises in <hi>England</hi> to be <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
emptitijs.</hi> But we absolutely deny that Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship
is in any sort a kinde of bondage. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that to proue it be so, they make a
parallel between the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> seruitude, and
the <hi>London</hi> apprentiship, yet will these <hi>comparata,</hi>
be found <hi>disparata,</hi> if not <hi>disparatissima.</hi> For <hi>seruus</hi>
among the old Romans, was so called of <hi>seruando</hi>
of preseruing or sauing, and not of <hi>seruiendo,</hi> of


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6612:15"/>
seruing, saith the Law-maker himselfe, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Iustinian.</hi> But the word <hi>Apprentise</hi> commeth
of <hi>Aprenti,</hi> the French word, a raw souldier, or
young learner, <hi>Tyro, rudis discipulus;</hi> or of the <hi>French</hi>
verbe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which signifies to learne, or of the <hi>Latine</hi>
word <hi>apprehendo,</hi> or <hi>apprendo,</hi> which properly is to
lay hold of, and translatiuely to learne, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuations
are consonant to the thing, and true
howsoeuer Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> in his bookes <hi>de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica
Anglorum,</hi> not remembring to distinguish
betweene seruitude and discipline, bondage, and
regular breeding, iniuriously defined them to be a
kind of bondmen (meaning meere slaues, and not
as in some places of <hi>England,</hi> bondsmen are taken
for such as are in bonds for actionable causes) and
such bondmen as differ onely thus from very
bondmen (whose like words for signification
are those foulest ones, <hi>slaues</hi> and <hi>villaines)</hi> that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentises
be but for a time certaine. An ouersight
which I could haue wished far off from so graue
and learned a Gentleman, as that Knight, who
was of priuy Counsell, in the place of Secretarie,
to Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, that which did constitute a bondman
among the old <hi>Romans,</hi> was such a power and
right, vested in the Lord, ouer the very body of his


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6612:16"/>
bondman, or slaue, as descending to him vnder
some receiued title, or other <hi>iure gentium,</hi> was
maintained to him, <hi>iure ciuili Romanorum.</hi> By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
whereof he became proprietarie in the person
of his bondman, as in the body of his oxe, horse,
or any other beast he had, which proprietariship
was indeterminable, but only by <hi>manumission,</hi> and
that act meerely depended vpon the will of his
Lord, without any endentment, or condition on
behalfe of the slaue, which a right <hi>Roman</hi> would
neuer endure to heare of from his bondman. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
(which in the qualitie of that seruitude was
most base,) <hi>seruus</hi> among them, <hi>nullum caput ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit,</hi>
had no head in law, and neither was <hi>in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su,</hi>
nor <hi>in lustro condito;</hi> asmuch to say, that they
were out of the number of men, their names be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither put, as among such as had wherewith
to pay, in the Rolles of their Exchequer, or tables
of their <hi>Capitol,</hi> nor, as bodies wherewith to serue
in the generall musters of their Commonweale,
but (to bee briefe) were reputed <hi>ciuilitèr mortui,</hi>
dead in Law, death, and bondage being alike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, without any more reputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
members in the body politique, then brute
cattell, for bondmen were reputed no body, <hi>serui
pro nullis habiti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:6612:16"/>
And albeit the authority of the commonweale
vpon this good ground of State, <hi>interest reipublicae
ne quis re sua male vtatur,</hi> and the Maiestie of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
Princes, meerly as in honor, and as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with commiseration of humane miseries, did
sometime interpose it selfe vpon iust causes; as,
where the Lord did immeasurably tyrannise, or
the bondman tooke Sanctuary at the Emperours
statue, and image, or, at the altar of some one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their gods (an example whereof is in <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus)</hi>
yet the bondman after manumission, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in such relation to his late Lord, that in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
cases, (as ingratitude) he who was once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchised
was adiudged backe to his patron, and
condemned againe to a farre more miserable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude
then euer.</p>
               <p>These things considered, and nothing being
like in Apprentiship, who liues so carelesse of the
honour of the English name, as to bring the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of honest Arts, and Schollers of mysteryes in
ciuill trade, and commerce for vertuous causes, all
called by the faire title of Apprentises, into the state
or qualitie of bondmen? Faire I call it, because that
title is common to them with the Inns of Court,
where Apprentises at Law, are not the meanest
Gentlemen. Apprentiship therefore is no volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
bondage, because it is no bondage at all, but a


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6612:17"/>
title onely of politicke or ciuill discipline. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship
therefore doth not extinguish Gentry.
So then, Apprentises, whether Gentlemen of birth
or others, whatsoeuer their Indentures doe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and howsoeuer they seeme conditionall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
are in truth not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to do, or to suffer things
more grieuous then yong souldiers in armies, or
schollers in rigorous schooles, or nouices in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceships:
each of whom in their kind vsually do,
and suffer things as base and vile in their owne
quality, simply, &amp; in themselues considered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect to the finall scope, or aime of the first
institution, as perhaps the very meanest of fiue
thousand Apprentises in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The finall cause therefore of euery ordination
qualifies the course, and the end denominates the
meanes and actions tending to it. For if that be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
no worke is base prescribed <hi>in ordine,</hi> or as in
the way to that end. Though abstracting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
consideration, the worke wrought, in the proper
nature of it, be seruile. As, for a souldier to dig or
carie earth to a rampire, or for a student to goe
bare-headed to a fellow of the house within the
Colledge, as far off as he can see him, omitting the
more deformed necessitie, of suffering priuate, or
publike disciplines: or for a nouice in a nouiceship
to wash dishes, or the like seeming-base workes,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6612:17"/>
as by report, is vsuall. If then the generall scope, or
finall reason of Apprentiship be honest, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as will appeare hereafter that it
is) what can be clearer then that <hi>Apprentiship</hi> doth
not extinguish <hi>Gentry?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am the more feruent in this case; because this
one false conceit (at all times hurtful, but chiefly in
these latter times, in which the meanes of easie
maintenance are infinitely straitned) that <hi>for a
Gentleman borne, or one that would aspire to bee a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
for him to be an Apprentise to a Citizen, or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensis,
is a thing vnbeseeming him,</hi> hath fill'd our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with more vices, and sacrificed more seruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
bodies to odious ends, and more soules to
sinfull life, then perhaps any <hi>one other vnciuill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
whatsoeuer. For they who hold it better to
rob by land, or sea, then to beg, or labour, doe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see, and feele, that out of Apprentises rise such, as
sit vpon them, standing out for their liues as male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
when they (a shame, and sorrow to their
kinred) vndergoe a fortune too vnworthy, euen
of the basest, of honest bondmen.</p>

should it fall into the minde of
any good, or wise discouser, <hi>That
Apprentises are a kind of bondmen,</hi>
and consequently, <hi>That Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship
extinguisheth natiue Gentry, and disenableth to
acquisitiue?</hi> For, if that opinion bee not guilty of
impiety to our Mother Countrey, where that lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
policie of Apprentiship necessary for our
nation, is exercised as a point of seuere discipline,
warrantable in <hi>Christianitie;</hi> certainly it hath in it a

and why not impietie also, if they wilfully
wrong the wisdome of <hi>England,</hi> their naturall
common parent, whose children are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne?
Surelie, notorious inconsiderance is
apparent, because there are but two maine pillars
of Common-weale, PRAEMIVM &amp; PAENA,
<hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Punishment.</hi> Of which, in ciuill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<hi>Honor</hi> is highest, according to that of the

noted to be commodious for the Prince) being
the most familiar part of <hi>Honor,</hi> they rip vp, and
ouerturne the principall of those two pillars of
common-weale, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very basis. A strange ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
specially of professors of skill in the Arts of
publike gouernment, vnlesse perhaps they speake
it because they would haue things reformed, or
changed in this particular of Apprentiship. But
we do not remember, that either Sir <hi>Thomas Eliot</hi>
in his Gouernor, or Sir <hi>Thomas Chaloner,</hi> (Leigier
Ambassador for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in <hi>Spaine)</hi> in his
bookes of Latine Hexameters <hi>de rep. Anglorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staurandâ,</hi>
(published with the verses of the Lord
Treasurer <hi>Burghley's</hi> before it) or any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
rightly vnderstanding our <hi>England,</hi> and her
generous people, did euer once taxe our Countries
policie in this point. Yea, some make it a <hi>quaere,</hi>
whether the Cities discipline had not more need
to be reduced neerer to the ancient seuerity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
considering with what vices <hi>London</hi> flowes,


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6612:19"/>
and ouerflowes, then that it should bee abduced,
though but a little, from it.</p>
               <p>Now then let any one but rightly weigh
with what conscience, or common sense, the first
institutors, or propagators of the English forme
of gouernment could lay vpon <hi>Industry,</hi> and ciuill
<hi>Vertue</hi> (whose subiect are the lawfull things of
this life, and whose neerest obiect is honor, and
honest wealth) so foule a note as the brand of
bondage, or any the least disparagement at all?
whereas to quicken, &amp; inflame affections in that
kind, all wise Masters in the most noble ciuill Art
gouernement, and all founders of Empire, and
States, haue bent their counsels, and courses, to
cherish such as are vertuously industrious, yea,
God himselfe, (the onely best patterne of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours)
hath made it knowne, that euen Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

in accomplishment of the three maine heads to
which mortalls vse to refer all their worldly ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors
(necessitie, profit, &amp; pleasure) that <hi>Tubal Cain</hi>
was <hi>Malleator,</hi> and <hi>faber ferrarius,</hi> an hammer-Smith,
or worker in yron, that being one of those
Arch-mysteries, <hi>sine quibus non aedificatur ciuitas,</hi> as
the words are in <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> Nay, there belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in Gods owne iudgement so great praise to
the particular excellency of some artificers, as that,
in the building of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, they are regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to all posterities in Scripture; and their skill
is not onely made immortally famous, but a more
curious mention is put downe of their parentage,
and birth place, then of many great Princes, as in
<hi>Hirams</hi> case, not he the King, but the brasse-foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And in the new Testament, <hi>S. Paul,</hi> (being a
Gentlemen borne of a noble familie, as the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
write) had the manuall Art of <hi>Scoenopoea,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
englished, Tent-making: vpon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> place
of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> trade (whereof in his Epistles he doth
often glorie) it is declared to vs out of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi>
that S. <hi>Paul</hi> (who himselfe tells King <hi>Agrippa</hi>
that he had liued a <hi>Pharisee;</hi> according to the most

traditionall precept, binding such a would studie


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6612:20"/>
sacred letters, to learne some one or other mysterie
in the Mechanicks. And at this present among
other things which the Turks retaine of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
rites, this seemes one, when euen the <hi>Sultan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or <hi>Grand Signior</hi> (as all his progenitors) is said
to exercise a manuall trade, little, or much, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
once a day. And in fresh memorie <hi>Rodul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
the Emperour had singular skill in making
Dials, Watches, and the like fine works of Smith-craft,
as also a late great <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which
they practised.</p>
               <p>4 If then such honor be done by God (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid)
not onely to those which are necessarie
handy-crafts, but to those also which are but the
handmaids of magnificence, and outward splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
as engrauers, founders, and the like; hee shall
be very hardie who shall embase honest <hi>Industry</hi>
with disgracefull censures; and too vniust, who
shall not cherish, or encourage it with praise and
worship, as the ancient excellent policie of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
did, and doth, in constituting corporations,
&amp; adorning Companies with banners of Armes
and speciall men with notes of Noblesse.</p>
               <p>5 And, as of all commendable Arts all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6612:21"/>
of the Citie none generally are encorporated,
but such onely as through the strait gates of
Apprentiship aspire to the dignitie and state of
Citizens. That <hi>Hebrew</hi> bondmen were not, in
MOSES law, among themselues, like to our
<hi>Apprentises</hi> (howsoeuer the seuenth yeare agrees
in time with the ordinarie time of our Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
obligation) is euident both in the bookes of
<hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomie.</hi> For, first, their title to
their bondmen grew to their Lords by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of bargaine, and sale, which was indeed a
kind of seruitude. For, when the seuenth yeare, in
which the bondage was to determine, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
if then he resolued not to continue a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
for euer, he was compelled to leaue his wife
(if maried in his Lords house during bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his children, borne in that mariage
behinde him, though himselfe departed free, but
withall rewarded also. So that voluntarie bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
is not onely <hi>de iure gentium</hi> (as the <hi>Romane</hi>
lawes import, by which a man might sell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>ad participandum precium)</hi> but also <hi>de iure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
positiuo.</hi> By which notwithstanding it doth
not appeare, that such a bondage was any dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
or disenablement in <hi>Iewish</hi> blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> because in <hi>Exodus</hi> wee read of a


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6612:21"/>
prouision made for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> bond-woman,
whom her Lord might take in mariage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or bestow her vpon his son, if he so thought
good, but might not violate her chastitie, as if hee
had <hi>ius in corpus.</hi> But the condition of an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of <hi>London</hi> resembleth the condition of no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
estate in either of the lawes, <hi>Diuine</hi> or <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;</hi>
For he directly contracteth with his Master to
learne his mysterie, or Art of honest liuing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath his Master (who therefore is but a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
&amp; not a Lord) <hi>Despoticu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imperium</hi> ouer his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentise
(that is, such a power as a Lord hath ouer
slaue) but <hi>quasi curaturam,</hi> or a <hi>Guardianship,</hi> and is
in very truth a meere <hi>Discipliner,</hi> or Teacher, with
authority of vsing moderate correction as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not as a Tyrant, or otherwise. Immoderate
correction whosoeuer doth vse, is (by a gracious
statute of the fifth of Queene <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> subiect to
be punished with the losse of the Apprentise, by
absolutely taking him away.</p>
               <p>6 Which things, so often as I deeply ponder, I
cannot but hold it as loose, and as wandring a
conceit, and as vnciuill a proposition in ciuill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as any: <hi>That Apprentiship should be imagined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to extinguish, or to extenuate the right of natiue
Gentrie, or to disable any worthy, or fit person to acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6612:22"/>
Armories.</hi> For how can it in Gods name
worke that effect, vnlesse it be criminall to be an
Apprentise? Because no man loseth his right to
beare Armes, or to write Gentleman, vnlesse hee
be attainted in Law for such a cause, the conuic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof doth immediately procure corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in blood, which as in this case no man yet
hath dreamed of.</p>
               <p>Againe, when by the old common Law of
<hi>England</hi> there are onely two sorts of bondmen,
that is to say, <hi>villaines in grosse,</hi> and <hi>villaines regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
to a Mannour,</hi> and it is most certaine, that our
<hi>Apprentise,</hi> or Schollar in Citie-mysteries, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one nor other of them, what ignorance then,
or offence was mother at first of this, not para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
but palpable absurditie, that <hi>Apprentiship ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisheth
Gentry,</hi> or that Apprentises are as with
vs a kind of bondmen?</p>

               <head>The third Part.</head>
               <p>1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough in the premisses wee
seeme to our selues, to haue
said enough for establishing
our <hi>Negation</hi> in this importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
question, that is to say, <hi>That
Apprentiship is not a kinde of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi>
consequently, that it cannot worke any such
effects as is before supposed, yet to leaue no tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
curiositie vnsatisfied, wee will set before vs,
as in a table, the whole condition of an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
Meaning chiefly such an <hi>Apprentise</hi> as being
the son of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> is bound to a Master, who
exerciseth the worthier Arts of Citizens, as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
by sea, Assurers, Whole-sale-men, &amp; some
such few others which may more specially stand
in the first classe of the most generous mysteries,
as those in which the wit or minde hath a farre
greater part then bodily labour.</p>
               <p>2 Such an Apprentise therefore when first he
comes to his Master is commonly but of those
yeares which are euery where subiect to correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
His ordinarie seruices these. Hee goes bare-headed,
stands bare-headed, waytes bare-headed,


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6612:23"/>
before his Master and Mistresse, and, while as yet
he is the yongest <hi>Apprentise,</hi> hee doth perhaps (for
discipline sake) make old leather ouer-night
shine with blacking for the morning, brusheth a
garment, runs of errands, keeps silence till he haue
leaue to speake, followes his Master, or vshereth
his <hi>Mistresse,</hi> and sometime my young <hi>Mistresses</hi>
their daughters (among whom some one, or
other of them doth not rarely proue the <hi>Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises</hi>
wife) walkes not farre out but with permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and now, and then (as offences happen) he
may chance to be terribly chidden, or menaced,
or (which sometime must be) worthily correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
though all this but onely <hi>in ordine,</hi> and in the
way to <hi>Mastership,</hi> or to the estate of a Citizen,
which last worst part of this <hi>Apprentises</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
continues peraduenture for a yeare, or two,
and while hee is commonly but at the age of a
boy, or at the most but of a lad, or stripling. And,
take things at the very worst, hee doth nothing as
an <hi>Apprentise</hi> vnder his Master, which, when
himselfe comes to be a Master his <hi>Apprentises</hi> shal
not doe, or suffer vnder him. Such or the like is the
bitterest part of an <hi>Apprentises</hi> happy estate in this
world, being honestly prouided, at his <hi>Masters</hi>
charge of all things necessarie, and decent. The


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6612:24"/>
                  <hi>Master</hi> in the meane-while seruing his <hi>Apprentises</hi>
turne with instruction, and vniuersall conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or moulding of him to his Art, as the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentise</hi>
serues his <hi>Masters</hi> turne with obedience,
faith, and industrie.</p>
               <p>3 Here haue we a representation of an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentises</hi>
being, or rather the well-being of a child
vnder his father, who hath right of correction.
Vpon view whereof we demand, why it should
be supposed <hi>That Apprentiship extinguisheth Gentry?</hi>
For if an Apprentise in <hi>London</hi> (since to haue Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentises
is a power not deriued to corporations
out of prerogatiue, and royall priuiledge, but out
of common Law) bee in their conceipts a kinde
of bondman, it must either be, <hi>ratione generis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequij,</hi>
or <hi>ratione temporis adiecti,</hi> or <hi>contractus,</hi> or
<hi>conditionis,</hi> or for all together; a fifth cause being
hard to be either assigned, or imagined.</p>
               <p>For the first point (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is in regard of the kind
of seruice) that is but an effect of the contract, or
bargaine, and consequently depends thereon, or
participates in nature with it; which not impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any kind of bondage, neither can the seruice
it selfe, due by that agreement, bee the seruice of a
bondman. So that as on the one side wee grant,
that Apprentises, as Apprentises, doe some things,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6612:24"/>
which Gentlemen would not doe, that liued <hi>sui
iuris,</hi> specially vpon a necessity to obey, yet on the
other side we constantly deny, that they doe any
of them, either as seruile, or as seruilely, but <hi>propter
finem nobilem,</hi> that is, to learne an honest mysterie
to enable them for the seruice of God and their
Countrey, in the station, place, or calling of a
Citizen.</p>
               <p>For the second (which is in respect of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time (as of seuen yeeres at least) added and
limited in the contract, that is meerely but a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of the agreement, and <hi>per consequens</hi>
cannot alter the substance of the question. For if
Apprentises are not a kind of bondmen, abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the time which they are bound to serue,
the addition of time, addeth nothing to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the contract, to make it seruile.</p>
               <p>For the third (which is in regard of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
as it raiseth a relation, or the titles betweene
two, of Master, and seruant) if the very act of
binding to performance, be a sufficient reason to
make Apprentises a kinde of bondmen, and so to
disenable them to Gentry, either deriuatiue, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitiue,
the Masters themselues are also a kinde
of bondmen, because, <hi>suo genere</hi> they aswell are
bound as the Apprentises.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:6612:25"/>
For the fourth (which is in respect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
either vocally exprest, or vertually implide
in the contract) there is in it no proofe of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
but the contrarie. For in that the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is mutuall, it proues the Apprentise free as from
bondage, though (for the <hi>Apprentises</hi> owne good)
not free from subiection to discipline. Because
onely free men can make contracts, and challenge
the benefit of them. The verbe, not, <hi>seruire,</hi> but
the verbe, <hi>deseruire</hi> (which is of farre lesse weight)
comprised in the instrument, or Indenture, and
containing the whole force of the obligation,
hath onely in that place the sense of <hi>obsequi, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi>
to obey, and doe as an <hi>Apprentise,</hi> and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ancient sense, which it had among
the <hi>Romanes.</hi> This ought not to seeme a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.
For the word <hi>dominari,</hi> to which <hi>seruire</hi>
is a relatiue, and the word <hi>dominus,</hi> haue in tract of
time beene so softened, and familiarised, as they
are growne to be words of singular humanity.
And what so common among the noble as to
professe to serue? But the relation constituted in
this case, is peculiar, and proper, the odious word
<hi>dominus</hi> is not there at all, nor <hi>seruus,</hi> no nor <hi>famu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi>
the relation constituted is directly named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Master, and Apprentise: a cleare case that


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6612:25"/>
all iniuries to blood, and nature, are of purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided
in those conuentions; and <hi>conuentiones</hi> they
are called in the interchangeably sealed instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it selfe. So cleare a case, that in the Oath
which all freemen make in the Chamber of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
at their first admission, this clause among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, is sworne vnto by them, That they shall
take <hi>None</hi> Apprentise, but if he be <hi>Free borne,</hi> that
is to say, no <hi>Bondmans</hi> sonne: which are the very
words of the oath. Thus carefully open was the
eye of institution in this noble point of the Cities
policy, to preuent that no staine, no blemish, nor
indignitie should wrong the splendor thereof.
A thing which could not but follow ineuitably,
if they who prouided against admission of <hi>bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
issue, into the estate of apprentiship, should
themselues by making apprentises, make bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
or should in any sort embase their blood,
whose Masters they were to be, as to the purpose
of comming to bee Citizens in time. They neuer
meant to make any man bond, who would haue
none but the sonnes of free-borne persons bound
apprentises. It shall be wilfull ignorance or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
from hence forth to maintaine the contrary.</p>
               <p>4. A most memorable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in Scripture to the
purpose of the present question is that of <hi>Iacob</hi> and


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6612:26"/>
                  <hi>Laban</hi> in the nine and twentieth Chapter of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,</hi>
where the time <hi>(seuen yeares)</hi> yea, &amp; the very
word <hi>(seruire)</hi> are plaine in that contract which
was made betweene the vncle, and the nephew:
yet who did euer say that <hi>Iacob</hi> was for this a kind
of bondman? The reason why he was not, riseth
from consideration of the finall cause, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the contract, which is recorded to haue
beene honorable; the obtaining of a worthy wife,
and of an estate to maintaine her with. Neither,
when he was no longer defrauded of <hi>Rahel</hi> then
seuen daies after his first seuen yeares, and when
in the fruition of <hi>Rahel</hi> he serued also other seuen
yeares, was he a kind of bondman, by as it were a
relapse, or as by a cessation of expecting his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which he enioyed in enioying her. Out of
which it followeth, that as <hi>Iacob</hi> was no kind of
bondman though he serued, and serued out all
his time twice ouer, so neither are Apprentises.
And from this place of the Bible it is vnanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablie
proued that bodily seruice, is a laudable
meanes to atchieue any good, or honorable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
a meanes truly worthy of a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>5 Hereunto we finally adde, and repeat, that as
an Apprentise tyes himselfe to his Master in the
word <hi>deseruire,</hi> that is, <hi>to obey,</hi> and doe, restrictiuely


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6612:26"/>
to the ancient reason, and traditionall discipline
of Apprentiship in <hi>London,</hi> so the Master tyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to his Apprentise in the word <hi>docere,</hi> in lieu
of his honest seruice, to teach him his Art to the
vtmost. Which Masters part is growne to such
estimation as that Apprentises now come com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
like wines with portions to their Masters.
If then Apprentiship be a kinde of seruitude, it is
either a pleasing bondage, or a strange madnesse
to purchase it with money.</p>
               <p>6 An Apprentise therefore, as an Apprentise,
being neither <hi>ratione obsequij, temporis, contractus,</hi>
nor <hi>conditionis</hi> in any kinde a bondman, is in no
respect a bondman: and hath therefore no more
lost his title, and right to <hi>Gentrie,</hi> then hee hath
done to any goods, chattels, lands, royalties, or
any thing else, which, if hee had neuer beene an
Apprentise, either had, might, or ought to haue
come vnto him. Nay, much lesse can Gentry bee
lost in this case, then right to lands, and goods,
how much more inherent the rights of blood are
then the rights of fortune. For, according to the
law-rule, <hi>iura sanguinum nullo iure ciuili dirimi pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt;</hi>
whereas those other may be dissolued. And,
that <hi>Gentry</hi> is a right of blood may appeare by
this, that no man can truely alienate the same, or


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6612:27"/>
vest another in it, though legally he may, in case of
Adoption, which is but an humane inuention in
imitation of nature, and therefore, <hi>in rei veritate,</hi>
no alienation at all, but a fiction, or an acception
in law as if it were such. So that none can any
more passe away his gentrie, to make another a
Gentleman thereby, who was not a Gentleman
before, then he can passe away any habit, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the minde, as vertue, or learning, to make
another honest, or learned, who was vnlearned,
or dishonest before. For Gentry is a quality of
blood, or name, as vertue, and learning are of the
minde. Vpon which reason that rule of law is
grounded, which teacheth vs, that <hi>annulus signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius
ornamenti appellatione non continetur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7 To all this if it bee replied: That Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship
is a kind of bondage, for that if an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
abandon his Masters seruice; his Master may
both fetch him backe, as Lord for the time ouer
his seruants body, and compell him also to liue
vnder obedience. We answer thus. That such a
power ouer the bodie of an Apprentise is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to constitute a bondman, though the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of the Apprentise belongs to the Master,
Gods partin him, and the Commonweales being
first deducted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:6612:27"/>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> held, that onely the <hi>Grecians</hi> were free,
and all the barbarous, that is to say, all not <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
were bond. Some among vs seeme <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totelians</hi>
in this point, who as he gloriously ouer-valued
his Country-men, so these ouer-value their
paragon-Gentry, and repute none worthie of
Armes, and Honor but themselues, we supposing
on their behalfe, that they are indeed not vaine-pretenders
onely, but true descendents from the
most vnquestionable noble races, howsoeuer
troubled perhaps with some little of the spirit of
vanitie, and of too too much scorne of others. But
as the <hi>Italians</hi> in our time, notwithstanding they
thinke meanely of all who are not <hi>Italians,</hi> calling
them (in <hi>Aristotles</hi> humor) <hi>Tramontani,</hi> and in that
word implying them to be barbarous, doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an error, aswell as that great Philosopher, so
those Gentlemen (how eminently noble soeuer)
will be likewise found to liue in errour, for that
others also may bee truely Gentlemen, for any
thing which as yet is spoken in the former So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisme:
<hi>videlicet; The Master hath power ouer his
Apprentises bodie:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Apprentises are a kinde of
bondmen.</hi> Because if such a power bee enough to
constitute a bondman, wee will say nothing of
those free-borne persons being in minoritie,


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6612:28"/>
whose bodies their <hi>Guardians,</hi> may not onely by a
right in law, fetch backe after escape, or flight,
but giue away also in mariage. Nay, if for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Apprentises, borne Gentlemen, shall bee
thought to haue forfeited their <hi>Gentry,</hi> in what
estate are all the sonnes, and children of good
houses in <hi>England,</hi> whose bodies their parents by
a right of nature, may fetch back after flight, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their pleasure, or displeasure vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen
to disinherison? Nay, in what case are souldiers
(to whom most properly, and most immediately
the Honor of Armes doth belong) who for
withdrawing themselues from their banner, or
Captaine without leaue, may not only be forced
backe to serue, but (according to the vsuall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of warre) may be martiall Law bee han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vp, or shot at the next tree, or wheresoeuer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of breath at once, and of braue reputation
together? So absurd it is to dispute, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of a Master, by the title of a contract ouer the
body of an Apprentise, in case of discipline, doth
conuince a seruilitie of condition in the sufferer.
For if the right to exercise corporall coerction
should absolutely constitute a state of bondage in
the subiect, the iniurie of that vntrue assertion
would reach to persons of farre higher marke


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6612:28"/>
then City-prentises, as is most plainely proued.
And therefore they must alledge somewhat else
besides subiection of bodie to draw the estate of
Apprentiship into that degree of reproach, which
as they cannot doe, wee hauing preuented those
obiections, so must they leaue it cleare from taint,
or scandall.</p>
               <p>8 We lay it downe therefore out of all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedences
for a cleare conclusion: That Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentises
are so farre from being a kinde of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as that in our Common-weale they then
first begin <hi>habere caput,</hi> and to be <hi>aliqui:</hi> to bee of
account, and some bodie. For Apprentiship in
<hi>London</hi> is a degree, or order of good regular sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
out of whose as it were Nouiceships, or
Colledges, Citizens are supplied. Wee call them
Colledges according to the old <hi>Romane</hi> Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase,
or fellowships of men, for so indeed they
are, comprehended within seuerall corporations,
or bodies of free persons, intended to bee conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
for commerce, according to conscience,
and iustice, and named <hi>Companies,</hi> each of them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally
bearing the title of their seuerall worthy
Monopolies, as Drapers, Salters, Clothworkers,
and so forth. Wee say as before, that <hi>Apprentises</hi>
in the reputation of our Commonweale, when


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6612:29"/>
first they come to bee <hi>Apprentises</hi> then first begin
to be some bodie, and that Apprentiship is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
to which out of youth, and yong men, who
haue no vocation in the world, they are aduanced
and that out of Apprentises, by other ascents or
steps, as <hi>donari ciuitate,</hi> to come to bee free of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
or Citizens, from thence to be of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
Liuerie, the gouernours of Companies, as
<hi>Wardens,</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> and gouernors in the City,
as Common-counsel-men, Aldermens-deputies,
Sheriffes, and Aldermen; and lastly the principall
gouernour, or head of the Citie, the Lord Maior;
yea sometimes also Counsellors of Estate to the
Prince (whereof Master <hi>Stowe</hi> hath examples) are
very orderly elected; and the whole policie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
after as excellent a forme as most at this day
vnder heauen.</p>
               <p>9 True it is, that Apprentiship, as it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
so is it the lowest degree, or classe of men in
<hi>London.</hi> Lowest wee say, that it may come to the
highest, according to that of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and of
common sense, that those buildings rise highest,
and stand fasteth, whose foundations are deepest.
And as Apprentipish is the first in order, &amp; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in dignity, so can that be no title to embase the
vocation, because there must be a first in all things.

coates of seruing men at <hi>Serieants</hi>
Feasts. An obiect, far more ridiculous among the
new-shapes of our time (enemie of rigour, and
discipline) then that of <hi>Apprentises.</hi> At which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
signes, and distinctiue notes among Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
though younglings, and friuolous nouices,
may somewhat wonder, till the cause be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
yet is the thing it selfe so farre in it selfe from
deseruing contempt, as that they who should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it, would themselues bee laughed at. For the
late Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in the preface of his third booke
of <hi>Reports,</hi> hath affirmed for the dignitie of the
word <hi>Apprentise,</hi> that an <hi>Apprentise</hi> at Law is a
double reader, whose degree is next to that of a
Serieant at Law, who is only inferiour to a Iudge,
and to no other degree of Lawyers.</p>

10 Here now let me be bold to say, that <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentises</hi>
seeme to haue drunke and sacrificed too
deepely to their new Goddesse, Saint <hi>Fashion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> An
Idoll which was alwayes noted fatall to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
As at the periods, or vniuersall concussions
of Empire in our portion of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> may
in old Writers bee obserued. This they doe not
without wrong in our opinions to the honestie
of their degree, at leastwise in so farre abandoning
their proper ornament, the <hi>Cap</hi> (anciently a note
of libertie among the <hi>Romans)</hi> as not to haue one
day at least in the yeare, wherein to celebrate the
feast of their <hi>Apprentiship</hi> in the peculiar garbe
thereof, which they should doe well and wisely
to frequent for downe-bearing of contumelie,
and scorne, by making profession in this wise,
that they glorie in the ensignes of their honest
calling.</p>
               <p>11 For reuocation of which into vse though
wee see no manner of hope, yet are those late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
of the Citie who laboured to reduce Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship
to practise this laudable point of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
conformitie, not the lesse to bee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
and it were to be wished perhaps, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of scattering Libels, and of discouering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to tumult, Apprentises had rather sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6612:30"/>
their vnderstandings, and resigned their
wills in this particular to their louing superiours,
making humble, and wise obedience the glorie of
their persons, much rather then apparell in
the fashion. For they who are not ashamed of
their profession, ought not to be ashamed of the
ensignes, and tokens of their profession, or degree.
They indeed are out of fashion who are not in
that fashion which is proper to their qualitie. The
flat round <hi>Cap,</hi> in it selfe considered as a Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall
figure, is far more worthy than the square,
according to that ground in the <hi>Mathematicks, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurarum
spaerica est optima,</hi> and in <hi>Hieroglyphickes,</hi>
is a symbol of eternity, and perfection, &amp; a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the worlds rotunditie. But I will make
no encomium for caps. This I say, that as the
square capp is retained not onely in the <hi>Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
but also abroad among vs, as well by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
persons in high places, as by Iudges of the
Land, so the round capp being but a note in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
of Apprentises, and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> as it is
of <hi>Students, Barresters, Benchers,</hi> and <hi>Readers,</hi> in
the Innes of Court, so the wearing thereof by
<hi>Londoners</hi> cannot be a reproach, but an ornament.
But <hi>communis error facit ius,</hi> and how freely soeuer
these thoughts come from me out of abundant


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6612:31"/>
loue to the preseruation of vertue in that most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
City, which ciuill discipline is ablest to
doe, yet as much pietie as it is to wish the best, so
great is the vanity to thinke to stoppe the generall
streame of predominant custome by priuate wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes.
<hi>Apprentises</hi> moreouer, and Citizens, because
they are alwaies conuersant in the light of action,
and concourse, and not shut vp in Colledges for
studies sake, may thinke by this contrary way the
more to honor their Citie, and to enioy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.</p>
               <p>12 Well may they in the meane time blush at
their temeritie, who by teaching that <hi>Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises</hi>
are called Apprentises, as if they were <hi>pares
emptitijs,</hi> doe dishonour and highly wrong the
excellent old policie of this land. For they (as much
as lyeth in the credit of their words) most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
discourage flourishing <hi>Industrie,</hi> who cast
such an aspersion vpon any ciuill profession, and
order of men (assembled to vphold a kingdome
by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce, according to Iustice) as the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of so hatefull a note as bondage. And if it
be temeritie to cast it vpon any renowned, or
other corporation vniustly, it is singular iniquitie
(let it not be called madnesse) to lay it vpon <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
which shines among all Cities within the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough thus I haue been the Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and Defender of the credit of
the City, yet desire I not to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.
For it is very far from my
thoughts, by this Apologie, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronisation,
to confound degrees in common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale,
so to set vp as it were a new <hi>Babylon</hi> of
mine owne. I am not ignorant therefore, that
Citizens, as Citizens, are not Gentlemen, but Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;
To hold otherwise were to take one order,
or degree of men out of the Realme, or like <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races</hi>
monster (a mans head, and a birds bodie) to
create a thing which had halfe one, and halfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and our lawes giue a proper name both
to the tenure, and person, calling the tenure of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
in Cities, <hi>Burgage,</hi> and their persons, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses,
among whom the more eminent of them
in <hi>London</hi> had of old not onely the honour of the
title of Citizens, or Burgesses, but of <hi>Barons</hi> also.</p>
               <p>2 The ordinarie Citizen therefore, is of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
beneath the meere Gentlemen, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
is among vs in the lowest degree, or
classe of Nobilitie in <hi>England.</hi> And all


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6612:33"/>
Citizens as Citizens, yea, the Lord Maior himselfe,
simply as a Citizen, is not a Gentleman, but
Burgenfis. As the greatest Princes, and Despots
that euer were, or euer shall be in the world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in their first naturall condition, are at most
but <hi>Ingenui,</hi> or free-borne, in which respect all are
equall, for <hi>omnes natura aequales,</hi> and their first ciuill
degree, or generall state, which either compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
all the orders of Nobilitie, or is capable of
them, is among vs the Gentleman. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
he who shall say, That this or that King, or
Emperour is a Gentleman, speakes rightly, and as
the thing is. For Gentleman is the title, about
which all other titles, as they concerne honor, and
conueigh no iurisdiction, are put as robes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.
This therefore is my meaning; That
some Citizens may be a Citizen, and yet truely a
Gentleman, as one, and the same man may in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral
respects be both a Lord and Tenant. Citizen
in regard of his encorporation in <hi>London,</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in regard of birth, or of Armories assigned
for encouragement of <hi>Industrie,</hi> to ennoble his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
riches and titles of honor, or worship, in that
City, whereof he is a qualified member. Neither
is the communication of rewards, which consist
of painted distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, composed according to the


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6612:33"/>
receiued rules of <hi>Heraldrie,</hi> iniurious to ancient
<hi>Gentrie</hi> any more then the promiscuous permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of wearing gold-rings on their fingers alike
to freed-men, as to freemen, granted by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the authentickes: the reason of gold-rings
among <hi>Romanes,</hi> and of Armories among vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same. Nor is it a new thing in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale,
that speciall Citizens, not borne to
armories, but the sonnes of yeomen, or not of
Gentlemen, should haue armes assigned them.
For there is perhaps scarce any record of Armes
granted in <hi>England</hi> more ancient then testimonies
in the Halles of <hi>London,</hi> that speciall Citizens haue
bin honourd with particular bearings. And these
are aduanced vpon the Lord Maiors day by the
speare-men of that companie of which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is a member, not all of them specially giuen
of old, but some vndoubtedly borne by right of
blood, as descendents of Gentlemen, but other
againe as vndoubtedly assigned for excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in City-Arts. Of which number there are
at this day not a few, whose <hi>seri nepotes</hi> whose
great-grand-childrens children are reputed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
the oldest and best families of their Shires, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any relation to <hi>London,</hi> which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
raised them. Hence it followes, that as an
Apprentise being a Gentleman-borne remaineth


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6612:34"/>
a Gentleman, which addition of splendor, and
title, as God blesseth his labours, so a worthy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
is capable of honor and Armes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his Apprentiship. And by this distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made betweene a Citizen meerely as a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
and of a Citizen, as hee may also be a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that obiection which some bring out of a
Statute enacted vnder one of our Kings, which
forbidding the disparagement offered by the
<hi>Guardian</hi> to marie the <hi>Ward</hi> borne gentle, to a
<hi>Burgensis,</hi> may easily bee salued and answered.
For in that Statute the word <hi>Burgensis</hi> is spoken
in the natiue, and more narrow sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that is of one who is simply <hi>Burgensis,</hi>
without any consideration of him as hee
may otherwise bee a Gentleman, Esquire, or
Knight, which in some places happens, as in the
famous corporation of <hi>Droit Wiche</hi> in <hi>Worcester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
But howsoeuer, cerainely <hi>Burgensis</hi> here
nothing concernes Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who by an
excellency of their calling had the honor in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
to beare the name of Barons, and were sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
so; and weighing that, the Citizen is a distinct
degree from <hi>Burgensis,</hi> and aboue it; and therfore
that law concernes them not. For the proofe
of their title to the appellation of Barons,
by way of Hexoche (as artists in eloquence call


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6612:34"/>
it) most famous is that place in the Histories of
<hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> where speaking of the Londoners
of his time, vnder King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, these
words are eminent in him: <hi>Londonienses quos
propter ciuitatis dignitatem, &amp; ciuium antiquitatem,
Barones consueuimus appellare.</hi> As for the distinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of a Citizen from a <hi>Burgensis,</hi> that appeares
in this, that the City of <hi>London</hi> doth not send Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses
to the Parliament, but Knights, or Citizens;
and the enumeration of the rankes is cleare in a
Statute of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, enacted the
fift yeare of his raigne, and the fourth Chapter of
the same, where they are, <hi>Count, Baron, Banneret,
Cheualier de Counte, Citizen de Citie, Burgeis de Burgh.</hi>
The Princes before that time, but specially the
Princes following (as the worthinesse of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
inuited) did ennoble them exceedingly, and
continue more and more so to doe. Yet, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Armes, and arguments of honor vpon Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
not borne Genlemen, reason requireth that
they should not haue coats of the fairest bearing
assigned to them, but such as either in Canton,
Chiefe, Border, or otherwise might carie
some testimonie, marke, or signe to shew the Art
by which they were aduanced, as Merchant-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers
to beare Anchors, Grocers Cloues,


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6612:35"/>
Clothworkers a Tezel, Merchantaylors a robe,
and so forth; which those Gentlemen ought in
honestie, and thankfulnesse to choose, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to accept; and rather striue to match the best in
goodnesse, and worth of spirit then in the silent
tokens of it. Posteritie thriuing, there may then
some change be also made in the coat for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Specially considering what pretty riddance
hath beene in our times made of surcharges in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
granted about the end of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
eight; what encroachments vpon old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
rights, by new ones, because their names
onely haue beene the same; and many other inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to blanch or beautifie newnesse. According
to which notion and dictamen, coats of Armes
haue beene deliuered from their originall defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
surfets, and surcharges, by their proper
Physitian, the prouinciall King of Armes; So Sir
<hi>Thomas Kitsons</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whose Chief, now sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
gold, was heretofore ouerladen with three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses,
and they with an Anchor (the badge or
argument of the originall) and two Lyons ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
argent; as at this houre is publikely extant to
be seene in <hi>Trinitie</hi> Hall at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whereunto
he was a benefactor: and besides that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
the coat armours of some of the Peeres of


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6612:35"/>
this land, and of others also, not a few: very many
more needing the like reliefe, or remedie. The
rule of proportion seemes diligently obserued in
antiquitie among vs, where the principall, and
most noble charges, and formes of Armories
were not appropriated but to analogicall compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies
of honourable qualitie.</p>
               <p>3 Such therefore being the nature of <hi>Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and such the condition of <hi>Citizens</hi> estate, as to
the purposes of honor, and armes, let <hi>Fathers</hi> who
are Gentleman put their children, who are not
rather inclining to Armes, or letters, to <hi>Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
that is to say, to the discipline, and Art of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
gaine, giuing them a title of being somewhat
in our Countrey. For it is a vocation simply ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and may proue a stay to posteritie, and giue
credit to their names, when licentious and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
eldest sonnes haue sold their birth-rights
away. For albeit many Citizens thriue not, but
breake, yet those fathers, or such who are in place
of Fathers, worke more probably, who put their
children, or Orphans into a certaine method of
life, then others who leaue them at large. And as
some riotous, foolish, or vnfortunate Citizens
miscarrie, so ten to one more yonger brethren in
the Country. And fathers, such of you are not gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6612:36"/>
put your children to be <hi>Apprentises,</hi> that so
as God may blesse their iust, true, and vertuous
industrie, they may found a new family, and both
raise themselues and theirs to the precious and
glittering title of Gentlemen bearing Armes law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
For which cause no Lord, nor Peere of
this Land, who may perchance owe his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
estate, and as well the completiue, as the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
greatnesse, or amplitude of meanes, to
such as haue beene Citizens of <hi>London;</hi> nor those
other, whose originalls were from cheualrie, and
martiall seruice (the most pure, and proper No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesse
of all, as to the purpose of bearing Armes)
and yet since haue beene mixt with Citie-races,
ought to thinke it the least disparagement to
owne their benefactors and ancestors, Citizens
of <hi>London.</hi> On the other part it will worthily
well become them, freely and thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
so honest originalls, and accession
to originalls, as all this Realme from thence is
filled with. Because among them the vertues of
commutatiue iustice, and of commendable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie
flourish, and, the sinewes of warre, and
peace, abundance of treasure, are stored vp, as
in the Chamber of the King.</p>
               <p>4 Which acknowledgment, besides that it is in


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6612:36"/>
the lawes of honor, an act of bounden duty, they
may the rather take it for a glorie, because our
Princes haue vouchsafed to be incorporated; as
members of seuerall Companies in the Citie,
comming thereby as it were vnder that banner.
Nor onely so, but <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth (whom all
of vs will easily confesse to haue well enough vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
what he did) is credibly said to haue
beene in person, at the election of <hi>Master</hi> &amp; <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
and himselfe to haue sitten openly among
them in a gowne of crimson veluet, Citie-fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with a Citizens hood of veluet on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>a la mode de Londres,</hi> vpon their solemne feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
in the common hall of his Company, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantailers.</hi>
Moreouer, his grand-childe, Queene
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> (no way inferior to her ancestor in high
pollicie) was free of <hi>Mercers.</hi> Lastlie (which is
more to our present purpose) our late dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
himselfe King <hi>Iames</hi> more learned then
they both (though learning hath beene a Royall
abilitie in our ancient Princes, &amp; so flourishing in
<hi>Sebert,</hi> King of <hi>East-England,</hi> that our venerable
countreyman BEDE, affirmes him to haue been,
<hi>per omnia doctissimus)</hi> encorporated himselfe into
one the most important society of this kingdome
<hi>Clothworkers,</hi> as men dealing in the principall and


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6612:37"/>
noblest <hi>Staplewares</hi> of all these Ilands; wooll, and
cloath.</p>
               <p>5 Nor let the names of Companies, because
they seeme not to sound honorably enough as
appellations of degrees in Gentry, and Nobility,
auert the mind from them as things ignoble and
vnworthy the dignity of generous dispositions,
a thing erroniously holden in <hi>Fernes Blazon</hi> of
<hi>Gentry.</hi> For all renowned Cities euer had in them
<hi>vrbana nobilitas,</hi> and yet their citizens could not
but bee distributed into orders, tribes, or titles of
professions, yea sometimes also in their games,
For the <hi>Circensian</hi> companies in <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones,</hi>
that is to say, companies, and denominated
from the seuerall colors of their seueral clothings,
<hi>White, blew, greene,</hi> and <hi>red,</hi> to which <hi>Domitian</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
two other, <hi>purple,</hi> and <hi>gold,</hi> were the speciall
delights and exercises of Prince &amp; people; which
grew to such excesse, no longer after then in <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi>
time, that <hi>Plinius secundus</hi> held it a matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his complaint, and censure, as in one of his
Epistles is extant, where he saith <hi>nunc panno fauent,
nunc pannum amant.</hi> Againe, such of the <hi>Gentry,</hi> who
liue not in the citie, and doe most of all eleuate
themselues with contempt of others in respect of
the Arts, and wayes of maintenance, were they

but incorporated vnder the true titles of their
meanes, in which we will not speake of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
eating vp of whole houses, townes, and
people, by a thousand wicked deuises proper to
the mysterie of depopulation (against whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
works so many statutes of this land haue
long time warred in vaine) the names of those ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie-brotherhoods,
or Companies would easilie
sound, in a most curious eare, full out as faire, and
well. <hi>Corne, Cattle, Butter, Cheese, Hay, Wood, Wooll,

all of them inseparable to Countrey-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales,
and without which they can no
more subsist then <hi>Drapers,</hi> as <hi>Drapers</hi> without
cloath, <hi>Glodsmiths,</hi> as <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> without Iewels, or
plate, and so forth. Neither doth it create any great
odds in this point touching honour betweene
parties in this dispute, that Gentlemen, by their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
as Bailiffes, Reeues, or the like, doe order
their affaires for their more ease, &amp; dignities. For
besides, that the wisest among them exercise that
superintendency in their owne persons, so herein
the worthy Citizen is no way behind, dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his businesses by Factors, Iourneymen, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
<hi>Apprentises,</hi> reseruing onely to himselfe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueruiew,
and controll all their doings. Citie-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesse

so apparent, that the Knights or Gentlemen
of <hi>Rome,</hi> professing Merchandise, and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them that way bent, had their Hall, or seat
of their Colledge, or companie vpon Mount <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitoline</hi>
it selfe, dedicated to their patron Deity, or
tutelarie God-head, <hi>Mercurie.</hi> Other encorporated
societies there also were, as Goldsmiths, and the
rest, who liued so far from being excluded out of
the power of common-weale, or from honors,
and signes of noblenesse, that they had right in
some cases euen to ouertop the Lords, and out of
their owne body to choose not only Consuls, but
euen Dictators also, their super-soueraigne &amp; most
absolute Magistrate before their Emperors times.
Yea so mighty were they growne in respect of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
and negatiue authoritie, that <hi>Clodius</hi> to be
reuenged vpon <hi>Cicero,</hi> left his owne rancke of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritians,
and Lords, and turned Commoner.</p>
               <p>6 To conclude, such Gentlemen are much
deceiued, which no sooner heare one named to
be of this, or that Societie, or Colledge of trade in
<hi>London,</hi> as of <hi>Grocers, Haberdashers, Fishmongers,</hi> or
of any other of the twelue principall <hi>Monopolies</hi>
(the Zodiacke of the citie, in whose Eclipticke

of the parties quality, as too too much beneath
their owne ranck, and order, without further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
<hi>when it often happens, that he who is titular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of this, or that Fraternity, neuer was bred vp in it,
nor vnderstands any more what it meanes then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest
Gentleman, their Masters themselues hauing been
Merchants, or of other profession of life diuerse from their
title, vnder which they are marshall'd,</hi> the law of the
citie imposing an absolute necessity that all who
are free of the city should cary the name of some
one, or other of their brotherhoods. Againe, what
doe the constellations of heauen shine the worse,
or the lesse, because they carrie the names of
<hi>Ramm,</hi> of a <hi>Water-bearer,</hi> of <hi>Fishes,</hi> and so forth?
Or how many the fewer are their seuerall lights
for that? Answerably to which I say, that if the
parties mind be adorn'd with the starre-lights of
vertue and honor, what basenesse is it for him to
bee marshall'd vnder any of the names compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
one, or other of the honest Arts of
worldly life?</p>
               <p>7 In disputing thus, let me not be thought
to set vp an enuious comparison betweene these
two worshipfull degrees, or qualificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of men.
That is very farre from me. For it must euer bee
granted, to the authority of general opinion foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6612:39"/>
vpon custome among vs, that the true Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-Esquire
<hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> is in his proper place
before the Citie-Esquire, which with the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
clause beforesaid of <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> holds also,
throughout the other degrees of the inferior No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesse
in <hi>England.</hi> I reason here, as reason bids, not
against the right, or dignities of persons either as
in parallell, or as in disparagement, but against the
vanity, and offences rising out of causelesse elatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and arrogance, and against their errours, who
not vnderstanding the things of their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
are indeed meere <hi>Meteoroscopers,</hi> and houer in
the clowdy region of admiration vpon rude, and
vnlearned fansies, for which cause as minds nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to be healed, so would I sincerely that they
were healed. Such are theirs, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
think the Companies, or Monopolies of the
citie more worthy of their acknowledgement, if
where now they are denominated of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ware, or craft, they were named of <hi>Eagles,
Vultures, Lions, Beares, Panthers, Tygers,</hi> or so forth,
as the seuerall orders of the Noble in <hi>Mexico</hi> (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
                  <hi>Iosephus Acosta</hi> writes) vnder their Emperor: yet
much better, because more truly, these fellowships
of <hi>London</hi> cary the names of men as they haue vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
in professions, which onely men can exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6612:39"/>
Or they would peraduenture thinke more
noblie of them, if those societies were denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
of <hi>Eyes, eares, hands, feet,</hi> or of other
members, as <hi>Philostratus,</hi> in the life of that impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
<hi>Apollonius Tianaeus,</hi> saith, the officers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of a Philosophical King in <hi>India</hi> were.
But as those were called of their King his <hi>eyes,
eares,</hi> and so forth, so haue these mysteries some
one, or other professor in each among them, from
the higher trade to the lowest eminently designed
out with the addition of King, as the Kings Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
the Kings Draper, and so forth. Againe, how
much more worthy the whole is then the parts,
because the parts are in the whole, so by that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is more honourable to be marshall'd as a
man among societies of ciuill men, then to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisht
by allusions to particular members. At
leastwise, those singular Gentlemen might certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their most contempt of the City reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that
of <hi>Plato, Nemo Rex non ex seruis, nemo non seruus ex
Regibus;</hi> and that also rare and reall worth may
bee in the persons of Citizens themselues, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Terentius</hi> (Consul of old <hi>Rome,</hi> with that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Paulus Aemilius)</hi> was free of the Butchers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and our <hi>Walworth</hi> Lord Maior of old <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
was free of the Fishmongers. And they were


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6612:40"/>
not onely the Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who had voice in election of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
yearly Magistrates, but euen handycrafts-men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Artificers, as is most manifest by that place of
<hi>Salust</hi> in his <hi>Iugurthine</hi> warre, where <hi>Marius</hi> was
chosen Consul, by the speciall affection of that sort
of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, who (saith he) <hi>sua necessaria
post illius honorem ducebant,</hi> preferred his election
by their voices, before the trades by which they
earnd their liuings. Finally, they may reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that
in the posterity of Citizens many right noble, and
worthy Gentlemen are often found, and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the vniuersall mixture with Citie-races tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Kingdom, it may not be denyed that true
nobless shineth often very bright among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For
they are Companies of free Citizens, in which, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
Maiesty it selfe is incorporated, making
them at once to be sacred as it were, and certainly
magnificent. For euen as where the Sun is, there is
no darknes, so where soueraign Princes are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed
parties, there is no basenes. And as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
Medicine purgeth vilest metals, turning
all to gold, so the operation of Princes intention
to ennoble Societies with his personall presence,
transmetalls the subiect, and clearly takes away all
ignobilitie. Which things as they are most true in


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6612:40"/>
                  <hi>London,</hi> so, for that, the Emperour <hi>Constantinus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
(if our ancient <hi>Fitz Stephan</hi> reports the right)
<hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> sonne of king <hi>Henry</hi> the
second, and that braue great Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the
first, and whosoeuer else, were borne in the Citie,
they giue to it the glory of Armes: and <hi>Ieffrey
Chaucer,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> knight, with others
borne in <hi>London,</hi> communicate thereunto the
glorie of wits and letters. To nourish vp both
which most excellent titles to reall nobilitie in the
Citie, the Artillery-yard, and <hi>Gressam</hi> Colledge
were instituted.</p>
               <p>8 Thus this question of Honor, and Armes,
vndertaken at the instance of interessed parties,
but more for loue to that great Citie, and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
being by Gods assistance, and, as we hope,
sufficiently discussed, the end of all is this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the loue of humane praise, and of outward
