            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Were he as many Kings as he has Subjects to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,
I'de not endure 't. Come, the plaine truth is, I
don't like it, so I don't, nor should I spare him had he
been a King of Gold: What? should I stood like a fool
to be his shooing-horne to draw a paire of hornes upon
my head, and turn Pander to his lickerish kisses, while he
wipes my mouth with a cod-piece Knighthood? I'le
hang first. Let him bestow his honour with a vengeance
upon those that hold it a good pen'worth on such
tearms: For my part I like it not. Have I liv'd these
thrice thirty years, to be caught with Chaffe? <hi>Kettreena</hi>
must be a Lady forsooth, to be more capable of his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65686:4"/>
princely lust. And <hi>Pertenax</hi> must be dubb'd, and gain
the glorious attribute of a right worshipfull Cuckold.
Come, these are baits to catch young birds with, and
honourable mists to blind ambitious fools with. His
politique Majesty has taken a wrong Sow by th'eare.
I'm none of those that for a smile can play the royall
Pander, nor like a temporizing Wittold can help my
wanton Prince into the Saddle, or hold his Stirrop. Did
I not mark the lustfull progresse of his lascivious glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
And how his ugly rowling eyes shot fire-brands at
<hi>Kettreena's</hi> face? How every word was garnish'd with
a wanton smile, and still presented to <hi>Kettreena's</hi> eare!
His antick gestures, croutches, congies, cringes, comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and all directed to <hi>Kettreena!</hi> While she like a
wel-disciplin'd Curtezan could counterfeit a modesty,

               <p>A prety Reck'ning!</p>
               <p>As I am a virtuous 'Pothecary, I know not how to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.
Here's all that's comming to me, and that's not to
be expected till Christmas, if paid then. Gentlemen, I
am in a very skirvy case. <hi>Artesio</hi> has turn'd me out of
his service, and I must break. What shall I doe? I must
play the good Fellow abroad, and then my Wife plaies
the Devill at home. How can the one be maintain'd?
or the other endured? I have pawn'd already her
Tuftaffaty Peticote and all her Child-bed linnen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65686:13"/>
two tiffiny Aprons, and her bearing-cloth, for
which I have had already two curtame Lectures, and a
black and blue eye. But stay! my satten Dublet had
yet a good glosse, and her silk mohaire Petticote and
Wastcote will make a good show in a Country Church.
Nay, my credit will yet passe in <hi>Bucklers berry</hi> for
five pounds worth of Commodity, which with the help
of a gold Night-cap, a few conjuring words and a large
conscience will go far, and set me up in a Market towne,
where I may passe for a <hi>Padua</hi> Doctor: 'Tis but Italia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
my name, garb, language, and habit, and then
<hi>Seignior Quackquinto</hi> may practice as safely, kill as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
and innocently as <hi>Artesio</hi> himselfe, or any
Doctor in the King's Dominions. And when my Name
is once but rais'd upon the wings of popularity, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort will hold it disparagement to their judgments
not to magnifie <hi>Quackquinto,</hi> and rather not be sick at
all, then to be counsell'd by <hi>Quackquinto;</hi> Every disease
will call upon <hi>Quackquinto.</hi> If any foolish Lord be sick
of a Plurisie of Gold, who must be sent for but the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Doctor, <hi>Seignior Quackquinto?</hi> If any love-sick
Lady would take a Pill to purge mellancholly, who must
be sought to but the Italian Doctor, <hi>Seignior Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinto?</hi>
And then so honourable will the Name of the
Italian Doctor be, that he's not fashionably sick that
will not advise with <hi>Seignior Quackquinto.</hi> But the way
to proceed is not to stay here.</p>

When she first heard of your coming, her Ladiship was

and pawn'd all my child-bed linnen, and to day my Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faty
petticoat, and my best purld Gorget, and to make
up the matter, he hath plaid such pranks that the Doctor

               <p>Discipline him? If I counsell him, he stands
like an Asse and casts up his ugly gray eyes: If I ring
him a peal he slights me with his silence, and that which
vexes me to the heart, stands and whistles. But if I live
till to morrow, for I know he'l come in drunk to night,
I'le whistle him, y'faith I wil; I'le make him know what
'tis to whistle a Wife, the longest howre he has to live,
y'faith I will.</p>

               <p>As I live and hope to be a Doctor, 'twas for
nothing in the universall world but for killing a rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

               <p>That was a poor thing to turn away an old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quack.</speaker>
               <p>'Twas nothing else as I am virtuous. Nay
more, He was a slow Pay-master too, and took Phisick
upon the Ticket. Ah Madam, had he conniv'd a little,
I had clearly gain'd a hundred Marks by his death.</p>

               <p>His younger Brother, a fine Gentleman, laid
me a hundred Marks he would live till our Lady-day.
Alas! I did no more for a considerable summe then my
Doctor has done a hundred times for nothing; I'm sure
I have been a gainfull Servant to him, and that he knows
right well. But the truth is, he has no more conscience
with him then the dog has: How often have I left out
the chief Ingredient out of his Receits to prolong the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65686:15"/>
Cure for his profit? How often dropt in a Dram of a
malignant quality into his Dose to make a Cure for
his gain! Nay, as I am an honest man, out of my rank
affection to him, at my owne cost and charges kept a
brace of hot Creatures in Ordinary to help yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to their Diseases for his sweet sake: Had I been a
knave, his Daughters had wanted many a satten Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote.
And thus my honest dealing is requited: But 'tis
no matter, There's more waies to the wood then one.
I have corruption enough in me to make a Country
Doctor. And 'tis no new thing to build up a new Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
upon the ruines of an old broken 'Pothecary.</p>

to your eye, that Doubt shall find no ground to
question, and Unbelief shall blush at her own infidelity.
And first,</p>
            <p>Here is a Soveraigne Balsome, that in the space of one
minute and three quarters, shall cure the deepest wound
that dagger can inflict, whereof behold sufficient proofe.</p>
            <stage>Stabs himself.</stage>
            <p>Gentlemen, this wound which I have made, shall by
the vertue of this Balsome be as quickly cured.</p>
            <stage>Annoynts.</stage>
            <p>So, now the blood retyres unto his wonted veynes, I
feele the Orifice, which even just now had roome enough
to lodge my finger, now clos'd, and smoothe, and flesh
deliver'd from the sense of paine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is an excellent Antidote, which taken,
shall preserve the taker from the injury of poyson, hot or
cold. As for exampleâ€”</p>
            <l>This ugly Spider here contains the rankest of all venim.</l>
            <l>Now Gentlemen, I take my Antidote.</l>
            <l>And now my Spider.</l>
            <stage>Eates it.</stage>
            <l>Tis gone! Fight Dog, fight Beare. Hem!</l>
            <l>Poyson doe thy worst. Hah! Dost thou rejounce?</l>
            <l>Thy power's curb'd, and cannot work her end.</l>
            <l>Needs feare no Foe, that hath so true a friend.</l>
            <p>Thirdly, here's a soveraigne Restoritive which shall
correct the deadlyest poyson in the height of operation.
See ye this swelling Toad, whose poyson taken shall swell
ye till ye burst, And from the very Porch of Death this
rare Preservative shall soone redeeme ye. Gentlemen,
mark how I squeeze this mortall bit into this Boule.
Now Gallants, a Health to my Mistresse.</p>
            <stage>Drinks.</stage>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65686:28"/>Now pledge it that dare. Mark the operation, Hem!
Hem! Hem! Now it begins to work, O I am sick, my
bowels gripe, I sweat, I burne, I burstâ€”</p>
            <stage>Takes the Restorative.</stage>
            <l>O what a Julip breathes into my veynes!</l>
            <l>And how these strong Convulsions of my soule</l>
            <l>Begin to loosen! How the loathsome Qualmes</l>
            <l>Of my obstructed stomach turnes to ease</l>
            <l>And appetite! O soveraigne drop</l>
            <l>How, how hast thou restor'd my dying life</l>
            <l>With thy unvalu'd excellence, and lent</l>
            <l>My tongue new pow'r to call thee excellent!</l>
            <p>Now, my Masters, you that delight in Chimestry,
know also, my Master can shew you many rare Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
He sayes he can make the Philosophers Stone,
but saving his Reverence I think he lyes, else he'd be
hang'd ere he'd thus Quack for Testers.</p>
            <p>But this upon my knowledge: he can bring an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Resurrection, and Vivification to <hi>Mercury,</hi> which
being mortified into a thousand shapes, assumes againe
its owne Body, and returnes to its numericall selfe. He
can likewise from the Ashes of a Plant, revive the Plant,
and from its Cinders recall it to the Stalk and Leaves
againe. Lastly, by the vertue of a thing called Wit, he
can doe such wonders at Cribbidge, or New-cut, that
the experience thereof shall teach ye more wisdome in
an houre, then all the Volume of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> can
afford you in ten dayes: Wherein if you please the next
market day he shall give you a plenary satisfaction, if
you repaire hither with purses to be handled, and minds
to be instructed.</p>

               <p>Yes <hi>Madge,</hi> as sure as I live. <hi>Doll</hi> our Dairy-maid
gave some on't to <hi>Nick</hi> the Butlers boy, and within an

let her alone, but dogg'd her from corner to corner, and
would so tumble her and so touze her: And when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was by her would so gloit and cast sheeps eyes at
her, as past. She could goe no where but the boy would
make one. Sometimes he would bring her May-bushes,
sometimes mellow-Apples, sometimes a Busk-point,
sometimes a Silk-lace. And if she spake but a kind word
to him, Lord, he would so simper, and so jemper, and so
lick his lips, and so scratch his elboe, as 'twas admirable.</p>

               <p>I tell thee <hi>Madge,</hi> I saw it with my owne eyes,

               <p>Yes verily, I confesse I think he loves me dearly

            <sp>
               <speaker>Madge.</speaker>
               <p>Why? I'm sure I saw him kisse thee twenty

               <speaker>Madge.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I am not ashamed to name him,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cis.</speaker>

               <speaker>Madge.</speaker>
               <p>I care not, so he left it with no body but me;
yet in the way of honesty too (I tell ye but so:) Well,
no body knowes what I have endur'd for his sake; But
I may thank my modesty for't, and my Mother for that.
She gave my a Rule forsooth, once, which I ha' beshrew'd

            <sp>
               <speaker>Madge.</speaker>
               <p>She charg'd me, that when any sued for my

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65686:29"/>
and Noforsooth, which I ha'done so long,
that I have almost Noforsooth'd away all my fortunes.
But sirrah, (here's none but Thee and I) Ile tell thee.
This very day two moneths (well fare all good tokens)
<hi>Antony</hi> at the <hi>George</hi> would needs ha'me downe into
his Wine-celler, and gave me a Pint of Brown-bastard;
and being in a good humour, brake his minde to me,
And taking a glasse of Wine, wisht it might be his
poyson if he did not love me with all his heart.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cis.</speaker>

            <sp>

               <p>Every drop as I live; Nay more, wou'd may
nere store, if he offered not (Ile tell it to thee) to fetch
a Licence instantly, and marry me forthwith, if I'de
goe with him; But I, like a puppinos'd foole, followed
my Mothers directions, and cry'd Noforsooth, to
make him the more eager, which he taking in earnest,
flung away in a pet, and as I live, took me at my word,
and never spake kindly to me since: And this is the

               <p>Nay, Sirrah, See the luck on't; Had he but ask'd

scapes me, on my conscience: Sometimes, methinks I
see him twirling up his pretty little black beard: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
stroaking up his fore-top: sometimes singing that
heavenly tune of <hi>Walsingham</hi> to his Citterne: sometimes
crying Anon Anon Sir, and running up stairs: sometimes
Very welcome Gentlemen, Is all paid i'th'Rose? which
he fetches up with such a graceâ€”As indeed every thing
he does becomes him most sweetly. O how I could curse
this peevish tongue of mine for saying that last Nofor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth.
Ah! if he had askt me the Question but once
more, verly I had been to morrow two moneths gone:
But who can help it?</p>

               <p>That's but cold comfort <hi>Cis:</hi> I but my case
is thousand times worse then thine; Thou mayst see
him thou lovest every day, and dine together, and sup
together, and sleepe together under the same roofe; but
I a poore forsaken creature must waste my disconsolate
hours in thinking, &amp; in sighing, and in <hi>[Weeps]</hi> sobbing.
Insomuch that I han't eaten a bit of bread that has done

catcht my Lady fast by the <hi>â€”Ha, ha, ha, ha,</hi> middle; but
she lent him such a whirrit upon the eare, that all the

from your Highnesse, and a silver Cup was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Kettreena</hi> by a stranger, who after the delivery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
departed. Likewise I find that <hi>Pertenax</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in the nick, snatcht it from <hi>Kettreena's</hi> unwilling
hand, and in a passion retyr'd into a roome, not suffering
her to follow him, where he was found dead an houre
after.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Another Examinate faith, that he sent for a dramme
of Arsnick the night before, but for what purpose the
Examinate knoweth not.</p>
            <p>Another Examinate, being one of his fervants, saith,
that she harkning at the doore, did heare him say, that
he would put in a dose of Arsnick into the Cup for? <hi>Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treena,</hi>
which she saw him search in his pockets for; but
being suddenly call'd away by her Lady, stayed not to

               <p>Her Ladiships body is much out of order, and

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Art.</speaker>
               <p>She is likewise much troubled with inflamations,

swimming in the Braine, and giddinesse. Is she not apt

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Page.</speaker>
               <p>O Sir, when the Fit takes her, she speaks never a
word of sense: she talks of nothing but Bishops, and
Petitions, and I can't tell what, and her tongue runs so
wildly, and indeed I think she is scarce sensible some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of her own sicknesse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Art.</speaker>
               <p>That proceeds altogether from the rude conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of loose humors. I find by her water, she is much
troubled with wind and choller, which occasions a great
and frequent heart-burning: Is she not much subject to
unaccustomed sadnesse at times?</p>

               <speaker>Art.</speaker>
               <p>I find she has a great imbeeility in her spirits
naturall, which causes in her a generall faintnesse, and
now and then enclined to the <hi>Cardiaca Passio.</hi> Is she not
often possest with sudden frights, and feares, and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Art.</speaker>
               <p>I find likewise, that she is much troubled with
the Spleene, which occasions stupidity, melancholy,
and at times distractions? Is she not often in a brown

               <p>Well, I feare we must be forc'd to draw some
blood from her, which as the case stands now with her,
I should be loth to doe. There is some bad blood in her
veynes; but if a veyne be once opened, the best blood in
her body may chance to passe too, which she can hardly
spare, without palpable danger. Untill I see her, I can
prescribe little. To morrow I shall wait upon her Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and what I shall then find fitting, shall be carefully
administred. In the meane while, let her keep her head
warme, and be very careful of her Temples: Let her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
Salt and Usquebagh: Let her use Moderation in
her Exercises, wherein she might not be forc'd to lift
her armes too neare her head: And for the relieving of
her drooping spirits let her recreate her selfe now and
then with a game at Irish: Ler her forbeare Noddy, and
Chesse, as Games too serious. Farewell.</p>

must keep her chamber all day, and at night her
peevish Ladiship must be sick and goe to rest. Then at
Midnight <hi>Cis</hi> must be call'd to kil the Flea that keeps her
Ladiship from sleeping forsooth. Then <hi>Cis</hi> must slip on
her petticote to see if the Hall-doore be shut, then downe
againe to rate the dogs, then downe againe to fetch her
Ladiship some Beere. Then <hi>Cis</hi> must look under the
