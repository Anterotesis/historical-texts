            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Engliſh-Company Trading to the Eaſt-Indies, ERECTED In Purſuance of an Act of Parliament for Raiſing Two Millions, and for Settling the ſaid Trade.</head>
            <p>IT having been the undoubted Right af all the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> to Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> until reſtrained by Act of Parliament: Many Perſons carried on that Trade, without ſeeking any other or greater Priviledges than what they had in Common with their fellow Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Old Company did in <hi>May</hi> 1698, propoſe to the Houſe of Commons to lend 700000 <hi>l.</hi> on Condition they might be Settled by Act of Parliament excluſive of all others for 31 Years.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Houſe of Commons Impowered the Committee of <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> to receive <hi>Propoſals</hi> for ſettling the Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This gave the occaſion to ſeveral Merchants and others, to offer a Loan of Two Millions for the ſaid Trade for Ten Years, (Redeemable afterwards by Parliament upon Three Years Notice) into which, all Perſons who were willing to Subſcribe, were to be equally admitted.</p>
            <p>Which offer was received, and an Act of Parliament paſſed for Raiſing the ſaid Sum of Two Millions and ſettling the ſaid Trade; in which Act amongſt other things is contained,</p>

That all Perſons Natives and Foreigners, Bodies Politick and Corporate, might Subſcribe to the ſaid Loan; And His Majeſty was Empowered to Incorporate all the Subſcribers by the Name of the <hi>General Society, Entituled to the Advantages given by an Act of Parliament for Raiſing a Sum not exceeding Two Millions for the Service of the Crown of</hi> England.</item>
               <item>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 763.</note>2. His Majeſty was alſo Empowered to Incorporate all ſech of the Subſcribers as ſhould deſire the ſame, to be <hi>One Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> to Trade with a <hi>Joint Stock.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Throughout the whole Act, there is no Power given to Erect any other Company or Corporation, but the ſaid <hi>General Society</hi> and the ſaid <hi>One Company</hi> to Trade with a <hi>Joint Stock.</hi>

Thoſe that were not willing to come into the <hi>Joint Stock,</hi> had liberty to Trade ſeparately; but were to make their Entries with the Truſtees of the <hi>General Society,</hi> until <hi>a Company</hi> ſhould be Erected to Trade with a <hi>Joint Stock,</hi> and after the Erecting of <hi>ſuch Company,</hi> then with the Directors of the <hi>ſaid Company,</hi> and to be ſubject to the Regulations mentioned in the ſaid Act</item>

                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 777. <hi>Fol.</hi> 780.</note>4. Alſo a Duty of Five <hi>per Cent,</hi> on the whole Trade is Granted to His Majeſty, to be paid over to the <hi>General Society,</hi> till <hi>a Company</hi> ſhould be Erected to Trade with a <hi>Joint Stock,</hi> and after the Erecting of <hi>ſuch Company,</hi> then to the <hi>ſaid Company.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>By all which it evidently appears, there could by the ſaid Act be but <hi>One Company</hi> Erected to Trade with a <hi>Joint Stock,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Paſſing the ſaid Act, His Majeſty was pleaſed, before the Subſcription began, to ſign His Notice of the Old Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's Determination according to the Power reſerved in their Charters, and cauſed the ſaid Notice to be ſerved upon the Old Company, before Mr. <hi>John Dubois,</hi> the Old Company's Agent, ſubſcribed the 315000 <hi>l.</hi> which he did in his own Name only, and not until above One Million was under-written, whereby the Subſcribers were Intituled to the Trade.</p>
            <p>The Two Millions being ſubſcribed, His Majeſty, in purſuance of the ſaid Act, did Incorporate all the Subſcribers in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>General Society;</hi> and thoſe who deſired to unite in a Joint Stock, were likewife Incorporated by the Name of <hi>The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Company Trading to the Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which Conſidered, it is humbly conceived the Continuing the Old Company a <hi>Corporation,</hi> is contrary to the ſaid Act, for which the New Company have ſo lately advanced 166200 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas</hi> the ſaid Old Company in their Petition to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, did as an inducement to the Bill now depending, ſuggeſt, That unleſs they continued, a Corporation they could not Compel any of their Officers, Factors, or Agents, to render them any Accounts, or make them Returns of their Eſtates, and that they ſhould be diſabled from paying their Juſt Debts: And in the ſaid Bill it is declared, That ſeveral Hundred Perſons being Intereſted in the before-mentioned Subſcription of 315090 <hi>l.</hi> they cannot Manage the ſame, and the Benefit of Trade accruing thereby, but in a Corporation. It is Humbly Offered, That all the ſaid Ends may be attained without the ſaid Bill, for they may recover their Effects, pay their Debts by a Settlement upon Truſtees, and Manage the Subſcription of Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> either ſeparately, as ſeveral other Subſcribers do; or by coming into the Joynt Stock of the New Company, and Diſpoſe of their Dead Stock at a Reaſonable Value, as was Offer'd by the ſaid New Company in a late Treaty betwixt them.</p>
