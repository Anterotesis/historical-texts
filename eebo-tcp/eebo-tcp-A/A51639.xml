         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MUS RUSTICUS.</head>
            <p>THE Exportation of One Hundred and Thirty Thouſand Pounds in Gold, into the Gulf of <hi>Holland,</hi> in One Month and Eight Days laſt paſt, as appears by our Bills of Entry; with a fair Surmiſe, that a greater quantity hath been Claudeſtinely Ship'd off, as likewiſe a large quantity of Silver, being join'd to the difficulty, that the Woollen-Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers of this Kingdom, for a conſiderable time, laſt paſt, hath been under, in getting Silver for Gold, and that without ſome ſpeedy ſupply of Silver Coin in Shillings and Six-pences, this noble Commerce which Providence hath happily bleſs'd us with, muſt inevitably ſink; will be a fair Juſtification of this Rural Addreſs. When ſo violent a Draught is upon us in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold, we can expect no ſupply from Foreign Importation, nor will a total ſtop to the Exportation relief, when Silver and Gold is as well taken in at <hi>Cadiz</hi> as here, to ſupply the Occaſions of thoſe Trades which drain our Treaſure. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> preach'd down the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> the <hi>Silver-Smiths</hi> exerted their whole Strength to ſupport their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and as now left no Stone unturn'd to Maintain their Ground. Even reprinted Dr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s <hi>Republican Poſition,</hi> that Authority had no power in altering the value of our Silver. What (in great Submiſſion) I offer at, is an immediate Advance of our Silver Coin, and a Security to it when Coin'd. The Ounce of Silver which from <hi>Ozlwright</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King continued for many Hundred Years at Twenty-Pence; was advanced to Thirty-Pence in the Second Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th; it was advanced to Forty-Pence by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th; to Forty Five-Pence and Forty Eight-Pence in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th; and to Sixty-Pence by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. The Ground upon which theſe Advances were made, could be no other, then the keeping an Equality with Foreign Standards with whom we Traded. And by this Rule (which was ſtrenuouſly urg'd) at the laſt new Coinage of our Silver, our Standard ought to be advanced to Sixty Five-Pence, to equal the Rix-Dollars of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Crown piece of <hi>France.</hi> This being undeniable matter of Fact, his Majeſty's Proclamation in adjuſting this important Affair, in an Equality with Foreign Standards, and giving that Advantage to thoſe of his own Subjects, that brought Plate to be Coined into Shillings and Sixpences, it would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately advance a Stock of Silver Coin, and be a relief to Trade, allowing the advance to our Silver Coin now ſtanding, (which I take to be much leſs then reported by ſome) unto a limited time, that it might be new Stamp'd; which advantage being ſtrictly limited to his Majeſties Natural Born Subjects it could not be look'd upon with an ill Eye, altho' an eaſy Profit; by this expedient, according to our nice Polititians, we ſhall have as much for our Crown as it Weighs, and it will be ſome ſmall ſecurity againſt its being melted down. And as I have been here Labouring for this conveniency to Negotiate this noble Fabrick of ours. I am now to fix this Treaſure of our Silver Coin by an expedient which is much more Advantagious to our Woollen-Manufactury. And in order to this, I muſt beg leave to recite the Reſtrictions under which the Flourishing Trade of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was carried on. All Intereſt of Mony was ſtop'd by her Brother King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, which turn'd Drones into Bees. The Wear of Silks was ſtop'd by her Siſter Qneen <hi>Mary,</hi> by all Perſons under the degree of Quality, and if any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant wore any Silk, if the Maſter did not put her forth of her Service in Fourteen Days, or did retain her again, he forfeited One Hundred Pounds. By a Law made in the Fifth Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> no Foreign Fabrick could be ſold otherwiſe than for ready Mony. And in the Thirteen Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was Enacted, that every Perſon above the Age of Seven Years, ſhall wear upon the Sabbath and Holy-Day, a Knit Cap made of the Wool of this Kingdom, under the Penalty of Ten Groats for every Day not wearing it, except Maids, Ladies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What I now, in great Submiſſion, propoſe, is the Revival of this laſt Act, in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Name of Cap to Hat; in the making of which, we are now come to great Perfection, and there can be no more decent Diſtinction or becoming Dreſs to our Women. This Hat will be like the Stern of a Ship, guide all other Habits of the Body, and introduce the wear of the Fine-Flaxen-Linnens of <hi>Germany, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Lace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Natural Effects of our Woollen-Manufacture, and ſtop the wear of Muſlings; to purchaſe which, our Silver is now iſſued out, and what I farther propoſe, is, a ſtrict Injunction of the wear of the Woollen-Manufacture of this Kingdom by all Servants for their upper Garments, with a Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the Maſter if the ſaid Act was not complied with; as was the Caſe of Silk in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> In the moſt Flouriſhing Reigns of this Kingdom, as <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th, <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; we were under Sumptuary Laws and a total ſtop put to the Cotton Commodities of <hi>India</hi>; and Preſidents are ſafe rules to waik by. And as this Diſtinction will tend to the Encouragement of our own Products, and be a means to keep the Ballance of Trade upon our ſide, and ſecure our Silver Coin, it will likewiſe be an inducement to Virtue and Good Manners, and Servants will not think themſelves above their proper Imployments.</p>
