            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now me think I heare it asked by whome this bloody deed or rather moste cruell Massaker of Gods annointed, should haue been committed. Truly by no stranger nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner but euen by one of her maiesties owne natiue (but disloyall and moste vnnaturall subiect) the trueth wherof was as followeth. One Doctor <hi>Parrie</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Ciuil Law being (though beyond his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts) very deer vnto her maiestie, and wel liked of,
<pb facs="tcp:18505:3"/>
was by her grace sent ouer Seas in very waightie affaires, which he wel atchiuing: returned home and no doubt was bountefully rewarded of her grace for his seruice, and paines sustained, within a while after: this doctor <hi>Parrie</hi> vnwoorthy the name of a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or of a Christian, conspired the death of her maies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hauing receiued his fees of the Pope (as it should seem) for the same. For the accomplishing of which moste hainous fact: he with another determined to kill her maiestie, sometimes with a Dag, sometimes with a Poynado or dagger, sometime with one thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and sometimes with an other. Wel this platforme being laid, and he hauing promised the Pope to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the thing: one of his conspirators through the goodnes of God disclosed the same, which doon: both he &amp; the said archtraitor <hi>Parrie</hi> were both apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and committed, and vpon the <hi>25.</hi> of Februarie the said <hi>Parrie</hi> was conuaied from the Tower of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to Westminster hall, where he was arraigned according to the lawe in that case prouided.</p>
            <p>The Pope that great Antechriste, and rose coullo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red whore of Roome, as he suborned many heertofore to kill her maiestie: so he hired this traiterous villain <hi>Parrie,</hi> and therfore sent him a letter dated the <hi>30.</hi> of Ianuary <hi>1584.</hi> annimating, exhorting, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading him, as he tendered his holynes fauour: that he would bring to passe and performe this their bloody purpose, and in so dooing he should merit great thanks at his hands, and to the end he should go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in that wicked enterprise: he graunted him ple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>narie, absolution, indulgence and remission of sinnes.

            <p>NOw whose hart is so stonie, that reading this bloody letter wil not burst foorth into teares? See heer how her grace was (as it were) bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght and solde, nay see how bloodely and how vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully they had murthered her royal maiesty in their harts if their intended practises had taken expected successe and effect.</p>
            <p>What good subiect now, knowing the Pope and papists to be the instruments of all mischeef, of blood, and of treason, wil not abhor and detest both the one &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other? how many times hath the Pope and papists practised her maiesties distruction? nay not onely the distruction of her grace, but also the ouerthrow of the whole Realme, the massaker of Gods Saints, and vt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter desolation for euer. And how mercifully, or rather miraculously hath God preserued her grace, discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their treasons, laid ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their conspiracies, &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their inuencions to their owne deserued distructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? how merciful a watch man hath the Lord been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer her grace, her people &amp; Cuntry these many yeers defending both the one and the other from all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheef what soeuer? how true is it which is writen <hi>He shall giue his Angells charge ouer thee, that thou dashe not thy foot against a stone?</hi> The Lord continue watchman ouer her grace, stil confound her foes and preserue her maiesty for euer.</p>
            <p>God graunt that her maiesty with her moste hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable counsaile, may sound the depth of these things and preuent them in time, for the performance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: would god papistry might be punished with death (as it ought to be) and that al obstinate papists might

sustaine the same punishments which traitors are to sustaine, for take this for a <hi>Maxime,</hi> that all papists are traitors in their harts, how soeuer otherwise they beare the world in hand.</p>
            <p>And therfore how many papists her grace hath in the Land: so many deaths, may she feare. God grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that this high Court of Parliament may see to this geare. For shall it be lawful for the papists to put to death true professors of Gods woord without lawe, without reason, without concience, or warrant of the woord of God and shall it not be lawful for vs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the punishment of death vpon them beeing trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to God, their Prince and cuntry, hauing the law of God vpon our side, reason, good concience, and els what soeuer? Wel how soeuer we perswade our selues, this is certain, that blood, treason, rebellion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections commotions, mutenies, murther, and the like are the badges and cognizaunce of them, and of that wicked generation, and let vs look for it, they wil be pricks vnto our eyes, whips vnto our backs, and kniues to cut our throts withall if time would serue them, which I pray God neuer doo.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, in as much as it hath pleased the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of our good God in mercy to preserue her grace heertofore and especially at this time, not only from imminent daugers: but euen from present death it self.</p>
            <p>I beseech all true Christian hartes and loouing subiects euen in the bowells of Iesus Christe, to rest thankfull to God for it, and to pray to God to preserue her grace still, and confound her foes
