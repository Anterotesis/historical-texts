         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Liberty of Conscience Asserted, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE ought to be allowed in the dayes of the <hi>Gospel</hi> in the free Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it to <hi>God-ward</hi> (without Compulsion) in all things relating to His Worship, for these Reasons following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Universal</hi> Royal <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> Commands it <hi>Matth. 7. 12. All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the Law and Prophets.</hi> That which every man would have and receive from another, he ought by Christ's Rule to give and allow it to another. But every man is willing to have the <hi>Liberty</hi> of his <hi>own Conscience,</hi> Therefore ought to <hi>allow it</hi> to another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because, <hi>No man</hi> can <hi>perswade</hi> the <hi>Conscience</hi> of <hi>another,</hi> either what <hi>God is,</hi> or how he should <hi>be worshipped,</hi> but by the Spirit, which God hath given to instruct man in the wayes of Truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because, <hi>All Obedience</hi> or <hi>Service</hi> that is obtained <hi>by force,</hi> is for fear of <hi>Wrath,</hi> and not from <hi>Love,</hi> nor for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake;</hi> and therefore will but continue so long as that <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>force</hi> abides upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Because, That <hi>by forcing,</hi> No man can make a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> to be <hi>a true Believer;</hi> but on the contrary, many may be made <hi>Hypocrites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Because, That in all <hi>forced Impositions</hi> upon <hi>mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> there is something of the <hi>Wrath</hi> of man <hi>exercised,</hi> which works not the <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> bur rather begets <hi>Enmity</hi> in the heart <hi>one</hi> towards <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Because, that by <hi>forcing</hi> any thing upon <hi>mens Consciences,</hi> as to matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> many are <hi>hardened</hi> in their <hi>hearts</hi> against the <hi>things imposed;</hi> when as otherwise, through <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>gentle Instructions</hi> their hearts might be <hi>perswaded</hi> to <hi>willing Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61615:3"/>
7. Because, That <hi>Persecution</hi> for <hi>Conscience</hi> contradicteth <hi>Christ's Charge,</hi> Matth. 13. who bids, that <hi>the Tares</hi> (or <hi>false worshippers)</hi> be <hi>suffered</hi> to <hi>grow together</hi> in the <hi>Field</hi> (or <hi>World)</hi> till the <hi>Harvest</hi> (or End of the World.)</p>
            <p n="8">8. Because, <hi>Force</hi> is contrary to the End for which it is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> to be used <hi>(viz.) the preservation and safety of the Wheat,</hi> which <hi>End</hi> is not <hi>answered</hi> by <hi>Persecution,</hi> because the <hi>Wheat</hi> is in danger to be <hi>plucked up</hi> thereby, as Christ saith.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Because, <hi>to force,</hi> is inconsistent with the <hi>Belief</hi> of the <hi>Jews Conversion</hi> (and other <hi>false worshippers)</hi> which is prayed for by the <hi>Publick Teachers,</hi> and cannot be attained, if <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for <hi>Conscience</hi> be <hi>prosecuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Because, they that <hi>impose</hi> upon <hi>mens Consciences,</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise <hi>Dominion</hi> over <hi>mens Faith,</hi> which the Apostles denyed, saying, <hi>they had not Dominion over any mens Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Because, <hi>Imposition</hi> upon <hi>mens Consciences</hi> necessitates them <hi>to sin,</hi> in yeelding a <hi>Conformity</hi> contrary to their own faith: <hi>for whatsoever is not of a mans own faith, is sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. Because, that <hi>Imposition</hi> and <hi>force</hi> wrestles with <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>Carnal weapons,</hi> which is contrary to the Apostles Doctrine, who said, <hi>Our VVeapons are not Carnal, but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and mighty through God:</hi> and <hi>we wrestle not with flesh and bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Because, there is but <hi>one Judge, Law-giver</hi> and <hi>King</hi> in and over the <hi>Conscience,</hi> as the Saints have testified in the Scriptures of Truth; and whosoever would <hi>intrude,</hi> so as to be <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Law-giver</hi> over the Conscience, <hi>intrencheth</hi> upon the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of Christ, <hi>Isa. 33. 22. James</hi> 4. 12.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Because, it is prophesied in <hi>Isa. 11. The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid, and there shall be no Destroyer in all he Holy Mountain;</hi> and therefore no <hi>Imposition</hi> upon mens Consciences.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Because, to <hi>impose</hi> upon <hi>mens Consciences</hi> for <hi>differences</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Advice</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> who directs People <hi>to wait upon God to be satisfied,</hi> and not to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> or <hi>Others,</hi> to be <hi>forced;</hi> who saith, <hi>VVhereunto we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, let us walk;</hi> and <hi>wherein any man is otherwise-minded, God shall reveal, even that unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61615:3"/>
16. Because, <hi>To force</hi> mens <hi>Consciences,</hi> and to lay <hi>Yoaks</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, is to <hi>make void</hi> the <hi>Blood-shed</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Christ, who sits upon the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and gives <hi>libeyty</hi> there; and commands us to <hi>stand fast in that Liberty,</hi> and <hi>not to be entangled through the Impositions of men,</hi> or <hi>Yoak of Bondage,</hi> Gal. 5. 6.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Because in <hi>all Nations</hi> the <hi>different Professions</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> are either <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours:</hi> If <hi>Friends</hi> then <hi>obliged</hi> by that <hi>Bond.</hi> If <hi>Enemies</hi> then <hi>Christ's Command</hi> is to take place, who saith, <hi>Love your Enemies;</hi> which if observed, <hi>Persecution</hi> for <hi>Conscience</hi> will be avoided.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Because, <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>different Perswasions</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> was <hi>allowed</hi> in the <hi>Jewish State,</hi> as not <hi>Inconsistent</hi> with <hi>their Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and that in <hi>things</hi> contrary <hi>each</hi> to <hi>other,</hi> as the <hi>Sadduces, Pharisees, Essaeans, Herodians</hi> with <hi>Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. Because, the <hi>True Religion</hi> cannot be <hi>Preached</hi> up by <hi>force</hi> of <hi>Armes,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> detested that Form of <hi>Proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. Because, No man hath <hi>such Power</hi> over the <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> of other men, as to lay a <hi>Necessity</hi> on them <hi>to Believe</hi> that which they do <hi>not Believe,</hi> or not <hi>to Believe</hi> what they <hi>do Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi> True Faith being the Gift of God.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Because, If the <hi>Magistrate Imposeth</hi> upon the <hi>Conscience,</hi> he must either do it as a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> or as a <hi>Christian.</hi> Not as a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> for then <hi>Heathens</hi> (being <hi>Magistrates)</hi> have the <hi>same Power</hi> to <hi>Impose;</hi> and so, by <hi>Revolutions</hi> and <hi>Conquests,</hi> may come to <hi>give Laws</hi> to <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>Compel</hi> them <hi>to Idolatry.</hi> 2. Not as <hi>Christians,</hi> for that <hi>Contradicts</hi> Christ's saying, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them; but it shall not be so among you, for all ye are, Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22. Because, By the <hi>same Rule</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> that the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> of <hi>one Nation</hi> ought to <hi>Impose</hi> upon, and <hi>Persecute</hi> for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> the <hi>Magistrates</hi> in <hi>all</hi> other <hi>Nations</hi> ought to do the <hi>same;</hi> and so the <hi>greatest part</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> may come to be <hi>Destroyed,</hi> there being more that <hi>Dissent,</hi> than are at <hi>Unity</hi> in Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
