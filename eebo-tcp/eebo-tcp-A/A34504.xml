            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

parts for the defence of his Honour and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
they will expresse themselves so affected
as we have alwayes represented them to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
So in this common consent, which hath
appeared in the Nobilitie, Iudges, Gentry and
others, to forward his Majesties service by their
persons and states, we have made no difficulty to
answer for the same correspondency in his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Subjects, as Catholiques: Notwithstanding
they all have already concurred to this his Majesties
service, according to the qualities whereof they
are, when others of the same quality were called
upon. For wee beleeve that it became us, who
have beene so often interested in the sollicitation
of their benefits, to shew our selves now in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of their gratitudes. Therefore having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
by his Majesty by other meanes recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them this earnest desire of ours to assist and
serve his Majesty, by some considerable summe of
money, freely and cheerefully presented: Wee

have thought fit (to the end that this our desire,
may be the more publique and the more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed)
hereby to give you Commission and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to distribute Coppies under your hand of this
testification thereof, unto those that have met in
<hi>London</hi> by our direction, about this businesse: And
unto the severall Collectors of every County.
And as wee presume the summe they will raise
will not be unworthy our presenting to the King;
so shall we be very sensible of it, as a particuler
respect to our selves, and will indeavour in the,
most efficatious manner wee can to improve the
merit of it, and to remove any apprehension of
prejudice, that any (who shall imploy themselves
towards the successe of this businesse) may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
by this they may be assured that wee will
secure them from all such objected inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And we are very confident that this our first

as may not onely afford us particular satisfaction,
but also, facilitation towards their owne advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>

concerning the contribution.</head>
            <p>IT is sufficient already knowne to every one, the
extraordinary Graces and Protections we owe
the Queenes Majestie, to whose favourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
wee must ascribe the happy moderation we
live under; So as we doubt not, but an occasion of
the expression of our gratitudes will joyfully bee
imbraced by every Body; which the present estate
of his Majesties affayres, doth now offer us. We
have already by our former letters indeavored to
prepare you to a cheerefull assistance of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
in his declared journey to the Northerne
parts, for the securing of his Kingdome, and such
other purposes as his Royall wisedome shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
of: That so you may really demonstrate
your selves as good Subjects, as God and nature
requires of you. Now her Majestie hath beene
gratiously pleased to recommend unto us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of our duties, and zeale to his Majesties
service, by some considerable gift from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques.
And to remove all scruples (that even
well affected persons may meete with) she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to secure us, and all that shall imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this businesse, from any inconvenience,
that may bee suspected by their or our forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and declaration in this kind. It will easily
appeare to every body how much it imports us,
in our sence of her Majesties desires to presse every
body to straine himselfe even to his best abilities
in this proposition, since by it wee shall certainly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94469:4"/>
preserve her graciousnesse to us, and give good
Characters of our devotion to the King and State;
of whose benignitie wee have all reason to give
testimonies, and to indeavour to produce argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the prosecution and increase of it.</p>
            <p>Now for the best expedition of this businesse
(which is the chiefe circumstance that importeth
in it) we have thought fit to recommend it to your
nominations of such persons as shall in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
be agreed of for the ablest and best disposed
in every severall County, not onely to sollicite,
but to collect such voluntary contributions, as
every bodies conscience and duty shall proffer:
And we shall desire you to give us an account of
what acceptation his friends, which wee cannot
but expect very successefull, and answerable to
the forwardnesse we meete with here about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
for which wee shall offer up our prayer to

            <p>THe inclosed Advices and motives being so
ample, as you will perceive by perusing
them, it will not be needefull that we enlarge our
selves upon any particulers concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

This therefore serveth onely to convey them to
you, (as we are intreated by those that have met
here, and have undertaken to doe) and desire you
to repaire immediatly unto those persons to
whom they be directed, and to deliver the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them in the name of all the Noble men and
Gentry (together with our selves) assembled here
at <hi>London</hi> by the Queenes commandement to set
forward this worke. And wee pray you assure
them in the most efficacious manner you can (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
all our credits for the trust thereof) that it
is the sence of us all both Ecclesiasticall and lay
persons, that besides the discharging of their and
our duties to God and the King, it mainely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
the good of Catholiques to have their
businesse take good successe. Therefore intreate
them to deale actively and efficaciously and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
according to these advices and motives. Wee
are so well perswaded of their devotion to put
forward so pious a worke, that we doubt not but
they will be as well satisfied in the needefulnesse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94469:5"/>
of the thing, and bee as ready to imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in it, receiving the assurance thereof, and
perswasions thereunto, onely from our hands, as
if they came by all the most formall wayes that
can be imagined; which in a businesse of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot be expected. And although the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
and motives be directed only to lay Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
yet we desire you, (&amp; have answered for you)
that you will imploy your selves and all those
that depend on you, sincerely to sollicite &amp; dispose
all their mindes that you have relation unto, as
powerfully as you can, to contribute cheerefully
and bountifully upon this occasion; which is the
first that ever we laboured in of this kind, so wee
hope in God it will bee the last: there being no

to occurre any more.</p>

            <head>A Message sent from the Queenes
Majesty to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
by Mr. Comptroller,
Febr. 5. 1640.</head>
            <p>THat her Majesty hath beene ready to use her
best endeavour for the remooving of all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding
betweene the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>That at the request of the Lords who petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the King for a Parliament, her Majesty at that
time writ effectually to the King, and sent a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
expressely to perswade the King to the
holding of a Parliament.</p>
            <p>That shee hath since beene most willing to doe
all good offices betweene the King and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which is not unknowne to divers of the
Lords, and so shall ever continue to doe as <unclear>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</unclear>
it the onely way of happinesse to the King, her
selfe, and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>That all things bee justly setled betweene the King and his people <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. </p>
            <p>That her Majestie having taken a knowledge that having one sent to her from the Pope is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastefull to the Kingdome, she is desirous to give
satisfaction to the Parliament within convenient
time she will remove him out of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>That understanding like wise that exception
hath beene taken to the great resort to her Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94469:8"/>
at <hi>Denmarke</hi> house she will be carefull not to
exceede that which is convehient and necessary
for the exercise of her Religion.</p>
            <p>She further taketh notice that the Parliament
is not satisfied with the manner of raysing money
for the assistance of the King in his journey to the
North, in the yeare 1639. at her intreaty from the
Catholiques, she was moved there unto meerely
out of her deare and tender affection to the King,
and the example of other his Majesties subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
she seeing the like forwardnesse would not but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
her forwardnesse to the assistance of the
King.</p>
            <p>If any thing be illegall, she was ignorant of the
Law, and was carried therein onely out of a great
desire to be assisting to the King in so pressing an
occasion but promiseth to be more cautious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
not to doe any thing but what may stand
with the established lawes of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Her Majestie being desirous to employ her
owne power to unite the King and people and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
the Parliament to looke-forwards and passe
by such mistakes and errors of her servants as may
be formerly, and this your respect shee promiseth
shall be repayd with all the good offices shee can
doe to the house, which you shall finde with reall
effects as often as there shall be occasion.</p>
