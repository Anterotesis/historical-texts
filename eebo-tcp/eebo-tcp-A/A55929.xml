            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>T. Armſtrong,</hi> you may go away with
what Opinion you pleaſe of your own Innocency: but you
are here Attainted by Outlawry. That which was done,
to him you ſpeak of, was the Grace and Mercy of the
King, and he may if he pleaſe extend the ſame Grace and

                  <p>My Lord, I would only acquaint you
with one thing in reference to what Sir <hi>Tho. Armſtrong</hi>
has ſaid: The King did indulge <hi>Holloway,</hi> that he ſpeaks
of, it is true, ſo far as to offer him a Trial, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
perhaps might have ſome reaſon for it, but the
Priſoner truly deſerves no Sort of Indulgence or Mercy
from the King. For it has appeared by the Evidence
that has been given of this Late Horrid Conſpiracy, that
after the Diſappointment that was given by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, by the Fire at <hi>New-Market,</hi> to the meeting
at the <hi>Rye;</hi> this Gentleman was one of the Perſons that
actually engaged to go upon the Kings haſty coming to
Town then, and to deſtroy him by the way as he came to
Town. And this appears upon a full and clear Evidence,
as poſitively teſtified as any thing can be. And when
he was taken beyond Sea, Letters of Communication
with Forreign Miniſters and other People were taken
about him, and will be—</p>

                  <p>We are not to meddle at all with the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Mr. Attorney; that is not our buſineſs; here is an
Outlawry, upon this Outlawry he is Attainted; we have
nothing more to do, but to do the Duty of the Court
upon this Record before us, to Award Execution upon
that Attainder, and we muſt give a Rule for it. If the
King will be pleaſed to do for Sir <hi>Tho. Armſtrong</hi> what
he did for <hi>Holloway,</hi> and indulge him a Trial, and wave
the Outlawry, with all our hearts. We are not diſpoſers
of his Grace and Favor, but the Miniſters of his Juſtice.
If the King will pardon him, he may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is not our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
but all we have to do upon what is before us, is
to conſider the Record, and what the Priſoner ſays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our awarding of Execution. We have Conſidered
whether this be a Yielding within the Proviſo of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

Juſt men made Perfect, after they are delivered
from their earthly Priſons; we humbly commend the
Soul of this thy Servant into thy Hands, as into the
Hands of a Faithful Creator, and moſt Merciful Saviour,
beſeeching thee it may be pretious in thy Sight. Waſh
it, and Sanctifie it by the Blood of the Immaculate
Lamb, that taketh away the Sins of the World; that
whatſoever defilements it may have contracted, in this
miſerable, ſinful and naughty World, through the luſts
of the Fleſh, or the wiles of Satan, being purged and
done away, it may be preſented Pure and Spotleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

thou moſt Bleſſed Judge Eternal, ſuffer him not, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him not at his laſt Hour, for any Pains of Death
to fall from thee. Support him by the aſſiſtance of
thy Spirit in all Agonies of Soul and Body at his laſt
Moment; and teach us by this, and all other Spectacles
of Mortality, to number our Days, and to apply our
Hearts to that Holy and Heavenly Wiſdom whilſt we
live here, which may bring us hereafter to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>I Thank Almighty God, though I have had but a
ſhort time allowed me, I find my ſelf prepar'd for
Death, and my thoughts ſet on another World,
and truſt in God, well weaned from putting my heart
on this; yet I cannot but give ſo much of my little
time to ſet down in Writing my Anſwers to ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
raiſed ſince my cloſe Impriſonment, as well as
what Mr. Attorney accus'd me of at the Bar: I was
told a Very Great Perſon ſays, I was a Spy of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s.
I have been ſent from <hi>England</hi> by the beſt and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Friends the King had then, with Bills of Exchange
for His Majeſties Uſe, and Letters of very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to His Majeſty then at <hi>Bruxels;</hi> I appeal to
His Majeſty, if I deliver'd them not ſafe to Him, and
His anſwers too when I return'd; Which I had not
been above Six Days, but I was Clapt up Ten Weeks a
cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> and in no ſmall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of my Life for that Journey; Before this time, I
had been a whole Year at leaſt in <hi>Lambeth-houſe</hi> a Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and after both theſe times a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
when the <hi>Uſurper</hi> Died, and near Starving in every One
of them: Very ill Treatments for a Spy and Penſioner;
My Lord of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and many others of Quality will, I
think, teſtifie my Innocency in this point; I proteſt before
God I was never a Spy to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> or any other Man.</p>

                  <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt I was brought to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>
Bar on an Outlawry of High Treaſon, I was asked
what I had to ſay for my ſelf, that Judgment of Death
ſhould not paſs; I was beyond Seas when the Outlawry
came out, I thought a Writ of Errour to Reverſe it the
Law allowed, I prayed I might be allowed a Tryal for
my Life according to the Laws of the Land, I urg'd
the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. which was expreſly
for it, it being within the Twelve Months allowed by
that Statute; It ſignified nothing, I was with an unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Roughneſs Condemned, and made a Preſident,
tho' Mr. <hi>Holloway</hi> a little before had it offered him; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think all the World will conclude my Caſe
very different; elſe why refuſed me?</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney ſaid, I was accuſed for being one of
thoſe that was to Kill the King as he came from
<hi>Newmarket,</hi> after the Fire, I take God to Witneſs I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any Deſign, nor ever had ſuch a Thought to
take away the King's Life; neither ever had any man
the Impudence to propoſe ſo Barbarous and Baſe a thing
to me; neither was Fever in any Deſign to alter the
Government of <hi>England:</hi> What I am Accuſed of more,
I know no otherwiſe than by Reports and Prints,
which I take to be uncertain; So that it cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be expected I ſhould make particular Anſwers; If
I had been Tryed I could have proved my Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>'s
Baſe Reflections on me to be a Notorious Falſhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For I know there is at leaſt Ten Gentlemen, beſides all
the Servants of the Houſe, can teſtifie I Dined there
that day.</p>
               <p>I have Lived, and now Die of the Reformed Religion,
A <hi>True</hi> and Sincere <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and I heartily wiſh
I had more ſtrictly lived up to the Religion which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
and I have found the great comfort of the Love
and Mercy of God, in and through my Bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
in whom I only truſt, and I do verily
hope, that I am going to partake of that fulneſs of
Joy which is in His Preſence, the hopes whereof doth
infinitly pleaſe me.</p>
               <p>I thank God, I have no repining at my heart, for the
condition my ſins have moſt deſervedly brought upon
me; I have deſerved much worſe at the hands of God,
ſo that I cheerfully ſubmit to this Puniſhment, as being
taken off but a ſmall time ſooner.</p>
               <p>I do freely forgive all the World, even thoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in taking away my Life. As for the Sentence of
Death paſt upon me, I cannot but think a very hard
one, being, I think, denied the Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>To conclude, as I never had any Deſign againſt the
King's Life, or the Life of any man, ſo I never was in a
Deſign to alter the Monarchy.</p>
               <p>I Die in charity with all the World, and therefore
I heartily pray God to Bleſs the Church of Chriſt every
where, theſe poor Nations, the Kings Majeſty; and I
heartily commend my Soul, to Gods Infinite Mercy,
through my Bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
