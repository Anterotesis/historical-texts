         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The maine thing that you ſhould look upon is the Land,
which calls upon her children to be freed from the entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

waſte and barren, and her children ſtarve for want, in regard
the Lords of Manors will not ſuffer the poor to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure

            <p>When <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror came in, he took the land
from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> both the Encloſures from the Gentry, and
the Commons and waſte lands from the common people, and
gave our land to his <hi>Norman</hi> ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſeeing we have with joynt conſent of purſe and

               <hi>Norman</hi> yoaks, or <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
to have the land free to work upon, that they may eate their
bread in righteouſneſs; that is to ſay, let the Freeholders have
there freedom to work quietly in their Incloſures, and let the
common people have their Commons and waſte lands <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
to themſelves. If you eſtabliſh not this ſeeing power now is
in your hand, you will be the firſt that break Covenant with
Almighty God.</p>
            <p>For you ſwore in your National Covenant to endeavour
a Reformation according to the Word of God, which Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is to reſtore us to that Primative freedom in the earth,
in which the earth was firſt made and given to the ſons of
men, and that is to be a common treaſury of livelihood to all,
without working for hire, or paying rent to any, for this is
the Reformation according to the Word of God before the
fall of man, in which there is no reſpect of perſons.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing in particular you ſwore to endeavour the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
peace and ſafety of this people of <hi>England,</hi> ſhutting out
no ſort from freedom; therefore you cannot ſay that the
Gentry and Clergy were only comprehended, but without
exception, all ſorts of people in the land are to have freedom,
ſeeing all ſorts have aſſiſted you in perſon and purſe, and the
common people more eſpecially, ſeeing their eſtates were
weakeſt, and their miſery in the wars the greateſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the Gentry and Freeholders have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures
freed from all entanglements of Fines, Heriots and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
burdens, and let the common people have their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and waſte lands freed from entanglements of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Lords of Mannors, and pluck up all <hi>Norman</hi> Tyranny by

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
of people may live in peace one among another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if this freedom be not granted quietly, you will
pull the blood and cries of the poor oppreſſed upon
heads; Firſt, becauſe you have taken their money in taxes, and
freequarter from them, whereby they are made worſe able to
live then before the wars. Secondly, becauſe in your low
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116021:5"/>
eſtate, when you called upon us to come and help a bleeding
dying Nation, and we did come with purſe and perſon, and
under-went great hardſhip, and you ſtil promiſed us freedom
in the end, if in caſe you and we prevailed over the <hi>Norman</hi>
ſucceſſor, and we have prevailed.</p>
            <p>And if now, while the price is in your hand, you ſhould ſtil
leave us under the <hi>Norman</hi> Lords of Manors, and will not
quietly ſuffer us to plant our ſelves upon the Commons, and
waſte land, which is ours by the law of our Creation, and
which is ours now by conqueſt from under our oppreſſor, for
which we have paid taxes, given free-quarter, and adventured
our lives; the Common-land now is as freely the common
peoples, as you can ſay the Incloſures are your propriety.</p>
            <p>If you deny this freedom, then you juſtly pull the blood
and cries of the poor oppreſſed upon you, and are Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers,
and wil be proved double hypocrites: Firſt, to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, in breaking Covenant with him, for in his Name
you made the Covenant. Secondly, to men, in breaking Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with them, for the matter of the Covenant was the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
peace, and ſafety of the people of <hi>England,</hi> taking in all
ſorts of people.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if you do not ſet us free from the <hi>Norman</hi> yoake,
now after you have taken our Taxes and Free-quarter from
us, whereby we have dearly bought our Freedom, and you
thereupon promiſed freedom, and you have power now to
give it, for if you ſpeak the word the <hi>Norman</hi> yoaks will be
broke, and all ſorts will rejoyce in freedom and righteouſneſs;
but if you will not, you give a juſt occaſion to the common
people of <hi>England,</hi> never to truſt the fair words of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
any more, as you were alwayes very ſlow in truſting the
King, when he ſwore by the word of a King, becauſe you
found that ſubtilty and Self lay under, and no reality.</p>
            <p>And truly the hearts of people are much falling from you,
for your breach of Promiſes when you have power to keep
them, and for your neglect of giving them their freedom, and
removing burthens; and what danger may enſue by that to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116021:6"/>
your ſelves, and the Nations, you know how to judg; and for
our parts we are ſorry to hear the muttering of the people
againſt you.</p>
            <p>O that there were a heart in you to conſider of theſe things,
and act righteouſneſſe, how ſweetly might you and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
live together: If you grant this freedom we ſpeak of,
you gain the hearts of the Nation; if you neglect this, you
will fall as faſt in their affections as ever you riſe: I ſpeak what
I ſee, and do you obſerve; ſlight not that love that ſpeaks
feelingly, from the ſence of the Nations burdens.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if ſtill you ſhould eſtabliſh the old <hi>Norman</hi> laws,
and confirm Lords of Manors in their ancient Cuſtom, and
oppreſſing power over the Common-people, you would now
at length, after the wars with King <hi>Charls</hi> are over, take part
with ſuch (as is known very well) as have been either flat ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or ambidexters all along the wars, and will caſt ſuch as
have been your true friends at the feet of the Nations ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to be ſtill oppreſſed by their cruelty. Surely if theſe
Lords and Free-holders have their Incloſures eſtabliſhed to
them in peace, is not that freedom enough? Muſt they needs
have the Common land likewiſe? As <hi>Ahab,</hi> that was reſtleſſe
till he had <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, and ſo in the midſt of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
yet will eat the bread out of the poores mouthes.
O, the land mourns in her children, under the hard hearted
covetouſneſſe of theſe men.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you eſtabliſh the old <hi>Norman</hi> laws, That Lords
of Manors ſhall ſtill have the Commons and waſte lands, then
you are the maintainers of the old <hi>Norman</hi> Murder and Theft
ſtill; for Lords of Manors came to be Tyrants over the poor
enſlaved Engliſh, by the Murder and Theft of <hi>William</hi> the
Conqu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rour, and downwards to this day they have held title
to their Royalties therefrom, and from the will of the King;
for when he had conquered, he turned the Engliſh out, and
gave their land to his <hi>Norman</hi> ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you eſtabliſh the old <hi>Norman</hi> laws, and this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That the Lords of Manors ſhall ſtill be Lords of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116021:6"/>
Common land and the Common people be ſtill enſlaved to
them, then you pull the guilt of King <hi>Charles</hi> his blood upon
your own heads; for then it will appear to the view of all men,
That you cut off the Kings head, that you might eſtabliſh your
ſelves in his Chair of Government, and that your aym was not
to throw down Tyranny, but the Tyrant. But alas, the Kings
blood was not our burthen, it was thoſe oppreſſing <hi>Norman</hi>
laws, whereby he enſlaved us, that we groaded under.</p>
            <p>Let it not be ſaid in the ears of poſterity, That the Gentry
of England aſſembled in Parliament, proved Covenant-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
Oaths, Proteſtations, and promiſe brekkers to God,
and the Common people, after their own turn was ſerved;
and killed the King for his power and government, as a thief
kils a true man for his money. I do not ſay you have done ſo,
but for ſhame dally no longer, but cut off the bad laws, with
the Kings head, and let the poor oppreſſed go free, as well as
the Gentry and Clergy, and you will finde more peace. Let
the Common land be ſet free, break the <hi>Norman</hi> yoak of
Lords of Manors; and pull not the cryes and blood of the
poor oppreſſed upon you</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Know this, That if ever you, or any Parliament
of England, do England good, you muſt make all your laws in
the light of equity and reaſon, reſpecting the freedom of all
ſorts of people; but if you reſpect ſome ſort of people, to
wit, the Gentry, and Clergy, and give freedom to them; for
they, by vertue of your Act of Parliament, eſtabliſhing the
old <hi>Norman</hi> laws, do arreſt and trouble me and others, for
digging upon the Commons, whereas by vertue of the Victory
over the King, in regard I have to my eſtate given free quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and taxes for Englands liberty, as they have done, I have as
much right to the Common land as they; therefore I ſay, if
the Gentry and Clergy muſt have their <hi>Norman</hi> power eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
to them, and the Common people, that are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
for number and neceſſities, be left ſtill under the
yoak, you will be proved the fooliſh builders.</p>
            <p>Surely if you found out the Court of Wards to be a burden,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116021:7"/>
and freed Lords of Mannors, and Gentry from paying Fines
to the King; and freed their children from the ſlavery of
falling Ward; Let the common People be ſet free too from
paying homage to Lords of Manors; and let all ſorts have
freedome by vertue of this Conqueſt over the <hi>Norman</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
And ſeeing you took away the will of the King from
enſlaving Lords of Mannors, Take away the will of Lords of
Mannors from enſlaving the Common People.</p>
            <p>Thus ſirs, we have made our Appeal to you, as the only
men that muſt and can give ſentence of freedome in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
and that you will not leave us in the cruell hands of
Lords of Mannors, the ſucceſſors of the <hi>Norman</hi> Task-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
For there are but three wayes that Lords of Man<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
can lay claime to the Common land, and yet all three are too
weak to build a juſt title upon:</p>
            <p>Firſt, if they can prove, that the Earth was made by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God peculiarly for them, and not for others equall
with them, then we have treſpaſſed in digging upon their
rights; but the Earth was made as free for us as for them;
therefore they have treſpaſſed againſt us their fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in troubling us by their tyrannicall Arreſt, and hindering
us from our righteous labor.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if they ſay, that others ſold or gave them the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the Commons, by way of Inheritance; They are to
prove by what Authority any other had from the pure Law
of our Creation, to give away or ſell the Earth from the uſe
of any of their fellow creatures, it being the common ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
of livelihood for all, without reſpect of perſons.</p>
            <p>He that ſels the Earth, and he that buyes, doth remove the
land-mark from the third perſon, becauſe the land that is
bought and ſold, belongs to the third man, as well as to the
other two that buys and ſels; and they two perſons that buys
and ſels, and leaves the land that is bought for an inheritance
to their children, excluding others, they murder the third man,
becauſe they ſteal away his livelihood from him; for after a
man hath bought the land, and paid money for it to another,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116021:7"/>
he ſaith, this is my land, I have paid for it: But the third
man comes in, and ſaith, the land is mine, equall with you by
the law of Creation; And ſo he that is the buyer, he begins
to draw his ſword, and to fight; and if he conquer, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces,
and ſayes, the land is now mine indeed, I have bought,
and I have conquered. But thou coverous perſon, ſo long as
there is another man in the world beſides thee, and him
whom thou haſt killed, the Earth belongs to him as well as to
thee; And this is the caſe of the Nations of the world, and
thus propriety came in, and hath been left as an Inheritance
to Children; which is the burden the Creation groans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee who are thieves and murderers; even the
buyers and ſellers of land, with her fruits, theſe are they that
take away another mans right from him; and that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes
righteous propriety, to uphold particular propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
which covetouſnes the God of this world hath ſet
up.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, if Lords of Manors ſay, as it is truth,
that they hold title to the Commons by cuſtome, from the
Kings will, as they do, this is as bad as the other; for we
know the King came in by conqueſt, and gave the land
to theſe forefathers, to be task-maſters over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> But if you ſay, that theſe later Kings
were choſen by the people, it is poſſible it might be ſo, but
ſurely it was when his greatneſs over-awed them, or elſe
they would never have choſen him to enſlave them, and to
ſet task-maſters over them.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Common People have joyned perſon and
purſe with you, to recover your ſelves from under the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of Kings, and have prevailed; the Common people
now have more truer title to the common lands, then the
Lords of Manors, for they held title by Conqueſt and ſword
of the King (we now the common people have recovered the
land again by conqueſt and ſword in caſting out the King) ſo
that the title of Lords of Manors is broke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:116021:8"/>
Therefore now the Common people have more true title to
the Common land, then Lords of Manors have, in regard they
have recovered themſelves out of ſlavery by taxes, free quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and conqueſt, yet we ſhut them not out, but let them take
part with us as fellow creatures, and we with them, and ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
our Creator in the work of his own hands.</p>
            <p>Thus we have declared our Cauſe without flattery to you;
if you leave us in the hands of oppreſſion, and under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the old tyrannicall laws, know this, that we ſuffer in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute
of o<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Nationall Covenant, endeavouring a Reformation
in our place and calling, according to the word of God, and
you ſhall be left without excuſe.</p>
            <p>Set the Land free from Oppreſsion, And righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
will be the Laws, Government, and ſtrength
of that People.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:116021:8"/>
               <head>Theſe are ſome of the NORMAN
Laws which William the Conqueror
brought into ENGLAND.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, he turned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of their
Lands, and placed his <hi>Norman</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

gave them a Royalty to the Commons, to

               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:116021:9"/>
Secondly, another <hi>Norman</hi> Law is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror cauſed the Laws to
