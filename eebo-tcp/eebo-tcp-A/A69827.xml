            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is by all Men an allow'd Principle, That 'tis the Bounden Duty of every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by the Laws of God, Nature, and the Nation, to contribute all that in him lies towards the Glory of God, and the Service and Preſervation of his Native Country, and the greater his Quality or Station is, whether Spiritual or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo much the more is this Duty Incumbent on him.</p>
            <p>If this wholſome Principle had been truely and ſincerely practis'd this Reign, then might we have expected that God would have bleſs'd our Endeavours, and not have ſuffer'd us to have endur'd ſo long and tedious a War, and ſo great Expence of Blood and Treaſure; and at laſt to be reduc'd to ſuch a Pitch of Miſery, as this Nation never groan'd under; and (which is more deplorable) not caus'd by our Enemies abroad, but our pretended Friends and Patriots at home; and which is worſt of all, the Nation's groaping, as it were, in the Dark, not ſeeing the true Riſe and Cauſe of our preſent Miſery and approaching Ruin.</p>

                     <hi>ALtho' it is the unquestionable Right of every free Born Subject of</hi> England, <hi>to have the Liberty of Petitioning, and tho' it has in all Ages been alſo accounted the Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Duty of every Peer, not to refuſe a Petition that ſhall be offer'd him; yet have not I been able, in a Months Attendance and Solicitation of ſeveral Noble Lords, to get a Petition carried into the Houſe of Peers. My ſaid Petition is againſt Notorious Crimes, that have been Committed in the Admiralty, Navy, and Sick and Wounded Offices, whereby the King and Kingdom have been groſly abus'd, and the publick Treaſure waſted, to a very high degree, which has already greatly Endanger'd the Common Safety, and certainly will (if not timely redreſs'd) bring the Nation into Confuſion; all which I am fully able to prove.</hi>

            <p>At the Receiving of which Letter, my Lord-Keeper (as I was inform'd) Acted with a great deal of Honour; For immediately he Reported the true Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it to the Houſe, Telling their Lordſhips withal, That 'twas the ſevereſt Charge that ever he Read; at the making of which Report, the ſame Lord (who I had long apply'd to before) came out of the Houſe in great haſte, and ſent one of the Door-keepers to me in the Painted Chamber, deſiring me to ſend him my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, he having loſt that which I had given him before, which I accordingly did, and then his Lordſhip returning into the Houſe, ſpake (as I was inform'd) to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: That he acknowledg'd he had been very much Teez'd about bringing in this Petition; but that when he brought it in the laſt Parliament, it not meeting with that Incouragement, he hop'd and expected it would have had, was the Reaſon why he was ſo backward in doing it this Seſſion, at which ſeveral of the Lords ſtood up and

ſaid, That if it had been offer'd to them, they would have brought it in; and the whole Houſe ſaid, They were very willing to hear it, but that the Buſineſs for the day was Order'd for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company; ſo my Petition not being read that day, I concluded his Lordſhip would have caus'd it to be Read the next Morning; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing mov'd, and fearing things were all aſleep, I wrote out another Copy, and the next morning, <hi>viz. 29th.</hi> of <hi>Jannuary,</hi> I offer'd it to a Noble Lord, who told me he heard I had been refus'd almoſt by every Body, and that he would carry it in for me, which his Lordſhip accordingly did, and immediately it was Read, a Copy of which is as followeth.</p>

            <p>As ſoon as this order was made, I was told by a Member of the houſe that when the Commiſſioners of accounts return'd their Anſwer, and that the whole matter lay fairly before the houſe, that then their Lordſhips would appoint a Committee to Examine it; accordingly I waited ſeveral days, and finding no Report from the Commiſſioners of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and having good grounds to believe they would never return any, by reaſon it would diſcover their own Partial and Illegal practices, I therefore acquainted a Noble Lord therewith, and pray'd his Lordſhip to move the houſe to appoint a Committee to Examine theſe Corruptions, before whom I would prove divers Notorious matters,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58351:3"/>
that were never before the Commiſſioners of Accounts, and deliver'd his Lordſhip a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to that purpoſe, which will be hereafter incerted. But his Lordſhip did not think fit to move the houſe thereupon, telling me, I had better wait ſome time longer, which I accordingly did.—But finding that diverſe Crafty and Scandalous Reports were ſpread abroad, Namely, That my deſign in bringing theſe Complaints was not ſo much for the publick good, as it was to cauſe heats and feuds in Parliament to hinder the Kings Affairs, for that if theſe matters were laid before the King, his Majeſty would effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly redreſs the ſame; But to acquit my ſelf of ſuch a Callumny I drew up a Petition to his Majeſty, which I preſented at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 9th of <hi>Feb.

                  <p>
                     <hi>That the ſaid Complaint was about five months in their Office ſworn to, before it came under Examination, till on the first of</hi> Auguſt 1694 <hi>The ſaid Commiſſioners of Accounts ſent for</hi> Mr. Baſton, <hi>and, after rejecting the first three Articles in his Complaint, they, in an Illegal and Arbitrary manner, Examin'd the reſt, and Countenanc'd and Conceall'd manifest Perjury therein, as well as other notorious Crimes, all which lay Dormant till the begining of</hi> March 1694.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That your Petitioner the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, preſenting his humble Petition to this moſt Honourable Houſe; your Lordſhips were pleas'd to order the ſaid Commiſſioners of Accounts, to lay before the Houſe an account of the proceedings, againſt the Commiſſioners for Sick and</hi>

                     <hi>Wounded, to which in Eleven days,</hi> viz. <hi>from the 9th to the 20th of</hi> March, <hi>they return'd only a Verbal anſwer, and pretended the matter was ſtill depending before them and not finiſh'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by which they prevail'd to have it Recommitted, which was accordingly done, as well as the 2d and 3d Articles in my Petition, which they Examin'd as Illegally as before (all which appears by what Mr.</hi> Baſton <hi>and your Petitioner have ſet forth in Print). And ſo the matter has been delay'd by the ſaid Commiſſioners of Accounts to this day, by which means the Nation has been ſadly diſappointed of a moſt neceſſary diſcovery, which otherwiſe might have been laid open to your Lordſhips the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, and in all probability, Infinite Evils prevented that has ſince fallen upon the Publick.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Commiſſioners of Accounts having acted in the aforemention'd manner, their Report, whenever they make it, will appear to their ſhame, and ſo your Petitioner humbly Conceives it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follows, they will never obey the preſent order of this most Honourable Houſe (which has already been fifteen days unanſwer'd) ſo as to make a Report of theſe matters willingly, but Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all means poſſible to Evade and delay it this Seſſion of Parliament alſo, under diverſe ſpecious pretences of other more Important buſineſs. For preventing of which, and for that your Petitioner humbly Conceives, the diſtreſſes and danger that the publick lies under, is very great by reaſon of the violent perverting and obſtructing of Juſtice, and for that the adverſaries have no way to withſtand a Legal hearing of theſe Notorious matters, but by the aforeſaid method of delays.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your Petitioner does therefore moſt humbly pray, your Lordſhips to appoint a Committee to hear and Examine the Articles, and Allegations in his late Petition, who in the mean time that the Commiſſioners of Accounts may delay their Report, ſhall have diverſe Ennormous Crimes prov'd before their Lordſhips, that were never before the ſaid Commiſſioners of Accounts.</hi>

            <p>This Petition Enclos'd in the aforeſaid Letter, was deliver'd by the Uſher of the Black-Rod to Sir <hi>George Treby,</hi> and I expecting his Lordſhip would have mov'd the houſe therein (as my Lord Keeper had done before) I attended that day, but heard nothing of it, Then I came to the Houſe the next morning, and underſtood from one of the Clerks of the Parliament whoſe name I think is <hi>Walker)</hi> That Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> had given my Letter and Petition to him, and told him he had nothing to do to move the Houſe in it, and that every body knew Mr. <hi>Crosfeilds</hi> buſineſs, and offer'd to give my Petition back.</p>
            <p>Thus all theſe foul Crimes, that have been laying open theſe two Seſſions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are knock'd down dead by this laſt Act of denial of Juſtice in the higheſt Court of Indicature, which has oblig'd me to Print theſe Proceedings; and becauſe the matters are ſo notorious, as hardly to be Parell'd in any Age or Nation, I ſhall therefore crave leave to make ſome ſhort Obſervations upon the whole.</p>
            <p>And 1ſt, obſerving our unaccountable Loſſes and Miſcarriages with the great <hi>Streights,</hi> into which the publick is brought to find out Mony for Carrying on the War, It is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of amazement to Conſider, That there ſhould be ſuch Coldneſs, or rather unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to Examine into that Maſs of Wickedneſs, that has been laid open, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overſpread the Nation like a Leproſy, has been the true Cauſe of all our paſs'd and preſent miſeries, and muſt Inevitably bring us to Ruine, if the Laws are not ſpeedily put in Execution to prevent it. I ſay, 'tis matter of Amazement, that we ſhould be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Enquire into the Cauſe of our Miſery.</p>
            <p>2dly, Our practices are not only contrary to the Rules of common Prudence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but alſo to the practiſe of all other Nations, It being publickly known, That the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> have lately conſtituted Commiſſioners, to Enquire into publick frauds, as naturally concluding (tho none are Complain'd of) that there will be Cheats and Embezelments of the publick Mony in time of War, when there is moſt need of fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality. But we are ſo far from doing like them, that we are unwilling to Enquire into thoſe Notorious Miſcarriages that are already laid open, tho ſome of them have been actually prov'd over and over, and the Criminals Protected and Continu'd in their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:58351:5"/>
3dly, That as my Lord Keeper Acted with much Honour, and did his Duty for the publickgood, in Reporting my Letter before mention'd to the Houſe of Peers, ſo on the contrary Sir <hi>George Treby,</hi> in refuſing to Read or Report my Letter, or Petition to the Houſe, has only deny'd Juſtice, and put a ſtop to this neceſſary Diſcovery, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to protect thoſe Criminals that ought to be brought to Juſtice: But has alſo given a preſident to Encourage Evil Practices, and Deſtroy the Liberty of the ſubject by taking away the Petition Right. For if Officers and Miniſters of Truſt Act Corruptly, and Oppreſs the People, and there be no way to appeal from their Juſtice but to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then ſuch Appeal or Complaint muſt be by Petition; But if the known Liberty and Right of Petitioning be deſtroy'd, our Laws are Ineffectual and all great Men become Lawleſs, none being able to bring them to anſwer their Crimes: And if our Laws are not put in Execution, they are in effect Diſcontinu'd and Aboliſh'd. And if Laws be the Foundation ſupport and upholder of Government, Then whatever Government wants will or ſtrength to aſſert its own Laws, and bring offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Juſtice, muſt needs be in a very weak and Tottering Condition and near a period, and this ought to be matter of great ſorrow, to all thinking Men that wiſh the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Country, for however, ſlightly it may be thought of 'tis certainly a moſt fore and dangerous Diſeaſe, and Requires a ſpeedy and ſtrong purge, or 'twill be paſt Cure.</p>
            <p>And therefore in ſhort, if there be any Law in <hi>England,</hi> to puniſh thoſe hanious Crimes that I have offer'd to prove, I do and ſhall inſiſt on, and Demand it as my Birth Right, to be Speedily and Legally heard upon my Petition, and Articles now lying in the Houſe of Peers: Not doubting but by their Lordſhips Wiſdom, Prudence, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, matters may ſoon be Regulated to the Happineſs of the King and Kingdom.</p>
