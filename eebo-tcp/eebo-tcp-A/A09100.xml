            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T maye be (M. Charke) that you haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected now somewhat longe, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse remayned in some suspence of this defence of the Censure, or reioynder to your replye. VVhich Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sure, being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as I haue heard) in eight or nyen dayes space at the most: this defence therof hathe now hadde the staye, more than of so many monethes, before it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to light. But the cause therof is easie to Iudge, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie to you, whiche (for the most part,) are priuye to the same.</p>
            <p>In generall, euery one can imagine by hym selfe, how difficult a thing yt is in England at this daye, for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique man to write any book: where nether libertie, nor rest, nor librarie, nor conference, nor beinge is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted hym. And in particular, thus muche I must adde, whiche you alredie in part doe knowe: that soone after the publishinge of your reply to the Censure, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor therof addressed hym selfe to a defence, and had in greate part dispatched the same, redie for the printe, in suche sort as the rigorous tyme of your persecution permitted hym. But God sufferinge at that verie insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; that the sayd print so long sought, and muche feared by you; should be taken: there was taken, lost, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ther-withall; not onelie all furniture there redy for this booke, but also for sundry other thinges, partlie printed; and partlie in printing; concerning our defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of trueth and equitie, against your falsehood and violent oppressions.</p>
            <p>This disturbance, and losse beinge fallen owt by gods most holy and fatherlie permission: and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Censure hauing nether tyme, nor place, nor bookes, nor leysure to begynne agayne, nor any hope of print when he should haue done the same: being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so necessarilie called awaye at that verye tyme, to a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce somewhat farof, vppon vrgent businesse: he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14521:3"/>
vtterlie to gyue ouer the sayd attempt of defence, partlie vppon the difficulties now alleaged, and partly for that in very dede your replie (M. Charke) seemed sufficientlye to answer yt selfe, being so obscure in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, as most men without the Censure might not vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yt: and so weake otherwise, as yt needed litle confutation of others. These were some causes: but in deed (as I vnderstand) the principall and cheefe cause was, for that M. Campian (the greatest occasion, and subiect of the Censure) was now also euen at that tyme fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But after, when it came to hearinge of the worlde abrode<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aister Charke besides the matter in question, maketh a praeface to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, touching the vtilitie, necessitie, and waye of tryeing spirites: alleginge the woordes of S.

VVhich (he saythe) he and his felowes offer to doe: and we refuse. But that this is clearlie false, and a formall speche onelie, withoute trueth or substance: our dedes doe testifie: which are alwayes (with indifferent men) as good as woordes. Our bookes are extant, whereby we haue called to tryall all sectaries of our tyme, as they rose vpp, and shewed new spirites: as Luther, Corolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stad, Swinglius, Munster, Stankarus: and Caluin, whome our aduersaries folow as one of the last. And nowe in England, yf we had not bene willing or rather desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse of this triall of spirites: we wolde neuer haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured so muche to obtayne the same of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <note place="margin">

And yf all these our offers and endeuours, ioyned with so many petitions and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for triall, haue obtained vs nothing hitherto, but offence, accusations, extreme rackings, and cruell deathe: me thinke M. Charke had litle cause to make this preface of our refusing triall, and their offering the same: except it were onelye for lacke of other matter, and to kepe the custome of sayeing somewhat in the beginning.</p>
            <p>But perhappes M. Charke will saye, that althoughe we offer triall, yet not suche, nor by suche meanes, as in


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14521:9"/>
his opinion is lawfull, sure and conuenient. VVhen we come to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bate: then remayneth it to be examined, whiche parte doeth alleage best meanes: whiche shalbe the argument of this my answer to this preface. <note place="margin">

               </note> And I will endeuour to shew, that all the meanes of tryall whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch M. Chark &amp; his felowes will seme to allow in woord, (for they offer none in deede) are neyther sure, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor euident: but onelie meere shyftes to auoyde all triall: and that we (on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary parte,) doe not onelie allow, but allso offer, all the best and surest wayes of tryall that euer were vsed in Gods churche, for discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an hereticall spirit from a Catholique.</p>
            <p>The onelie meanes of tryall whiche M. Chark will seme to allow, <note place="margin">

               </note> is the scripture: wherto onelie he wolde haue all triall referred: and that which can not be tryed therehence by hym, must stand vntryed. And then, as yf we refused all tryall of scripture, he vseth his pleasure in speche against vs. But this is a shyft common to all suche as M. Chark is. And the cause thereof I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare immediatlye. <note place="margin">

               </gap>f there errours, and denyeing all other meanes of tryall, whereby the true meaning of scripture may be knowen.</p>
            <p>The causes of this shyft in all new teachers are principally three. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>linge onelie to scripture</hi>
               </note> The first, to gett credit with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by naming of scripture, and to seme to honour it more than their aduersaries doe, by referring the whole triall of matters vnto it. The second is by excluding councels, fathers, and auncitours of the churche, (who from tyme to time haue declared the true sense of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture vnto vs,) to reserue vnto them selues libertie, and authoritie to make what meaning of Scripture they please, and thereby to gyue colour to euerye fansie they list to teache. The third cause is, that by chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of onelie scripture, they may delyuer them selues from all ordinances or doctrines left vnto vs by the


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14521:10"/>
first pillers of Christe his Church, thoughe not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selie sett downe in scripture: &amp; thereby assume autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of allowinge or not allowing, of comptrolling or permittinge, what soeuer liketh or serueth their turnes for the tyme. So, Martin Luther after he had denied all testimonie of man, besides hym selfe, he beginneth thus aboute the number of Sacramentes: <note place="margin">

VVherefore I maye perhaps (yf this booke come not otherwyse to be too greate) adde a short table or appendix in the end, to shew by examples the vnconstant dealings of our aduersaries herein, and that in verie dede, when all is done and sayd that may be, <note place="margin">

For those bookes onelie be scripture in the bible whiche they appoint: &amp; in those bookes, that onelie is the true sense whiche they gyue out: the fathers erred in all things where they differ from them: the new doctors, (as Luther, Caluin, and the rest) sawe so much onelie, of the truthe, as they agree with them, and no further. This is the sayeing of our aduersaries: this is the saying of all the other sectaries of our time: this hathe bene the sayeinge of all heretiques from the beginninge: and this muste needes be the sayeinge of all heretiques for the time to come.

The same waye of triall he vseth, and muche more at large, in hys hundred three skore and fyueth epistle, where he reckoneth vpp all the byshopps of Rome from Peter vnto Anastasius (whiche was byshop in his tyme,) and thinketh this a good proofe against the donatists, that none of those held or fauoured theyr opinion.

               </note> the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re be two conditions to be obserued of his part whiche will obiect an olde heresie to an other. The first is, that the partie doe in dede holde that thinge whiche he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth, and not a certaine likeliehoode of it. For that were to slaunder, and not to obiect. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iniurious dealinge of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</hi>
               </note> As when oure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries doe obiect to vs the heresie of Pelagius abowt free will, it is a mere slaunder. For we holde that mans will beinge preuented and holpen with the grace of God may woorke well: but he helde that it could do the same by the power and force of nature, without the helpe of gods grace, as S Augustin proueth at large in his booke of free will. The like iniurie they doe vs, in many other things, which they obiect against vs: as the heresie of those whiche dyd sacrifice to our ladie, and the like, whiche we doe not. The second condition is that the heresie obiected be in dede suche as was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted and condemned for an heresie, in the primatiue churche, and not onelie that an heretique held it. For heretiques doe holde diuerse truethes alwayes together withe falsehode: And for lack of this condition doe our aduersaries often abuse the simple people. As M. Fulke oftentimes sayeth: prayer for the deade is an heresie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Montanists (which were heretiques) helde it. But lett hym proue that euer this was accompted one of Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tanus hys heresies, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he proueth somewhat. But

And I heere saye again, that lett hym and all the protestants in the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de proue, that we doe holde in dede, but anie one thing, which was acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted an heresie in the primatiue church, &amp; we will graunt that we are not the Catholique Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, but that in all other things we erre besides.</p>

The lyke we doe about vigilantius: whose opinions were (among others) that Saints were not to be prayed to, nor their reliques to be honored: Now that the protestants hold this, no man dowteth: And that this was accompted he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie in the primatiue churche, <note place="margin">

this way of triall.</p>
            <p>The last way of triall (whereof I will speake at this time) is to consider the maners of olde heretiques, <note n="9" place="margin">

where are nowe the lies and hipocrisie you talked of? on which parte doe they appeare?

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next after the matter of disputation, M. Charke taketh an other thing in greefe, and that is, that the Censure should saye: <hi>seing there can be had nothing from them but vvoordes &amp;c.</hi> And for hym selfe, he referreth men to his answer. But for M. Hanmer he answereth, that he hathe brought more reason with his woords, than may well be answered by me. But suppose all this were true, and that bothe his woordes and M. Hanmers also were reasonable woordes: yet are they but woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in respect of the desired disputation, whiche is a deede. And so me thinke the Censure doeth offer them no iniurie. But how reasonable M. Charks woordes are, it appeared partlie by the Censure, and shall doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by this defence. For M. Hanmer, <note place="margin">of M.

But yet, as I omitted hym not in the Censure when occasion was offered: so will I not in this defence: allthough finallie I must confesse, that albeit I am not willing to increase a proude humour where alredie it doeth abounde: yet doe I attribute more to M. Chark, than to hym, for some discretion in answering to the purpose.</p>
               <p>But, for that M. Charke will needes so frendelie take vpon hym the avouchement of M.

And for traditions, they holde that yf they be suche traditions as came from Christ and his Apostles: then is the wilfull breakinge of suche traditions, sinne directlye against God hym selfe. But yf they be but traditions or precepts of the churche: then the breache therof (as also of all other our superiours commandementes) are offences against men: but yet consequentely also against God: for that he hath commaunded men to obey theyr superiours, whiche rule them, and that in conscience as S.

yt appeareth euidentlie by his whole discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se in the place alleaged: where he sayeth plainlie (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side other things) that the papists dyd seeke aduaunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge against hym for this opinion of his, and to that ende dyd misreporte his woordes (as he sayeth:) besides, you knowe that papists teache no suche doctrine, but the plain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, &amp; therfore he coulde not <hi>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dare literis</hi> as his woordes are that he did: that is, he coulde not <hi>put in vvriting &amp; publishe suche a doctrine among vs,</hi> but he wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de haue bene resisted presentlie, yf he had bene of our churche at that tyme.

One called Brulle of the towne of Ostune, being made a protestant, came with his wyfe to dwell at Geneua, and for that he was but poore, he procured many letters in his commendation to Caluin, for his releefe of the common purse, which he obtained. And being therby, made a fast frende vnto hym, and verie familiar: Caluin on a time bracke with hym and his wyfe, in a matter of great secrecie, whiche might turne the gospell to great credit, and them selues to great gaine, if they wolde doe it faythfullie. And this was, that the husband shoulde feyne hym selfe sicke, &amp; so to dye, and that he wolde seeme (by the woord of the Lord) to rayse hym agayne.

                  <p>And as this man was busie a brode, so was he not Idle at home, in establyshing his owne dominion, in Geneua.

The like he dyd by an other called Gaigneur, and for the same purpose, he caused the Lord of Pacye (though a protestant) to leese his head, without all cause, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweing herein his Maister Caluin, whoe had a facilitie in cutting of all them which any way resisted hym. For this ende also he ioyned gladlie with all straungers, that fledd to that citie, for the same or lyke causes as he had done him selfe: that is, for horrible wickednesse. For that he was sure, that suche men durst neuer goe home againe, and therfore must nedes be fast freendes vnto hym: that is, as he calleth them Zelous folowers of the ghospell. So the fore named Ville-mongis flyeing to Geneua for hauing counterfayted the kyngs seale (as I haue sayd) became most Zelous vpon the sodaine: <note place="margin">

So the Ladye of Clells in Dolphinie runnyng awaye in her husbands absence, with one countie Iulio of Atien, an Italian, whoe had

                  <p>The like happened in one Contour, a notable adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, whoe toke awaye the wyfe of one Pise, a Citizen of Mascon, and brought her to Geneua, and nether the Citizen nor anye freends that euer he coulde make, could gett anye iustice or restitution of that wyfe: but that vnder pretence of zeale to the gospell, bothe were maintayned in Geneua, against all reason, conscience, &amp; honestie, she hauing left many childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with her former husband, desolate by her departure. And all this is done by the counsaile, doctrine, and authoritie of Monsieur Beza now in Geneua: whoe hauing entered there with his maister Caluin for refuge of their fylthe, (as hath bene declared) haue reformed the Citie to their owne humours, &amp; haue made yt a receptacle for all desperat and monstruouse malefactors in the worlde.</p>

And this was the sinne of Hely, and of the watchemen before mentioned: whereof: the one determined not to punishe his childeren, and the other not to sounde the trompet, though they sawe the enemie comming, as the text sheweth. Secondlie, I may omitt this goeing to the churche at the hower appointed, not vpon any resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to the contrarie: but for that I doe sett my selfe to doe some other action at that time, (as to write, or the lyke) whereby I doe occupie vp the time wherein I should goe to churche, and so doe committ that omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion without any particular resolution, that I will not goe: and in this case the action of writing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in the tyme when I should haue gone to churche, is the indirect cause of this omission, and the grounde of the same, being done wittinglie at suche time as it should not.

For that, <hi>natura &amp; volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> are distinct agents: as he ought to haue learned in philosophie. Secondlie, it is false, that all fyrst motions of lust are meerlie naturall. For in lewed men they are often voluntarie: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fyrst mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions volun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tarie some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</hi>

In all whiche cases, though the motions of lust that ryse, be naturall in the roote, as diuines tearme it: yet is their nearest and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat

                     </note> and therfore are they not meerlie naturall. A playne example heerof may be this: that, if a furious dogge should lye a sleep, &amp; one should a-wake hym purposelye, knoweing the daunger, and so should be bytten of hym: this hurt might be sayde to proceed from the dogges nature, as from the roote or fyrst cause: But the immediate cause therof was the mans voluntarie awaking of hym, and not the dogges nature. So in the first motions of lust, though all be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall in the roote, or first cause of concupiscence, and many times they doe rise of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues in the most god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that are, without any cause gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (&amp; therfore sayeth M.

VVhiche I graunt without proofe. But yet in this one reason he vttereth three fowle absurdities, and most grosse errours.</p>
                  <p>The first is that he placeth concupiscence of the fleshe (wherof we talke) in the reasonable parte of the mynde, <note place="margin">

                     </note> and not in the sensityue parte: which is as much, as yf a man should appoint seeyng to be in the nose, &amp; smellyng to be in the eyes. For the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And yf we consent, they are sinnes: but yf we consent not, but vanquishe them: they are cause of merit and rewarde in heauen: though the motions them selues, be infirmities and spottes left in vs by originall sinne. And this maketh men to stryue and resist them, and to keepe their myndes cleare from consent, and finallie to stand stronglie in the spirituall battaill betwene the fleshe tempting, and the spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting: wherin the protestant fighteth not at all, for that he hath no hope of victorie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The second reason is, for that S.

                     </note>
Austen doe expound this place: S. Paules meanyng is to putt an antithesis or differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene corporall exercise &amp; pietie: sayeing, that the one is but litle profitable, but the other (that is godlynes) hath her promysse of rewarde in all actions, taken ether for this lyfe, or for the lyfe to come: Out of all (I say) she reapeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, and is profitable. For in all actions, whiche are taken in hand for charitie and loue of God (whiche is true pietie:) therin is merit and rewarde, whether the actions be about matters of this


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14521:98"/>
lyfe, or of the lyfe to come. And whoe wolde say heere that profitable signifieth sufficient?</p>
                  <p>His second reason he frameth in these woordes, vpon the place of S. Paul before alleaged: <hi>that vvhiche is profitable to all the partes that may be required to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can not be but sufficient for the perfection of the vvhole: but that the scripture is profitable in suche maner, the Apostle doeth fullie declare, in rehearsing all the particular partes vvhiche are necessarie: as to confute, to correct, and instruct in iustice: ergo the scripture is sufficient.</hi> God help you (M. Charke:) I assure you: you are a simple one to take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies in hand. VVhat boye in Cambrige wold euer haue reasoned thus? If you had sayed, that whiche is sufficient to all the partes in particular, is sufficient to the whole: you had sayed somewhat. But how foloweth it, that what soeuer is profitable to all particular partes, should be sufficient to all? haue you not Learned that there is <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> whiche is not one he profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but also necessarie to all partes, wherof it is such a cause: and yet is not sufficient alone, ether to the partes or to the whole? As (for example,) the heade is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea necessarie to all the actions of this lyfe, as to sing, weepe, dispute, and the lyke: for without a heade none can be done: and yet is not the head sufficient alone to performe these actions: as we see by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. For that euery one whiche hath a heade is not able to doe these thinges.</p>
                  <p>Hys thyrd reason and argument is taken from the woordes of S. Paul immediatlie goeinge before in the place now alleaged to Timothie: whiche are these, <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>for that thou hast learned the holye scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ures from thy infancie, vvhiche can instruct thee to saluation, throughe the faythe vvhich is in Iesus Christ.</hi> Loe (sayeth M. Charke) heer the scriptures are sayed to be sufficient to saluation. But I denye this. For the Apostle sayeth they can instruct Timothie, and shew him the waye to saluation, and can bryng hym also to it, yf he will folow them. But doeth it folowe heerby that they are sufficient for the whole churche? and in such sort as all doctrine by tradition is


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14521:99"/>
superfluous? Euerie epistle of S. Paul instructeth a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to saluation, &amp; wolde also bryng any man to heauen, that shoulde folow the same exactlie. But is therfore euerie epistle of S. Paul sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the whole Church? (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of onelie our question is) and are all other supe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fluous? Againe, it is to be noted, that S. Paul speaketh heere principallie of the olde testament. For he speaketh of the scriptures which Timothie (beyng nowe a byshope) had learned from his infancie: whiche was before the newe testament was wryten. And will M. Charke saye, that the olde testament is sufficient to Christian men (such as Timothie now was) for their saluation, without any other write? You see this man lyke the hare in the nett: the more he struggleth, the more he encombreth and intangleth hym selfe.</p>
                  <p>To my two reasons in the Censure, to proue that S. Paul in the place alleaged spoke not onelye of all the whole scripture together, but also of euery particular booke therof, (whiche notwitstandinge can not be sayed to be sufficient of it selfe without other) he answereth in effect nothinge: but for excuse of his fraudulent translating <hi>Omnis scriptura: all scripture</hi>: where as he translated <hi>omne opus bonum, euerie good vvoorke,</hi> euen in the same sent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yf there be ordinarilie such a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and your selfe obseruing the same in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parte of the same sentence: why you showld alter your translation in the second part therof, I can not imagine, except you mente fraude.</p>
                  <p>But now to my two reasons. In the first, I saye that S. Paul coulde not meane to Timothie of all the scriptures together which we now vse. For that, all was not then written: as the Gospell of S. Iohn, and some


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14521:99"/>
other partes. To this he answereth, that there was enou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh written then, for the sufficient saluation of men of that tyme, and that the other partes added afterwarde were not superfluous. But this is from the purpose. For I graunt, that in all tymes when there was least writen vvord, yet was there sufficient for the peoples saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that tyme. For God supplied it otherwyse: that is, by woorde of mouthe vnwritten. And this maketh for vs: for in suche tymes the written woord was not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without all other helpes as you affirme it is: as (for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) when onelie S. Mathewes Gospell was written, and nothing els of the new testament: yet graunt I, that this scripture was sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for that tyme. For that, God sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied yt otherwyse, by the woordes and speeches of his apostles. So before Moyses wrote the lawe, the patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had sufficient for theyr saluation: thoughe they had ether nothinge, or verie litle writen woorde. And yet you can not saye, that the written woorde of that tyme was sufficient of it selfe, without all tradition by mouth. VVerfore this answere is against your selfe, as also that is, whiche you frame to the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reason: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that albeit dyuers partes of scripture be wanting now, whiche was in S. Pauls tyme: yet still it is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whiche I denye not, being ioyned to the other supplies that God vseth. For God supplieth by tradition and woorde of mouthe. <note place="margin">

Epiph in haer.</hi> 61.</note> But whether in all tymes the onelie written woord, that is extant, be sufficient of it selfe to the whole Churche, without all other helpes deliuered by tradition: that is our question. And of times past, when the law was not written, no man without impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie can affirme, that the written woorde was then sufficient. And of our tyme, that is, after the writinge of the new testament, Epiphanius sayeth:
<q>Non omnia a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uina scriptura accipt possunt, quapropter aliqua in scripturis, aliqua in traditione sancti. Apostoli tradiderunt.</q>
                     <q>All things necessarie, can not be had from the scripture: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holie Apostles left vnto vs some thinges writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and some thinges by tradition.

But what should I doe heere with VV.

And the cause heerof is (as often hath beene noted before) for that the quoting of Canisius, according as he found hym quoted in his author, wolde haue discouered the lye, which M.

The</hi> 70. <hi>folovv the rest.</hi> Heere you see that M. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Charke bryngeth diuers reasons for his defense. First, that he hath diuers Bybles in his house, and that of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> diuers translations. Secondlie, that the original or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text of this verse in the Psalme, hath <hi>not immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata</hi>: that is, vndefiled or vnspoted: but rather perfect, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that sense as he defendeth it. Thirdlie, that all the best translations haue it so: and that our olde translation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> differeth from them all. Fouerthlie, that the septuagint or seuentie greke interpretours are also against vs here in. This is all M. Charkes defense.</p>
                  <p>But here by the waye wolde I haue the reader to Marke, how muche M. Charke getteth to hys cause.


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14521:108"/>
Yf I should graunt hym all that he hathe here sayd: su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie he should gayne onelie, that the law of God, is perfect. And is this against any thinge that we saye or holde? or is it against the signification of the woord <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculata</hi> in the olde latin translation, whiche he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth? Is not a thinge immaculate or vndefiled also, called perfect? euen as on the contrarie, a filthie or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thinge, is called imperfect? If then we should graunt that the hebrew and greeke textes had the woord <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> in them, in steed of the latin woord <hi>immaculata</hi>: yet this dothe not condemne the olde translation for vsing the woord <hi>immaculata,</hi> immaculate. For that <hi>immaculate</hi> (as hath bene shewed) signifieth also perfect from spot: mary not perfect in that sense, wherin M. Charke talke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th: and for proofe wherof he alleaged this sentence: to witt, that because the law of the lorde is perfect, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the scripture can not be wrested: whiche is a most false and absurd illation vppon the worde perfect. For S. Paules epistles are persect together withe other scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: and yet S. Peter sayeth that many men dyd wrest and depraue them. <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> But now lett vs consider the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fower pointes of M. Charkes former answer, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che (as yow see) if wee should graunt vnto him, without contradiction, yet had he gayned nothing therby. But lett vs examine them.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first whiche he answereth: that is, abowt the varietie of Bybles and translations, which he hath at home, I will not stand or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend with M. Chark. Let hym haue as many as he please: the matter is, howe well he vnderstandeth, or reporteth those Bybles, and not how many he hath. The second poynt is false, that the hebrew text disagreeth from the olde latin transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as shalbe shewed after. The thyrd is fond, that all the best translations doe differe from the olde transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heerin. <note place="margin">
