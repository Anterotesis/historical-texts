            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis licentious Age doth abound with ſo many <hi>unclean Spirits, like Frogs, Rev.</hi> 16. 13. As not only creep into Kings Palaces, as the Frogs of <hi>Egypt</hi> did into the King's very Chamber, to croak in his Face, and to crawl on his Boſom, when neither Walls not Weapons, Barrs nor Bolts, could keep them out, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 1, 3, 4, 6. But dare alſo croak <hi>there</hi> with their continual <hi>[Breke, ke kex coax coax]</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> phraſeth it) out of their black Mouths, and beſpatter ſome principal Peers of our Realm, for no other Fault, but becauſe they deſire,</p>

               <l>Their Sov'raign to preſerve, theſe Kingdoms free,</l>
               <l>From popiſh Cut-Throats, and <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Slavery.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thoſe Spiritual Fathers (the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are the Pope's <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Diaboli crepitus,</hi> the laſt <hi>Crack-Fart</hi> of a daring Devil) are called <hi>Frogs,</hi> for their Loquacity, Impudency, and Impurity. 'Tis a thouſand pities, that the famous <hi>White-Hall,</hi> ſhould harbour any ſuch <hi>Black-mouth'd</hi> Creatures, with all thoſe three <hi>Black-brands</hi> upon them; I dare ſay, 'tis not <hi>cum Privilegio,</hi> as the dirty Dogs do bark at the ſplendid Moon, which yet keeps her Courſe, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues her Luſtre, <hi>notwithſtanding their Barking:</hi> So thoſe croaking Frogs do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to darken ſome Stars of the firſt magnitude in our Britiſh Sphere, with their Out-cryes againſt them; yet I doubt not, but thoſe Noble Peers will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Grandeur and Splendour, <hi>notwithſtanding their Croaking.</hi> 'Tis a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pities, ſuch <hi>Scandalum magnatum</hi> may now ſculk ſo under unknown Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queradoes, as to ſcape Scot-free with their pretended Letters from <hi>Scotland,</hi> (though writ at home) againſt ſuch NoblePeers, and Loyal States-men. <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Frog is deemed an able and couragious Champion, that durſt encounter the ſilly Mouſe, and run a Tilt at him with a Bull-ruſh for his Spear; but this <hi>Pamphleteer</hi> is a bolder Frog, yea a more daring Devil, (or unclean Spirit) who dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter no leſs then ſixteen at once, (when <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf durſt not contend with two at one time, <hi>Ne Hercules contra duos)</hi> and thoſe ſixteen all great Peers of the Land: This is an Enterpriſe <hi>dignum tanto,</hi> worthy of a poor Frog to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake. Aſſuredly he conceited himſelf to be that other Frog of <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s, who would needs ſwell and ſtretch himſelf out, till he became as big as an Ox; but the iſſue was, he brake himſelf all aſunder, and ſo periſhed. The like Fate may in due time befal this <hi>Bombaſting Bragadocio,</hi> and over bold undertaker. Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he fancied himſelf of the Off-ſpring of thoſe, (the Poet mentioned) who waged War againſt <hi>Jove</hi> himſelf, <hi>(ſubjectum Pelion Oſſae</hi> &amp;c.

Or laſtly, he might imagine himſelf to deſcend from the <hi>Zamzummims, Deut.</hi> 2. 20. Thoſe big and boiſtrous Men, that durſt bid defiance to the true <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and challenge him to a Duel, whom yet the Lord deſtroyed before <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This <hi>Thraſonical</hi> Libeller feareth none of theſe Fates, daring to outdare both God and Man, yea great, and the greateſt of Men: And if he falls in his Eſſay, (as fond <hi>Phaeton</hi> did in his) with my conſent he ſhall have <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s Epitaph writ upon his Tomb, (may he be capable of that Honour) only with change of the Name and Employ:</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>roes</hi> all at once, and that with no better a Weapon than that Spear of the Frog aforeſaid, to wit, a poor Bulruſh? All his Arguments he urgeth againſt them are not worth a Ruſh, and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Bulruſh, as the Sequel evidenceth.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation whereof, looſeth my long ſilent Tongue, (as danger did the dumb Son of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> who all on the ſudden cryed out, <hi>kill not King Croeſus).

One that caſteth ſo much Dirt upon them, is in the high way to be deſtroyed, and the Nobles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not much damag'd thereby? For if Dirt be caſt upon a Mud-Wall, it may poſſibly ſtick, but it cannot do ſo upon Marble.</p>
            <p>This ſcurrilous Libeller (as ſuſpecting his own ſtrength in his Eſſay) doth ſupplie with Policy his want of power and proweſs.</p>

            <p>He therefore firſt ſingleth out the Noble Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (that brave Patriot for his King and Kingdom,) as their Forlorn Hope, which could he but rout, then will he fall foul upon the main Body, that ſtood in a double File, or two in a Rank behind him. And in purſuance of this project he firſt aſſaults that ſingle Earl, with ſubtile Inſinuations, dipping his Nail (he had to drive) in Oil, to make it drive the deeper, not only to the Head, but to the Heart alſo. Thus like the Devil (he accoſts the Earl with <hi>Flattering,</hi> before he come to his <hi>Frowning</hi> Work, which he comes to in the ſecond place. Not only frowning upon the Earl, in telling him that he threatens his Majeſty (which his humble offer of Advice (as he ſaith there) can in no Grammatical ſence without notorious wreſting be interpreted) but alſo in giving that Noble Peer <hi>(Tantamont)</hi> the Lie, in upbraiding him with his weak Obſervation without the leaſt ground in Hiſtory, as if this obſcure Whiffl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>However, he craftily quotes <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chronicle only, and becauſe he there found nothing of the Parliament at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the II.'s Time, therefore he affronts the Earl with telling an Untruth: and he ſaith, the cauſe of that King's Unhappineſs was from <hi>ambitious</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

(both of them true Sons of the Church, and under Prelatical Order) he would have found there, that the Parliament was called at <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to retrench the Enormities of the Clergy, where the Foundation of a Feud was laid, not ſo much 'twixt him and any ambitious Nobles, (as the Pamphlet hinteth) as betwixt him, and that Traitor-Saint, <hi>Becket,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was a ſtubborn Patronizer of the debauched Clergy, with whom that King had many Bickerings; and 'twas not the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Lords (as this Whiffler ſaith) but this proud Spiritual Lord, <hi>Becket,</hi> who fomented the Difference betwixt this King, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King, <hi>Fuller, p.</hi> 33. with whom his own Son <hi>Henry</hi> ſided againſt him, <hi>p.</hi> 40. And as to <hi>Henry</hi> the III. this Pamphleteer might have conſulted the two fore-named Authors, as well as <hi>Baker,</hi> and there he would have found like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſomething of an <hi>Inſanum Parliamentum</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which proved prejudicial to Regality, <hi>Prideaux, p.</hi> 322. and how his immoderate and exaſperating Favours caſt upon Strangers drew on the Barons Wars; and that the King's Non-age, after his Full-age, (ſuch was his Weakneſs of Spirit, and Lowneſs of Reſolution) was a great Cauſe of his Trouble, <hi>Fuller, ut ſupra, p.</hi> 55. who further ſaith, That the Barons had then too much Matter whereon juſtly to ground their Diſcontent; partly, becauſe the King, diſtruſting his own Native Subjects, employed ſo many French Forreigners in Places of Power and Profit; and partly, becauſe he had uſed ſuch indirect Courſes to recruit his Treaſuries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> More at large, <hi>Fuller, ibid. p.</hi> 66. <hi>Sect.</hi> 33. Yet was he happy in this, to redreſs all his Errors before he died, <hi>Sect.</hi> 38. granting that good <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. our Libeller ſhuffles that up, and never quotes <hi>Baker,</hi> (as he might have done) who tells us, how the Duke of <hi>York</hi> firſt began to whiſper for the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 188 <hi>Col.</hi> 2. then ſecondly, made his way to the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 190. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. After all this, takes the Oath of Allegiance to <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. <hi>p.</hi> 192. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. whom he caſt out of his Throne, (notwithſtanding his Oath of Fidelity two ſeveral times,) there being no leſs than four Changes in his Reign. But not a word of this muſt we hear from him, leſt that ſhould create the like Fears about the Duke of <hi>York</hi> at this time: For then did <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York (Edward</hi> the IV.'s Father) get it confirmed by Parliament, to be Heir Apparent of the Crown; and this is the great Conteſt of this Day. Neither doth he mention that Parliament held at <hi>Coventry,</hi> (which that Honourable Lord in his Humble Addreſs hinteth at) wherein the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was convicted of High-Treaſon, and all his Lands and Goods confiſcate to the King. This alſo had a <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> upon it, as being, like the afore-ſaid, unſuitable to his Deſign, tho his <hi>Baker,</hi> whom he only quotes, do ſpeak fully to all this, <hi>p.</hi> 396. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>As to the Body of the Petition, I obſerve, this Libeller is a faſt Friend to the plotting Papiſts, and would give us a Diverſion from that kind of Cattel to the Presbyterians, (whom he judges Far worſe) as if he had an hand in the Meal-Tub Intrigue.</p>
