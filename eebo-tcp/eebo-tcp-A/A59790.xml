         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Answer to the Request to Protestants,</head>
            <head type="sub">(a) To produce Plain Scriptures directly Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
these their Tenets.</head>
            <p>(a) Ans. WE do indeed make the Scripture the
Rule of our Faith, because we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
God gave us the Scripture to
be our Rule, and we know not
where to meet with a better; and
therefore we do not quarrel at this Request to produce plain
Scripture proofs for what we believe; but we may justly
quarrel at the fallacious or unskilful way of stating it, as
if we pretended to own no Doctrines, but what are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the express Words of Scripture; and therefore, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this matter, we must consider the several kinds
of Doctrines professed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and what
kind of proof from Scripture, they are capable of.</p>
            <p>1st, The positive Articles of Faith, such as are contained
in the Creed, and expresly taught in Scripture, we prove
from plain and express Testimonies of Scripture, and are
ready to give our proofs of them, when they are demanded.
But besides these, <hi>2ly,</hi> we have a great many Negative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
opposed to the Corruptions and Innovations of the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Now to believe a Negative, is only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that such a Doctrine is not taught in Scripture; and
it would be a very wise Request, to desire us to prove by
plain and express Scripture, that such a Doctrine is not
taught in Scripture. We believe it is not there, because
we cannot find it in Scripture, and those who pretend it is
there, cannot shew it there; which is proof enough, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98153:3"/>
all that the thing is capable of. <hi>3ly,</hi> There are other Doctrines,
which, it may be, are not in a strict Sense, Articles of Faith,
but great and useful Truths, which cannot be proved by
express Words of Scripture, but by immediate and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Consequence; and it is ridiculous in these Cases, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a <hi>direct</hi> Proof, if by that he means the express words
of Scripture, for we never pretended to that in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but think it very reasonable to believe an evident
Consequence, as well as express Words. Since our Saviour
proved the Resurrection it self by Consequence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.
32. Having premised this, I shall examine, what it is he
would have proved, in which also he has betrayed great
want either of skill or honesty, as will appear from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> Scripture is clear, in all Necessaries, to every Sober En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He begins well with demanding a Scripture proof;
That the <hi>Scripture is clear in all Necessaries;</hi> as if we Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
wanted a Scripture proof, that the Sun shines, when we
see it. Can there be any better proof, that the Scripture
is clear and plain, than its own plainness? And therefore,
every plain Text proves its own plainness? If this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Scripture is clear in all Necessaries, to every Sober En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer,</hi>
were contained in express Words in Scripture; yet
if we could not find it plain, we should rather question,
whether those Words are plain, than believe the Scripture to
be plain, when we do not find it so. But if I find the Scripture
plain, the plainness of the Scripture proves it self, and needs
no other proof. And yet this is one of those Propositions,
which may be proved by plain and necessary Consequence
from the Scripture. For if the <hi>word of God be a Light unto
our Feet, and a Lamp unto our Paths,</hi> then it must be clear, if
Light be clear, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105. If it <hi>be able to make men wise
unto Salvation,</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 15. then it must be plain and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
in all things necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98153:3"/>
               <hi>II.</hi> The Secular Prince hath all Spiritual Jurisdiction and
Authority, immediately, from and under God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> What Authority the Church of <hi>England</hi> grants to
Kings in matters of Religion, which he here calls all <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Jurisdiction, and Authority,</hi> we are taught in the <hi>37th</hi>
Article of Religion: <hi>The Kings Majesty hath the chief power
in this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and other his Dominions, unto whom
the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they
be Ecclesiastical or Civil in all causes doth appertain, and is
not, and ought not to be subject to any foreign Jurisdiction.</hi>
Which is further explained, <hi>That we give not our Princes,
the Ministring of God's Word, or of the Scraments,—but
that only Prerogative which we see to have been given always to
all Godly Princes in Holy Scriptures by God himself, that is, that
they should rule all Estates and Degrees committed to their
charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and
restrain with the Civil Sword the stubborn and evil doers.</hi>
Which signifies no more, than that the King is supreme in
his own Dominions, and therefore there is no Power, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Secular nor Ecclesiastick above him; for if there were,
he were not Supreme; Must we then prove by express Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that the King is Supreme? Do men want Scripture to
prove, That Supreme Power is Supreme? Thus some men
are always in the Extremes, either the Scripture signifies
nothing, or it must be every thing, Grammar, and Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary
and Logick, and Statute-book, and all; but can they
prove by express Scripture, that the King has the Supreme
power in Civil causes? Then I will prove, That he has the
Supreme power in Ecclesiastical causes; and I think <hi>Rom.
13. 1. Let every Soul be subject to the Higher Powers,</hi> is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
proof of both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> Justification by Faith alone (<hi>viz.</hi> a Persuasion that we
are justified) is a wholesome Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Our Church does teach,</hi> That Justification by Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is a most wholesome Doctrine, and very full of comfort, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98153:4"/>
II. but she does not teach,</hi> That justifying Faith is a
persuasion, that we are justified; <hi>and sure we are not bound
to prove that by Scripture, which we do not believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV.</hi> The Substance of Bread and Wine remains after, what
it was before, Sacerdotal Consecration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Our Church teaches, That <hi>Transubstantiation (or the
change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of
the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ,</hi> Art. 28. But she
does not teach, That <hi>the Bread and Wine remain after, what
they were before Sacerdotal Consecration.</hi> Their substance is
the same, that is, they are Bread and Wine still, but by
virtue of Christ's Institution, after Consecration they are not
meer Bread and Wine, but <hi>a Sacrament of our Redemption by
Christ's death, and to such as rightly, worthily, and by faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the same, the Bread which we break, is a partaking of
the Body of Christ, and likewise the cup of blessing is a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Blood of Christ.</hi> The substance of Bread and
Wine is the same, but the Institution gives it such a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and use, as is equivalent to changing its nature, and
makes it the Sacramental Body and Blood of Christ. And
this the words of Institution are an express proof of, <hi>This is
my Body;</hi> for if it be not his Natural Body, as sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
tell us it cannot be, then it must be only his Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Body, or his Body by Institution. Christ was visibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with his Apostles in his own Natural Body, when he
instituted this Sacrament, and therefore they could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
and our Saviour could never intend they should
believe, that the Bread which he blessed and brake, was his
Natural Body, which they saw before their eyes; that they
ate their Lord, when they are the Consecrated Bread, that
they swallowed him down into their stomachs, and yet all
this while saw him, and conversed with him, as they did at
other times. The Bread is the Body of Christ, but it is his
broken Body, which it could not be at the Institution of this
Sacrament; for Christ was not then Crucified, his Natural
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98153:4"/>
Body was not yet broken, and therefore the broken bread,
though it was his Sacramental, could not be his Natural
Body; his Blood was not then shed, and therefore though
the Wine was <hi>his Blood of the New Testament,</hi> it could not
be his Natural Blood which is shed for the remission of sins,
unless his Natural Body was broken, and his Blood shed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was crucified. Now I take that to be the express sense
of Scripture, which is the only sense that can be made of
it; for a sense in which it is impossible, is none at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> Our Lord's Presence in or with the Eucharist is meerly
gracious and influential; and, if more, only to the Faithful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is no such Proposition as this taught by the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> that I know of; we own the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Divine Grace to accompany the external admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Lord's Supper; and this I suppose, they will
not put us to prove. We own the Sacramental Body and
Blood of Christ, that is, the Consecrated Elements, to be
really present upon the Altar, and <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> eaten
of the Faithful; for so our Saviour expresly tells us, <hi>This is
my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood;</hi> and this is somewhat more
than to say, that <hi>our Lord's Presence in or with the Eucharist
is meerly gracious and influential:</hi> for so he is present in all
other Religious Duties; but here he is so present, that his
Body and Blood, with all the benefits of his Death and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
are exhibited to worthy Receivers, as much as they
could have been, had we eat his Natural flesh, and drank
his blood. And therefore whatever difference they would
allow, between Christ's gracious and influential presence in
the Eucharist, and eating his Natural flesh and blood, had
that been possible, the same we allow between his gracious
Presence, and eating his Sacramental Body, which is to all
the ends and purposes of a Sacrament, the same by his own
Institution, with his Natural flesh and blood; for the carnal
feeding on Christ's flesh, is not a Sacramental eating of him</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98153:5"/>
But if by <hi>more</hi> he means, that Christ is corporally present
in the Eucharist, that his natural Flesh and Blood is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the Species of Bread and Wine, this we deny, and
it being a Negative Article, it is ridiculous, as I observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to demand express Scripture, to prove that it is not in
the Scripture; let those, who affirm it, prove by express
Scripture, that it is there; for <hi>this is my Body, and this is
my Blood,</hi> will not do it: We own, that it is the Body and
Blood of Christ, as well as they; and therefore they must
prove, that it is Christ's natural Body and Blood, and it is
well for them, that they have something else than Scripture
to trust to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VI.</hi> Adoration of the Eucharist (<hi>i. e.</hi> of our Saviour under
the Species of Bread and Wine) is Idolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Nor is there any such Proposition as this taught in the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> We teach indeed, that Bread and Wine
in the Eucharist, remains Bread and Wine after Consecration,
and that to adore Bread and Wine is Idolatry, as <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
themselves confess, and is easily proved from Scripture,
if to give Divine Worship to Creatures be Idolatry. To adore
our Saviour is not Idolatry, but to adore Bread and Wine for
our Saviour may be as much Idolatry, as to worship the Sun
for God. But this Author puts a fallacy upon his Readers,
by an explanatory Parenthesis, <hi>Adoration of the Eucharist</hi>
(i. e. <hi>of our Saviour under the Species of Bread and Wine</hi>) as if
they only worshipped our Saviour under the Species of Bread
and Wine; whereas they teach that the Species themselves
(whatever they be,<note place="margin">See the late Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse of the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Host, p. 8, 9. &amp;c.</note> to be sure, not Christ himself) are to
be worshipped together with Christ; and therefore, according
to their own Doctrine, they must worship something which
is not Christ. And let them consider, what name to give this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VII.</hi> All Christians, whenever they communicate, are oblig'd
to receive in both Kinds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> And why does he not ask us to prove, That <hi>all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
whenever they communicate, are obliged to receive the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98153:5"/>
bread?</hi> For there is the same Institution for the Wine, that
there is for the Bread. There is no other rule in matters of
Institution, but to observe the Institution; and since the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
was instituted in both kinds, and neither Christ nor
his Apostles have told us, that it is sufficient to receive in one
kind, we think this reason enough to assert, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
when they do communicate, must communicate in
both kinds. And indeed this Sacrament is not compleat
without it; for if we consider it as a spiritual Feast, Wine as
well as Bread, to drink as well as to eat, is essential to a Feast;
if we consider the End of the Institution, to be a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Death of Christ, and the expiation of his Blood,
how can we commemorate Sacramentally the expiation of
his Blood, without drinking his Blood, which is shed for the
remission of sins? For to eat his Blood together with his
Flesh, as they pretend, does not represent his broken Body,
and his Blood shed, but his whole Body with Flesh and Blood
together, which contradicts the very Institution of this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
And if we partake of no benefits in the Sacrament, but
what we Sacramentally commemorate, I would desire this
Author to tell me, how those who do not drink the Blood
of Christ, <hi>this blood of the New Testament,</hi> obtain the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their sins? A very material thing for those to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
who would be sure of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VIII.</hi> Chastity, deliberately vow'd, may be, inoffensively, violated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This is no Doctrine of our Church, nor are Protestants
now concerned in it, though some of the Monks and Nuns
at the beginning of the Reformation were. There was no
such thing known as vowing Chastity, as that signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a Vow against Marriage; neither under the Law,
nor in the times of Christ and his Apostles; and therefore
we cannot expect in Scripture an express decision of this
matter, but must argue from the nature and obligation of
Vows. And if he please to consult the Writings of the first
Reformers, who were concerned to vindicate themselves in
this point, he will find it easier to condemn what they did,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98153:6"/>
than to answer the reasons, whereby they justifie it. These
Vows were never thought so Sacred, but that the Pope can
dispense with them; and what is dispensable, necessity will
dispense with on course; and that they themselves knew
best. These Monastick Vows were undertaken as the most
excellent state of Religion, as meritorious of pardon and
justification, which is a fulsom superstition and corruption of
Christianity, and therefore are void and null as all other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions
are. And if Monastick Vows, as such, do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige,
as no superstitions can; then they were free to use that
liberty, which God and Christ had allowed them. But who
taught him to call a Vow against Marriage, a Vow of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
when Marriage it self is a state of Chastity? And tho'
it be lawful to vow Chastity, which is a necessary duty, let
him prove, that it is lawful for any man, nay a boy, or girl,
to vow not to marry, when our Saviour himself tells us, this
is not in every mans power; and nothing can be a lawful
matter for a Vow, but what is in our power. Christ indeed
tells us of some, <hi>Who made themselves Eunuchs for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19. 12. that is, who voluntarily chose
a devout coelibacy, not who obliged themselves against
Marriage by the Religion of a Vow. But if the Vow of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
is so sacred, I hope, they keep it better now, than some
of their Predecessors have done; unless they think the Vow
of Chastity only obliges them not to marry, but does not
restrain them from a vagrant lust.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IX.</hi> All Christian Excellencies are commanded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This I think St. <hi>Paul</hi> has determined, Phil. 4. 8. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report,
if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these
things.</hi> If these general Expressions do not comprehend <hi>all
Christian Excellencies,</hi> I know not what does. And indeed,
whatever Virtues are commanded, we must always reckon
that the heights and perfections of those Virtues are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98153:6"/>
for God can command nothing less than a perfect Virtue;
and it is apparent, he has annexed no Limitations to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
for we are required <hi>to be perfect, even as our Father,
which is in Heaven, is perfect.</hi> Not that every man shall be
damned, who does not attain to the highest Perfections; for
through the Merits and Intercession of our Saviour, God will
accept of a sincere, tho imperfect Obedience; but sincerity it
self requires our endeavours after Perfection, which could not
be our duty, if it were not commanded; and tho a sincere
Christian shall be saved notwithstanding his many defects,
yet our reward shall be proportioned to our several Degrees
and Attainments in Virtue. Nothing is a <hi>Christian Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
but what is an instance of some Virtue, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
which will throw a great many meritorious
Works, which our Author had an eye on, out of this number,
and every degree and act of Virtue becomes more or less ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to us, according to our different Qualifications and
Circumstances of Life, according to our Saviours rule, <hi>to
whom much is given, of them shall be much required.</hi> These
uncommanded Christian Excellencies are what the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> call <hi>Works of Supererogation,</hi> which our Church has
condemned, Art. 14. in these words. <hi>Voluntary Works besides,
over and above Gods commandments, which they call Works of
Supererogation, cannot be taught without Arrogancy and Impiety.
For by them men do declare, that they do not only tender unto God
as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his
sake, than of baunded duty is required; whereas Christ saith
plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say,
that we are unprofitable Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>X.</hi> Every Soul, as soon as expired, is convey'd to Heaven or Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Scripture gives us no account of any other places
of rewards and punishments in the other World, but Heaven
and Hell, and therefore we know of no other. Our Church
has expresly determined, Art. 22. <hi>That the</hi> Romish <hi>Doctrine
of Purgatory, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98153:7"/>
God.</hi> Now, that there are no other places of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
but Heaven and Hell, and that there is no such
place as Purgatory, where the Souls of Men, who have any
Sins to expiate, are purged and tormented with Fire, are Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Articles, and therefore not to be proved by express and
positive Testimonies of Scripture. But that <hi>every Soul, as
soon as expired, is conveyed to Heaven or Hell,</hi> is only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from this Doctrine, that we know of no other place
they should go to after Death, the Scripture having not told
us of any other, and Christs parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s desire <hi>to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,</hi>
looking fairly that way. And yet our Church has not posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
determined this, in reverence, I suppose, to many of the
Ancient Fathers, who did assert an intermediate state between
Death and Judgment, not a Purgatory, where the Souls of
good Men were punished for their Sins, but a state of ease and
rest, tho not the highest Heavens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XI.</hi> Desiring the Intercessions of the Blessed, is more Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and Derogatory to our Lord's Mediatorship, than entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Prayers of Holy Men Militant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This is as plain in Scripture, as that Christ is our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mediator in Heaven, who alone (like the high Priest under
the Law, who was his Type) is admitted into the Holy of
Holies to make Expiation, and to interceed for us. As
great a difference as there is between the mutual Prayers of
good Men for each other on Earth, and the Intercession of
Saints for us in Heaven, by so much more does the Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Saints in Heaven invade the Office and Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Christ, than the Prayers of good Men on Earth. Good
men on Earth pray for each other as humble Supplicants,
as Members of the same Body, as subject to the same Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
Saints in Heaven intercede as powerful Favourites,
who by their merits and interest with God, obtain Blessings
for us; and any meritorious Intercession is inconsistent with the
only Mediatorship of Christ in Heaven. But suppose we
could not prove, that the Intercession of Saints in Heaven,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98153:7"/>
is any more inconsistent with the Mediatorship of Christ,
than the Prayers of good Men on Earth are; does this prove,
that we may pray to Saints with all the Solemnities of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
that we do to God or Christ, which is to give Divine
Honours to Creatures; tho he minces the matter, and calls it,
<hi>desiring the Intercessions of the Blessed;</hi> and might with as
good reason call his Prayers to Christ, only desiring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions
of Christ; and his Prayers to God, only desiring
some Blessings of God, as he does of his Frinds on Earth.
The sum of what we teach about this matter, is this. That
we must worship none but God, and therefore must not pray
to Saints and Angels, as our Saviour teaches, <hi>Thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi> That
there is but one Mediator between God and Man, the Man
Christ Jesus, and therefore we must not make more Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to our selves, nor put our trust in the Intercession of
Saints and Angels. Thus far we have plain Scripture proof.
And then we think common Sense teaches us the rest. That
it is an Injury to an <hi>only</hi> Mediator, to set up other Mediators
with him. That good Men on Earth are not Mediators, but
Supplicants, which is no encroachment of Christ's Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
and that Saints in Heaven, according to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> pray as Mediators and Intercestors, who appear in the
Presence of God for us; and this is not reconcilable with
Christ's only Mediatorship in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XII.</hi> Honouring the Cross, the Reliques and Representations of
our Lord and his Saints, with that degree of Reverence as we do
the Gospels, (commonly kiss'd and sworn by) Altar, and other
Sacred Utensils, is Idolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This is a very reasonable <hi>Request,</hi> to require us to prove
that by Scriture, which we do not believe! Papists indeed
would excuse that Worship, which they pay to the Cross, to
Reliques and Images, by saying, that it is no more than that
Reverence, which we allow to the Gospels, and Religious
Utensils, which is no more than an external Respect; but
do those, who charge them with Idolatry in worshipping the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98153:8"/>
Cross, and Reliques, and Images, charge them only with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some external Respects to them, or with giving them
formal acts of Worship and Adoration? As both the Decrees
of their Councils, and the visible Practice of their Church
proves: And if he would have this proved to be Idolatry,
he may meet with some Protestants, who will be ready to
oblige him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XIII.</hi> The Pope is Antichrist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This indeed has been affirmed by some Protestants, but
is no Article of our Church, and therefore we are not bound
to prove it, but when we have a mind to it. No man ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that there is any such Proposition in Scripture, as
that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is Antichrist, but some think that the
Characters of Antichrist and the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> are much more
applicable to him, than the Universal Headship and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XIV.</hi> Every Prayer, us'd in Divine Offices, must be in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
vulgar, and intelligible to every Auditor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Why he should put us upon proving this from Scripture,
I cannot tell, when he knows that St. <hi>Paul</hi> has a whole
Chapter to prove it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. unless he has some reserve in
expressing it by <hi>every Prayer.</hi> For that indeed, St. <hi>Paul</hi> does
not say in Words, but his Reason saies it. For if the Reason
he assigns against Prayers in an unknown Tongue, extend
to all Prayers; then it proves, that every publick Prayer
should be in a Language understood by the People. But what
is this to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who has all publick Offices
in an unknown Tongue? Yes, if they could prove it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>ever</hi> to pray in an unknown Tongue, they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
prove it lawful always to do so; and thus St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
discourse against praying in an unknown Tongue is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for want of saying that we must never pray in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Tongue. But whether it be not more reasonable to
conclude from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> discourse against praying in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Tongue, that we must never do so, than from his not
saying, that we must never pray in an unknown Tongue, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98153:8"/>
we may always do so, let any man judg, who has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
his own understanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XV.</hi> A Company of Christians, voluntarily separating from
all other Christian Societies, condemning their Doctrines and
Rites, destitute also of any visible Correspondence with them in
the Eucharist, in any Religious Assemblies or Solemn Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
can, notwithstanding this perverse, intire, and manifest Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
be a mystical Member of Christ, in Catholick Unity,
and a Charitable Part of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If he applies this to us, it is manifestly false; for tho'
we do not communicate with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her
corrupt Worship, yet there are many Christian Churches,
with which we can and do communicate, and separate our
selves no farther from any society of Christians, than they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
themselves from the Primitive and Apostolick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
But to gratifie him, Suppose that all the Communions
of Christendom were corrupted in their Worship, so that
we could not safely communicate with any one of them but
our own; yet if the Church of <hi>England</hi> be a true Apostolick
Church, in Faith and Worship, and Government, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
from others only upon account of such corruptions, as
will justifie such a separation, what should hinder her from
being <hi>a mystical member of Christ, in Catholick unity, and a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
part of the Catholick Church?</hi> The true Apostolick
Faith and Worship does certainly make us the <hi>mystical mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
of Christ's Body, or else I desire to know, what does? <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Vnity</hi> is not violated by a just separation, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
corruptions in Faith and Worship are a just cause of
separation: <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith
the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive
you, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 17. and where there are such corruptions, so
fatal and dangerous to mens souls, how far soever such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
have spread, it is a greater act of charity to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
than to communicate with them, as it is greater chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to reprove men for their sins, and forsake their company,
than to joyn with them in a wicked confederacy. This is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98153:9"/>
the true state of the case, and this we can prove either from
the express words of Scripture, or from easie and necessary
consequences; and this shows that it is possible, <hi>that a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Christians,</hi> (not) <hi>voluntarily</hi> (but necessarily.) <hi>separating
from all other Christian Societies, condemning their</hi> (corrupt)
<hi>Doctrines and Rites, destitute also of any visible correspondence
with them in the Eucharist, in any Religious Assemblies, or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Devotions,</hi> (upon account of such corruptions) <hi>can not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this</hi> (not) <hi>perverse</hi> (but just and necessary) <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
be a mystical member of Christ, in Catholick unity, and
a charitablt part of the Catholick Church,</hi> which is not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the present Church of one age, but the whole Church,
from the times of Christ and his Apostles to the end of the
world. For could we suppose at any time all the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christendom to be corrupt but one, that one uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Church must forsake the communion of all others, and
yet it would be a member of Christ, and a charitable part of
the Catholick Church, unless it be only numbers, not the
purity of Faith and Worship, which makes the Catholick
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XVI.</hi> The whole Clergy of the Catholick Church may aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
from Fundamental Truth and Holiness; whilst part of a
National Laity may preserve both, discover the Clergies De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and, depriving them, heap to Themselves Teachers of
their own sending and instruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> What he intends by this, I cannot well guess; I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
he would have his Readers believe, that the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of the Christian world did at the time of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
maintain the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
were rejected and condemned only by the major vote of a
Parliament of Lay-men in <hi>England,</hi> which how false it is
all the world knows. For,</p>
            <p>1. There were many other Churches, and better parts of
the Catholick Church, than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which did
not own those Doctrines and corruptions, which we reject.</p>
            <p>2. Nay the whole Clergy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did not. For
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98153:9"/>
were not our <hi>English</hi> Bishops and Clergy as Zealous in the
Reformation, as any Laymen? And were not they Bishops in
Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Were not the <hi>German</hi>
Reformers of the Clergy? And was the whole Clergy then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Reformation? These are admirable things to be
proved by direct Testimonies of Scripture.</p>
            <p>3. Nor do we say, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church her self has <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized
from fundamental Truth and Holiness.</hi> We do grant,
that they have retained the true Faith and Worship of Christ,
tho they have fatally corrupted both, by Additions of their
own.</p>
            <p>4. If the first discovery of this Defection had been made by
Laymen, and afterwards acknowledged by the Clergy, who
joyned in the Reformation, I should not have thought the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
ever the worse for it. For if the Clergy corrupt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
we have Reason to thank God, if he opens the Eyes of
honest and disinterested Laymen. But is not this Author very
modest in his Requests, who would have us prove his own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
and spiteful Insinuations from Scripture?</p>
            <p>This, I think, is Answer enough to his <hi>Request.</hi> And as for
his following Harangue, there is little in it to be answered,
but some spiteful and sensless Reflections, which are better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
then answered. But let us briefly consider some of them,
lest he should think they cannot be answered.</p>
            <p>1. He saies, <hi>In these positive Propositions, our Religion chiefly
consists.</hi> And truly it is a very sorry Religion, if it does. But why
does not our Religion consist in believing the true Catholick
Faith contained in the ancient Creeds? In worshipping God
through the Mediation of Jesus Christ, according to the Rules
of the Gospel? In obeying all those holy Laws our Saviour has
given us? In observing the Sacraments of his own Institution,
and as he has instituted them? This is all the Religion we own,
and know no other; and why then is not this our Religion?
No, <hi>This is the Churches peculiar, and claimed by her against all
Novel and Unjust, both Foreigners and Out-laws.</hi> But if this be
our Religion, and the Religion of the Catholick Church, how
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98153:10"/>
come we to be <hi>Foreigners and Out-laws?</hi> Why does not the
Catholick Faith and Worship, make us Members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church? And then we have as good a claim to the
Creed and Sacraments as they. No, saies our Author, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they have invented and chosen, that belongs (as sin to a
depraved will) properly to them; thence they derive their Title,
and thereto must we precisely confine their Religion.</hi> But now if
we have invented and chosen nothing else, what then? How
do we lose our right to the Creed and Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we will allow of no new Inventions and Additions to it?
And yet this is the plain case. Our only Dispute with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is about those corrupt Additions they have
made to the Catholick Faith and Worship, without any
Foundation in Scripture, or Reason, or true Antiquity; and
therefore our Religion is <hi>precisely confined</hi> to the old Catholick
Faith and Worship of the Christian Church, and therefore is
properly ours (if they will allow us to have any) because it is
all we have. The <hi>German</hi> Reformers indeed, were called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
from protesting against the Corruptions and Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this only shows what they do
not believe, and what they will not practice; but they have a
better name than this, and that is Christians, which shows what
their positive Faith and Religion is, <hi>viz.</hi> that Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which was taught by Christ and his Apostles, and owned
and practised by the Primitive Church, before these Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Innovations were heard of; and therefore, this is
<hi>precisely</hi> our Religion; what we protest against, we declare
not to be our Religion; so ridiculous is it, precisely to confine
our Religion to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> The next subject of his Harangue, is our demands of
Scripture-proofs from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for their new Faith
and Worship, which I confess is a very hard Request, because
they have none. However, he says, this makes it just for the
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> (as they will needs call themselves) to retort
this demand upon us, and to demand our Scripture-proofs; and
I confess, there is great reason for it, and I hope, have done him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98153:10"/>
justice; for I suppose, he would not ask more of us, than we
do of them. Now we only demand either the express words
of Scripture, or plain and evident consequences, or the silence
of Scripture, to prove that a thing is not revealed; and this
we are ready to return them as to any Doctrines which we
profess; and whether we <hi>adulterate Scriptures by corrupt
Translations</hi> (such as the vulgar <hi>Latin) or Sacrilegious mutila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
(as by leaving out the second Commandment) or <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
misapplications</hi> (as applying the Psalter of <hi>David</hi> to
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> by changing <hi>Lord</hi> into <hi>Lady</hi>) or <hi>gross wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings
and false interpretations</hi> (as proving Supremacy and
Infallibility by <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> and <hi>Pasce oves</hi>) shall be left to
every Impartial Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> In the next place he reproaches us with the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
whom he calls our <hi>Brethren by descent and iniquity</hi> who
<hi>steering by the blast of a private spirit, the Chart of clear Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and Compass of Humane reason, have made shipwrack of
faith.</hi> This is intollerable to say, that to follow Scripture and
Reason, is the way to make shipwrack of Faith; which can
never be, unless Scripture and Reason be contrary to Faith,
which indeed they are in many things to the Faith of the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but God forbid they should be to the true
Christian Faith. But have not the <hi>Socinians</hi> made shipwrack
of Faith by following clear Scripture and Humane reason?
And will he then say, that Scripture and Reason are on the
<hi>Socinian</hi> side? If they be, how can he know that they have
made shipwrack of Faith? if they be not, then they make
shipwrack of Faith by not adhering to clear Scripture and
Reason; and is this a reason for us to be ashamed of following
Scripture and Reason, because the <hi>Socinians</hi> err by the abuse
of both? There is no doubt, but men who pretend to Scripture
and Reason may err; and it is demonstrable, that men who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Scripture and Reason, must err, and we have so many
instances of this in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is no great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to us to rely on Church-authority without
Scripture and Reason. They dare not say, that we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98153:11"/>
contrary to Scripture, or that the Scripture is not the
Rule of our Faith; but they will allow no body to interpret the
Scripture but the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the most certain
way to make her infallible; for to be sure she will not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the Scripture against her self; she must be always in the
right, if what she says be the Rule of Faith. But we who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe, that God has given us Scripture and Reason to
make no use of them; That he has made the Pope or Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> infallible, and divested all other Christians of sense and
common understanding, have nothing but Reason and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to steer by, and that will neither make us <hi>Socinians,</hi> nor
<hi>Papists.</hi>

               <hi>4ly,</hi> His parting-blow is about the Supremacy of the King,
which he calls <hi>Hobbism,</hi> as if we ever thought, that all men
must be of the Kings Religion, <hi>as the sole and Sovereign Judg
of all Causes Spiritual?</hi> What we mean by the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
I have already explained. He has no Spiritual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
properly so called; can neither ordain, nor admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Sacraments, nor has the power of the Keys, but is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Church is incorporated into the State,
so he has the Government of all Ecclesiastical Persons and
Causes. Whatever Secular Authority the Church has, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the Prince, and depends on Secular Laws, and
this may be enlarged, retrenched, suspended, by the same
Power that gave it; but the Church as a Spiritual Society
has Rights of its own, can teach the true Faith, administer
Sacraments, inflict Church-Censures, though without any
Temporal effect, by an inherent Authority: We thank God,
when our Prince, who has the Supreme Authority, does coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
true Religion; But whenever it is otherwise, we are
taught to submit all our Temporal Concernments, our
Lives, and Bodies, and Estates, to the will of our Prince, but
to defend our Church and Religion by a modest, but reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
profession of the true Faith, and meek and patient suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for it.</p>
