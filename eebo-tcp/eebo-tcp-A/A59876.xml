            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THough I had no intention
to make this Sermon Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
yet I could not with
any Modesty deny your Request,
when you had paid so great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Counsel given you in it.
I heartily Congratulate your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
agreement in the Choice of so
excellent a Person to succeed the
not-to-be-forgotten Dr. <hi>CALAMY,</hi>
who, I doubt not, will deserve all
that Honour and Kindness, which
it is so natural to you, to show to
your Ministers. I here present you
with the Sermon, as it was Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:63396:4"/>
excepting some few things at
the beginning, which were left out
in speaking, to shorten it, as much
as I could, without injuring the
Sense. I am sensible the Character
falls very short of what our decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Friend deserved, but it is every
Word true, and I thought, had been
as inoffensive too as it is true; and
so I believe it will appear to wise and
considering men, and others may
judge as they please. If it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
any thing to make both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and People more faithful in
the discharge of their several Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
I have what I aimed at, both in
Preaching and Printing it, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if you please to accept of it as a
Testimony of the sincere Respects of</p>

               <bibl>24 Matth. 45, 46.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Who then is a Faithful and Wise servant,
whom his Lord hath made Ruler over
his Houshold, to give them meat in due
season?</p>
                  <p>Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord
when he cometh, shall finde so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this and the fore-going Chapter, our
Saviour acquaints his Disciples with
the Signs and Prognosticks of his
coming; which plainly have a double
aspect, both upon his coming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and upon his coming to
judge the World: But the application he
makes of it, is of universal use; <hi>Watch
therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord
doth come.</hi> v. 42. which is excellent advice,
in what sense soever we understand the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63396:5"/>
coming of our Lord; for the coming of our
Lord signifies his coming to take account
of us, and whether we apply this to the
Hour of our Death, or to the last Day of
Judgment, still it concerns us to watch; that
is, to be always diligent and careful in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Duty, and discharging that Trust
which is committed to us, that whenever
our Lord comes, we may give up our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
with joy.</p>
            <p>The Words, I have now read to you,
concern the Apostles of Christ, and their
Successors, the Bishops and Pastors of the
whurch, who are as much obliged to this
watchfulness, as any other sort of persons,
because as they have a greater Trust, so
they have a greater Account to give. This
we learn from 12 <hi>Luke 42, 43, v.</hi> where
our Saviour having given that general ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to all his Disciples, to watch for the
coming of their Lord, St. <hi>Peter</hi> particularly
enquires, how far he, and the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were concerned in it: <hi>Lord, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou this parable unto us, or even to all.</hi> v.
41. To which our Saviour answers, <hi>Who
then is that faithful and wise steward, whom
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63396:5"/>
his Lord shall make Ruler of his Houshold, to
give them their portion of meat in due season?
Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord, when
he cometh shall find so doing.</hi> Wherein our
Saviour does particularly apply that general
Advice to his Apostles and their Successors,
his Servants, Stewards, and Ministers of the
Gospel: and indeed those particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
which are here used do sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquaint us, to whom this Advice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.</p>
            <p>We need not question, who is here
meant by <hi>the Lord,</hi> which is the peculiar Title
of Christ in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and it is as
evident, what this Houshold is, which is the
Church of Christ,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The House and Temple of
the living God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The Houshold of Faith, The
Houshold of God.</hi> And Christ is said to be
Faithful <hi>as a Son,</hi> or Lord,<note place="margin">6 Gal. 10.</note> 
               <hi>over his own
House, whose House are we, if we hold fast
the confidence,</hi>

               <hi>and the rejoycing of the hope
firm unto the end,</hi> in distinction from <hi>Moses,</hi>
who was Faithful as a Servant.</p>
            <p>The Rulers of the Houshold, or the
Stewards in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> are the Apostles, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,

            </p>
            <p>This is sufficient to shew you, that my
Text does principally concern the Bishops
and Ministers of the Church, who are in an
eminent manner the Servants of Christ in
the Instruction and Government of his
Church, which is his House; and in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to these words, I shall observe this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
method.</p>
            <p>I. Consider the Duty of Gospel-Bishops
and Pastors, which is to Feed, and to
Govern the Houshold of Christ.</p>
            <p>II. The Qualifications of Gospel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
which are Faithfulness and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>a Faithful and Wise servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63396:6"/>
III. The great rewards of such men,
<hi>Blessed is that servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. The Duty of Gospel-Ministers whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops or others, and that consists of
two parts. 1. To Feed. 2. To Govern
the Houshold or Church of Christ. They
are appointed <hi>Rulers of his Houshold, to give
them meat in due season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. To Feed the Flock of Christ.<note place="margin">20. Acts 28.</note> This
command Christ gave to <hi>Peter,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
it three times;<note place="margin">21. John 15, 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Simon, son of Jonas,
lovest thou me more then these?</hi> then <hi>feed my
lambs, feed my sheep.</hi> Now to Feed, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
to instruct men in the Knowledge of
Christ, for Knowledge is the proper food
and nourishment of the Soul, by which it
grows in Spiritual Wisdom,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> and all Vertue
and Goodness; and is as necessary to our
Spiritual Life, as natural food is to the Life
of our Bodies.<note place="margin">17. John 3.</note> 
               <hi>This is life eternal,</hi> saith
our Saviour, <hi>to know Thee the onely true God,
and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this reason our Saviour appointed
Stewards and Dispensers of the Mysteries of
his Kingdom, whose whole business it should
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63396:7"/>
be to study the Divine Will themselves,
and to instruct others. For this is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which must be taught; Nature may
instruct us in the Being of a God, and the
differences between good and evil, and the
plain Rules of Morality; but the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Kingdom, the whole oeconomy
of mans Salvation by Jesus Christ, is to be
known onely by Revelation. Christ came
down from Heaven to reveal this to us,
and he instructed his Apostles, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
by their preaching and Writings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
the Church, and have left us a
standing Rule of Faith and Manners; but
yet it is necessary, that there should be
some men peculiarly devoted to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Religion, the study of the Scriptures,
and the Work of the Ministry, to instruct
and teach those who have neither leisure
nor opportunities for enquiry, nor capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to learn without a Guide, which is
the case of the generality of Christians;
especially since Religion has been clogged
with such infinite Disputes, and there has
been so much art used to make the plainest
truths difficult, obscure, and uncertain, to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63396:7"/>
corrupt the Christian Faith, and to make it
comply with mens sensual Lusts, or secular
Interests. A Guide and Instructor is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary, when there are so many
Turnings and Labyrinths, wherein men may
lose themselves, and their way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>But though there were no Disputes in
Religion, no difficulty in understanding it,
though all men were agreed about the way
to Heaven, though the meanest Christian un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the Mysteries of Christianity, as
well as the greatest Divine, yet there would
be constant need of a Spiritual Guide, while
men are apt to be unmindful of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and careless in the practice of it. The
work of an Evangelical Pastor is not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to instruct the Ignorant, but to exhort,
to reprove, to admonish, to watch over the
Lives and Manners of Christians, to make
seasonable Applications to their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to administer Comfort to afflicted Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
to excite and quicken the slothful, and
to encourage the fearful and timerous, and
to assist and direct men in their Spiritual
Warfare, how to obtain a glorious victory
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63396:8"/>
over the World and the Flesh. This is to
feed the Flock of Christ, and to give them
Meat in due season, to instruct them in those
things of which they are ignorant, and to
put them in mind of those things which
they already know, that their Faith may be
turned into a principle of life and action,
and this heavenly Food may be digested in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Bloud and Spirits, to the edifying of the
Body of Christ in all Christian Graces and
Vertues.</p>
            <p>2. Another part of the Ministerial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
consists in Acts of Discipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
Christ has made these Ministers
and Servants, <hi>Rulers over his houshold.</hi> No
Society can be preserved, without Order and
Government,<note place="margin">5 Eph. 23.</note> which is as absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in the Church,<note place="margin">10 John. 14.</note> as in the State. Christ
is the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, the <hi>Husband,</hi>
the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> which are all
names of Authority and Power; and the
Church is his <hi>Body,</hi> his <hi>Spouse,</hi> his <hi>Flock,</hi> his
<hi>Houshold,</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> which are names of
Subjection, and denote a regular and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Society; but Christ has now left this
World, and does not visibly appear among
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63396:8"/>
us, to direct and govern the Affairs of his
Church; he is ascended into Heaven, where
he sits at the right hand of God, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
an invisible Power and Providence
for the defence and preservation of his
Church on Earth: He governs us by his
Laws, and by his Spirit, and by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
for <hi>when he ascended on high, he led
captivity captive, and gave gifts to men. And
he gave some, Apostles:</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 Eph. 8, 11, 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>and some, Prophets:
and some, Evangelists: and some, Pastors
and Teachers. For the perfecting of the
Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all
come in the unity of the Faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man,
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When our Saviour was risen from the
dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">28 Mat. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>he tells his Disciples,</hi> All power is
given unto me both in Heaven and in Earth.
Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing
them in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them
to observe all things whatsoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you: and lo, I am with you alway,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63396:9"/>
even unto the end of the World. <hi>This is
their Commission to preach the Gospel, and
to govern his Church; which was not
meerly a Personal Commission to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
but extends to all their Successors, as
appears from Christ's promise to be with
them in the discharge of his Ministerial
Authority to the end of the World. Thus
St.</hi> John <hi>acquaints us, that Christ after his
Resurrection appeared to his Apostles, when
they were met together, and said unto them,</hi>
Peace be unto you,<note place="margin">20 Joh. 21, 22, 23.</note> as my Father hath sent me,
so send I you. And as he had said this, he
breathed on them, and said unto them, Receive
ye the Holy Ghost. Whose soever sins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
they are remitted unto them; and whose
soever sins ye retain, they are retained. <hi>This
invested them with Authority, but then
the actual communication of Power, which,
especially at that time, was necessary to the
discharge of their Office, was reserved for
the descent of the Holy Ghost; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviour commanded them,</hi> Not to
depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the
promise of the Father, <hi>that is, the gift of the
Holy Ghost. For says he,</hi> Ye shall receive
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63396:9"/>
power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
you,<note place="margin">1 Act. 4. 8, 9.</note> and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,
and unto the uttermost parts of the
Earth.</p>
            <p>And accordingly we find, that during
the time of the Apostles, the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Church was in their hands,
which they committed to their Successors,
and has ever since been exercised by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Bishops and Presbyters, with regard to
their different Order and Power. But what
is this Power which Christ hath given to
his Ministers? They have no Rods, nor
Axes, as secular Princes have, to compel
men to the Faith of Christ, and to force
their obedience. No, this is contrary to
the Genius and Spirit of Christianity. If
men will be Infidels, if they will be wicked,
we cannot help it:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>For though we walk in
the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: For
the weapons of our warfare are not carnal,</hi>
such as earthly Princes use, <hi>but mighty
through God, to the pulling down of strong
holds, Casting down imaginations, and every
high thing that exalteth it self against the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63396:10"/>
knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity
every thought to the obedience of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour in my Text acquaints us
what this Power and Authority is; he <hi>makes
them Rulers over his Houshold, to give them
meat in due season.</hi> This is the Authority
Christ hath given to his Ministers, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
to exhort, to advise, to admonish, to
reprove, and that with <hi>sharpness</hi> too, when
there is occasion for it, <hi>according to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which the Lord hath given to edification,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 10.</note>
               <hi>and not to destruction;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks.</p>
            <p>But what Authority is this? May not
every Christian do the same? Is it not the
duty of us all, as we are able, to instruct,
exhort, reprove one another? Yes, it is;
and I would to God it were more generally
practised: but yet every private Christian
cannot do this with the Authority of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
or a Gospel-Minister: The Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Exhortations of private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
are acts of Friendship and Charity;
and the obligation to it, is that mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
and sympathy which the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the same Body ought to have for
each other: In Gospel-Ministers it is an act
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63396:10"/>
of Authority, like the Censures of a Father,
a Magistrate, or a Judge.</p>
            <p>We do not pretend indeed, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 24.</note> to have <hi>dominion over your Faith,</hi> to
exercise a kind of Soveraign Authority, to
oblige you to believe any thing meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we say it; but yet our Authority is
such, that if in the exercise of our Office
we explain the Articles of Faith and Rules
of Life to you, it lays an indispensible Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
upon you, carefully to examine what
we say, and not to reject it, without plain
and manifest evidence, that what we teach
you is not agreeable to the Will of God
revealed in the Scriptures. For when we
come in the Name and Authority of Christ,
that man who rejects our Message, without
being sure that we exceed our Commission,
rejects the Authority by which we act; and
<hi>he that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God.</hi>
It is our Work and our Commission to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
you, and it is your Duty to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed;
and whoever shall wantonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
any Doctrines which do not suit with
his humour and interest, or oppose some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
mistakes and prejudices against the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63396:11"/>
Instructions of his Guide, or turn away his
ear from instruction, and heap to himself
Teachers, having itching ears, such a man
must give a severe account of this neglect
and contempt to the great Bishop and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
of Souls. While we are careful to
discharge our Office in pursuance of that
Trust our Great Master hath committed to
us, what our Saviour tells his Apostles is
true of the meanest of us all;<note place="margin">10 Luk. 16.</note> 
               <hi>He that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you, heareth me: and he that despiseth
you, despiseth me: and he that despiseth me,
despiseth him that sent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like may be said of the Exhortations,
and Counsels, and Directions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs,
of our Spiritual Guides, they carry
great Authority with them; they are not
like the private Admonitions of our Friends,
who exhort and reprove out of kindness,
and their particular concernment for us: To
reject such Counsels as these, does mightily
aggravate our sin and our condemnation, as
every thing does, which makes our sin more
wilful and obstinate; but to reject the
Counsels and Reproofs of our Guide, is a
new act of disobedience to that Authority
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63396:11"/>
which Christ has set in his Church. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will hear, or whether you will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
we must exhort, reprove, advise; and
wo be to us, if we do not, and wo be to
those who will not hear, who will not obey.
Our great Master looks upon this as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of his own Authority, and this is all
the Authority we have. We cannot force
you to obey our Counsels or Reproofs, but
ours and your Master will severely punish
you, if you do not.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Instructions, Reproofs,
and Censures of Christ's Ministers, carry
such Authority with them, that they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
into, or shut out of the Communion
of the Church, which is the onely visible
state of Salvation. Remission of sins, and
eternal Life, is ordinarily to be had onely
in the visible Communion of the Church,
and therefore the Power of Receiving into
the Church by Baptism, and of Casting out
of the Church by Excommunication, which
is the onely Authority Christ hath given to
these Rulers of his Houshold, to Receive in
and cast out of his Family, is called a Power
of Remitting or Retaining sins, because the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63396:12"/>
forgiveness of Sins is to be had onely in the
Communion of the Church, and no man
belongs to the invisible Church, who does
not live in Communion with the visible
Church, when it may he had.</p>
            <p>The Authority of Christs Ministers is to
feed those, who are of his Houshold, to give
them their meat in due season, and to judge
who shall belong to this Houshold, who
shall be received in, or cast out of Christs
Family: This is the highest Act of Church
Authority on Earth, and the onely Sanction
of all our instructions, counsels, and reproofs;
and therefore this Authority is not intrusted
with every Gospel-Minister, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the chief Governours of the
Church, the Bishops who succeed into the
ordinary apostolical Power.</p>
            <p>II. Let us now consider the due Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
which are required in Gospel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and they are two: Faithfulness and
Prudence, <hi>Who is that Faithful and Wise
Servant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Faithfulness: Now Faithfulness in
a Servant consists in being true to his Trust;
and when this is applied to Preaching the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63396:12"/>
Gospel, it signifies, that he is extreamly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to publish the whole Mind and Will of
God; which as it concerns us in this Age,
includes these following Rules:</p>
            <p>1. To be careful to acquaint our selves
with the Will of God, that we may be
<hi>Scribes which are instructed unto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">13. Mat. 52.</note> 
               <hi>who are like unto a man that
is an housholder, which bringeth forth out
of his treasure things new and old.</hi> The
Priests lips must preserve Knowledge, but
we must first have it, before we can teach
it others; and since none of us now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to immediate Inspirations, this is a
work of difficulty and labour, and requires
as much faithfulness in our Studies, as in the
Pulpit. It is no argument of Faithfulness,
whatever it may be of Diligence, to run
like <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> without Tidings,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 22.</note> to vent some
crude and indigested thoughts for the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of God.</p>
            <p>2. Faithfulness requires us to preach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for the Will of God, but what we
are sure to be so; to deliver no Message,
but what we have received in Commission;
not to indulge our own private conjectures
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63396:13"/>
and fancies, nor think to mend and subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Religion by Philosophical Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but to content our selves with the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the Gospel, to Preach Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and him Crucified. Nothing has done
greater mischief to Religion, than when the
very Teachers of it have been ambitious to
be Wise above what is Written. All the
Articles of the Christian Faith, as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht
from the Principles of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
can be known onely by Revelation;
and therefore there is no reasoning about
them any farther, than to know what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and what is not revealed, is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and so useless, that it is not worth
the knowing. Since we preach in the
Name, and by the Authority of Christ, we
ought not to instruct our People in any
thing but what we have his Authority for,
for this is to exceed our Commission. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nice Speculations may entertain us in
private Conversation; but when we preach
in the Name of Christ, let us onely preach
his Gospel, and teach them to observe
and do whatsoever he hath commanded
us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:63396:13"/>
3. Faithfulness requires, that we preach
the whole Will of God; that we instruct
men in all the Articles of the Christian
Faith, especially where there is any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and present danger of a mistake; and
that we teach them every part of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God and men, especially such Duties
as they are most unwilling to learn, and most
averse to practice. This is an essential part of
Faithfulness, &amp; requires no small courage too.</p>
            <p>There are no times so bad, no hearers so
captious, but they will very well bear some
general commendations of Religion, or some
common Topicks about Vertue or Vice;
which are of great use too, especially in
such a sceptical and unbelieving Age, as
this. But a faithful discharge of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
requires somewhat more; a particular
application to the Consciences of men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their wants and necessities, not
so much to consult what will please them,
as what will do them good. It mightily
concerns a Gospel-Minister, as far as he can,
to maintain a fair reputation in the World,
but a good name is nothing worth, when
we can do no good by it, when we cannot
get or maintain a good name without neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63396:14"/>
our Duty, or betraying the Souls of
men. I had a thousand times rather, that
men should reproach and revile me for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
them in such Duties, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with patience hear of, than that they
should commend me for my silence.</p>
            <p>It is hard to live in any Age, wherein
there are not some popular Errors, or some
popular Vices to be corrected; and it is a
very dangerous thing to meddle with any
thing that is popular. But what is danger
to that man, who is in a greater danger by
the neglect of his Duty? Shall any man call
himself a Minister of the Gospel, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of Jesus Christ, and in such an Age, as
we now live in, be ashamed or afraid to
cenfure or consute the Errors of Popery or
Fanaticism, or to reprove Schism and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because they are very popular Vices.
<hi>Let a man so account of us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4, 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>as the ministers of
Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
Moreover, it is required in stewards that a man
be found faithful. But with me it is a very small
thing that I should be judged of you, or of mans
judgment:</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks. When we
leave our several Flocks, it will be infinite
satisfaction to us, to be able to say, as St.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63396:14"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> did to the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops;<note place="margin">20. Acts 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>I take you to
record this day, that I am pure from the blood
of all men. For I have not shunned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you all the counsel of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Prudence is as necessary in a
Gospel-Minister, as Faithfulness is: By Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
I do not mean Cunning and Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
artificial Insinuations and Addresses,
which are more like the Arts of Seducers,
than of Gospel-Ministers,<note place="margin">16 Rom. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Who by good words,
and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the
simple.</hi> Prudence will not allow us in the
neglect of any part of our Duty, whatever
the event be; but <hi>we must renounce the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
things of dishonesty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>not walking in craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness,
nor handling the word of God deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but by manifestation of the truth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
our selves to every mans conscience
in the sight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wisdom and Prudence, as it is consistent
with Faithfulness and Honesty in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of our Trust, can signifie no more
but this; To Instruct, Exhort, Perswade,
and perform all the parts and offices of a
Gospel-Minister, in such a manner, as may
render our instructions and perswasions most
effectual; to take the most convenient sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63396:15"/>
when men are most apt to be wrought
on; to teach them such things as are of
most present use to them; to use such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as are most likely to prevail; to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
all unnecessary provocations, when the
Duty it self, which we are to teach them is
not the matter of the provocation; for if
men will be provoked with hearing of
their Duty, there is no help for that. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
never dispences with any part of our
Duty, but directs to the best way of doing
it: a Faithful Servant does what he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and a Wise Servant does it in the
most effectual manner.</p>
            <p>III. The last part of my Text concerns
the great Rewards of such Faithful and
Wise Servants; <hi>Blessed is that servant.</hi>
What this Reward is, we are not here par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
told. All good men, we know,
shall be very blessed and happy in the other
World, and we may reasonably presume,
that Christ, who is the great Judge of the
World, has reserved some peculiar marks
of honour for his immediate Servants: This
he plainly intimates to us, in that distinction
he makes between the reward of a Prophet,
and of a righteous man: <hi>He that receiveth a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63396:15"/>
prophet in the name of a prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">10. Mat. 41.</note> 
               <hi>shall receive
a prophets reward: and he that receiveth a
righteous man in the name of a righteous man,
shall receive a righteous mans reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our reward in Heaven will bare some
proportion to the nature of our Work, and
to that Service we do for God in this World.
Now we cannot do any more acceptable
service, than to serve God in the Gospel of
his Son: to use our utmost endeavours to
propagate Religion in the World, and to
make other men wise, and good, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
Our Saviour himself came into the
World on this very design, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc't
to the right Hand of Glory and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as a reward of it;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 1.</note> and those who <hi>are
workers together with him,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks,
will receive some proportionable Reward
also.</p>
            <p>The faithful discharge of this Duty is a
work of infinite care and difficulty, that it
made an Apostle himself cry out, <hi>Who is
sufficient for these things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> It requires the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of great care, and great prudence, and
great patience; it is abundantly enough to
employ our whole time and thoughts either
in studying the Will of God, or in attending
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63396:16"/>
the publick Ministries of Religion, or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Addresses and Applications to men who
want our Advice and Counsel; we must
contentedly bear all the Affronts and Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of bad men, the Frowardness and
Peevishness of many profest Christians, the
Gain-sayings and Contradictions of sinners.
We must go on and persevere in our Work,
though our Persons and our Ministry be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised:
<hi>when we are reviled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>we must bless:
when persecuted, we must suffer: when defam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we must entreat:</hi> yea though we <hi>are made
as the filth of the world, and the off-scouring
of all things.</hi> This is not very pleasing to
flesh and bloud, but the harder the work is,
the greater will our reward be, if we be
found faithful and wise Servants.</p>
            <p>Nay, there is no Work does so ennoble
the Mind as this, and qualifie us for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Reward. No man can faithfully
discharge this Work, but it must purge and
refine his Mind, and set him vastly above
this World, and the little Concernments of
it: It gives us a more clear distinct compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
knowledge of God and divine things,
which is an Angelical perfection of the Mind
and Understanding; and he must be a strange
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63396:16"/>
man, who can be so constantly employed in
the Contemplation of God, and the things
which relate to another and a better life, and
not find his Soul ravisht with those unseen
and unspeakable Glories; who is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
employed in taking care of other
mens Souls, and takes no care of his own;
who is so frequent in his Devotions, as the
very nature of our Work exacts from us, and
not live a most divine and heavenly life:
There are indeed some, who in the most
Divine Employment are no great Examples
of such a Divine Conversation; but I fear
they will not be found in the number of
these faithful and wise Servants. Whoever
heartily applies himself to the care of Souls,
will in the first place take care of his own;
and the faithful discharge of this Duty, will
raise us so much above the ordinary Level
and Attainments of Christians, as will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
us for a greater Reward, and advance
us to a more perfect state of Glory.</p>
            <p>Nay, that immediate Relation we stand
in to Christ, who is the Soveraign Lord and
Judge of the World, if we approve our selves
faithful and wise Servants, will secure us of
a more excellent Reward. The Church on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63396:17"/>
Earth and the Church in Heaven, is but one
Church, one Houshold and Family; and
those whom he has made Rulers of his
Houshold here, to whom he has committed
the greatest places of Trust and Dignity,
need not fear being degraded in the other
World, if they adorn their Office, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
discharge their Trust here: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviour tells his Apostles, <hi>Verily I
say unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">19 Mat. 28.</note> 
               <hi>that ye which have followed me
in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall
sit in the Throne of his glory, ye also shall sit
upon twelve Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes
of Israel:</hi> that is, that their Reward and
Glory in the other World, should answer
to that place of Trust, and Power, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which they had in the Church on
Earth; and this Promise is no more peculiar
to the Apostles, than their Office was.</p>
            <p>In a word, if we consider what the state
of the other World is, and who is King there,
that it is the blessed Jesus, our Great High
Priest, King of <hi>Salem,</hi> or the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
and Priest of the most High God, how mean
and contemptible soever our Office is thought
here, we need not doubt but the Scene will
be mightily chang'd, when we come into that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63396:17"/>
Kingdom where the King is a High Priest.</p>
            <p>Let this then, beloved Brethren of the
Clergy, be a mighty Encouragement to us
to be very diligent and faithful in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of this great Trust; whatever Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
we meet with, whatever Scorns, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
or Sufferings, it is but expecting a
while, and our Lord will come, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is with him: and <hi>blessed,</hi> for ever bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<hi>is that Servant, whom his Lord when he
cometh shall find so doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea blessed, for ever blessed, as my Text
gives us reason to hope, is this our dear
Brother, whose Remains lie here before us,
who, when his Lord came, was found thus
doing. We may lament the loss of so kind
a Relation, so true a Friend, so faithful a
Pastor, and Fellow-labourer, according to the
several interests we had in him; but he, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Soul, has fought a good Fight, and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
his Course, and kept the Faith, and is
now gone to receive a Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a Crown of Immortality and Glory.
He is now gone to that great Bishop and
Shepherd of Souls, whose Flock he has so
carefully and diligently fed, and whose wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
and stragling Sheep he has reduced into
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63396:18"/>
the Fold. To that kind Shepherd who laid
down his life for his Sheep, and therefore will
not fail to reward those who have spent
their lives, and were ready to have sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them too, for the service of Souls.</p>
            <p>When we speak of so great a man, it is
below his Character to mention such things
as would be thought considerable Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in meaner persons; though indeed a
truly great man does nothing meanly. A
great Mind gives a peculiar grace and decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to common Actions, as it was easie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in his very Mirth and freest Humours,
that he never gave the Reins out of his hands,
but governed himself by the strictest Rules
of Prudence and Religion.</p>
            <p>But I shall confine my self to the subject
of my Text, and consider him onely as <hi>a
faithful and wise Steward,</hi> and therefore have
very little to adde; for I doubt not, but you
who knew him, especially you who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the benefit of his Ministry, and have
lived under his Care and Conduct, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
applied what I have discoursed on
this Argument, to your deceased Pastor; and
would I have chosen any particular man
to have drawn the Character by, of a wise
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63396:18"/>
and faithful Steward, there are not many men I
should sooner have thought on, than Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi>
to have been the Pattern.</p>
            <p>That he did take care to give you Meat in due
season, I need not tell you, because you all know it.
If Preaching in season and out of season, if publick
Instructions and private Applications, where they
were needful or desired, be to feed the Flock of
Christ, &amp; to give Meat to his Houshold and Family,
this he did, and that very faithfully and wisely too.</p>
            <p>In the first place, he took care to inform himself,
and to furnish his own Mind with all useful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and his constant Preaching, though without
any vain affectation of Learning, which serves onely
to amuse, not to instruct, did sufficiently discover
both his natural and acquired Abilities. He had a
clear and distinct apprehension of things, an easie
and manly Rhetorick, strong Sense conveyed to the
mind in familiar words, good Reasons inspired with
a decent Passion, which did not onely teach, but
move and transport the Hearers, and at the same
time gave both light and heat: for indeed he was
a good man, which is necessary to make a good
Preacher; he had an inward vital sense of Religion,
and that animated his discourses with the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Passions which he felt in himself.</p>
            <p>He did not entertain his Hearers with School-Subtilties,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63396:19"/>
or a coniectural Divinity, with such thin
and airy Speculations, as can neither be seen, nor felt,
nor understood, but his chief care was to explain
the great Articles of Faith, and Rules of Life, what
we must believe, and how we must live, that we
may be eternally happy. And he did; as a faithful
Servant ought to do, as he declared a little before
his death, that he never preached any thing, but
what he himself firmly believed to be true.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you what a troublesome World
we have lived in for some years past, such Critical
times as would try the Principles &amp; Spirits of men;
when a prevailing Faction threatned both Church
and State, and the fears of Popery were thought a
sufficient Justification of the most illegal &amp; irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
methods to keep it out; when it was scandalous
to speak a word either for the King or the Church,
when cunning men were silent, and those who affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Popularity swam with the Stream; then this
great &amp; good man durst reprove Schism and Faction,
durst teach men to conform to the Church, and to
obey &amp; honor the King; durst vindicate the despised
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the hated Doctrine of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Obedience, though the one was thought to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
Popery, and the other to introduce Slavery;
but he was above the powerful Charms of Names,
and liked Truth never the worse, because it was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63396:19"/>
His publick Sermons preached in those days,
and printed by publick Authority, are lasting Proofs
of this, and yet he was no Papist neither, but durst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the errours of Popery, when some others, who
made the greatest noise and out-cry about it, grew
wise and cautious. This was like a truly honest and
faithful Servant, to oppose the growing Distempers
of the Age, without any regard either to unjust Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
or apparent Danger. And yet he did not
needlesly provoke any man; he gave no hard words,
but thought it severe enough to confute mens errors
without upbraiding or reproaching their persons.
His Conversation was courteous and affable to all
men, soft and easie, as his Principles were stubborn;
he could yield any thing but the Truth, and bear
with any thing but the Vices of men. He would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have been the Wonder of his Age, had he not
lived in such an Age, as; thanks be to God, can shew
many such Wonders, and yet in such an Age as this
he made an Illustrious Figure; though he had his
Equals, he had not many Superiours.</p>
            <p>Thus he lived, and thus this good man died, for
thus he was found doing when his Lord came. The
first symptoms of his Distemper seized him just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his last Sermon at <hi>White-hall,</hi> but gave him so
much respite as to take his leave of the World in
an excellent Discourse of Immortality, which he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63396:20"/>
speaks of with such a sensible gust and relish, as if
his Soul had been then upon the wing, and had some
fore-tast of those joys it was just a going to possess.
And indeed he encountered the apprehensions of
Death, like one who believed and hoped for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;
he was neither over-fond of living, nor
afraid to die. He received the Supper of our Lord,
professed his Communion with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in which he had lived, and in which he now
died, and having recommended his Soul to God, he
quietly expected how he would dispose of him.</p>
            <p>But I must not forget to tell you, that he died
like a true and faithful Pastor, with a tender care
and affection for his Flock. When he imposed this
unwelcome Office upon me, he told me, he did not
desire any Praises of himself, but that I would give
some good advice to his People, who, said he, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a very kind and loving People. And this was
not the first nor the onely time I have heard him
own not onely your kind reception of him at first,
but the repeated and renewed expressions of your
affection, which did signally manifest it self in his late
Sickness, and now accompanies him to the Grave. A
Character, which to your honour I speak it, you have
now made good for several successions, and which,
I hope, you will never forfeit.</p>
            <p>But what that good counsel is, he would have me
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63396:20"/>
give you, he told me not; and therefore I can onely
guess at his intentions in this. Were he now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to speak to you, I believe he could not give
you better counsel than he has already done: and
therefore my advice to you is,</p>
            <p>1. To remember those Counsels and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which you have heard from your deceased Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.
Though the Sower be removed, yet let that
immortal Seed, that Word of Life which he has
sown, live and fructifie in your hearts, and bring forth
the blessed Fruits of Righteousness. He has shewed
you the plain way to Heaven, have a care you do
not forget it, have a care you do not wander out of
it. He has recommended the Communion of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to you. He has taught you to
be Loyal to your Prince, and to be true to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
take care then, that neither your Religion
destroy your Loyalty, nor your Loyalty corrupt
your Religion: remember that beloved person,
whose memory is dear and sacred to you, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Rebel, a Papist, nor a Fanatick.</p>
            <p>2. Since you have lost your Guide, a faithful and
a prudent Guide, and the choice of a Successour is in
your selves, be very careful, as the concernment of
your Souls requires you should be, of your Choice.
Consider what an Age we live in, which requires an
experienced and skilful Pilot to steer a secure and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63396:21"/>
steady course. Have a care of dividing into Factions
and Parties; let not meer private Interests or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
govern you; if it be possible, admit of no
Competitions, much less of Pulpit-Combats, which
do oftner occasion lasting and fatal Divisions, than
end in a wise Choice. Remember what a successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you have had of Great and Good Men in this
Place, and let it be your ambition still to equal and
out-do it, if you can.</p>
            <p>And now I shall conclude with one word to you my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the Clergy. We have lost a faithful and diligent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer
in Gods Vineyard, in a time when we could ill have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him; let us then, who still survive, double our diligence,
and express a greater Zeal and Concernment in the defence of
Religion, and in the care of Souls. Let us remember that we
are all mortal, and how little time we have to work in, we
know not; but let us so improve the remainder of our days,
that when our Lord comes, he may own us for faithful and
wise Servants, and bestow on us a Crown of Righteousness
and Immortality. Which God of his infinite mercy grant,
through our Lord Jesus Christ; To whom, with the Father
and the Holy Spirit, be Honour, and Glory, and Power, now
and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
