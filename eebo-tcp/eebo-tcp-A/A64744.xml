         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Doctrine</hi> of good living is ſhort, but the <hi>work</hi> is long, and hard to be perſwaded, though eaſie to bee learnt: for to be good, is of all things the moſt eaſie, and the moſt ready, if wee could learne but one other <hi>Art,</hi> which <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> termed the moſt neceſſary, I will add, the moſt difficult, and that is, <hi>to forget to doe Evill.</hi> I find that <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> have two <hi>handles,</hi> whereby we may take hold of them, <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Temperance.</hi> Rule thy <hi>Evil</hi> with theſe, and then thy <hi>will</hi> may rule thee well. Horſes are ruled with bridles and ſpurs. In proſperity uſe the firſt, that is, reſtraine, or keepe in thy ſelfe. In adverſity the laſt, that is, Incite,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103173:12"/>
and uſe thy ſelfe to a gallant <hi>Apathie,</hi> and contempt of misfortunes. Generous and metleſome <hi>Courſers</hi> when they are brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, or rid abroad, are compelled to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon thoſe very things, whoſe firſt ſight ſtartled and terrified them; doe ſo with thy ſelfe: tread under thy feet thy moſt hideous adverſities; ſo ſhalt thou forget the feare of fortune, which makes men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for vertue. Patience in adverſity is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in proſperity. Nor can it be eaſily reſolved, which of theſe two excells: This is moſt certaine, that noble ſufferance is as neceſſary to man, as the virtue of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Some few Croſſes thou canſt beare well, but fortune can afflict thee with many, and thou by patience (the greateſt of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) muſt afflict her with more; for
<q>
                        <l>— The naked man too getts the field,</l>
                        <l>And often makes the armed foe to yeeld.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>It coſts not much to live well, and it is as cheape to learne it. The whole Art is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in theſe two words, <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Temperance.</hi> In theſe lies all the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie</hi> of Peace: you would think it a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> of the Prieſts of <hi>Ceres,</hi> it is ſo unknown to any, but ſacred minds. Theſe are the Domeſtick Gods of tranquility, and the tutelar Angels of good men: beleeve with

beare and forbeare. He neither obtaines, nor retaines his joy, that doth not abſtain, and ſuſtaine. Theſe are the two <hi>Poles</hi> upon which tranquility and vertue move. To obtain peace, you muſt bear; to retain it, you muſt forbeare. An odd way of fruition; By refuſing you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and by ſuffering you preſerve: by refuſing the favours, and ſuffering the ſpite of fortune. By this very carriage did <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> beleeve that he had quite depoſed and overthrown her: hee crowned his temples with branches of <hi>Pine,</hi> the old <hi>Iſthmian</hi> ceremonie, and walked like an abſolute vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour in the Sacred Games. Being required by a croſſe fellow, not to uſurpe that honour till he had lawfully ſtrived, he anſwered, that he had overcome two enemies, <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Griefe,</hi> the one by forbearing, the other by bearing.

Reaſon, and a warie, ſtayd Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while ſhe ſpends and waſts with her owne malice. The wrath of furious and haſty perſons is ſincere, and without arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; It hath no poyſon, but what breakes out preſently at the tongue, or the hand: Fortune too, when in this humour, is leſſe Noxious, for She makes then an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent uſe of all Tooles, and diſpoſeth of them without Study. But when She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to hate, She becomes ſlow and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not contented with open valour, addes to it Treachery. She pines with the Memory of her old favours, and that She may pull down what She built, adornes her moſt deadly Intentions, as Poverty and grievous Miſeries, in the dreſſe of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. All her projects, machinations and Engines to Torture and vex Man, amount to no more, then to give him what he would not have, and to deny him what he would have.

                  <p>But here is our double Diſeaſe, by which <hi>Virtue</hi> Conceived for a great end, together with <hi>Felicity,</hi> become both abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that wee neither rightly wiſh, nor rightly abſtain, loath, or love, but doe both moſt abſurdly, moſt prepoſterouſly.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103173:13"/>
We Covet moſt unſeaſonably, when even neceſſity is neceſſary, and this to him that wants, is no more then a wiſh. We covet, I ſay, ſuch things as fortune hath not, and in a time when they may not be had. Wee would have <hi>Cherries</hi> in <hi>January</hi>: Theſe wiſhes are their own Torments: Fortune too moſt Commonly gives them but cold Comfort. Why ſhould we Covet extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goods? It is better to ſerve the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the time, then to be a ſlave to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Wee are ſet upon longing like Woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, that labour with ſtrange appetites and depraved ſtomacks; that loath healthfull Viands, and (which in them is very ſtrange) abhorre ſweet meats; That affect raw, abſurd compoſitions, that eat lime, Charcoles and Aſhes, that in the dead of Winter long for Summer-fruits, and in Summer for Winter-fruits. What doſt thou think is bearing and forbearing? It is to be even with Fortune, diſcreetly to abſtaine, diſcreetly to will, and to covet nothing. Abſtain then: otherwiſe what wilt thou do by Coveting, but make way for Fortune, and enlarge her Empire? Though ſhe would not, ſhe muſt needs hit thee. Her being blind, hinders not but ſhe may ſhoote well: When the mark is <hi>have at all,</hi> and <hi>every where</hi>: an Archer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103173:14"/>
out Eyes cannot miſſe it. Though unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, her Arrowes cannot wander from him, whoſe luſt wanders after all things. She will hit him without Ayming, whoſe hope aymes at every thing. No Weapon falls in vaine amongſt a multitude. Her ſcope to hurt, is the ſame ſcope thou takeſt to wiſh.</p>
                  <p>Thou muſt know that the Command of Fortune over man about theſe outward things, lies in the midſt of the will, as the hand in the midſt of a bended bow. If thou holdeſt thy will by the middle, then art thou maſter of both ends, and mayſt doe any thing. If thou commandſt the one halfe, I will not ſay, thou haſt no hold at all. Liberty hath two Limbs, to <hi>Will,</hi> and to <hi>refraine</hi>: The one is a ſtronge <hi>Arme,</hi> the other a weak <hi>Hand</hi>: What thou haſt not, thou mayſt refraine from wiſhing to have, but no man can have what ever he would have. When you refrain from will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then have you Power over all things; when your will luſteth, then you are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to all things. Outward goods are fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and the faithfull ſervants of unfaithfull chance. O how great a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, how provident and infallible a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply againſt theſe ſudden Ebbs and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutions is a regular and reſolute will!
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103173:14"/>
Why are we troubled at them! We are too hard for Fortune, and by much too hard, if wee command but the one halfe of our will; that maimed and halting hand (if I may ſo ſpeak) will overtake and bring back the moſt averſe and winged Felicities. It will enrich us ſooner and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then all the Treaſures of <hi>Croeſus</hi>: Thoſe are but beggerie before thee if thou covet them not, if thy will be not a begger. Not to will, makes thee ſecurely rich, even when thou wilt, that is, when thou doeſt will nothing. Thou makeſt Fortune poore by leaving her no power over thee, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in her ſelf, wherewith to pleaſe thee; I meane to deceive thee. Thou wilt be richer than <hi>Attalus</hi> by contemning his ſtore, and of greater power than <hi>Midas</hi>; for his was placed in fruition and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but thine in abſence and emptineſſe. By wiſhing nothing thou haſt all, yea thoſe things which thou ſeeſt not: and what wonder then, if thoſe things thou ſeekeſt not, being abundantly enriched by thy moſt pretious povertie? It was Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argued by <hi>Euſebius, That he onely ſhould be eſteemed rich, who was perſwaded that he had enough. For thoſe that adde ſtill to what they have already gotten, and never thinke that they can get enough, though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103173:15"/>
richer than</hi> Midas, <hi>are moſt poor and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beggers; becauſe they are nothing rich in their own minds.</hi> And in another place, <hi>An unreaſonable covetouſneſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is ſooner driven away with the loſſe of riches allready gotten, then by a plenteous and dayly acceſſe of more treaſures.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art then only rich, and poſſeſſeſt all things to thy mind, when to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is in thy will: When ever thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <hi>It is enough,</hi> thou haſt all. Yea, thou haſt more then thou ſhouldſt have. All that comes afterwards doth but load and overwhelme thee.</p>
                  <p>Of ſuch an Immoderate uſe is Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and I Judge Patience to be of no leſſer. Happily it may be eaſier; for having learnt to abſtain, we may the better ſuſtain. Impatience ariſeth naturally out of Cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and feare is the Daughter of hope. Caſt theſe away, and you will find, that an adverſe Fortune may be entertained, not onely with Patience, but with much well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. <hi>Crates,</hi> or <hi>Zeno</hi> (a gallant man, if either of the two) being at Sea in a great ſtorm, caus'd all his goods (wherewith the Ship was Loaden) to be thrown over board, and thanked Fortune for the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: doe thou the like, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thy misfortunes, ſay, <hi>It is well
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103173:15"/>
done, Fortune, thou haſt read me a good leſſon, thou haſt had care of my Soul. I thank thee that thou art Come thy ſelfe to fetch theſe burthens, which I ſhould have brought thee home. Thou haſt dealt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to lend me their uſe, and to prevent their Abuſe. I like thy Method, and prefer thy adviſe to thy favours; I know thy mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I muſt make a wiſe uſe of theſe croſſes, I muſt have recourſe to virtue, to my ſelf, and to my God. Thou doſt not onely Incite, but compell me to goodneſſe. I am brought ſafe to ſhore, by the ſplitting of the Ship: hereafter I will be better provided. Behold, thou haſt left yet behind thee ſome movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which thou ſhouldſt have taken with thee, they are thine by right. Thou gaveſt me ſo many things, that thou canſt not well remember them. I deſire not to conceale them, take all thy Reliques and appenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with thee, all that is here beſides my ſelfe; I hold thy leavings not worthy of acceptance from the mind of man.</hi> I wiſh that we would ſo deal with Fortune, as a certain old man did with theeves that came to rob his houſe. <hi>Take with you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>all that you ſee here.</hi> They did ſo, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing behind them but an empty purſe; which the old man tooke up, and following after, called to them; <hi>Take this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103173:16"/>
alſo with you, which you forgot to put up.</hi> Fortune perhaps amazed at ſuch a Noble, Serene diſpoſition, would reſtore all: It is moſt certaine the Theeves did. But let a Chriſtian reject this figment of Fortune, and in all worldly mutations acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and kiſſe the divine hand.</p>
                  <p>But if after all this, thou wilt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the outward and ravenous manners of Fortune; there will be no Juſt cauſe for thee to accuſe them, having received no damage by her. If thou wilt purge thy mind from wiſhes and hopes, thou mayſt ſafely place thy ſelfe before her very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and defie them. And truly I believe it will be thy moſt ſecure ſtation. When <hi>Stratonicus</hi> ſaw an unskilfull fellow ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Buts,</hi> he got preſently cloſe to the <hi>VVhite,</hi> as the onely place free from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and being asked his reaſon for that unuſual Refuge, he anſwered; <hi>Leaſt that fellow ſhould hit me.</hi> Fortune (we ſay) is blind; ſtand then in her way: She hits that the leaſt, which ſhe moſt aimes at; but if all her ſhafts ſhould fall upon thee, they can draw no blood from thee, as long as thou art not drawn by covetouſneſſe. If you break off the point of the Weapon, it cannot hurt you. Our own Covetouſneſſe is Fortunes edged toole; take that away,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103173:16"/>
and you diſarme her, and ſecure your ſelfe: blunt weapons wound not to blood.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe now that <hi>Epictetus</hi> his abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or reduction of Philoſophy into two words, <hi>Abſtain</hi> and <hi>Suſtain,</hi> will ſeeme prolix enough to you. The firſt we have paſt through; the ſecond and laſt, I meane <hi>Suſtain,</hi> or the <hi>Art of bearing well,</hi> wee ſhall find tedious enough. Hee cannot be ſaid to wiſh for nothing, that finds fault with that which he hath. This bearing well is to deſire nothing but what wee have. A Serene, bright Will then, not cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thick and muddy deſires, will find the burdens of Fortune to be very light: For Fortune of her ſelfe is very light and eaſie, but ſhe hath for <hi>pannels</hi> our own Luſts, which are heavier than her <hi>packs,</hi> and without theſe ſhee puts not one loade upon us. Nothing tires and weighs us down but our own wiſhes, which evills (being ignorant that our burthen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from them,) we multiply with an Intent to eaſe our ſelves, but in the meane time the weight increaſeth. A certain plain Countryman wearied with ploughing, and returning home from the field after his daies task, tyed the Plough to his Aſſe, and afterwards mounted himſelf upon his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103173:17"/>
back; but the tyred Aſſe, and overloaden, could not ſtirre from the place; whereupon the Country-man lights, and with the Plough upon his backe remounting the Aſſe, tells him, <hi>Now I hope thou canſt goe well, for it is not thou, but I that carry the Plough.</hi> Wee are every day as ridiculous, though not ſo harmleſſe as this Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Wee ſtudy with new cares and new deſires to eaſe and diminiſh our old luſts; which not onely keepes under, but choaks and preſſeth to death all the ſeeds of Joy and Content. This is nothing elſe, but to retain the former load undiminiſh'd, and to put another on the top of it. As long as we tolerate theſe burthens, we become intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to our ſelves, without any exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Fortune. Let us ſhake them off, let us caſt off hope, that troubleſome <hi>Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>; ſo ſhall we find Fotune light, and be able to bear both her and our ſelves. All things may be born of him, that bears not future Evills; Thoſe are grievous burthens, which miraculouſly oppreſſe us, and ſo ſtrangly accommodate themſelves to our hurt, that they exiſt in the heart, and vexe it, before they can exiſt in time. Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evil, but Good, when it is hovering and uncertain, doth afflict us. Of Evills them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there cannot come ſo many together
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103173:17"/>
upon us, as we can feare: fortune can throw at us but few darts at one time, and were ſhe not ſtill furniſhed by our luſts, we ſhould quickly ſee her quiver empty. Abſtinence then, or the reſtraining of our deſires is the Nurſerie of patience, by a like title as the toleration of evill and good</p>
                  <p>But when I name Patience, I ſpeake not of a <hi>Simple</hi> thing; for there is not onely patience in <hi>Evill,</hi> but in <hi>Good</hi> alſo, and this later is ſometimes the moſt difficult. There is one when we <hi>ſuffer,</hi> and another when we <hi>act.</hi> There be alſo other diviſions of Patience. Holy <hi>Ephrem</hi> makes it three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: the <hi>firſt</hi> towards <hi>god,</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>tempter,</hi> or wicked Angel, and the <hi>third</hi> towards <hi>man.</hi> I ſhall add a <hi>fourth,</hi> and the moſt difficult of all, towards our <hi>ſelves</hi>; or I will make it onely <hi>twofold, firſt</hi> towards <hi>thoſe</hi> that are <hi>without us,</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> and laſt towards our <hi>ſelves,</hi> or thoſe <hi>commotions</hi> which fight againſt us from <hi>within.</hi> This laſt is the greateſt, becauſe it teacheth us to beare thoſe preſſures which lean upon us, and bow us down. It is harder to reſiſt thoſe weights which come forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon us from above, then thoſe which come oppoſitly, or over againſt us. The beaſts can draw more after them, then they can carry upon their backs. Man hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103173:18"/>
to beare within himſelfe: but evills are a great familie, and keep aſwell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doores as within. Every minute of our tranquility is purchaſed with patience; It is the great Sacrament of peace, the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of Security, the Herald and the badge of felicity. What will it availe us to be at peace with thoſe that are without, while we ſuffer inteſtine warres and tumults with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? let us have peace in our ſelves, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving maſtered the rebellion and diſorders of the will, let us be the patients of our ſadneſſe, yea of our Impatience, and ſome times of our patience.</p>
                  <p>As nothing is more accidentall to man then to ſuffer, ſo ſhould he conclude, that nothing is more neceſſary for him than pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. It is the naturall medicine for all humane calamities, with which (as the <hi>heart</hi> with <hi>Dittany</hi>) wee pull out the heads and ſplinters of thoſe arrowes which the <hi>mighty hunters</hi> of this world ſhoot at us. Nature dealt not more unkindly with man, than with other creatures: The <hi>Boare</hi> is cured with <hi>Ivie,</hi> the <hi>Dragon</hi> with <hi>wild-lettice,</hi> and the <hi>Snake</hi> with <hi>Fennell.</hi> Others have their cure nearer, in their owne mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: his <hi>tongue</hi> is the <hi>Balſom</hi> to a woun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded <hi>dog</hi>; and the <hi>Catholicon</hi> of man is ſilence and patience. But did I ſay
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103173:18"/>
that to ſuffer was accidentall to man? I blot out that errour, and affirme, It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: wherefore patience is moſt neceſſary; for by that we are freed from a ſlaviſh ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, as by a certaine gifted premuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defenſive faculty. By patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during we become impaſſible. The minde is invulnerable, unleſſe in the fits of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, as <hi>Achilles</hi> was in the heele. Think not the Art of patience to be any more, then not to ſuffer voluntarily; at leaſt, not in ſpight of thy will. Hee that gently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, doth by a ſhort cut free himſelf from the tedious labours and numerous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life. Neceſſities ſhould be cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully borne. The hands, the feet, and the other limbs will ſooner fail to execute their duties, then to be Inſenſible of paine. The ſick, the maimed, yea and the diſmembred are not ſo morcified, but they are ſubject to ſenſation. It was an excellent ſaying of <hi>Herod</hi> the Sophiſt, when hee was pained with the gout in his hands and feet; <hi>When I would eat,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I have no hands; when I would goe I have no feet; but when I muſt be pained, I have both hands and feet.</hi> So entire and whole are we alwaies to griefe; which ſufficiently ſheweth, that the ſoundneſſe of man is beſt ſeene in his patience; and ſuch a ſtrong neceſſity of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103173:19"/>
ſuffering is laid upon us, that when our limbs faile us in their offices, they muſt not faile of ſufferings. Thou wilt aske then what can they ſuffer, when without ſpirit and motion? I will tell thee; Not to be apt to ſuffer, is their ſuffering. Nothing is lacking to the miſery of man, though his limbs ſhould be wanting, his griefe by that defect will abound the more.</p>
                  <p>Deeply, and into the Inmoſt Cloſets of our hearts ſhould that ſaying of the <hi>Tema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> deſcend, <hi>Man</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is borne unto trouble, and the bird to flye.</hi> Obſerve, if the birds be unfurniſh'd of any thing for flight: they are all over arm'd for it; Their Bills are keen and ſharp-pointed, and ſerve like <hi>foredecks</hi> to cut their aire; Their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are two ſwift <hi>rowers,</hi> and the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in both wings placed orderly every one longer then the other repreſent ſoe many <hi>oares.</hi> Their traines are the <hi>Sternes,</hi> with which they bend their whole bodies, and govern them in their flights, and with their feete and crooked clawes like <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors,</hi> they ſtick and faſten themſelves to the green branches, which are their <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> and ſhady Harbours. Though thou hadſt never ſeene them uſe their wings, yet by their very <hi>Structure,</hi> thou would'ſt Judge that thoſe feathered <hi>Sayles</hi> were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103173:19"/>
deſign'd for the aire, and flying. Man is every way as well accoutred for trouble. Obſerve him: Thou ſhalt find nothing wanting that may conduce to his paſſion, though he wants much of Patience. Man is every way moſt exactly trimmed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned for trouble; He was made unfit for labour, that he might be fit for ſufferings; He hath no wings to fly from them, he is poor, infirme, naked, defenceleſſe; and (which is worſe than all) forſaken of himſelf: Betwixt nakedneſſe and poverty he is on all ſides expoſed and appointed for miſery, as the bird is for the flight. Thou ſhalt obſerve all this in him; for wanting all the neceſſaries which ſupport life, he is ſurrounded onely with thoſe ſad neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and intanglements which make life grievous and burthenſome; as a <hi>Sparrow</hi> is dreſt and cloathed all over with thoſe ſoft habiliments which make his flights eaſie and pleaſant. The onely difference betwixt them is this, that thoſe Inſtruments of flying may faile the birds, but thoſe of ſuffering cannot faile Man. So carefull was Nature of Mans condition, that ſhe would not truſt Fortune with his relatives. The <hi>Eagle</hi> may caſually loſe his ſharpneſſe of ſight, the <hi>Roe</hi> her ſwiftneſſe, and the <hi>Lyon</hi> his ſtrength; but Man while he lives can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103173:20"/>
not miſſe of afflictions. There is a greater care had of our affaires; And to a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous end are theſe Calamities made ſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, if wee can make them benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
                  <p>The firſt token, and evidence of life is crying. The Prim-roſes, or firſt bloſſoms of it are teares; from theſe it take its inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Man is not borne before he ſuffers: Yea, he grones and complaines in his very paſſage into the World. The firſt homage he payes to life is ſufferance, and from that minute to his laſt, he becomes (as <hi>Bleſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> ſaith) <hi>a conſtant tributary to miſery.</hi> I Judge him that murmurs at this payment, that kicks under this generall burthen, to wrong and diſeſteem the Nobleſt Nature, I mean Man; and to be worthy of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puiſhment, <hi>not to be at all.</hi> He is a moſt vile abuſer of Humane Nature, that thinks it not worth his patience, and values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at a moſt ſordid rate; let him beare in his manhood, what he bore in his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and not be aſhamed of his Inveſtiture, becauſe he felt affliction, before he felt the light. It is the firſt leſſon we are taught here, and the laſt that wee ſhall learn. All other Creatures, as ſoone as they are born, make ſome uſe of their ſtrength; but Man knowes no uſe of any thing but teares: He
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103173:20"/>
muſt afterwards be taught the cauſe of them. We muſt teach him every thing, but weeping. All other things are given him for his labour, but teares he can have for nothing. This onely faculty was beſtowed upon him <hi>gratis,</hi> all other conceſſions are the rewards of his paines; but teares were given him freely, becauſe they eaſe and allay his ſorrowes. This convenient <hi>Salve</hi> did nature ordain for ſome inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sores. She prepared this <hi>Oyle</hi> to allay the aking of thoſe ſtripes the World gives us, which without this <hi>Native Oyntment</hi> would have ſmarted more: for thoſe wounds, whoſe anguiſh is not vented at the Eyes, lie heavieſt upon the heart. And by this I am induced to believe, that it is naturall for man to Suffer, becauſe he onely naturally weepes. Every extraneous felicity of this life is violent, or forced; and theſe conſtrained, though ſplendid <hi>Adiuncts</hi> of Fortune are therefore ſhort, becauſe noe violent thing can be perpetuall. To ſuffer is the naturall condition and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man, this is believed to be his miſery: without patience, I confeſſe, it is. Nature never failes us in thoſe things which are needful, much leſſe divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and grace: Wee ſhall therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faile of Sufferings, becauſe they are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103173:21"/>
the great <hi>Neceſſaries,</hi> &amp; <hi>Medicines</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. Wee read of many men that never laught, but never heard of any that never wept. <hi>Democritus</hi> himſelf came weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World; none ever came without labour, none without griefe.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt ask, why man, the only creature addicted to beatitude, ſhould bee borne to trouble? why through the vale of teares travells he to the houſe of joy? why is he alone, being capeable of felicity, made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto miſery? Becauſe he is borne for virtue, the next and readieſt inſtrument to attaine beatitude. Now troubles, or miſerie are the maſſe, or firſt matter of virtue, and without this hard rudiment, without this <hi>coyne</hi> of ſorrow he cannot purchaſe it. Nor are the good offices which theſe calamities doe for us, either meane or few; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore flowes, yea overflowes the divine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon man, but becauſe he is miſerable? wherefore is Gods ſure power and ſaving arme ſtretched out, but becauſe he is fraile? wherefore are his comforts and refreſhments ſo plentifully ſhowred down, but becauſe he is ſorrowfull and helpleſſe? wherefore is his liberality and moſt faithful providence ſeen every minute, but becauſe he is poore and conſtantly needy? yea wherefore is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, everlaſting pleaſures, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103173:21"/>
reſurrection ſecured unto us, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our bodies are mortal, and ſubject to death and putrefaction? By this time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you ſee the appoſitneſſe of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> made betwixt <hi>man</hi> and a <hi>bird.</hi> The bird by nature lifts himſelf above the earth upon his wings, he paſſeth from hence into the cleare confines and neighbourhood of heaven, where he dwells for a time, and looks with contempt upon this inferiour darkſome portion of the world: when hee deſcends towards the earth, he keepeth ſtill above us, he lodgeth in the height and freſhneſſe of the trees, or pitcheth upon the ſpires or ridges of our houſes, or upon ſome ſteepe rock, whoſe height &amp; inacceſſibleneſs promiſe him ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; ſomething that is eminent and high he alwaies affects to reſt upon. Man likewiſe ordained for heaven, and the contempt of this ſpot of earth is by his very calamities borne up and carried above the world, yea into heaven, as an Eagle by the ſtrength of his wings aſcends above the clouds. O the depth of the riches of the wiſedome of God! O the mercifull deſigne, and devic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of his providence! who knowing our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, hath laid upon us a neceſſity of ſeeking thoſe bleſſings, whoſe ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value ought to ſtirre us up to a moſt voluntary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103173:22"/>
and diligent ſearching after them. To this <hi>neceſſity</hi> by the ſame chain of his providence hath hee tyed <hi>utility.</hi> Theſe are ſufficient motives to perſwade us to patience. It was wiſely ſaid by ſome <hi>Arabian, that the hedge about patience was profit</hi>: for he that thinks gaine to be neceſſary, muſt think labour ſo too. All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Fortune ſhould be ſo prodigal as to poure all her Treaſures into the boſome of one man, and not repent when ſhe had done; yet would this very man ſometimes feele ſtrong exigencies in indigencie. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> were both hardly diſtreſt with thirſt; they that were Lords of ſo many Rivers, did then wiſh for one drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> in ſome of his expeditions was like to periſh with cold, though his Dominion did in a manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the very Sun; for in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> (which I may call the Suns Houſe,) he was ſuch an abſolute Lord, that (bating the Power to forbid the Sun to riſe) there was nothing more could be added to his conqueſts.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that labour or troubles are a neceſſity impoſed upon man, it followes, that there are other labours belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which are alſo as neceſſary; and thoſe I ſhall terme <hi>Voluntarie Labours.</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers willingly, ſuffers not, even that which is neceſſary to be ſuffered. One wedge drives out another. Venemous bitings are allayd by Venemous Medecines; therefore in neceſſary troubles, there is a neceſſity of voluntary Labours, that <hi>Violent Evills</hi> meet not with <hi>Obſtinate Wills</hi>: but the unavoydableneſſe of ſuffering would not be grievous, nor the neceſſity or Law of Nature any way rigorous, did not we by our owne exaggerations adde to their weight, and our owne pain.

Fortune, whoſe burthens we ought to bear as willingly, as if wee deſired to undergoe them?</p>
                  <p>It is a great rudiment of patience to ſuffer willingly, when we leaſt expect ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. It is ſtrange, that although wee ſee nothing in the courſe of this life more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent then miſeries, yet will wee not be perſwaded that they may fall into our ſhare: Our griefes come moſt commonly before we believe they may come. Nothing can make us believe, that we may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, untill miſery it ſelfe aſſures it to us. The mind therefore ſhould be tryed and prepared for it, with ſome luſorie or mock-miſfortunes. Nor muſt we give eare to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> whoſe ſaying is, <hi>That if there be any things for us to ſuffer, it is good to learn them, but not to ſuffer them.</hi> It is good indeed to learn them, but if they muſt be unavoydably ſuffered, what will our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them avail us? A moſt ridiculous adviſe, in my Judgement: And if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it had been wiſe, he had laught at nothing more then at this his owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. It is good to learn to <hi>ſuffer Evills,</hi> but not to <hi>be evill.</hi> It will benefit us much to learn to ſuffer them, if not as they are Evills, yet leſt wee our ſelves become Evill; for ſuch we ſhall be by impatience.

                  <p>Let the mind then learne to buckle with theſe rude toyles of life, and by a frequent velitation or light skirmiſhing with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſo improve it ſelfe, that when we c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not onely ſlight the neceſſary and common afflictions of life, but overcome alſo (by a noble <hi>volunteering,</hi>) the very prerogative of fate, violating even the violence of death, while they dyed unconſtrayned and undiſturbed. <hi>Mithridates</hi> his feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poyſoned, made him uſe himſelfe to a venomous diet, by which he came at laſt to diſgeſt all ſorts of poyſons without any prejudice to his health: ſo that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when he would have poyſoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in good earneſt, he could not poſſibly doe it. By this deſtroyer of mankind did he ſecure himſelfe even from himſelfe, and by long acquaintance made this deadly enemie a faithfull friend: he fed life with the proviſion of death. By a like ſagacity ſhould we forearme our ſelves againſt the conſpiracies (if I may ſo ſay) of nature. Let us labour againſt labours; It will much availe us: our very feares will prove com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; by uſing our ſelves to ſufferance, the Antidote of life, which is Patience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes effectuall.</p>
                  <p>Of ſuch great importance is this aſſiduous exerciſe in troubles, that it lets in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Conſtancie,</hi> and is a ſure manuducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that ſincereſt vertue. The <hi>Roman</hi> Fencers, players for prizes, barbarous and diſſolute livers, if but indifferently skild,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103173:25"/>
received their wounds without grones, or any alteration of geſture or countenance, becauſe they would not be judged puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, nor cowardly decliners of danger; If at any time they fell by the violence of wounds, they ſent preſently to know their maſters pleaſures, (becauſe they would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them,) for they themſelves were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to dye; If their maſters (finding them incurable) bad them prepare for death, they would preſently hold forth their throats and receive the ſword moſt willingly. O the ſerious faith of Playes! O the faith of Players in ſerious dangers! It is all one then, whether thou thinkeſt fortune a meere pageant and paſtime, or not; Thou ſhouldeſt obey with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall faith even to the death. Let a wiſe man execute the commands of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, let him like a faithfull ſouldier of JESUS CHRIST certifie his great maſter, that he is ready and willing to doe him ſervice, that he will loſe his life, &amp; chooſe rather to dye, then not to ſubmit to his pleaſure.

the <hi>Olympick</hi> Olive-branches ſhall crown an enduring Patience, which by an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but overcomming Sufferance wearies the hands of thoſe that beat us. It is the part of a wiſe man, to tire and weare out the malice of his Enemies. I ſay not by Suffering, but by Patience, which makes him neither their Patient, nor trampled upon, but a trampling overcomer. This was the glory of <hi>Melancoma,</hi> who lived not one day without an Enemy. In the moſt vehement ſeaſon of the yeare, hee judged his ſingle-ſelfe hard enough for his two Adverſaries: He could beare with the <hi>Sun,</hi> his moſt obſtinate <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> though fighting againſt him in the heate of the Summer with ſo many hands as he had Rayes.: When he might have gotten the Victory by Oppoſition, he would not but by Submiſſion. Hee conſidered, that the beſt might be overcome by the worſt, if force ſhould take place. That Victory was in his Judgement the Nobleſt, when the Enemy, yet whole and without any hurt, was compell'd to ſubmit. There is he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, when not by wounds, but by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore what vice, and a ſpurious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience did in the <hi>Roman</hi> Fencers, let Virtue and true Patience performe in thee: and

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103173:29"/>
not onely enabled to bear, but alſo beareth. The backe and ſhoulder of Patience is the <hi>Will.</hi> This voluntary fortitude of the mind will do all its buſineſſe, without the help of outward Engines; It needs not the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Armes, nor the weak uſe of wiſhes. The ſtrength of Virtue is not exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>There remain alſo other neceſſary Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, though not to thoſe that ſuffer them allready, yet to others that may, or are about to undergoe them: For the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Country &amp; liberties we ought patiently to ſuffer even unto death. It is not too deare a rate to pay that debt wee owe to Nature, for the defenſe of Nature in our publick Perſons: To this we want not the Incouragement of examples. What ever hath been ſuffered heretofore, may be ſuffered now by us. But if thoſe preſidents rather cool, then provoke our Courage, why dare not wee ſuffer a little, ſeeing they ſuffered ſo much? To teach us this Virtue of Patience, and ſtrengthen our ruinous brittle condition, the motherly love and fatherly care of the eternal, Divine mind, did provide and diſperſe through certaine ſpaces and Intervalls of time (like knots for the ſtrengthning of a weak reed,) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch eminent Patience and Piety,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103173:29"/>
as might by their examples ſuſtaine and beare up mankind, untill the <hi>Antient of daies,</hi> and Father of Immortality himſelf ſhould deſcend into this mortall life, and be born for Patience, and for death. In the meane time, that the populous World might not want a Glaſſe to dreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by, he ſent theſe to be the ſubſtitutes and forerunners of his mighty and inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Patience. The firſt he conſecrated to this dignity was <hi>Abel,</hi> in whom <hi>Patience</hi> (ſaith holy <hi>Aldhelmus</hi>) <hi>was Original, as Sinne was in Adam.</hi> God joyned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to his Innocence by a certain Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juſtice or claim in him; but to the reſt of the Juſt it deſcends together with ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, by right of Inheritance: to none more, to none better then to the Innocent. But now even by this, thoſe ſuffer moſt, that ſhould ſuffer leaſt, the good and the Juſt. But thoſe ſufferings are moſt ſacred, that are moſt unjuſt. <hi>Adam</hi> found out afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and <hi>Abel</hi> Patience; the medicine preſently followed the diſeaſe. Evills were the Inventions of Sinne, Patience was the Device of Innocence. So that Patience as their peculiar Treaſure abounds more, and is more beloved by the Juſt, then by any elſe. But that Poſthume Cry of <hi>Abel</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from Impatience: For God
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103173:30"/>
would not have taken to himſelf the cauſe of one dying diſcontentedly, and with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; but as devout <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. Abel the Juſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjuſtly was the firſt of men that ſhewd the foundations of death to be ruinous; wherefore he being dead yet ſpeaketh.</hi> Death, whoſe right came by unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, laid ruinous foundations indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ill-layd, upon the Juſt dying unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It hath cauſe to grieve, that it erred ſo fouly in its firſt ſtroke, ſeeing it might have made a better beginning in wicked <hi>Cain.</hi> But there was <hi>Divinitie</hi> in it, that death taking poſſeſſion of mankind by the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Juſt, might be juſtly extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and ſwallowed up in Victory by the undefiled <hi>Virgin-Prince</hi> of the Juſt, who for that end was born of a Virgin. <hi>Ephrem</hi> ſaith, <hi>that death howled or lamented in her very beginning, which ſhewed what would be her end.</hi> The <hi>Hern</hi> by inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Chatters and mourns, before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the prey of the <hi>Falcon.</hi> Death dyed by him, over whom ſhe had no power. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is the night of death, where ſin, where corruption lives.</p>
                  <p>Another tie of Conſtancy laid upon the World, after a convenient ſpace, was <hi>Job,</hi> who retained his Patience after proſperity,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103173:30"/>
and after Innocence. Patience is no where merrier, nor better contented with it ſelf, then in the Innocent. Integrity and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſeldome lodge together. Adverſity is the Whetſtone which keepes it from ruſt, and makes it ſhine. No Virtues can ſubſiſt without troubles, which are their foode. They live not commodiouſly, where their Proviſion is farre from them: Wherefore holy and Juſt men have adverſity alwaies (like a <hi>Well</hi>) at their dores. I ſhall take up then with that ſaying of <hi>Eliphaz: Affliction comes not forth of the duſt, nor doth trouble ſpring out of the ground</hi>; but rather from Heaven; and comes oftner to holy and heavenly livers, then to Worldly and unrighteous perſons.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Job,</hi> and at a convenient diſtance from his time was <hi>Tobiah</hi> appointed, who inſtead of <hi>Celandine,</hi> made uſe of Patience to heal his Eyes: being blind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that they might adorne Patience with theſe two Jewells, the reward of ſuffering, and the dignity of the Sufferer. But the <hi>Truth</hi> of God hath now outdone the <hi>Fictions</hi> of men; It hath exceede all they did licentiouſly wiſh, but could not hope for. Our Patience is now ſufficiently inſtructed by the <hi>SONNE</hi> of God, who is the pleaſant remedy and <hi>Panacea</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills. The bleſſed <hi>JESUS</hi> breathed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Patience, nothing but mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his life, in his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the great examples which true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould follow; not thoſe of ſpurious Patience, and a narrow, heathen fortitude, which after it had born ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills indeed, dyed at the root, and could not bear it ſelf. <hi>Seneca</hi> (otherwiſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things a very true, and ſometimes a Chriſtian Philoſopher,) propoſeth to his readers the example of <hi>Cato</hi>; but I utterly reject it; for he deſtroyed himſelfe, becauſe he could not ſave his Common-wealth. What Conſtancy was here, though in a ſtate that concern'd not his private happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? or what manner of Conſtancy was that, which durſt not endure and hold out, but was overcome, not by irrecoverable, fallen affaires, but falling: Not collaſped and ruin'd, but tottering and doubtfull?
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103173:32"/>
I confeſſe, it was a ſpectacle, which the Eye of God Intentive to his great and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works might behold with glory: and I confeſſe him a brave Heathen, Ill-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But I ſee nothing glorious and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in him, nothing of true worth, but what I can find as wel in the moſt degenerate and womaniſh <hi>Sardanapalus.</hi> If wee look upon <hi>Cato</hi> amidſt the publick ruines, wee ſhall finde him overthrowne and laid along, where an old wall ſtands up, no Enemy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving touch'd him. A moſt unworthy man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if he was a man,) to fall thus baſely like a Woman; who at the noyſe of any thing ſuddenly thrown down, caſts her ſelf to the ground, and ſqueaks though untouch'd, and far enough from danger. But thou wilt ſay, <hi>Though all things became ſubject to one man, though his legions poſſeſt the Earth and his Navies the Seas, yea though Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars own regiment was in the gates, yet</hi> Cato <hi>made his way out.</hi> An honeſt voice, if it were not flattery: I tell thee he did not make his way, but ſneakt and fled out moſt ſhamefully: His legs could not carry him off, and therefore hee ran away upon his hands. But it is all one, flye with which he will, it is a plain flight; his buſie and ſearching fear, which in him (by reaſon of a ſudden, unmanly aſtoniſhment) was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103173:32"/>
moſt Sagacious, ſhew'd him this poſtern or backdoor, which he moſt baſely fled out at. <hi>But what could that man be afraid of, that had born ſo often the Aſſaults of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>? He feared that very ſame Fortune: <hi>How can that be,</hi> (ſay'ſt thou) <hi>ſeeing he had coped with her ſo long before</hi>? For that valour let him thank his errour: He belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Fortune (according to her old vogue) to be ſtill inconſtant, he expected that the Tyde ſhould turne; but finding her obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and reſolved in earneſt to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he feared her laſt blow, and providing for himſelf by a moſt daſtardly tenderneſſe, did with his owne hands dreſſe and make a wound to his own liking. To be patient, or to ſuffer as wee pleaſe, is not Patience. He could bear the anger, but not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and feud of Fortune. That is poore valour, that bears onely the flouriſhes and pickearings of an Enemy, but dares not receive his full charge. A weak man will for ſome time ſtand under a great burthen; but he that carries it through, and home, is the ſtrongeſt. <hi>Cato</hi> then was a moſt baſe, puſillanimous combatant; hee quitted his ground, and left Fortune in the field, not only unconquer'd, but untir'd, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing with a whole Arme, which hee had not yet drawn bloud from: What Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103173:33"/>
can be greater then his, who was more Inconſtant than Vertiginous Fortune? Or who more a Coward then he, that fled and ran away ſwifter and ſooner than her wheeles? To call <hi>Cato</hi> then either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, wiſe, or good, is moſt unjuſt; nay more, it is an Injurie to mankind, to call him a man, who hath deſerved ſo ill of Wiſedome and men, by thinking that any <hi>Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>Chance</hi> in this World can be worthy of a wiſe mans death. I would he had read the Concluſion of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> not the diſſertation of <hi>Socrates! Theodorus Cythereus</hi> moſt truly affirmed, that there never can be cauſe enough for a wiſe man to caſt away his life; And he proves it by invincible reaſon: <hi>For him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that contemns humane Chances, to caſt away his life becauſe of them, how contrary is it to his own Judgment, which eſteems nothing good, but what is Virtuous, nothing vitious but what is evill</hi>? I wiſh, when he did read <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he had alſo underſtood him! for then he ſhould have heard him condemning that <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103173:33"/>
cowardly common Souldier, that forſook his Charge, and betrayed the Fort intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by the <hi>Prince</hi> of Life? But here thou wilt reply, <hi>that his laſt nights con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, juſt before he quitted it, was Immortality.</hi> The end he did ſtudy it for, made it then unſeaſonable: And I know not (ſeeing he was but an Imperfect ſpeculator in the Doctrine of Immortality,) why hee ſhould be ſo haſty to try whither Eternity was periſhable, or not, by caſting away his own. He ſhould have expected it, as he did expect the change of Fortune, which till that night he alwaies eſteemed Mortall: He ſhould have prepared for it by makeing triall of his Conſtancie before Eternity.</p>
                  <p>What praiſe then either of Patience, or Fortitude hath he deſerved? he did no more then the moſt effeminate, <hi>Hemon</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus.</hi> O the glorious Act of <hi>Cato</hi> then, equall to his, that handled the <hi>Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi>!

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103173:36"/>
into the World through the envy of the Divell: Good men hold it to be Evill, &amp; the bad find it ſo. Thou wilt ask then, what is the Medicine of Evills? I anſwer, it is that, which is the Medicine that ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens us to bear the violence, and the pangs of death; that which the very Enemies of it cannot deny to be good, I mean Patience: that which being made Evill by abuſe, yet in that ſtate hath been commended by men that were not Evil, by <hi>Seneca</hi> in his <hi>Cato, Dion</hi> in his <hi>Melancoma,</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> in his <hi>Pancratiaſtes</hi>: So winning and attractive is the Virtue of Patience, that the very ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of it procures reverence, and make the very abuſe and corruption of it lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If then the <hi>Counterfeit</hi> of it could beautifie vice, and make it amiable even to wiſe men, what wonder is it, if the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> be a protection and ornament to Virtuous perſons? This is the Medicine which <hi>Leonides</hi> gave againſt death. Let thoſe Titles therefore which death uſurped, be vindicated by the right owner. Patience then is the beſt medicine of Evills; It is the cure of the Incurable, the laſt Phyſitian, the Eaſe in death, the mollifying Oyle, the gentle purge, the pleaſant Potion, and that I may recover its right to another Title which death uſurped from the pen of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Hitherto we have taken view but of one ſide of Patience, and that halfe of her which ſhe oppoſeth to <hi>Evills.</hi> Every part of her is lovely and excellent: and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move now from this Collateral ſtation to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103173:37"/>
a direct, we ſhall behold her intire beauty, and how well ſhee deſerves of <hi>good.</hi> The <hi>Sacraments</hi> of this Virtue are two: <hi>To ſuffer Evill: to do good</hi>: Nobly doth ſhe celebrate both; with her there is no Evill, without her there is no good. I think her the <hi>Mart,</hi> and <hi>Mother-City</hi> of all that is good. Every Virtue is a <hi>Colonie</hi> of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, planted and nouriſhed by her. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues owe their Original to her, ſhe is part of it, and in every one of them. She is their <hi>holy fire,</hi> their <hi>Veſta,</hi> and <hi>Lararium,</hi> or private Chappell; they are her <hi>Nuns</hi> or <hi>Virgins,</hi> what ever they have, either ſacred or glorious, is from her: To the perfection of man there is nothing more neceſſary: For as <hi>Braſſe</hi> muſt be firſt melted, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards caſt; ſo the hard and rigid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Virtues muſt be ſoftned and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Patience, that man may become a glorious and living <hi>Statue</hi> of Divinitie. No marvell, that wee require labour and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Virtuous perſons, ſeeing wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from <hi>Smiths</hi>; A certain Juſt Law of all the World hath exacted it to be the price of Virtue. Beare what thou wouldſt not, and thou ſhalt enjoy what thou wilt.

but in mind alſo: Without Patience they cannot poſſeſſe their own Soules.

What is

more glorious then to have made glory? In the preſent <hi>Sabbath</hi> and ſolemnity of Gods reſt, the workes which he hath made, declare his glory unto men, whoſe task alſo is, <hi>to work.</hi> Beſides, this firſt curious draught of his Almighty hand contributes ſomething to the perfect beauty of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, laſt one; for the Divine Eye (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon this <hi>proofe,</hi>) will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orne that building of holineſſe and glory with everlaſting ſtrength, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, Celeſtial freſhneſſe. God made not man by a <hi>Fiat,</hi> as he did the reſt of the Creatures, but fell to work himſelf, and like the <hi>Potter</hi> that firſt tempers, then faſhions the Clay, he made him by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not by ſpeaking. That one royall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture capable of felicity, was conſecrated for beatitude, and the Divine likeneſſe with the ceremony of labour: Here man was inſtructed, before he was made: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the exemplar of living before he received life: Idleneſſe was forbidden him, before he had the Power given him to be active. But when he gave him life, he gave him alſo with it another <hi>Specimen,</hi> or <hi>Item</hi> of labour, breathing into him, as if he had uſed reſpiration (which refreſheth the laborious,) to ſhew man the uſe of his breath. All things that were created for the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103173:39"/>
ſervice of mankind, were by the manner of their Creation (which was with a <hi>Fiat,</hi> or command,) taught to be obedient and humble: But man was firſt ordained for Dominion, afterwards for labour; And God himſelf, the Lord of all, labour'd in his Creation, that Hee might make him to be in love with his Ordinance, and that God (plotting as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf,) might by that love of man be induced to love him the more, and to eſteeme him more his owne Creature then any other, becauſe he onely (like his Creatour) loved Activity, and the uſe of life. And this I believe is the meaning of <hi>Xenophon: Labour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a certain over-meaſure, or extraordinary favour of love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So glorious an Ornament is Patience, either in ſuffering, or elſe in doing, I believe in both (for Labour, without the good of Patience, is good of it ſelfe,) that for no other end, but to be thought temperate and wiſe, the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> commended abſtinence, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſeverity, the <hi>Cynick</hi> exceeded to rigour, the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> to cruelty, and a face of madneſſe and deſpair. Every one of theſe adorned his <hi>Hereſie</hi> with Patience, and all the rude ſtatues they erected to wiſedom, were crowned
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103173:40"/>
with this Virtue. <hi>Edeſius</hi> being ſent by his Father to traffick into <hi>Greece,</hi> quitted the <hi>Merchant,</hi> and turn'd <hi>Philoſopher</hi>: His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his return receiving him with ſtripes, and hee patiently bearing them, asked him, what he had learnt in the Schooles of the Philoſophers?

                  <p>Patience doth that for the private man, which their <hi>life-guards</hi> doe for <hi>Kings</hi>: It keepes him ſafe, and reverenc'd.

Hee preaching to the <hi>Indians</hi> in the ſtreet, one barbarous Infidel, having gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his mouth full of ſordid ſpittle, came preſſing through the crowd to the place where he ſtood, and delivered it juſt in his face; but he nothing moved therewith, and neither rebuking the Barbarian, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſing his former geſture, perſiſted in his Maſters buſineſſe, and preach'd on: His Doctrine though powerfull, after the ſilent Rhetorick of this publick example, might for that time have beene well ſpared.

So glorious a document of Patience made him envy our Divine Philoſophy, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy made him Ambitious, and his holy Ambition made him a Chriſtian.

By ſuch a blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Victory did <hi>Motois</hi> overthrow his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary; from whom he fled moſt valiantly, leſt he ſhould offend him; I do not ſay with his hands, but with his ſight; for Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath no hands, but ſhoulders. His Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary purſues: <hi>Motois</hi> had lockt himſelf up, &amp; became his own priſoner, eſteeming it guilt enough, that another could be angry with him: But hearing that his Enemy was come in (being only Impatient till he had ſhewed more Patience,) hee breakes open the door, bids him welcome, and like one that had offended, deſires to be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and afterwards feaſts him. This ſtory I have touch'd upon, that thou maiſt ſee how powerfull an Inſtrument of tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a quiet, happy life, Patience is, that makes peace to beare fruit in another

                  <p>Every Action of a wiſe man is a certain emulation of Death; wee may ſee it expreſt in his patience.

poſthume liberty. Death looſeth the Soule from the body, it breaks in ſunder the ſecret bonds of the blood, that ſhe may have the full uſe of her wings, and be united to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. Patience, though it doth not quite looſen the chaine, yet it lengthens it, that ſhe may take the aire, and walk ſome part of the way towards Home: Though it frees not the Soul from the body, yet it gives her liberty and dominion over it. He that is tyed up by a long Cord, is within the compaſſe allowed him untyed, and a free man. The Spirit of man incenſed by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, and collected into it ſelfe, is by a certain <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> made more ardent and aſpiring: <hi>Fire</hi> is never ſtronger, nor more intenſe then amongſt <hi>Water</hi>; In the boſome of a cloud it breakes forth into thunder: So this Divine Spark, which God hath ſhut up in Veſſels of Clay, when all the paſſages of pleaſures are ſtopt, his raies (which before were diffuſed and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant) returne into it ſelfe, and miſſing their uſuall vent, break forth with ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, as carries with it ſometimes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body, and ſteales the whole man from paſſion and mortality. The <hi>Levitie</hi> of fire is of greater force, then the <hi>Gravity</hi> and Maſſineſſe of Earth: His <hi>Spirit</hi> is unreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the unknown force of it will blow

                  <p>Hitherto have I diſcourſed of outward <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills,</hi> I ſhall now conſider the Inward, and how Patience is their Antidote. You have ſeen her Prerogative over Fortune, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>Evills,</hi> which are called <hi>Evills,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeem to be ſo, not becauſe they are ſo; as diſgrace, grief, and poverty. All theſe are but fictitious <hi>Evils,</hi> which Cuſtom and Humane error have branded with that injurious denomination: for in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies there is no reall <hi>Evill,</hi> but the <hi>Evill</hi> of opinion; neither is any man miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable but in his own conceit, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. The glory of Patience would be but poor and trivial, if it could doe no more then take away, or beare with ſuch frivolous and fictitious troubles as theſe: If it prevailed onely againſt <hi>Evills,</hi> which we do not ſuffer, but invent. Its true glory is, that it ſubdues true <hi>Evills</hi>: Not that it bears them, but that it removes them far from us: Not that it endures them, but than it abſtaines from them: For truly to ſuffer <hi>Evil,</hi> is to do <hi>Evil,</hi> whoſe <hi>Agent</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the <hi>Patient</hi> is, by reaſon of a moſt ill impatience: But Patience is onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, becauſe it ſuffers not. This worſt kind of <hi>Evil</hi> is therefore the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103173:45"/>
becauſe when 'tis in acting, it is not ſeen; and were it not afterwards felt, there would be no place left for Virtue. This is the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all method of Vice, a flattering, <hi>Comical</hi> entrance, and a <hi>Tragical exit.</hi> The force and malice of Evil Actions may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their Nature: They are ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hurtful, that when they ceaſe to be, they ceaſe not to torment us: and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, that while we act them, they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, that being Acted, they may afflict us: While we are doing them, they conceal and deny themſelves; but being done, they appear to our ſorrow. Wherefore he that will lead a bleſſed, a joyfull, and a peaceful life, muſt make it his whole work, to do no work, but what Religion and Virtue ſhall approve of. What peace and ſecurity can he enjoy that will revenge himſelfe, (what more would cruelty have?) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own luſt? What life can he be ſaid to live, that kills himſelfe to pleaſe his inordinate affections?

pleaſed them ſo much as this gnawing worm, the terrible and luctual excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wiſe <hi>Father</hi> of Nature.

The firſt penaltie for murther was conſcience: The firſt Actor of a violent death was puniſhed with life: He that firſt ſaw, and introduced death, was thought worthy of no other punishmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103173:47"/>
brought murther firſt into the World, was firſt punished with the terrourr of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Which are then moſt torturing, when health and ſtrength are the capital punishments. The <hi>Protoplaſts</hi> themſelves, the parents of death, and of mankind too, who gave us death before they gave us life, thought it a greater plague then death, to be ſtill alive, and yet to be guilty of death?

God, Nature, Reaſon, and fury it ſelfe (which in this caſe muſt not be defined madneſſe,) do all beare witneſſe, that ſelfe-condemnation, or the guilt of conſcience is of all others the moſt bitter and avenging torment.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this, that the certainty of it is as infallible, and inevitable, as the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and fierceneſſe of it are implacable: there was never any Tyrant ſo cruel, but would pardon ſome offender: There was none ſo ſeverely inquiſitive, but ſome might either eſcape from him, or deceive him: But the rigour of conſcience permits nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther favour, flight, nor fraud. It is utterly inexorable, and neither our feete will ſerve us to ran away, nor our hands to free us: whither ſhall a man ran from himſelfe, from the ſecrets of his own ſpirit, from his life? No man can be an Impoſtour or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler with his own heart, no man can undo what he hath already done: to have ſinned is the remedileſs plague of the Soul. It was a ſlow expreſſion of <hi>Victor,</hi> that <hi>Vengeance is near to ſinne.</hi> It is ſwifter then ſo: It is not <hi>conſectaneous,</hi> or in chaſe of it, but <hi>coetaneous</hi> with it, and its <hi>foſter-ſiſter</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:103173:48"/>
The puniſhment hath the ſame birth with the offence, and proceedes from it; It is both the <hi>Siſter,</hi> and the <hi>Daughter</hi> of it: Wickedneſſe cannot be brought forth without its penalty: The breſt that conceives the one, is big with the other, and when the one is borne, he is delivered of both. It is a fruitfullneſſe like that of <hi>Mice,</hi> whoſe young ones are included the one in the other, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the very wombe. Conſcience, while man thinkes of Evill, even before he acts, doth rebuke that thought: ſo that the puniſhment is praeexiſtent to the crime, though in the reigne of Virtue it is noiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and uſeleſſe; as penal Lawes are dead letters, untill they are quickned by offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. It is then in its <hi>minority,</hi> and without a <hi>ſting,</hi> or elſe it is aſleep, untill the Cry of Sinne awakes it. In the ſtate of Evill, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the firſt and the laſt revenger: when ſmal offences are wiped out, enormous crimes like capital letters will ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>
                  <p>No man can find a Sanctuary to ſave <hi>him</hi> from <hi>himſelf.</hi> No evill doer can ſo fly for refuge, as to be <hi>ſecure,</hi> though he may be <hi>ſafe</hi>: Hee will be afraid in that place, where he thought not to fear: Though he fears not the friends of the murthered, yet
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103173:48"/>
he finds that within him, which makes him ſore afraid: He may eſcape the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner and the ſword, but he will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by himſelfe; and being ſafe, hee will be afraid even of his ſafety: Though he may find fidelity in his fellow-Tyrants, yet ſhall he find none in his own boſome, which is ever clamorous, and ſpues out blood and guilt. Nature deviſeth ſuch a puniſhment for evill doers, as that which tyed living Malefactors unto the putrid Carkaſſes of dead men, that the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and ſtench of them might afflict their ſpirits, and the quick fleſh be infected and devoured by the dead and rotten. The <hi>puniſhment</hi> ſticks faſt unto us after the <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> whoſe carkaſſe is terrour of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Shame, and a gnawing remorſe, that feeds ſtill upon the faulty, but is not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The guilty perſon can have noe peace,

                  </p>
                  <p>Adde to this, that Reaſon which in all other preſſures and misfortunes is the great Auxiliary and Guardian of man, is in an offended Conſcience his greateſt Enemy,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103173:49"/>
and imploys all her forces to his vexation and ruine.</p>
                  <p>Fortune therefore is not the onely cauſe of our contriſtation; we our ſelves do arm adverſities, and put a ſword into the hand of griefe to wound us with; we are ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers againſt our ſelves. Evill Actions afflict more then Evill Fortune; We are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled that it was <hi>Chaunce,</hi> but that it was our <hi>Choice.</hi> It is the worſt kind of miſery, to be made miſerable by our owne approbation. That evill which we procure to our ſelves, muſt needs grieve us more, then that which we caſually ſuffer: Noe damage is ſo doleful, as a condemning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Truly, I do believe, that the onely misfortune of Man is <hi>Sinne.</hi> And ſo very bad and miſchievous a Cheat it is, that when it is moſt puniſhed, wee think it moſt proſpers; neither can Fortune be juſtly termed Evil, but when ſhe is the Aſſiſtant of Evill men, and the ſurety for Evill doing. This permitted ſucceſſe makes the affaires of the moſt unrighteous to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Juſt: This is a felicity like that of beaſts, which we put into pleaſant and well watered paſtures, that they may be fed for ſlaughter. Againſt this true misfortune, as well as the falſe and ſeeming, Patience muſt be our Antidote; not by bearing, but by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103173:49"/>
abſtaining from it. Patience in this Caſe muſt elevate it ſelfe, and paſſe into a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anger and contempt of ſinfull proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: We muſt be piouſly impatient of all their proffers and poiſonous allurements; Impatient, I ſay, that we may patiently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as I have formerly exhibited the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>bearing well</hi> to be the onely remedy againſt Fortune: So now I ſhall demonſtrate to you, that the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well,</hi> is the ſole medicine againſt theſe true and inward misfortunes: Differing diſeaſes muſt have different cures. Patience is the poyſon that kills Fortune, and the Balm that heales her ſtripes: but a ſacred impatience, or abſtinence from Sinne is the Antidote of Conſcience; and the <hi>Baſis</hi> or foundation of this holy impatience is tranſcendent and triumphant Patience. To mitigate or overcome Fortune is a trivial trick: Flattery will do it, if we can but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to approve of, and commend all that ſhe doth. To preſerve the peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, wee muſt be rigid, and cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: We muſt ſpeak home, and truly: We muſt examine before we Act, and admit of no Action that wil be a juſt cauſe but for to bluſh.

Contrition is the infancie of Virtue: Therefore that ſadneſſe muſt not be expelled which expelleth Vice. It is an invention of the Deity to deſtroy Sinnes: That they might be either unfruitfull, or fruitfull onely to their owne deſtruction: For this we have two inſtances from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the <hi>Mule</hi> and the <hi>Viper</hi>: Whereof the one is barren, and the other unhappily fruitfull.

                  <p>Hee then that would not drink of this <hi>Wormwood,</hi> muſt be ſure to refuſe the <hi>ſugred venom</hi> of ſinne: No man is Evill for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Every defect in life is occaſioned by a defect of Patience: becauſe we cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be conſtantly good: becauſe we are impatient of continuall holineſſe.

impatient of the firſt, or elſe the patients of the laſt: Unleſſe wee will ſuffer a litle to avoid offences, wee muſt ſuffer much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have fallen into them. A ſhort diſpleaſure is better then a long torment: This previous Patience of abſtaining, frees us from two ſubſequent Evils: The <hi>pain</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> untill we repent, and after that the <hi>pain</hi> of <hi>Penitence</hi>: Theſe two are the <hi>Appendants,</hi> or retinue of every ſinne; A ſeaſonable, innocent forbearance is the <hi>fenſe</hi> againſt them both: one ſmall griefe averts theſe two great ones: How whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and comfortable is that Patience which prevents ſinne and ſorrow, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of it?

The Joy of Conſcience is Natures recompence, the coaleſcent reward, or fruite of integrity, an entailed happineſſe, the native blandiſhment of life, and the minds mighty purchaſe: What happier gaine can be, then to rejoice alwaies, for what wee have done but once? or what greater da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage then an unrighteous gain?

To be onely without Vice, is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious commendation: Nay, it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable at all, but ſelf-indulgence, or a flattering of our owne corrupt inactivity. To ſuch a paſſe is man come, that he is not aſhamed to do leſſe for Virtue, then the vitious will do for Vice. It is a moſt poore and fordid glory, to be onely not numbred amongſt the bad: It is a baſe degree of praiſe, to be reputed onely not baſe. To be without Vice, is not to be good: Not to be vitious, and to be Virtuous, are two things. To refrain from Evill, is ſcarſe not Evill, eſpecially if we proceed no further: For to be able to be good, and not to be throughly ſo, is, if not Evill, a neighbourhood to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. True praiſe conſiſts not in a bare abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from Evill, but in the purſuance &amp; the performance of good. It ſufficeth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we doe nothing which may <hi>afflict</hi> us, but we muſt withall doe ſomething that may <hi>exhilarate</hi> us. This we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that to do good is one thing, and to become good is another; Although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

It is to write faire, and then to poure the Inke upon it. Actions ceaſe to be good, unleſſe well acted, they are like excellent <hi>colours</hi> ill-layed on.

God would not limit thy happineſſe: He left thee pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to encreaſe it, to poliſh and beautifie thy ſelfe according to thy own mind.

The preſents we offer to the true God, muſt be true and ſolid works, not the fictitious oblations of <hi>Jupiter Milichus</hi>: Why wilt thou delight in a maimed Soule, or which is worſe, in a Soul whoſe beſt part is dead? Thou hadſt rather have a member cut off, then hanging dead by thee: Thou wouldſt then onely wiſh for its company, when it would be no hindrance to thee.

It is an emanation from that place, where eternity ſprings. The right uſe of it, is to reduce it to its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal: If we follow time cloſe, it will bring us to its Fountain. It is a <hi>clue</hi> caſt down from Heaven to guide us thither. It is the younger brother of eternity, the one muſt be ſought in the other. It hath ſome aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Divinity: it is partly knowable, and partly not: Wee move in it, and wee ſee it not: It is then moſt inviſible; when moſt preſent. If we be carefull of it, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is ours: If wee neglect it, we caſt away our ſelves.

                  <p>But when I ſpeak of tenderneſſe, and a ſeeming complyance with the weakneſſe of others; I mean not diſſimulation. I allow a community of tears, but not of the <hi>cauſe</hi> of tears. Let the miſerable bewail their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103173:65"/>
and let the wiſe man mourne with thoſe that mourn, becauſe they mourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, not becauſe they ſuffer. Let him not mourne for the power of Fortune, but for the weakneſſe of man. When a friend of <hi>Solon</hi> found him weeping, hee told him, <hi>That tears were not the potion againſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and would therefore profit nothing; I know it well</hi> (ſaid <hi>Solon</hi>) <hi>and that is it which I Lament.</hi> He bewailed the tears of others, not the cauſe of their tears: That is it which a wiſe man (the enemy and the avenger upon Fortune,) may juſtly bewail, to ſee men weep, when weeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes not. He is troubled, not becauſe they ſuffer, but becauſe they will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; yea, becauſe they will not be men: He thinkes not that it is Evill to ſuffer worldly afflictions; Nay, hee knowes it is good, but he knowes withall that worldly ſorrowes ſlay the Soul. This is the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that calls forth his tears: Hee wiſely diſtinguiſheth, that man is not made miſerable by any <hi>outward accidents,</hi> but by his own <hi>opinion</hi>: For no man is made unhappy, becauſe he <hi>exiſts,</hi> or <hi>is,</hi> but becauſe he thinks himſelfe to be ſo: The wiſe man bewailes a greater <hi>Evil</hi> then the <hi>Evil</hi> of misfortune, and that is the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability</hi> of ſome men to beare <hi>Evil.</hi> Hee
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103173:65"/>
mourns not becauſe they are <hi>Patients,</hi> but for their <hi>impatience.</hi> The true or reall <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> which he knowes to be in them, is their ignorance of falſe or reputed <hi>Evills.</hi> That which cauſeth him to weep, is their cauſeleſſe weeping. He that diſguiſeth his conſtancie thus, diſſembles not. I make not a wiſe man to be impaſſible, but enduring and compaſſionate, yea the <hi>Patient</hi> of compaſſions: Though I exempt him from the <hi>crowd</hi> and <hi>populacie</hi>; I place him not above <hi>Humanity</hi>: Though he is no <hi>peere</hi> of the <hi>Multitude,</hi> yet he <hi>deſcends</hi> to pitty them: But we doe not therefore diſturb his peace and ſerenity, becauſe he is mercifull and condoling; but becauſe it is his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, his deſire. He is not ſtormy, nor treacherous, nor baſe, but courteous, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and happy; he is in all eſtates maſter of himſelf; he is kept freſh and pleaſant by the ſecret Joyes and vivifications of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offended Conſcience.

nor that Chriſtian peace, which is the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit of faith and hope. The great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God hath ſo provided, that <hi>Evill</hi> when it ſets upon us, is but an apparition; there comes good preſently after it. To live well, we have in our ſelves more then enough: we need not any extraneous help; our very deſiring of it, makes us miſerable. So excellently beſt is our condition, that the bleſſed life is ours <hi>gratis,</hi> but miſery we muſt hunt after. The happy life needes neither riches nor wiſhes; Miſery cannot be had without <hi>deſiring,</hi> and it is never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without Covetouſneſſe, which is the price paid for it. Wee ſuffice of our ſelves for a happy life; why not for meere life, which is ſomething leſſe? ſhall we think our ſelves poor, becauſe we abound with the means of happineſſe?

Who would not be aſtoniſhed at that furious Army of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which fought againſt holy <hi>Job</hi>?

But this frighted him not: Hee was ſo farre from thinking it an <hi>Evil,</hi> that he played with the worms, and made that, which his friends eſteemed for vengeance and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, to be his meditation and mirth: Hee was ſure that he was innocent, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his integrity, he could not miſſe of joy.

Youthfulneſſe, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and joy were alwaies in his preſence, nothing elſe was to be ſeen, nothing elſe was diſcourſed of in his company.

ſuit of the Son croſt the intentions of the Father, who was forced to give over his device to keep him from ſadneſſe, leſt by continuing it, he ſhould make him ſad.

And that his life might have the leaſt ſhare here, where Fortune hath the greateſt, he rejected the hopes and blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life, yea that which is to many the price of two lives, his Kingdom, and royal Dignity: He laboured with all diligence to

live ſo in the world as if he had been dead, that by avoyding ſin, the cauſe of ſorrow, he might be, though not ſafe, at leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. If this ſingle accident made him ſo much offended with life, what (think you) would he have done, had his liberty been univerſal, and unbounded? What if he had ſeen the inſide of thoſe ſtately Tombes wee build for the worms to eat us in, where they feed upon ſuch fat oppreſſors as have been fed here with the tears and pillage of the oppreſſed? What if he had narrowly ſearched every corner of the world, and ſeen thoſe neceſſary uncleanneſſes in which the birth of man is celebrated, in which this miſerie is inaugurated, by the paines of the Mother, and the cries of the Infant? What if he had entred into their bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambers and boſomes, where ſome ſit weeping, others wiſhing; ſome ſurfeited and ſick with fruition? where ſome mourn for their wives, others for their children; ſome pine and ſtarve with want, others are full and vomit; ſome are troubled with lack of neceſſaries, and others are as much vexed with abundance and ſuperfluity? What if after all this ſearch, and wide diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition he could not have found one houſe without ſome misfortune, and none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tears? What if he had been admitted
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103173:75"/>
into the breaſts of all thoſe, whom either domeſtick, hidden griefs, lingring diſeaſes, worldly cares, or an inſatiable covetouſneſs is ever tormenting? Perhaps thei ſight of ſo many evils had driven him to a refuſall of life, in which we doe ſo dye with miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and by which miſeries doe ſo live in us; at leaſt he had earneſtly wiſhed and groaned for ſome means of redemption from ſo miſerable a bondage. If any had brought him the joyful news of liberty, and affirmed that ſome were already made free, he had certainly envyed them very much, and would have been impatient to know the means. But when it had been told him that the device and releaſe was death, I do not onely think, but I verily beleeve that he had both approved of it, and would have ſought for it more then for hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

Death only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us from troubles: Death heals, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies all thoſe wounds which are received in a good cauſe. When <hi>Socrates</hi> had drank off his <hi>potion</hi> of <hi>hemlock,</hi> he commanded that ſacrifices ſhould be offered to <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> as the <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Medicine.</hi> He knew that Death would cure him.

                  <p>Moſt ridiculous were the tears of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and worthily checkt by his Captain <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus</hi>; when ſeated on the top of an hill, and viewing his great Army (wherein were ſo many hands as would have ſerved to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn the world, to levell mountains, and drain the ſeas, yea to violate Nature, and diſturb Heaven with their noyſe, and the ſmoak of their Camp) he fell to a childiſh whining, to conſider in what a ſhort portion of time all that haughty multitude, which now trampled upon the face of the earth,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103173:77"/>
would be layd quietly under it. He wept to think, that all thoſe men (whoſe lives not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee haſtned to ſacrifice to his mad ambition) ſhould dye within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of an hundred yeares. The ſecular death, or common way of mortality, ſeemed very ſwift unto him, but the way of war &amp; ſlaughter he minded not. It had been more rational in him to weep, becauſe death was ſo ſlow and lazie, as to ſuffer ſo many impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, inhumane ſouldiers to live an hundred years, and diſturb the peace and civill ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mankind. If as hee ſaw his Army from that hill, he had alſo ſeen the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and miſchief they did, with the tears and ſorrows of thoſe that ſuffered by them, he had dried his eyes, and would not have mourned, though he had ſeen death ſeiſing upon all thoſe ſalvages, and eaſing the world of ſo vaſt an affliction. He would not have feared that, which takes away the cauſe of fear: That is not evill, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves ſuch violent and enormous evills. If I might ask thoſe that have made experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life and death, whither they would chuſe (if it were granted them) either to live again, or to continue in their ſtate of diſſolution, I am ſure none would chuſe life but the wicked, &amp; thoſe that are unworthy of it; for no pious liver did ever repent of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103173:77"/>
death, and none ever will. The Juſt deſire not this life of the unjuſt, which (were it offered them,) they would fear it more, (now being at reſt,) then ever they feared death, when they lived.

                  <p>I do verily believe, that to him that throughly conſiders it, no part of life can be deſireable. It is altogether ſo full of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes; It is a peece weaved of calamities and troubles, yea, life it ſelfe is its owne vexation. As thoſe that travell in rough, uneven and mountainous roades are alwaies gaſping and weary, which makes them ſit

down often, to recover their ſpent breath, and refreſh themſelves, that having reach'd the brow and crown of the hill, they may walk onwards with more delight, and be at leaſure to feed their Eyes with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous proſpect, and freſhneſſe of thoſe green &amp; flowry plaines which lye extended before them: So this troubleſome and tumultuous life hath need of death, for its eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, as a ſtate in which it doth repaire and ſtrengthen it ſelfe againſt the fair Journey and progreſſe of eternity. Frail and weary life cannot laſt, and hold out untill the <hi>Indiction</hi> of immortality; So long a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney cannot be performed without ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; A reſting place muſt be had: Death is the <hi>Inne</hi> where we take up, that we may with more chearfullneſſe ſet forwards, and be enabled to overtake, and to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with eternity. Nay, ſo fraile is life, that it cannot expect, or ſtay for the day of death without ſome prevening recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: It travells by Stages, and Periodical Courſes, where it breathes, and gathers ſtrength againſt the next motion. As tyred travellours make frequent Pauſes in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Roade, and cannot ſtay for the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lodging; So life, by reaſon of the importunity, and the multitude of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane troubles, cannot endure or hold out

till it reacheth the <hi>Inne,</hi> which is death; but is driven to reſt in the ſhade upon the way-ſide; for ſleep (the ſhadow of death) is nothing elſe but a reparation of weary and fainting life. So much more excellent then life is death, that life is driven to be ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſo many deaths, that is to ſay, the mortal life is neceſſarily preſerved by ſleep, which is the uſher &amp; <hi>Maſquerade</hi> of death. Reedes, becauſe they are very weak and brittle, are ſtrengthned with diſtinct knots or joynts, which makes their length firme, and keepes them from cleaving: So life, if it were not refreſhed and mantained ſtill by ſucceſſive, ſet allevations of certain proluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of death, would fall aſunder and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh upon its firſt appearance.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have diſcourſed of life, let us now conſider death, and compare it with life. If death in its ſhadow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection be the recreation of life, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull will it be at home, or in it ſelf!

It is madneſſe to judge our ſelves miſerable, becauſe others think ſo. The ſolemnities of death are contrary to the ceremonies of life. At the birth of man others laugh, but he himſelf weeps.

Weeping comes with the Infant into the world; Laughing is afterwards taught him; the Nurſe muſt both teach, and invite him to it. When he ſleeps, then he ſips and taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth joy; when he dies, then he ſucks and drinkes it.

As for the unjuſt, it is moſt certain, that no day can be more beneficiall to them, then that which ſets an end to their impieties, tyranny, perjury, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. To deny a ſword to one that would

Wee are born on condition, that wee muſt dye.

What is the reaſon (thinkeſt thou,) that the Divine <hi>Secrets</hi> are revealed to men moſt commonly in their ſleep; becauſe that ſimilitude of death is
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103173:88"/>
moſt pleaſing to God. Life is a wild and various madneſſe, diſturbed with paſſions, and diſtracted with objects; Sleepe (like death) ſettles them all; it is the minds <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in which the Spirit, freed from the Senſes, is well diſpoſed and fitted for Divine intimations. The Soul is then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to it ſelfe, while the body reigns not, and the affections are ecclipſed in that ſhort <hi>Interlunium</hi> of the temporall life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> or humane Knowledge is nothing elſe but a Contemplation of death; not to aſtoniſh or diſcourage men, but firſt to informe, and then to reform them: for the fruit of Philoſophy is Virtue, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is nothing elſe but an imitation of death, or the Art of dying well, by begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to dye while we are alive. Virtue is a certain <hi>Primroſe,</hi> a <hi>proluſion</hi> or <hi>Aſſay</hi> of dying. Therefore that by which man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes immortall and eternall is the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> and the <hi>Inch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ation</hi> of death. This is the main drift of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> to make life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable by conforming it unto death, and to make death immortality by regulating life. Death is intollerable to him only that hath not mortified his deſires, while he yet lives; but expects to ſwallow up death, and all the powers of it at once; that is to ſay, in the hour of death. We cut our meate,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103173:88"/>
and feed on it by bits, leſt we ſhould be choaked by ſwallowing it whole; ſo death, if it be aſſayed and practiſed by degrees, will be both pleaſant in the taſt, and wholſome in the digeſtion; if we mortifie one affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to day, and another to morrow. Hee that cannot carry a great burthen at once, may carry it all by portions. <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> acts the part of death upon the Stage of life: it kills ſenſuality, and makes death moſt eaſie to be born by teaching us to dye dayly. What can be more grievous then death unto him, who together with his own, feeles the paine of a thouſand other dying cupidities? We faile not to bewaile the loſſe of one thing, whither honour, pleaſure, or a friend: How much more when we looſe all at a blow, and looſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life in one ſhort minute? The Soule of the wiſe man frees her ſelfe from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in an acceptable time, ſhe caſts off the delectations of the fleſh, and the cares of this World while it is day-light, that ſhee may enjoy her ſelf, and be acquainted with God before the night comes. She finds by experience, that her forces are more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and her light more diſcerning, when ſhe is not ſullied with Earthly negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the groſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103173:89"/>
permit her not to ſee the truth, and that the affaires of the body are the <hi>Remora's</hi> of the Spirit: and therefore ſhe concludes, that he muſt neglect the cryes of the fleſh, and be attentive onely to the voyce of God; and upon theſe conſiderations, ſhee ſhakes off that Bondage; ſhe deſerts the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity and conſultations of blood, that ſhe may adviſe with, and diſcerne the moſt clear light of truth; ſhe caſts off pleaſures, by which even Spirits are made ſubject to ſenſe and pollution. The truth is moſt pure, and will not be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, but to the pure and the undefiled: Therefore all the ſcope and the end of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is, to ſeparate the Soul from the body, and to come as near death as poſſibly may be, while wee are yet alive. This is the cauſe that wiſe men do ſo much love and long for death, at leaſt they fear it not. How can he feare death, who by dying paſſeth into the life of the bleſſed? Who hath already delivered himſelfe from more feares and inconveniences then death can free him from? Yea from thoſe dangers which make death fearfull? Who before his dying day, hath diſarmed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death? Shall he that all his life-time deſired to be ſeparated from the body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at the performance and fullfilling of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103173:89"/>
it? It were moſt ridiculous, if haſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards home, thou wouldſt refuſe the helpe of another to convey thee thither with more ſpeed, and be angry at thy arrival in that Port, whither thou didſt bend thy courſe ſince the firſt day thou didſt ſet forth. There is no man that ſeeking for a friend, will not rejoyce when he hath found him. No man will be angry if another perfects what he did begin, but was not able to finiſh. Nature by death perfects that which Virtue had begun in life, and the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour dies not, but is continued, and thrives by a neceſſary tranſplantation. While he yet lived, he denyed himſelfe the uſe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe it hindr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This <hi>Correlation</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> I ſhall exhibite, or lay out to your view, by a diſcuſſion of thoſe honours which each of them procures. As Virtue by the Conſideration of death, ordereth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves her Majeſty; ſo by imitating death, ſhe obtaines the reverence and admiration of all: What more reverend thing can wee labour for, then that, which by our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of it, makes the worſt livers to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103173:90"/>
not bad? As thoſe who are Evill, are loath to believe themſelves to be ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of an innate reverence due from every man to Virtue, which makes them love the repute of Excellencie, though not inherent, and rejoyce to be accounted good of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or in their own eſteem, though they be evill, taking pleaſure in that ſelf-decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So thoſe who have beene vitious in their lives (out of the reverence wee owe to death,) wee dare not ſpeak evill of when they are once dead; Nay, it is not civil, nor pious, to mention the dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commendation, either by <hi>praiſe,</hi> or elſe by <hi>prayer,</hi> &amp; our <hi>Chriſtian well wiſhes,</hi> as if they had been moſt deſerving in their lives.

                  <p>Envy purſues us not beyond the grave, and our honour is not free and ſecure til we are layd in it. That humble and quiet <hi>duſt</hi>

ſtops the lying and malicious mouth. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> foreſaw that his <hi>draught</hi> of <hi>hemlock</hi> would (after his death) make his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies his worſhippers: He ſaw his <hi>Statues</hi> erected by the ſame <hi>decree</hi> that did caſt him downe: And what was the <hi>motive</hi> (thinkſt thou) that made his enemies wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him dead, whom they perſecuted li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving? There is amongſt the people a ſecret tradition that whiſpers to them, that <hi>thoſe who are freed from the miſeries of this life, live happily in another world.</hi> Now happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe even in their opinion is worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; therefore the honour or veneration which death exacts, is a certain tribute, or a debt rather that is due to happineſſe; and if for this thou wilt adviſe with thy <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he will not deny it. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> beſtowed the <hi>Olympick</hi> palms and honours (which whoſoever won in his life time, he was accounted moſt happy) upon all that dyed, without exception, or extenuation; adorning the <hi>ſtatutes</hi> of ſome, and the <hi>tombes</hi> of all with the green and flouriſhing <hi>Laurel,</hi> eſteeming every one of the dead as happy as the moſt fortunate Victor that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

Nor is this glory of death a <hi>Relative</hi> of the Soul only; Looke well upon the body, that proviſion of the worms, a frail and periſhing objects, but ful of Majeſty.

With how much awfulneſſe doth it lye along! with what a ſecret myſterious command doth it check all about it!

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103173:92"/>
did put them in minde of the fraile eſtate of their bodies, and did in prayer-time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate and humble their thoughts; That a conſtant commemoration of death was as beneficial to the Soul as devotion, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they carryed them alwaies about them as the powefull <hi>Momento's</hi> of their approaching departure out of the Land of the living. To this he added, that their drinking in a skull did mortifie their affections, repreſſe pleaſures, and imbitter their taſt, leſt they ſhould reliſh too much the delights of life; Laſtly, he added that this conſtant repreſentation of death, was an Antidote againſt all the ſinfull Exceſſes and deviations of man. With the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine they ſecured themſelves from other iniquities: When they were to ſwear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any thing, they laid their hands upon certain <hi>Images</hi> ſet with the bones of dead men, by which ceremony they were put in mind of the laſt Judgement, and the Account which the <hi>dead</hi> and the <hi>Quick</hi> muſt give in that great, that impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and cenſorious day. Certainly this was no barbarous, but a very humane and elegant <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which taught men to ſeaſon, and redeeme all the daies of their lives, with the memory of the one day of their death. Admirable was the memory

Nature doth every minute commend unto us this memoriall of death. <hi>Hermes</hi> in his <hi>ſacred book</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that reſpiration was given to man, as a ſign of that laſt efflation, in which the Soul parts from the body. Wee ſhould therefore as often as wee breath, remember death, when we ſhall breath our laſt, when the Spirit ſhall returne unto him that gave it. Our whole life is nothing elſe but a repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reſemblance of our laſt expiration; by the emiſſion of our breath we doe retaine
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103173:93"/>
it, and (as I may ſay) ſpin it out. God gave it not <hi>continual</hi> and <hi>even,</hi> like fluent <hi>ſtreames,</hi> or the calme and unwearied <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations</hi> of light, but refracted and ſhifting, to ſhew us that we are not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent but tranſitory, and that the Spirit of life is but a <hi>Celeſtial Gale</hi> lent us for a time, that by uſing it well, we may ſecure it Eternally. Another <hi>Hermetiſt</hi> adviſeth us, <hi>Adorare relliquias ventorum,</hi> to make much of, and to honour our Soules, which are the <hi>breathings,</hi> and laſt <hi>diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the ſtill fruitful, and liberal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: This we can never do but by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſtudy of our diſſolution, and the frailty of the body. Of ſuch an effectuall goodneſſ is death, that it makes men good before it comes, and makes ſure of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by a virtuous diſpoſing of time. Thinke not that evill, which ſends from ſo far the beams of its goodneſſe. There is no good liver but is a debtor to death, by whoſe lendings, and premunitions we are furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fitted for another world.</p>
                  <p>The certainty of it, and the incertainty of the time and manner, (which is the onely circumſtance that ſeemes to offend us,) if it were ſeriouſly conſidered, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be the moſt pleaſing &amp; acceptable; for amongſt all the wondrous Ordinances
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103173:93"/>
of Divine providence, there is none more Excellent for the Government of man then death, being ſo wiſely diſpoſed of, that in the height of incertainty it comprehends and manifeſts an infallible certainty. God would have us to be alwaies good, to keepe in his likeneſſe and Image: Therfore it is his will, that we ſhould be alwaies uncertaine of our moſt certain death. Such is his care of us, leſt the knowledge of a long life, and a late death ſhould encourage us to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our tranſgreſſions, as the notice of a ſwift diſſolution might diſhearten and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us. But being left now in a poſſibility of either, we are taught to live ſoberly, and to expect the time of our change in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe and watchfullneſſe. The poſſibility of dying ſhortly, doth leſſen the cares of life, and makes the difficulties of Virtue eaſie. Bondage and Slavery (if it be but ſhort,) is to thoſe that ſuffer it the lighter by ſo much: And a large allowance of time makes us ſlow to Virtue, but a ſhort portion quickens us, and the incertainty of that very ſhortneſſe makes us certaine to be good. For who would weep, and vexe himſelf for worldly proviſions, if he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew that he ſhould live but one month? and how dares he laugh, or be negligent of his Salvation, that knowes
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103173:94"/>
not whither hee ſhall live to ſee one day more, yea, one hour? The incertainty of death makes us ſuſpect life, and that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition keepes us from ſinning. The world was never fouler, nor more filled with abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, then when life was longeſt, when abuſed Nature required an Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by waters, and the generall ſubmerſion of her deteſtable defilers. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> did unjuſtly to raile at Nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne her of partiality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he envyed the long life of ſome <hi>plants</hi> and inferiour <hi>creatures,</hi> as the <hi>Oake,</hi> the <hi>Hart,</hi> the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi>; ſome of which live to <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>flye</hi> up and down in the World above <hi>five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> years. He quarrelled with the wiſe diſpenſations of Divinity, becauſe a ſlight <hi>ſuite</hi> of feathers, and a renew'd <hi>dreſſe</hi> of greene leaves could weare out a building that lodged a rationall Soul, and the breath of the Almighty. Both his <hi>wiſh</hi> and his <hi>reaſon</hi> were erroneous: He erred in deſiring long life, and in judging happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to conſiſt in the multitude of yeares, and not the number of good workes. The ſhortneſſe of life is lengthned by living well: When life was reckond by centuries, the innumerable ſins of the living ſo offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God, that it repented him to have made impenitent man: Thoſe that ſinned
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103173:94"/>
out of confidence of life he puniſhed with ſudden deſtruction. That long liv'd gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had made the world unclean, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing polluted by their lives, it was purged by their deaths. He ſhorten'd afterwards the leaſe of life, reducing it to an hundred and twenty years, that by the diligence of frequent death, he might reform the paſt diſorders of long life, and prevent them for the future, teaching both ſexes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their lives by giving them death for their next neighbours. So beneficiall is death, ſo much profits the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, and as much the incertainty: The ignorance of the day of death is in effect the ſame with the knowledge of it; the firſt makes us watch, leſt it come upon us unawares; and the laſt (though it might name the day to us) yet could it not arme us better againſt it, perhaps not ſo well. This incertainty of dying, certainly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us from many errors; it makes us prudent, provident, and not evill. Death therefore is a device of the Almighty, and a wiſe inſtrument of divine policy. <hi>Zaleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> ſo highly approved of it, that he was about to enact and proclaime a Law for dying, had he not found it already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the edict of Nature: And in his Preface to thoſe Laws made for the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crenſes,</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:103173:95"/>
he warns them, <gap reason="foreign">

To have alwayes before their eyes that time, which is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one the end of life, becauſe a hearty repentance for all former injuries ſeiſeth upon all men that thinke of death, and an earneſt deſire or wiſhing, that all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in life had been juſt. Wherefore it is expedient that in all our dealings and thoughts death ſhould act a part, and be our familiar counſellor, ever preſent with us; ſo ſhall we be carefull to doe all things vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly and juſtly. Death then is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to govern mankinde, becauſe the memory of it keeps us in awe, and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to virtue. All Commonwealths that follow the method of Nature, muſt approve of this Law of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> and death in all their conſultations ſhould guide their lives.</p>
                  <p>Certainly in the Government of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Generation of Man, Death hath been the moſt awfull Engine of the Deity; without this ſtern he guided them not: When man was immortall, God ſaw it neceſſary to preſerve his immortality by death; he injoyned the Law of Abſtinence to <hi>Adam,</hi> under the penalty of dying, which is continued ſtill by the ſame artifice of death, leſt iniquities ſhould be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103173:95"/>
&amp; wickedneſs ſhould eſcape puniſhment: by the patience and ſubmiſſion of his only Son to death he reſtored dead men to life, he conferred upon him all his loſt honours, renewd and confirmed his old prerogative, and together with the ſalvation of his Soule gave him a ſure promiſe, that his body all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhould be made Immortal; but in all theſe favours, and after full reconciliation, he would not remove death, but continued it ſtill, and the incertainty as well as the certainty of it. This divine deviſe of death ſo pleaſed God, and was ſo neceſſary for the good of man, that though by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his dying Son he changed all the former things, blotting out ordinances, aboliſhing Ceremonies, &amp; opening the gates of Heaven to all believers, yet would not he Exterminate death. It was out of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that he refuſed to abrogate it, that while corruption reigned, death alſo might reign over it, leſt this poyſon ſhould want its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote. We have therefore no juſt cauſe to complain of death, which is an Invention conducing to our great good, and the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the time (though it moſt vexeth us) is notwithſtanding the moſt beneficial Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that attends it. The time of life is certainly known, &amp; there is but one entrance
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103173:96"/>
to the light of this World: The Ceremony of dying is not formal; It keeps not to one time, nor one manner, but admits of all times, and many manners. Life comes into the World but one way, but hath many waies to go out. It was the benevolence of God to open ſo many doors to thoſe that flye for refuge. One way is more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to find out dangers, but to eſcape them, many are but neceſſary. Death is not a burthen of ſeaven or nine monthes, but life muſt have time before it ſets forth. And what are the firſt encounters of it? Tears <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It cannot avoyd Evills, and it is afea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bear them; therefore it delaies time, and when it cannot lurk any longer, it comes forth Crying. Death leads us forth to joy and liberty: Therefore it ſtayes not, it ſeeks no corners nor protractions. Nor doth death free us onely from ſuffering Evills, but keeps us alſo from doing any: To be good every day, thou m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:103173:96"/>The Glory of death, is alſo much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by its facility, in redreſſing the difficulties of life. It is not without the Divine counſel, and a ſpeciall priviledge that the Soule of man is ſo eaſily parted from the body; the life of beaſts is more tenacious, and will ſuffer much indignitie and fury before it leaves them.

This laſt is both a merry, and a frequent deſtroyer, and freed <hi>Sicily</hi> from one Tyrant. Death alſo makes uſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of our very virtues to exanimate us: Shame killed <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and the Mother of <hi>Secundus</hi> the Philoſopher dyed with bluſhing, and an exceſſive modeſtie. Life is a fraile poſſeſſion, it is a flower that requires not rude and high winds, but will fall in the very whiſpers and blandiſhments of fair weather. It is folly to labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which wil away; to fly from that which will meet us every where, yea, in the way we fly, is a vain and fooliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. Whither we ſeek death or avoyd it, it will find us out: Our way to fly, and our very flight end both in death; by haſting from it, we make haſt to it. Life is a journey, whoſe end cannot be miſt; it is a ſteady ayming at diſſolution: Though we fetch wide Compaſſes, and traverſe our way never ſo often, we can neither length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it, nor be out of it: What path ſoever we take, it is the Port-roade to death. Though youth and age are two diſtant <hi>Tropicks</hi> of life, yet death is as near to the one, as to the other: And though ſome live more,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103173:97"/>
and ſome leſſe, yet death is their equal neighbour, and will viſit the young as ſoon as the old. Death is a Croſſe, to which many waies leade, ſome direct, and others winding, but all meet in one Center: It matters not which thou takeſt, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art young or aged: But if thou beeſt young, thou maiſt come ſooner thither, then the old, who is both doting and weary. It was neceſſary that a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary being provided for the diſtreſſed, the way to it ſhould be eaſie, pervious, and at an indifferent diſtance from all parts. Good ſhould be diffuſive, and the gate that leads to it, muſt be without doors and bolts. The entrance into this life, is narrow and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, it is difficultly attained, difficultly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and lyes alwaies in the power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Every man may take life from us, none can take death. Life is ſubject to the Tyranny of men, but death is not; life makes Tyrants, and death unmakes them. Death is the ſlaves prerogative <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and the Sabbath of the afflicted. <hi>Leo Iconomachus</hi> the Emperor, made the birth of both ſexes tributary: but death never paid taxation. It was not lawfull in his reigne to get Children without paying for them; every Infant ſo ſoon as borne, was to give
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103173:98"/>
him contribution, they paid then the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of life. Death onely frees us from theſe Impoſitions of Tyrants.</p>
                  <p>And wilt thou then condemn liberty, and that maturity of death by which it ripens every age? wilt thou the divine liberality blame, becauſe thy life is ſhort, or may be ſo? thou haſt no reaſon to find fault with the years already given thee, becauſe thou ſhalt not have more: thou mayſt as well quarrel with Nature, becauſe ſhe made not thy dimenſions larger, and thy body heavier by eighty or a hundred pounds: he that meaſured thy proportion, meaſured thy time too: and too much of this laſt would have been as troubleſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy as too much of the firſt: for

                  </p>
                  <p>Death in every age is ſeaſonable, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and deſirable: It frees the old man from miſery, the youthfull from ſin, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant from both. It takes the aged in the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their time; It turnes the flowers of youth into fruit; and by a compendious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret improvement, matures infancy, leading it into the Gate of Heaven, when it cannot go one ſtep upon Earth, and giving it the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103173:98"/>
wings of a Dove to flye, and be at reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can uſe its feet.</p>
                  <p>To theſe paſt arguments of the goodneſſe of death, I ſhall adde another. Death in the old world, (before the manifeſtation of God in the fleſh,) was the publick index, or open ſigne of hidden divinity. It is the gift of God, who gives nothing but what is good. The Divell playing the Ape, and labouring to imitate the Inimitable <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> did by aſſerting death to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, mainly fortifie thoſe abominable rites and honours conferred upon him by his blind worſhipers: When they petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned him for the greateſt bleſſing that the Gods could give to man, he (by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the true God whom they had deſerted) would within three daies ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them in their beds, or uſe ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible meanes to ſet an end to their daies. Thus he ſerved <hi>Triphonius, Agamedes,</hi> and <hi>Argia</hi> for her three Sons: This miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mother requeſted of him, that hee would give the beſt thing to her children, that could be given to men: her petition was granted, and within a very ſhort time they received that which ſhe thought to be the worſt, namely death. So great is the ods betwixt ſeeming to be, and being really:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103173:99"/>
betwixt opinion and truth: yea that death which we judge to be the worſt, I meane the immature, is oftentimes the beſt.

the mouths of all good men, and as deare in their hearts. But what was the reward (thinkeſt thou) of his virtuous life? An immature and almoſt a ſudden death; So that it is not to be doubted, but it was a divine favour. Being to go into bed, he ſpoke to his ſiſter, O what manner of night will this be unto me! I beſeech you, deare ſiſter, furniſh me with ſome candles, and leave one to burn by me. Abought mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night he ſuddenly called, ſo that all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie was awaked, and got up; to whom he told that he ſhould dye that night; and deſired them to ſend preſently for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour. They all imagined that he had been troubled with ſome dream, eſpecially his Father, a moſt renowned Phyſitian, when he felt his pulſe to beate well and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly. But notwithſtanding all this, they omitted not to ſend for his Confeſſour, who was <hi>Gaſper Pedroza</hi>: He (as if touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome Divine preſenſion) was at that dead time of the night awake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the ſorrowfull Father, he told him, that <hi>Didacus</hi> was expected in another World before day, that the Virgin-Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He left this dark and low World towards the firſt breakings of the day, and aſcending to eternity upon the wings of the morning. He might have paſt from thence with leſſer noiſe, and in a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time; but he expired more ſolemnly then ſo; and yet without weary acceſſions, and the Tyranny of ſickneſſe: He ſtayed for the ſaving inſtitutions of his redeemer, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that detain'd him ſo long, was Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not the tumults of a tyring and obſtinate diſſolution; all this proves it to have been the hand of God, and not an unfortunate, ſudden death; the preciſe Actions of the deity muſt be attended with unuſuall circumſtances.

                  <p>Some men find fault with death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no experiment can be made of it, without an abſolute diſſolution: they would dye twice, to trye what kind of ſtate it is, that they may be fitly furniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond time, when they muſt dye in earneſt. But this is madneſs, and were it granted them, the good they pretend would not be performed. For he that will caſt away one life without preparing for death, wil not fear to hazard another; deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate malefactors will take no warning by r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>prieves. Beſides, what benefit would there be by dying twice, ſeeing that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they muſt live twice too, and ſo be twice miſerable, if not twice impious? It is ſtrange, that theſe men who fear death, and adjudge it to be evill, ſhould deſire to have it doubled, and that which, by their good will, they would not taſt once, they will beg to chew and ſwallow downe twice; whereas if death were an Evill, it would be ſo much the leſſer by comming but once. The miſeries of life are nothing ſo civill; they are inſtant, importunate, and outragious; they will reinforce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſet upon us twice or thrice,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103173:101"/>
yea, a thouſand times. Death is more modeſt, ſhe wearies us not as long as wee are well: When our diſorders have turned the harmony of life into diſcord and noiſe, then ſhee comes to caſt thoſe murmurers aſleep, and to give the Soul peace: He is no troubleſome gueſt that comes but once. But it were a great happineſſe, thou wilt ſay, if men did experimentally know what it is to dye: Truely this Felicity is not wanting: Death is a moſt admirable, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Excogitation: Though we dye but once, yet do not we dye at once: We may make, yea we do make many aſſaies or tryals of dying: Death inſinuates it ſelfe, and ſeizeth upon us by peecemeals; it gives us a taſt of it ſelf: It is the Cronie, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of life: So ſoon as we begin to be, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e begin to waſt and vaniſh; we cannot aſcend to life, without deſcending towards death: Nay we begin to dye before we appeare to live; the perfect ſhape of the Infant is the death of the <hi>Embryo,</hi> childhood is the death of Infancie, youth of Childhood, Manhood of youth, and old age of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. When we are arrived at this laſt ſtage, if we ſtay any long time in it, and pay not the debt we owe, death requires intereſt; ſhe takes his hearing from one,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103173:101"/>
his ſight from another, and from ſome ſhe takes both: The extent and end of all things touch their beginning, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the laſt minute of life do any thing elſe, but finiſh what the firſt began. We may know alſo what death is, by the apparition or Image of it. We ſee it, and make tryal of it aſſiduouſly: we cannot act life one day, but wee muſt act death at night: Life is a Terrace-walke with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at one end, where we repoſe, and dream over our paſt perambulations. This leſſer reſt, ſhewes us the greater; the Soule watcheth when wee ſleepe, and Conſcience in the Juſt as well as the unjuſt will be ruminating on the works of life, when the body is turned into duſt. Sleepe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but death painted in a night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece; it is a prelibation of that deepe ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, out of which we ſhall not be awaked untill the Heavens be no more: We go to bed under a Scene of Stars and darkneſſe, but when we awake, we find Heaven chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and one great luminary giving light to all: We dye in the ſtate of corruption, errours, and miſtineſſe: But wee ſhall be raiſed in glory, and perfection, when theſe clouds of blackneſſe that are carried about with diverſe winds, and every Enemy of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103173:102"/>
truth ſhall vaniſh for ever, and God alone ſhall be all in all. We affect ſleepe naturally, it is the reparation of man, &amp; a laying by of cares. The Coppy cannot match the pattern: if we love ſleep then, why ſhould wee hate the Idaea of it; why ſhould we feare death, whoſe ſhadow refreſheth us, which nature never made, nor meant to fright us with? It was her intention to ſtrengthen our hope of dying, by giving us the fruition of this reſemblance of death; leſt we ſhould grow impatient with delay, ſhe favour'd us with this ſhadow and Image of it, as Ladies comfort themſelves with the pictures of their abſent lovers. There is no part of life without ſome portion of death, as dreames can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not happen without ſleepe, ſo life cannot be without death. As ſleepe is ſaid to be the ſhadow of death; So I think dreams to be the ſhadowes of life, for nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us more frequent then it: When we ſhal be raiſed from death, we ſhal not grieve ſo much becauſe the joys of life were not real, as becauſe there were none at all. It was ſaid by one, that he had rather dream of being tormented in Hell, then glorified in <hi>Paradiſe</hi>: for being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, he ſhould rejoyce to find himſelfe in a ſoft featherbed, and not in a lake of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103173:102"/>
unquenchable fire: But having dreamt of Heaven, it would grieve him that it was not reall. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> writes, that the watching of the body is the ſleep of the Soul, and that the day was made for Corporeall Actions, but the night is the working-time of Spirits. Contrary natures run con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſes: Bodies having no inherent light of their own, make uſe of this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward light, but Spirits need it not. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams cannot ſtumble, nor go out of their way. Death frees them from this dark Lantern of fleſh. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> uſed to ſay, that men were both dead and alive, both when they dyed, and when they lived: when they lived their Soules were dead, and when they dyed, their Soules revived. Life then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the death of the Soule, and the life of the body: But death is the life of the Soule, and the death of the body.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall return now to proſecute the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of death, becauſe it comes but once. Death (like the Phoenix) is onely one, leſt any ſhould be ill. That which comes but once, is with moſt longing look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and with moſt welcome entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That poor man, the owner of one Ewe, nouriſhed her in his boſome, ſhe did eate of his meat, and drank out of his Cup,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103173:103"/>
as <hi>Nathan</hi> exemplified. The Father that hath but one Son, hath more cares, then he that hath many; ſo ſhould we be more carefull to provide for death which comes but once, then for the numerous and daily calamities of life: By providing for that one, wee turne the reſt all into ſo many joyes. Whatſoever is rare, whatſoever is pretious, it is ſingle, and but one. There is nothing ſo rare, nothing that is compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a good death. But it is not the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality or diffuſiveneſſe of it that makes it ſo, but the contempt and the ſubduing of it; h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s death is moſt pretious, by whom death is contemned. Diſſolution is not a meere merit, but a debt we owe to nature, which the moſt unwilling muſt pay. That wiſedome which can make deſtiny to be her ſervant, which can turne neceſſity into virtue, Mortality into Immortality, and the debt we owe to nature into a juſt right and Title to eternall glory, is very great. What greater advantage can there be, then to make Heaven due to us, by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to nature, and to oblige Divinity by paying a temporal debt? <hi>Clemens</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them <hi>Golden men,</hi> who dyed thus; that is to ſay, when it was neceſſary to dye. They made neceſſity their free will,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103173:103"/>
when either the publick liberty, the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of reaſon, or the word of God call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their ſufferings: For though death be a debt due to Nature, yet in theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Nature doth willingly reſigne her right, and God becomes the Creditor. If we pay it unto him before the time of pure reſolution, Nature is better pleaſed with that anticipation, then if we kept our ſet day: He is the beſt debtour, that paies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of payment. The day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Covenant of Nature is old age, but the good man paies before the day. If the nobleneſſe of thy mind will not incite thee to ſuch a forward ſatisfaction; let the deſire of gaine move thee, for the ſooner thou payeſt, the more thou doſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige. Hee that ſuffers an immature death for the good of his Country, for the ſacred lawes, or the vindication of the truth of God, and not for his owne vain glory, doth free himſelfe from the Natural debt, and doth at the ſame time make God his debtour, and all mankind? To a man that dyes thus, all men are indebted: God owes him for the Cauſe, and men for the effect: The laſt doth at leaſt ſet us an example, and the firſt improves the faith, and gives life to Charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:103173:104"/>Adde to this, that this great good of a paſſive death, is a voluntary imitation of the Son of God, who laid down his life for the life of the World: And it is alſo done without our induſtry; this great virtue, this glorious perfection requires not our care and activity to bring it about. This death is moſt pretious and the beſt, becauſe it is executed by others, and not by our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves: To ſuffer death, not to dye, is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. If priſoners break their chaines, it is neither their glory, nor their ſecurity, but augments their Guilt, and haſtens their condemnation: So he that violates his own body, and makes way for the Soul to flye out with his own hands, is damned by the very Act: but if another doth it to him, it is both his Salvation and his Crown. The heathens eſteemed it no honour for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to have their bonds looſed: It was their freedome, but not their glory. When the jugde himſelf did break off their Chaines, that they accounted honorable. By this Ceremony did <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the worth of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi>: This vindicated his integrity: By cutting his bonds with their Imperial hand, they freed him both from captivity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. <hi>Titus</hi> ſaid, that if they would break off
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103173:104"/>
his fetters, and not ſtay to take them off, his honour would be ſo perfectly repaired by it, as if he had been never bound, nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The ſame difference (in point of honour) is betwixt the naturall death and the violent: betwixt dying when wee are full of daies, and the death which Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants impoſe upon us, when we are mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and grinded by their fury. This honour is then greateſt, when the body is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, but diſtorted and broken into pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Certainly the beſt men have ever pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the violence of Tyrants; nature (to preſerve her innocence) being very backward and unwilling (as it were) to take away ſuch great and needfull exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of goodneſſe. Treachery and violence were ordained for the juſt in the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of death was (in him) conſecrated to the beſt men; thoſe perſons whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſpects, and is loath to medle with, envy laies hands upon: Whom the one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to preferre, the other plotteth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. Nor deals ſhe thus with the good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with the eminent and mighty too: thus ſhe ſerved <hi>Hector Alexander</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>: the goodlieſt object is alwaies her aim. When <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> the Aſtrologer told <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:103173:105"/>
the <hi>Roman,</hi> that he ſhould end his daies by a violent death, he anſwered, that he was very glad of it, for then (ſaid he) I ſhall dye like an Emperour, like the beſt and the greateſt of men, and not ſneak out of the World like a worthleſſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure fellow. But the death of theſe <hi>Glorioli</hi> was not truly glorious: I have onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned them, becauſe that a paſſive death (though wanting religion) hath made their honour permanent. That death is the truly glorious, which is ſeald with the joy of the ſufferers ſpirit, whoſe Conſcience is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with the kiſſes of the Dove: Who can look upon his tormentour with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and grow up to Heaven without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, though made ſhorter on Earth by the head.</p>
                  <p>This is the death which growes preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by contempt, and glorious by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: Whoſe ſufferer runs the race ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with patience, and finiſheth it with joy. We are carefull that thoſe things which are our own, may be improved to the utmoſt; and why care wee not for death? what is more ours then mortality? Death ſhould not be feared, becauſe it is ſimply, or of it ſelf, a great good, and is evill to none but to thoſe that by living
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103173:105"/>
ill make their death bad: What ever evil is in death, it is attracted from life. If thou preſerveſt a good Conſcience while thou liveſt, thou wilt have no feare when thou dyeſt, thou wilt rejoyce and walke homeward ſinging. It is life therefore that makes thee fear death: If thou didſt not fear life, if life had not blaſted the joyes of death, thou wouldſt never be afraid of the end of ſorrowes. Death therefore is of it ſelf innocent, ſincere, healthfull, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable. It frees us from the malignancie and malice of life, from the ſad neceſſities and dangerous errours we are ſubject to in the body. That death, whoſe leaders are Integrity and virtue, whoſe cauſe is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is the <hi>Elixir</hi> which gives this life its true tincture, and makes it immortal. To dye is a common and trivial thing, for the good and the bad dye, and the bad moſt of all: but to dye willingly, to dye gloriouſly is the peculiar priviledge of good men. It is better to leave life volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, then to be driven out of it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly: let us willingly give place unto poſterity. Eſteem not life for its own ſake, but for the uſe of it: Love it not, becauſe thou wouldſt live, but becauſe thou mayſt do good works while thou liveſt. Now the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103173:106"/>
greateſt work of life is a good death. If life then ought to be leſſe eſteemed then good works, who would not purchaſe a good death with the loſſe of life? why ſhould we be afeared of politick, irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tyrants, and an arm of fleſh though guarded with ſteele? Nature it ſelfe threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens us with death, and frailty attends us every hour: Why will we refuſe to dye in a good cauſe when 'tis offered us, who may dye ill the very next day after? let us not promiſe our ſelves a ſhort life, when our death aſſures us of eternal glory.</p>
                  <p>But if it were granted that death were neither good nor honourable, but evill and fearfull, why will not we take care for that which we fear? Why do we neglect that which we ſuſpect? Why, if it be evill, do not wee arme and defend our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? we provide againſt dangerous contingencies, we labour againſt caſuall loſſes, and we neglect this great and enevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perill. To neglect death, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn death are two things: none are more carefull of it, then thoſe that contemne it; none feare it more then thoſe that neglect it; and which is ſtrange, they fear it not becauſe they have neglected it, but they neglect it, when they fear it: they dare not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103173:106"/>
prepare for it, for fear of thinking of it. O the madneſſe and Idleneſſe of mankind! to that, which they adjudge to be moſt Evill, they come not onely unprepared, but unadviſedly, and without ſo much as forethought. What mean we, what do we look for? Death is ſtill working, and wee are ſtill idle, it is ſtill travelling towards us, and we are ſtill ſlumbering and folding our hands. Let us awake out of this darke and ſleepy ſtate of mind, let us ſhake off theſe dreams and vain propoſitions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe luſts: let us approve of truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, let us follow after thoſe things which are good; let us have true joy made ſure unto us, and a firm ſecurity in life, in death.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HEY are happily linked in the bond of blood, who are held to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the bond of love. And for this gift (which is deſcended upon us from the Father of lights,) both you and my ſelfe may greatly rejoyce: Whom love as well as kindred hath uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thoſe two faire obligations have betrothed in one entire affection. One of them wee tooke from the Fathers of our fleſh, and the other from our private diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. This double tye by which (love binding us on the one ſide, and blood on the other,) we are mutually knit together; hath inforced me to inlarge my ſelfe in this Epiſtle with ſome exceſſe more then uſuall; that I might commend unto your Conſideration the Cauſe of your owne Soul, and aſſert the work of our profeſſion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103173:110"/>
to be, that Supreme beatitude which is onely true, and capable of thoſe things which are Eternal.</p>
                  <p>And indeed your own pious propenſion is not repugnant to the profeſſion of holy living, who already by a forward felicity of manners have in ſome points prevented, and met with many things which are taught un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o us by ſacred learning: So that by the meanes of provident and diſcreet Nature, you ſeem unto me to have ſeized upon many duties of Religion; as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions and Indulgences of our good God towards you, whoſe gift it is, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſedome ſhould partly find in you, and partly conferre upon you the riches of his Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But although (by the hands of your Father, and Father in law,) you have been allready advanced and ſeated upon the higheſt pinnacles of temporall honours, and are ſtill adorned and ſurrounded with il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious titles deſcending from them both; Yet I deſire, and long to find in you a thirſt of greater and far higher honours, and ſhall now call you not to Earthly, but Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honours, not to the dignities and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of one ſhort age, but to the ſolid and enduring glories of eternity: For the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true and indelible glory is, to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Eternity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:103173:110"/>I ſhall therefore ſpeak unto you, not the wiſedome of this World, but that ſecret and hidden wiſdome which God ordained befor the World unto our glory. I ſhall ſpeake with much care and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and with very little reſpect or animadverſion of my ſelfe; for I have in this attempt conſidered more, what I wiſh to ſee perfected in you, than what I am able to do in my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The firſt duty of Man ordained and brought forth into this World for that end, (my moſt dear <hi>Valerian</hi>!) is to know his Creatour, and being known, to confeſſe him, and to reſigne or give up his life (which is the wonderfull and peculiar gift of God,) to the ſervice and worſhip of the giver; that what he received by Gods free donation, may be imployed in true devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what was conferred upon him in the ſtate of wrath and unworthineſſe, may by an obedient reſignation make him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and beloved. For of this ſaving opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are we; That as it is moſt certain, that we came forth firſt from God, ſo ſhould we believe it, and preſſe on ſtill towards him: Whereupon we ſhall conclude, that he onely, rightly and divinely apprehends the purpoſe of God in making man, who underſtand it thus, <hi>That God himſelf made us for himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103173:111"/>It is then our beſt courſe, to beſtow our greateſt care upon the Soul; So ſhall that which is the firſt and higheſt in dignity, be not the loweſt, and laſt in conſideration. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> let that which is the firſt in order, be the firſt cared for; let Salvation which is the chiefeſt profit be our chiefeſt imployment. Let the ſafeguard and the defenſe of this, take up all our forces; let it be not only our chiefeſt, but our ſole delight. As it ſurpaſſeth all other things in excellencie, ſo let it in our care and conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Our Supreme duty is that which wee owe to God, and the next to it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to the Soul. And yet theſe two are ſuch loving correlates, that though every one of them is a duty of Supreme conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and ſuch as by no means we may preſume to neglect or omit, yet cannot wee poſſibly performe any one of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other. So that whoſoever will ſerve God, doth at the ſame time provide for his own Soul; and he that is carefull for his own Soul, doth at the ſame time ſerve God. So that the ſtate of theſe two ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign duties in man, is by a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious dependencie and co-intention ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred very eaſie, while the faithfull perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the one, is a perfect conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103173:111"/>
of both: For by the unſpeakable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe and mercy of God, the good wee do to our own Soules, is the moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice and ſacrifice that we can offer unto him.</p>
                  <p>Much Phyſicall curioſity, much care and many ſtrict obſervations are beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body; much pain it undergoes in hope of health; and deſerves the Soule no Medicine? If it be but fit and neceſſary, that diverſe helps and means of healing are ſought for the body, for the recovering onely of a temporall and tranſitory health, is it not unjuſt that the Soul ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and be ſuffered to languiſh and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie with deadly and ſpirituall diſeaſes? Shall the Soul onely be a ſtranger to thoſe proper and pretious remedies ordained for it by the great Phyſitian? Yea rather, if ſo many things are provided for the body, let the proviſion for the Soul be far more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant: for if it was truly ſaid by ſome, that this <hi>fleſhly frame is the ſervant, and the Soul the Miſtris,</hi> then will it be very undecent and injurious, if we ſhall preferre and place the ſervant before the Miſtris. It is but a juſt claim, that the better part ſhould require the better attendance; for with conſtant and intentive diligence ſhould wee look on that ſide, where the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103173:112"/>
greater dignity and our moſt pretious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is laid up. It is not agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and it takes from the honour of our imployment, that we ſhould ſubject it to the unworthier party. The fleſh being all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies inclined to vitiouſneſſe, drawes us back to the Earth, as to its proper center and Originall: But the Soul being deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Father of lights, is like the ſparks of fire ſtill flying upwards. The Soule is the Image of God in us, and the pretious pledge of his future muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. Let us imploy all our innate forces, and all outward Auxiliaries for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this: if we manage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and defend it faithfully, wee take care for, and protect the intruſted pledge and purchaſed poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God. What conveniencie can wee have to build, unleſs we do firſt of all lay the foundation? but to him that hath deſign'd a ſuperſtructure of true bleſſings, the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall muſt be Salvation. And if hee hath not laid that foundation, upon what can the Conſequences he hopes for be builded? how ſhall he be filled with the Increaſe of thoſe remunerations and after-bleſſings, that wants the firſt fruits, and denies the rewarder? what portion can he have in the joyes of Eternity, that will be wanting to his own Salvation? How can
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103173:112"/>
he live the life of the bleſſed, that wil not riſe from death? or what will it benefit him to heape up temporal proviſion, and the materials of this World; when he hath ſtored up nothing for the comfort of his Soule? Or as our Lord <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>What is a man profited, if hee gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul</hi>? There can therefore be no cauſe for ſparing and laying up, where it is manifeſt, that the Soul is already loſt; where Salvation is forfeited, what gaine or profit can be hoped for? Or wherein ſhall the true treaſure be laid up, or wherewith ſhall he receive it, when the Soules pretious veſſell, and the ſtorehouſe of Eternal joyes is utterly ruined and broken? let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while we have time, labour for true riches, and make earneſt haſt to that holy and Heavenly commerce, which is worth our looking and longing after.</p>
                  <p>Eternall life may be obtained in a very few daies: Which daies though they ſhould be bleſt with an inoffenſive and untainted holineſſe of life, yet becauſe they are but few, are to be lightly eſteem'd of: for nothing can be rich in value, which is but ſhort in duration: Nor can that procure any long or durable joyes, whoſe time of exiſtence or abode is narrow and tranſient. The ſhort
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103173:113"/>
Accommodations of this life have but ſhort effects. It ſeems therefore but juſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that to the joyes of this preſent life (if it hath any) we ſhould preferre the true and indubitable joyes of that which is everlaſting. For the felicity we enjoy here, is at beſt but temporal, but the other is eternal; and the fruition of a tranſitorie, uncertaine happineſſe is but a frailty and accident; but the poſſeſſion of inviolable and never ending joyes, is triumph and ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>It is clear then, that the Eternal life is moſt bleſſed; for what other thing can be named, or thought upon, that is more happy then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life? As for this preſent ſhort life, it is ſo very ſhort, that it is withall moſt miſerable. It is preſt and aſſaulted on every ſide with ſurrounding, inevitable ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, it is diſtreſt with many evill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and toſt to and fro by ſecret and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal accidents. For what is there in all the whole World that is ſo uncertain, ſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo repleniſhed with troubles, as the courſe of this life? Which is full of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, full of anguiſh, fraught with cares, and made ominous with dangers: which is diſtracted with violen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and ſuddaine mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, made unpleaſant with bodily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, afflicted with thoughtfullneſſe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103173:113"/>
and mentall agonies, and lies naked and open to all the Whirlwinds of time and Chance? What benefit then, yea, what reaſon have you to turne aſide, and run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Eternal joyes, that you may purſue and follow after temporall miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>Do not you ſee, my dear <hi>Valerian,</hi> how every one that is provident (even in this life,) doth with plenty of all neceſſaries furniſh that cottage or field, where hee knowes he ſhall reſide? and where he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides but for a ſhort time, his proviſion is accordingly, where he intends a longer ſtay, he provides likewiſe a greater ſupply? unto us alſo, who in this preſent World (being ſtraightned on every ſide) have but a very ſhort time, are Eternall ages reſerv'd in the World which is to come; if ſo be that wee competently provide for an Eternall ſtate, and ſeeke onely what is ſufficient for the preſent, not perverſely beſtowing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care upon the ſhorteſt and ſmalleſt porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time, and the ſmalleſt care upon the time of greateſt and endleſſe extent.</p>
                  <p>And indeed I know not, which ſhould ſooneſt, or moſt effectually incite us to a pious care of life Eternal, either the bleſſings which are promiſed us in that ſtate of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or the miſeries which we feel in this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103173:114"/>
preſent life. Thoſe from above moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly invite and call upon us; theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low moſt rudely and importunately would expell us hence. Seeing therefore that the continuall Evills of this life, would drive us hence unto a better, if we will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the good, let us be compelled by the Evill: Both the good and the bad agree to incite us to the beſt, and though at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence amongſt themſelves; yet both conſent to make us happy. For while the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us, and the other compells us, both are ſollicitous for our good.</p>
                  <p>If ſome eminent and powerfull Prince having adopted you for his Son, and co-partner, ſhould forthwith ſend for you by his Embaſſador; you would (I believe) break through all difficulties, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome extent of Sea and Land, that you might appear before him, and have your adoption ratified. God Almighty, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and all that is in them, calls you to this adoption, and offers unto you (if you will receive it,) that dear ſtile of a Sonne, by which he calls his onely begotten, and your glorious Redeemer. And will you not be inflamed and raviſhed with his Divine love? will you not make haſt, and begin your Journey towards Heaven, leſt ſwift
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103173:114"/>
deſtruction come upon you, and the honors offered you be fruſtrated by a ſad and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death?</p>
                  <p>And to obtain this adoption, you ſhall not need to paſſe through the unfrequented and dangerous Solitudes of the Earth, or to commit your ſelfe to the wide and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous Sea: When you will, this adoption is within your reach, and lodgeth with you. And ſhall this bleſſing, becauſe it is as eaſie in the getting, as it is great in the conſequence, find you therefore backward or unwilling to attain it? How hard a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the lukewarme and the diſſembler will the making ſure of this adoption prove? for as to the faithfull and obedient it is moſt eaſie, ſo to the hypocrite and the rebellious, it is moſt difficult.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, it is the love of life that hath inſlaved us ſo much to a delectation, and dotage upon temporal things. Therefore do I now adviſe you, who are a lover of life, to love it more. It is the right way of perſwading, when we do it for no other end but to obtain that from you, which of your owne accord you deſire to grant us. Now for this life which you love, am I an Embaſſadour; and intreat that this life which you love in its tranſient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary ſtate, you would alſo love in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103173:115"/>
Eternal. But how, or in what manner you may be ſaid to love this preſent life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you deſire to have it made moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, perfect, and etternally permanent, I cannot ſee; for that which hath the power to pleaſe you when it is but ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, will pleaſe you much more, when it is made eternal and immutable: And that which you dearly love and value, though you have it but for a time, will be much more deare and pretious to you, when you ſhall enjoy it without end. It is therefore but fit, that the temporall life ſhould look ſtill towards the Eternal, that though the one, you may paſſe into the other. You muſt not rob your ſelfe of the benefits of the life to come, by a crooked and perverſe uſe of the preſent. This life muſt not oppoſe it ſelfe to the damage and hurt of the future: For it were very abſurd and unnatural, that the love of life ſhould causſe the deſtruction and the death of life.</p>
                  <p>Therefore whither you judg this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life worthy of your love, or your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; my preſent argument will be every way very reaſonable. <note n="*" rend="inter">An excellent Dilemma.</note> For if you contemne it, your reaſon to do ſo, is, that you may obtain a better: and if you love it,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103173:115"/>
you muſt ſo much the more love that life which is eternall.</p>
                  <p>But I rather deſire, that you would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of it, as you have found it; and judge it to be (as it is indeed) full of bitterneſſe and trouble, a race of tedious and various vexations; and that you would utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and renounce both it, and its occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Cut off at laſt that weariſome and endleſſe chain of ſecular imployments, that one and the ſame ſlavery, though in ſeveral negotiations. Break in ſunder thoſe cords of vain cares, in whoſe ſucceſſive knots you are alwayes intangled, and bound up, and in every one of which you travell is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and begun again. Let this rope of ſands, this coherencie of vaine cauſes be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: In which (as long as men live) the tumult of affairs (being ſtill lengthen'd by an intervening ſucceſſion of freſh cares) is never ended, but runnes on with a fretting and conſuming ſollicitouſneſs, which makes this preſent life, that is already of it ſelfe ſhort and miſerable enough, far more ſhort and more miſerable. Which alſo (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſucceſſe or croſneſſe of affairs) lets in divers times vain and ſinfully rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, bitter ſorrows, anxious wiſhes, and ſuſpitious fears. Let us laſt of all caſt off all thoſe things which make this life in reſpect
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103173:116"/>
of their imployment but very ſhort, but in reſpect of cares and ſorrows very long. Let us reject, and reſolutely contemn this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain world, and the more úncertain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of it, wherein the Peaſant as well as the Prince is ſeldom ſafe, where things that lye low are trodden upon, and the high and lofty totter and decline. Chuſe for your ſelf what worldly eſtate you pleaſe: There is no reſt either in the <hi>mean,</hi> or the <hi>mighty.</hi> Both conditions have their miſeries, and their misfortunes: The private and obſcure is ſubject to diſdain, the publick and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did unto envy.</p>
                  <p>Two prime things I ſuppoſe there are, which ſtrongly enchain, and keep men bound in ſecular negotiations; and having bewitch'd their underſtanding, retaine them ſtill in that dotage; the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of <hi>riches,</hi> &amp; the <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>honours.</hi> The former of which ought not to be called pleaſure, but pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the latter is not dignity, but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Theſe two (being joyn'd in one ſubtile league) ſet upon man, and with alternate, inſnaring knots diſturb and intangle his goings. Theſe (beſides the vain deſires which are peculiar to themſelves) infuſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind of man other deadly and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous luſtings, which are their conſequents; and with a certaine pleaſing inticement
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103173:116"/>
sollicite and overcome the hearts of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>As for Riches (that I may ſpeake firſt of them) what is there, I pray, or what can there be more pernicious? They are ſeldom gotten without Injuſtice; by ſuch an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator are they gathered, and by ſuch a Steward they muſt be kept; for Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the root of all evils. And there is indeed a very great familiarity betwixt theſe two, Riches <note n="*" place="margin">Divitiae &amp; Vitia.</note> and Vices in their names, as well as in their nature. And are they not alſo very frequently matter of diſgrace, and an evill report? Upon which conſideration it was ſaid by one, that <note n="a" place="margin">Every rich man is either a tyrant himſelf, or the ſon of a tyrant.</note>
                     <hi>Riches were tokens of Injuries.</hi> In the poſſeſſion of corrupt perſons they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the world their bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and unrighteouſneſſe, and elſwhere, they allure the eyes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the ſpirits of ſeditious men to rebellion, and in the cuſtody of ſuch they bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſufferings, and the murther of innocent perſons, &amp; the plundering of their goods.</p>
                  <p>But grant that theſe diſaſters ſhould not happen, can we have any certainty, whither theſe things that make themſelves wings, will fly away after our deceaſe? <hi>He layeth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103173:117"/>
up treaſure</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not for whom he gathers it.</hi>

                  <p>But ſuppoſe that you ſhould have an heir after your own heart, doth hee not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſtroy and ſcatter what the Father hath gathered? doth not an ill-bred ſon, or our ill choice of a Son-in-law prove the frequent ruin of all our labours and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in this life? What pleaſure then can there be in ſuch riches, whoſe collection is ſin and ſorrow, and our tranſmiſion, or bequeathing of them anxious and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine?</p>
                  <p>Whither then at laſt will this wild and deviuos affection of men carry them? You know how to love accidental and external goods, but cannot love your own ſelf. That which you ſo much long for is abroad, and without you; you place your affection upon a forraigner, upon an enemy. Returne, or retire rather into your ſelfe, and be you dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and nearer to your own heart then thoſe things which you call yours. Certainly if ſome wiſeman, and ſkilfull in the affaires of this world, ſhould converſe, and come to be intimate with you, it would better pleaſe you, that he ſhould affect your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then affect your goods; and you would chooſe, that he ſhould rather love you for your ſelf, then for your riches; you would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103173:117"/>
have him to be faithful unto man, not to his money. What you would have another to performe towards you, that doe you for your ſelf, who ought to be the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to your ſelf. Ourſelves, ourſelves wee ſhould love, not thoſe things which wee phantaſtically call ours.</p>
                  <p>And let this ſuffice to have been ſpoken againſt Riches.</p>
                  <p>As for the Honours of this world (to ſpeak generally, and without exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I ſhall not deſcend to particulars) what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can you juſtlt attribute to thoſe things which the baſe man, and the bad, as well as the noble and good, promiſcuouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and all of them by corruption and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition? The ſame honour is not conferred upon men of the ſame merits, and dignity makes not a difference betwixt the worthy and the unworthy, but confounds them. So that which ſhould be a character of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, by advancing the good above the bad, doth moſt unjuſtly make them equal; and after a moſt ſtrange manner there is in no ſtate of life leſſe difference made betwixt the worſt men, and the beſt, then in that ſtate which you term honourable. Is it not then a greater honour to be without that honour, and to be eſteemed of according to our genuine worth, and ſincere carriage
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103173:118"/>
then according to the falſe gloſs of promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, deceiving honours?</p>
                  <p>And theſe very things (how big ſoever they look) what fleeting and frail appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are they? We have ſeen of late men eminently honourable, ſeated upon the very ſpires, and top of dignity, whoſe incredible treaſures purchaſed them a great part of the world; their ſucceſſe exceeded their own deſires, and their prodigious fortunes amazed their very wiſhes: But theſe I ſpeak of were private proſperities. Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all their height and imperiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with all their triumphs and glory ſhined but for a time. Their cloathings were of wrought of gold, their diadems ſparkled with the various flames, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering relucencies of precious ſtones; their Palaces were thronged with Princely atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, their roofs adorned with gilded beams, their Will was a Law, and their words were the rules and coercive bounds of Mankind. But who is he, that by a temporal felicity can lift his head above the ſtage of humane chances? Behold now, how the vaſt ſway and circumference of theſe <hi>mighty</hi> is no where to be found! their riches and precious things too are all gone, and they themſelves the poſſeſſors and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of thoſe royal treaſures! moſt late,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103173:118"/>
and moſt famous Kingdoms (even amongſt us) are now become a certaine fable. All thoſe things which ſometimes were repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here to be very great, are now become none at all.</p>
                  <p>Nothing I think, nay I am ſure, of all theſe riches, honours, powers went along with them from hence: All they took with them was the pretious ſubſtance of their faith and piety. Theſe onely (when they were deprived of all other attendants) waited on them, and like faithfull, inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companions, travelled with them out of this wrold. With this proviſion are they now fed; with theſe riches, and with theſe honours are they adorned. In theſe they reſt, and this goodneſſe is now their greatneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, if we be taken at all with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and riches, let us be taken with the true and durable ones: Every good man exchangeth theſe earthly dignities for thoſe which are celeſtiall, and earthen treaſures for the heavenly. He layes up treaſure there, where a moſt exact and inconfuſed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is made betwixt the good and the bad; where that which is once gotten ſhall be for ever enjoyed; where all things may be obtained, and where nothing can be loſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:103173:119"/>But ſeeing we are fallen into a diſcourſe of the frailty of temporal things, let us not forget the frail condition of this ſhort life. What is it, I beſeech you, what is it? Men ſee nothing more frequently then death, and minde nothing more ſeldome. Mankinde is by a ſwift mortality quickly driven into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or ſetting point of life, and all poſterity by the unalterable Law of ſucceeding ages and generations follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Our fathers went from hence before us; we ſhall goe next, and our children muſt come after. As ſtreames of water falling from high, the one ſtill following the other, doe in ſucceſſive circles break and terminate at the banks; ſo the appointed times and ſucceſſions of men are cut off at the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of death. This conſideration ſhould take up our thoughts night and day; this memoriall of our fraile condition ſhould keep us ſtill awake. Let us alwayes thinke the time of our departure to be at hand; for the day of death, the farther we put it off, comes on the faſter, and is by ſo much the nearer to us. Let us ſuſpect it to be near, becauſe we know not how far. Let us, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, <hi>make plain our wayes before us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we make this the buſineſſe of our thoughts, and meditate ſtill upon it, wee

ſhall not be frighted with the fear of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bleſſed and happy are all you who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready reconciled your ſelves unto <hi>Chriſt</hi>! no great fear of death can diſturb them, who defſire to be diſſolved that they may be with <hi>Chriſt</hi>; who in the ſilence of their own boſomes, quietly, and long ſince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, expect the laſt day of their pilgrimage here. They care not much how ſoon they end this temporal life, that paſſe from it into life eternal.</p>
                  <p>Let not the populacy and throng of looſe livers, or hypocriticall time-pleaſers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to a neglect of life, neither be you induced by the errours of the <hi>many</hi> to caſt away your particular ſalvation. What wil the multitude in that day of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment avail us, when every private perſon ſhall be ſentenced, where the examinations of works, and every mans particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not the example of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall abſolve him? Stop your ears, and ſhut your eyes againſt ſuch damnable Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that invite you to deſtruction. It is better to ſow in tears, and to plant eternal life with the few, then to loſe it with the multitude. Let not therefore the number of ſinfull men weaken your diligence of not ſinning; for the madneſſe of thoſe that ſin againſt their own ſoules, can be no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

                  <p>If it be your pleaſure to look for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſeek them rather from that party, which though the leaſt, yet if conſidered as it is a diſtinct body, is numerous enough: Seek them (I ſay) from that party, wherein you ſhall find thoſe ranged, who wiſely underſtood, wherefore they were born, and accordingly while they lived, did the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life; who eminent for good works, and excelling in virtue, pruned and dreſt the preſent life, and planted the future. Nor are our examples (though of this rare kind) only copious, but great withall, and moſt illuſtrious.</p>
                  <p>For what worldly nobility, what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, what dignity, what wiſdom, what eloquence, or learning have not betaken themſelves to this heavenly warfare? what ſoveraignty now hath not with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſubmitted to this eaſie yoke of <hi>Chriſt</hi>? And certainly it is a madneſſe beyond error and ignorance for any to diſſemble in the cauſe of their ſalvation.

Joy in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and comforts in adverſity are both the diſpenſations of his hand. Wherefore it ſtands with all reaſon, that you ſhould love the giver more then his gifts, and him from whom you have all theſe things, more then the things themſelves. Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and all things elſe, whoſe preſent luſtre attracts and poſſeſſeth your heart, are not onely with him, but are now alſo had from him.</p>
                  <p>Recollect your diſperſed, and hitherto ill-placed affections, imploy them wholly in the Divine ſervice. Let this diſſolute love and compliance with worldly deſires become chaſt piety, and wait upon ſacred affaires. Call home your devious and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate thoughts, which opinion and cuſtome have ſadly diſtracted; and having ſuppreſt old errors, direct your love to his proper object, beſtow it wholy upon your Maker. For all that you can love now is his, his alone, and none elſe. For of ſuch infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is he, that thoſe who do not love him, deale moſt injuriouſly: becauſe they cannot love any thing, but what is his.</p>

                  <p>And what have we ſpoken all this while of thoſe innumerable delights which are with him? or of the infinite and raviſhing ſweetneſſe of his ineffable Goodneſſe? the ſacred and inexhauſtible treaſure of his Love? or when will it be that any ſhall be able to expreſſe or conceive the dignity and fulneſſe of any one Attribute that is in him?

                  <p>And that I may now deſcend unto thoſe things which were ſometimes out of his Covenant, I mean the Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Gentiles, doe you think that theſe were made ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that the diſperſed multitude of Mankind were incorporated (as it were) into one body under one head for any other end, but that (as Medicines taken in at the mouth are diffuſed into all parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) ſo the Faith by this means might with more eaſe be planted and penetrated into the moſt remote parts of the world.

of Chriſt.</hi> And how long (without this preparation in the fulneſſe of time) might this have been in doing, amongſt Nations, either innumerable for multitude, or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous for immanitie? Hence it is that the whole earth now from the riſing of the Sun unto the going down thereof, from the fartheſt North and the frozen ſea breaks forth into ſinging, and rings with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hence it is, that all parts of the world flock and run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Word of Life: The <hi>Thracian</hi> is for the Faith, the <hi>African</hi> for the Faith, the <hi>Syrian</hi> for the Faith, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath received the Faith. A great argument of the divine clemency may be gathered out of this, that under <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> power was in the height, and <hi>Acmie,</hi> then the Almighty God came down upon the earth and aſſumed fleſh. Therefore that I may now make uſe of thoſe things, which you alſo are verſed in, it may be clearly proved (if any skilled in your Hiſtories would aſſert the truth) that from the firſt foundation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (which is now one thouſand one hundred and eighty five years ago) what ever additions and growth it gathered either in the

                  <p>But I return thither, from whence I have digreſt. <hi>Love not the world</hi> (ſaith <hi>St. John) neither the things that are in the world</hi>; for all thoſe things with deluſive, inſnaring ſhews, captivate our ſight, and will not ſuffer us to look upwards. Let not that faculty of the eye which was ordained for light, be applyed to darkneſſe, being created for the uſe of life, let it not admit the cauſes of death. Fleſhly luſts (as it is divinely ſpoken by the Apoſtle) war againſt the ſoul, and all their accoutrements are for the ruin and deſtruction of it. A vigilant guard doe they keep, when they are once permitted to make head, and after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of forraign and expert enemies, with thoſe forces they take from us, they poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly ſtrengthen and increaſe their own.</p>
                  <p>Thus hitherto have I diſcourſed of thoſe ſplendid allurements, which are the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt taking baits of this ſubtile world, I mean Riches and Honours. And with ſuch earneſtneſſe have I argued againſt them, as if thoſe blandiſhments had ſtill

ſome force. But what beauty ſoever they had, when caſt over heretofore with ſome pleaſing adumbrations, it is now quite worn away, and all that paint and couſenage is fallen off. The world now hath ſcarce the art to deceive. Thoſe powerfull and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching lookes of things, beautiful ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even to deception, are now withered, and almoſt loathſome. In former times it laboured to ſeduce us with its moſt ſolid and magnificent glories, and it could not. Now it turnes cheat, and would entice us with toyes, and ſlight wares, but it cannot. Reall riches it never had, and now it is ſo poor, that it wants counterfeits. It neither hath delectable things for the preſent, nor durable for the future; unleſſe wee agree to deceive our ſelves, the world in a manner cannot deceive us.</p>
                  <p>But why delay I my ſtronger arguments? I affirm then that the forces of this world are diſperſed and overthrown, ſeeing the world it ſelf is now drawing towards its diſſolution, and pants with its laſt gaſps, and dying anhelations. How much more grievous and bitter will you think this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that for certain it cannot laſt very long? What ſhould I trouble my ſelf to tell you that all the utenſils and moveables of it are decayed and waſted? And no marvell

                  <p>Theſe latter years and decrepitneſs of time are fraught with evils and calamities, as old age is with diſeaſes.

Every hour tels us of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of that inevitable hour of our death, ſeeing a double danger of two finall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions threatens every one in particular, and all the world in generall. Wretched man that I am! the mortality of this whole frame lyes heavily upon my thoughts, as if my own were not burthenſome enough. Wherefore is it that we flatter our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe ſure fears. There is no place left for deviation: A moſt certain decree is paſt againſt us, on the one ſide is written every mans private diſſolution, and on the other the publick and univerſal.</p>
                  <p>How much more miſerable then is the condition of thoſe men (I will not ſay, in theſe out-goings, or laſt walks of time, but in theſe decayes of the worlds goodly things) who neither can enjoy ought that is pleaſant at the preſent, nor lay up for themſelves any hope of true joyes hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They miſſe the fruition of this ſhort life, and can have no hope of the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They abuſe theſe temporal bleſſings, and ſhall never be admitted to uſe the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Their ſubſtance here is very little, but their hope there is none at all. A moſt wretched and deplorable condition! un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103173:129"/>
they make a virtue of this deſperate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and lay hold on the onely ſoveraign remedy of bettering their eſtate, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting in time to the wholſome rules of heavenly and ſaving reaſon. Eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the goodlieſt things of this preſent time, are ſuch rags and fragments, that he that loſeth the whole fraught, and true treaſure of that one precious life which is to come, may be juſtly ſaid to loſe both.</p>
                  <p>It remaines then, that we direct and fixe all the powers of our minds upon the hope of the life to come. Which hope (that you may morefully and clearly apprehend it) I ſhall manifeſt unto you, under a type or example taken from temporal things. If ſome man ſhould offer unto another five peeces of ſilver this day, but promiſe him five hundred peeces of gold, if he would ſtay till the next morning, and put him to his choice, whither he would have the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at preſent, or the gold upon the day following, is there any doubt to be made, but he would chuſe the greater ſum, though with a little delay? Goe you and doe the like: Compare the Crummes and periſhing pittance in this ſhort life, with the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and enduring rewards of the eternall: And when you have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chuſe not the leaſt and the worſt, when you may have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103173:129"/>
the greateſt and the beſt. The ſhort fruition of a little is not ſo beneficial, as the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of plenty. But ſeeing that all the fraile goods of this world are not onely ſeen of us, but alſo poſſeſſed by us: It is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that hope cannot belong unto this world, in which we both ſee and enjoy thoſe things we delight in: For <hi>Hope that is ſeen is not hope; for what a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for</hi>? Rom. 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. Therefore however hope may be abuſed, and miſapplyed to temporal things, it is moſt certaine that it was given to man and ordained for the things that are eternal; otherwiſe it cannot be called hope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſomething bee hoped for, which as yet (or for the preſent life) is not had. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſubſtance of our hope in the world to come is more evident and manifeſt, then our hope of ſubſtance in the preſent.</p>
                  <p>Conſider thoſe objects which are the cleareſt and moſt viſible; when we would beſt diſcern them, we put them not into our eyes, becauſe they are better ſeen and judged of at a diſtance. It is juſt ſo in the caſe of preſent things and the future: For the preſent (as if put into our eyes) are not rightly and undeceivably ſeen of us; but the future, becauſe conveniently diſtant, are moſt clearly diſcerned.</p>

                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:103173:130"/>Nor is this truſt and Confidence wee have of our future happineſſe built upon weak or uncertain Authors, but upon our Lord and Maſter <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> that allmighty and faithfull witneſſe, who hath promiſed unto the juſt, a Kingdome without end, and the ample rewards of a moſt bleſſed eternity.

For not knowing God, and deviating in their firſt principles from the Author, and the Wel-ſpring of Juſtice; they neceſſarily erred in the reſt: Hence it happened, that the end of all their ſtudies was vanity and diſſention. And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongſt them chanced to hit upon ſome more ſober and honeſt Tenets, theſe preſently miniſtred matter of pride and Superſtitiouſneſſe, ſo that their very Virtue was not free from vice.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103173:133"/>
be done either to the glory of God, or for Gods ſake. Get Innocence for your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and ſhe is ſo faithfull, that ſhe will be alſo your defendreſſe. It is a worthy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe to follow after Virtue, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſomething while we live, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and the good of others: nor is it to be doubted, but the mind, by a virtuous courſe of life, will quickly free it ſelfe from thoſe intanglements and deviations it hath been formerly accuſtomed to. That great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to whoſe cure and care we offer our ſelves, will daily ſtrengthen and perfect our recovery.</p>
                  <p>And what eſtimation or value (when in this ſtate) can you lay upon thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious remunerations that will be laid up for you againſt the day of recompence? You ſee that God, even in this life, hath merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtributed unto all (without any difference) his moſt pleaſant and uſefull light. The pious and the impious are both allowed the ſame Sunne, all the creatures obediently ſubmit themſelves to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: And the whole Earth with the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof is the indifferent poſſeſſion of the juſt and unjuſt. Seeing then that he hath given ſuch excellent things unto the impious, how much more glorious are thoſe things which he reſerves for the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103173:134"/>
he that is ſo great in his free gifts, how excellent will he be in his rewards? He that is ſo Royal in his daily bounty, and ordinary magnificence; how tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent will hee be in his remunerations and requitalls? Ineffable and beyond all conception are thoſe things which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him; And that they are ſo is moſt certain: For it is altogether incomprehenſible, and paſſeth the underſtanding of his moſt choſen veſſels to tell, how great his reward ſhall be unto the juſt, who hath given ſo much to the unthankfull and the unbelieving.</p>
                  <p>Take up your Eyes from the Earth, and look about you, my moſt dear <hi>Valerian</hi>; ſpread forth your ſailes, and haſten from this ſtormy Sea of Secular negotiations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the calme and ſecure harbour of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion. This is the onely Haven into which we all drive from the raging Surges of this malitious World. This is our ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the lowd and perſecuting whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds of time: Here is our ſure ſtation and certain reſt: Here a large and ſilent receſſe, ſecluded from the World, opens and offers it ſelfe unto us. Here a pleaſant, ſerene tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity ſhines upon us. Hither when you are come, your weather-beaten Veſſell (after all your fruitleſſe toiles) ſhall at laſt find reſt,

and ſecurely ride at the Anchor of the <hi>Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is time now that I ſhould make an end.

                     <hi>Liberius</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>: In a Golden Age, when Religion and Learning kiſſed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and equally flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that he had the happines to ſhine in an age that loved light, and to multiply his own by the light of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It was the faſhion then of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Senatours to build them ſumptuous houſes in their Country-livings, that they might have the pleaſure and conveniency of retiring thither from the tumult and noyſe of that great City, which ſometimes was, and would be yet the head of the World.

Upon ſuch an occaſion (without doubt) was <hi>Burdeaux</hi> honoured with the birth of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> his Fathers eſtate lying not far off, about the town of <hi>Embrau,</hi> upon the River <hi>Garumna,</hi> which riſing out of the <hi>Pyrene</hi> hils waſheth that part of <hi>Guienne</hi> with a pleaſant ſtream, and then runs into the <hi>Aquitane</hi> ſea. By this happy accident came <hi>France</hi> to lay claime to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> which ſhe makes no ſmall boaſt of at this day. But his Country indeed (if we follow his deſcent, which is the right way to find it) is <hi>Italie,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; his Anceſtors were all <hi>Patricians,</hi> and honour'd (by a long ſucceſſion) with the Conſular <hi>purple.</hi> His Patrimonies were large, and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming a Prince then a private man; for beſides thoſe poſſeſſions in the City of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> and by the River <hi>Garumna,</hi> he had other moſt ample Inheritances in <hi>Italy</hi> about <hi>Narbone</hi> and <hi>Nola,</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.

                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:103173:141"/>To theſe Divine favours already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, God added another great bleſſing, the Crown of his youth, and the Comfort of his age; I meane <hi>Theraſia,</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman</hi> Virgin, whom he tooke to wife in the midſt of his honours, and who afterwards (of her owne free will) moſt joyfully parted with them all, and with her own pleaſant poſſeſſions to follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the regeneration.</p>
                  <p>At this height of honours, &amp; growing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, he was employ'd (upon ſome concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Empire</hi>) into <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; Where he was detained (together with his dear conſort) for the ſpace of almoſt fifteen years; during which time, he ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured to make himſelf acquainted with the glorious <hi>Fathers</hi> of that age, and (the Spirit of God now beginning to breath upon him) hee was ſtrongly moved to embrace the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith. In theſe travells of his, it was his fortune to arrive at <hi>Millaine,</hi> where Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Alypius,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Tagaſta</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> did the Sojourne; here by accident he was known of <hi>Alpyius,</hi> though unknown to him; as we ſee it often fall out, that great perſons are known of many, which to them are unknown.</p>
                  <p>Much about this time (which was the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103173:142"/>
eight and thirtieth year of his age,) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired privately with his wife into the City of <hi>Burdeaux.</hi> And the hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now come, that <hi>the ſinging of birds ſhould be heard, and the lips which were aſleep ſhould ſpeak</hi>: Hee was there by the hands of holy <hi>Delphinus</hi> (who then ſate Biſhop in the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi>) publickly baptized, from which time forward he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all his Secular acquaintance, aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating himſelf to the moſt ſtrict and pious livers in that age, eſpecially to Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Millan,</hi> and Saint <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Tours.</hi> That he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized about the eight and thirtieth yeare of his age, is clear by his owne words in his firſt Epiſtle to Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Nolo in me corporalis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>I would not (ſaith he) that you conſider my tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall age, ſo much as my ſpiritual; my age in the fleſh is the ſame with that Cripple, who was healed in the beautifull gate by the power of Chriſt working by his Apoſtles; but my age in the regeneration is the ſame with the bleſſed Infants, who by the wounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Chriſt himſelf, became the firſt fruits unto Chriſt, and by the loſſe of their innocent blood, did foreſhew
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103173:142"/>
the ſlaughter of the Lamb, and the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Lord.</q>
Now for the firſt, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Cripple upon whom this miracle of healing was ſhown, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove forty years of age</hi> (Acts Chap. 4. ver. 22.) and for the Infants, the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> words are, that <hi>Herod ſent forth his meſſengers, and ſlew all the Male Children that were in</hi> Bethlem, <hi>and the Coaſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, from two years old and under.</hi> So that conſidering all the Circumſtances which offer themſelves for the clearing of this point, it will evidently appear, that he was baptized (as I have ſaid before) in the eight and thirtieth year of his age. The onely Inſtrument which God was pleas'd to ordain, and imploy upon the Earth for his Converſion, was his dear and Virtuous Wife <hi>Theraſia</hi>; Which makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that ſhe was borne of Chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and had received the faith from her infancie. This <hi>Auſonius</hi> his old <hi>Tutor,</hi> (who was ſcarce a good Chrihian,) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat not to upraid him with in moſt injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous termes, calling her <hi>Tanaquil,</hi> and the <hi>Imperatrix</hi> of her Husband: To which paſſionate paſſages (though ſadly reſented) <hi>Paulinus</hi> r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Divine will: However I refuſed it not, but ſubmitted with all humility, and have put my necke into the Yoke of Chriſt, though altogether unworthy and unable. I ſee now that I have medled with things that are too wonderful for me; I am made a Steward of the Secrets of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and honourd with the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heavenly things, and being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nearer to my Maſter, I am exerciſed about the Body, about the Spirit, and the glory of Jeſus Chriſt. The narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my underſtanding cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the ſignification of this high and ſacred dignity, and I tremble every minute (when I conſider my own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities) to thinke of the great burthen that is laid upon me. But he that gives wiſedome to his little ones, and hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected praiſe out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings, is able to finiſh what he begun in me, that by his mighty work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I may be made worthy, who was moſt unworthy to be called.</q>
The Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is an Office belonging to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven. It is an honour that is ranged upon holy ground, and by it ſelfe. Worldly dignities, which are but humane inventions, are, and may be acquired (with leſſe offence) by humane meanes,

<q>The goods (ſaith he) I carried about me, by the ſlipping of my skirt out of my hand, fell eaſily from me: And thoſe things which I brought not into this World, and could not carry out of it, being only lent me for a time, I reſtored again. I pulled them not as the skin off my back, but laid them by, as a garment I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times worne. But now comes the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty upon me, when thoſe things which are truly mine, as my heart, my Soul, and my works muſt be preſented
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103173:152"/>
and given a living Sacrifice unto God. The abdication of this World, and the giving of our temporall goods amongſt the poore, is not the running of the race, but a preparing to run; it is not the end, but the beginning, and firſt ſtep of our Journey. Hee that ſtriveth for maſteries, ſhall not be crowned, except he firſt ſtrive lawfully; And he that is to ſwimme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a River, cannot do it by putting off his cloathes onely, he muſt put his body alſo into the ſtream, and with the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his armes, his hands and feete, paſſe through the violence of the Brook, and then reſt upon the further ſide of it.</q>
And in his 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Epiſtle, he cries out,

Well ſell oftentimes, but ſeldome give:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103173:153"/>
and happily that is the reaſon we ſell ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. He that keeps all to himſelfe, takes not the right way to thrive. The Corn that lies in the Granarie will bring no harveſt. It is moſt commonly the foode of vermine, and ſome creatures of the night and darkneſſe. Charity is a relique of Paradiſe, and pitty is a ſtrong argument that we are all deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from one man: He that carries this rare Jewell about him, will every where meete with ſome kindred. He is quickly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with diſtreſſed perſons, and their firſt ſight warmes his blood. I could believe, that the word <hi>ſtranger</hi> is a notion received from the poſterity of <hi>Cain,</hi> who killed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi> The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> in their own tribes, called thoſe of the fartheſt degree, <hi>brothers</hi>; and ſure they erred leſſe from the law of pure Nature, then the reſt of the Nations, which were left to their owne luſts. The afflictions of man are more moving then of any other Creature; for he onely is a ſtranger here, where all things elſe are at home. But the loſing of his innocency, and his device of Tyranny have made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pittied, and forfeited a prerogative, that would have prevailed more by ſubmiſſion, then all his poſterity ſhall do by oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Not to give to one that lacks, is a kind of murther: Want and famine are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103173:153"/>
as well as the ſword, and rage very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in private, when they are not thought of in the Publick. The bleſſed <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS</hi> who came into the World to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Nature, and to take away the inveterate corruptions of man, was not more in any of his precepts, then in that which bids us <hi>Love one another.</hi> This is the cement not onely of this World, but of that other which is to come. <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull</hi>; and, <hi>give to him that asketh thee,</hi> proceeded from the ſame lips of truth. And in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the laſt judgement, he grounds the ſentence of condemnation pronounced againſt the wicked upon no other fact, but becauſe they did not <hi>cloath the naked, feed the hungry, and take in the ſtranger. Love covers a multitude of ſins, and God loves the chearfull giver.</hi> But this is not our whole duty: though we give our bodies to be burnt, and give all our goods unto the poor, yet <hi>without holineſſe we ſhall never ſee the face of God.</hi> Darkneſſe cannot ſtand in the preſence of light, and <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> The great difficulty then (as our holy Biſhop here ſaith) is to become a living ſacrifice; and truly the next way to it, is by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical diſpoſing of theſe outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances; this will open and prepare
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103173:154"/>
the way before us, though it takes nothing from the length of it. The Hawke <hi>proines</hi> and <hi>rouſeth</hi> before ſhe flyes, but that brings her not to the <hi>mark</hi>: Preparations, and the diſtant flouriſhes of <hi>Array</hi> will not get the field, but action, and the purſuance of it.</p>
                  <p>His Eſtate in <hi>France</hi> being thus diſpoſed of, he retyred into <hi>Italy</hi>; where having done the like to his Patrimonies there, hee came to <hi>Millaine,</hi> and was honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by holy <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> then Biſhop of that <hi>Sea.</hi> But theſe gay feathers of the World, being thus blown off him, by the breath of that Spirit which makes <hi>the dry tree to become green,</hi> and <hi>the ſpices of the Garden to flow out,</hi> all his kindred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acquaintance became his deadly Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Flyes of eſtate follow Fortune, and the Sun-ſhine; friendſhip is a thing much talked off, but ſeldome found; I never knew above two that loved without ſelfe-ends. That which paſſeth for love in this age, is the meere counter to it; It is policie in the cloathes of love, or the hands of <hi>Eſau</hi> with the tongue of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Theſe ſmooth Cheats the World abounds with: There is <hi>Clay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the potter, but little duſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of commeth Gold.</hi> The beſt direction is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; find a true Chriſtian, and thou haſt

found a true friend. He that fears not God, will not feare to do thee a miſchiefe.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Millaine</hi> he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was honourably entertained by all, but his own kindred, and <hi>Siricius</hi> the great Biſhop. It was the ill Fortune of this zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pope, to be offended not onely with <hi>Paulinus,</hi> but with that glorious Father Saint <hi>Hierome.</hi> It was a perillous diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſſe of ſome Biſhops in that Century, to admit of Lay-men, and unſeaſon'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into the Miniſtry. This raſh and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice <hi>Siricius</hi> had, by ſeverall ſtrict Sanctions or decrees, condemned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; and it is probable that the reaſon of his ſtrange carriage towards <hi>Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> was, becauſe he would not ſeem to connive at any perſons that were ſuddenly ordained, though never ſo deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, leſt he ſhould ſeeme to offend againſt his own edicts. It is a ſad truth that this pernicious raſhneſſe of Biſhops (fighting <hi>ex diametro</hi> with the Apoſtolical cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) hath oftentimes brought boars into the Vineyard, and Wolves into the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; which complying afterwards with all manner of Intereſts, have torne out the bowels of their Mother.

<q>Your men (ſaith he) that were here with me, have ſeen, and can tell you with what conſtant diligence all the Biſhops, and my brethren the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, with the common people my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, did miniſter unto me all the time of my ſickneſſe. Unto you, who are unto me as my own ſoul, I take leave to boaſt and glory in this mercy of the Lord, whoſe goodneſſe it is, that I am ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully comforted. There is not one Biſhop in all <hi>Campania</hi> that did not come perſonally to viſit me, and thoſe whom either a farther diſtance, or their

and the ſincere gratulations of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Clergy; which accordingly was performed.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this year, which was the three hundred ninety and fifth after <hi>Chriſt, Theodoſius Auguſtus</hi> the firſt, a moſt pious Emperour, and a <hi>Nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of the Church departed this life. The <hi>Ethnick</hi> writers hating his memory as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulently as his perſon, laboured with all manner of lyes and Libels to render him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and deteſtable to poſterity. Holy <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delochius</hi> awaked with theſe ſcandalous clamours, and the inſolent aſperſions caſt upon ſo religious an Emperour, writes ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> and prevailes with him, to imploy thoſe excellent abilities beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, in the defenſe of this faithfull Souldier of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and Champion of his Spouſe. This task <hi>Paulinus</hi> performed, as appears by his owne words in his 9th E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Severus,</hi> to whom hee ſent a Coppy of his learned <hi>Panegygick</hi>; however poſterity have ſuffered in the loſſe of it. But we want not another witneſſe: That learned Father, and happy tranſlator of the booke of God in his thirteenth Epiſtle to <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> gives us a very fair and full account of it. <hi>Librum tuum quem pro Theodoſio principe prudenter ornateque,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> I have with much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light read over.

Your ſtile is compact and neat, and with the perſpicuity and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and yet weighty and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious; for that writing which hath nothing commendable in it, but words, is (as one ſaith) meer prating. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence beſides is very great, and the coherence exact. What ever you infer, is either the confirmation of the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or the inchoation of the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Moſt happy <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> to be vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by ſuch a learned Oratour of <hi>Chriſt</hi>! You have added to the glory of his Imperial robe, and made the utility of his juſt lawes ſacred to poſterity.</q>
But this rare peece, with many more mentioned by <hi>Gennadius,</hi> either through the envie of the Heathen, or the negligence of our own, are unfortunately loſt; eſpecially a <hi>Volume of Epiſtles</hi> written to his <hi>Siſter,</hi> with ſome <hi>controverſial peeces</hi> againſt the

The reverend Biſhop of <hi>Hippo</hi> did very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſollicite him to come over into <hi>Africk,</hi> &amp; he gives his reaſon for it in theſe words: <hi>Non imprudenter ego vos rogo, &amp; flagito, &amp; poſtulo,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>Not unadviſedly doe I intreat and earneſtly deſire, and require
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103173:163"/>
you to come into <hi>Africk,</hi> where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants labour more now with the thirſt of ſeeing you, then with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thirſtineſſe of the Climate. God knowes, I ask it not for my private ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, nor for thoſe onely, who either by my mouth, or by the publick fame have heard of you; but for the reſt, who either have not heard, or elſe having heard will not believe ſo great a change; but when they themſelves ſhall ſee the truth, they will not onely believe, but love and imitate. It is for their ſakes therefore, that I deſire you to honour theſe parts with your bodily preſence: Let the Eyes of our flocks alſo behold the glory of Chriſt in ſo eminent a Couple, the great exemplars to both Sexes, to tread pride under their feet, and not to deſpaire of attaining to prefection.</q>
And in his fifty ninth Epiſtle to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> when (according to the cuſtome of thoſe holy times) hee had ſent his Presbyter to him to be inſtructed, <hi>he cannot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>profit more by my Doctrine, then he can by your life.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> uſeth the ſame Engine to bring down the high thoughts of <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>:
<q>Art thou (ſaith he) nobly deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? So were <hi>Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Theraſia,</hi> and far nobler in Chriſt. Art thou rich

and honourable? So were they: and from the height of honours and worldly rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es became poor and inglorious, that they might gain Chriſt.</q>
Dearly did <hi>Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Siricius</hi> in the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> affect this holy Biſhop, as appears by his owne words in his ſixteenth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Delphinus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux.</hi>

                  <p>But amidſt all theſe triumphs of the Church of God, for the converſion of ſo eminent a perſon, and the frequent gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of learned men, expreſt by their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or perſonall viſits, there were none that raged with ſo much hatred and malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as his own kindred, and former acquaintance. <hi>A Prophet hath no honour in his own Country, and thoſe of his owne houſe will be his Enemies.</hi> There are no ſuch perſecutors of the Church, as thoſe that do it for ſelfe-ends, and their private advantage.

<q>You are my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now by a greater Father, then thoſe who are tyed to me by fleſh and blood onely. For where is now my great affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by blood? Where are my old

And in his firſt Epiſtle, I beſeech you (ſaith he)

The Noble Spirit is the braveſt bearer of indignities: and certainly extraction and a virtuous deſcent (let popular flatterers preach what they will to the contrary,) is attended with more Divinity, and a ſweeter tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then the indiſcrete Iſſue of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. There is an eminent difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt flowers and weedes, though they ſpring from the ſame mould. The Ape con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with the Lyoneſſe, told her, that ſhe was a very fair creature, but very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren:

For you (ſaid the Ape) bring forth but one at a birth, and I bring ſix, or more; 'Tis true (replyed the Lioneſſe,) but thy fix are ſix Apes, and my one is a Lyon. The greateſt part of men, which we commonly terme the populacy, are a ſtiffe, uncivill generation, without any ſeed of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or goodneſſe, and ſenſible of nothing but private intereſt, &amp; the baſe waies of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it. What Virtue, or what humanity can be expected from a <hi>Raymond Cabanes,</hi> a <hi>Maſſinello,</hi> or ſome Son of a Butcher? They have one barbarous ſhift, which Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Beares would bluſh to commit: They will cut the throats of their moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and Virtuous Benefactours, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with times, and advantage themſelves; Yea, they will rejoyce to ſee them ruined, and like inhumane Salvages, inſult over their innocent and helpleſſe poſterity. I could compare thoſe fawning Hypocrits, that waite not upon men, but upon their Fortunes, to that ſmiths bitch in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologues</hi> of <hi>Locmannus</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> which ſleeping in the forge, could not be awaked with all the noiſe of the hammers, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and the Bellowes: but if the ſmith would offer to ſtirre his teeth to eat, ſhee would ſtart up preſently, and attend upon him with all officiouſneſſe.

ſhare with him in the fruits of his labours; but would not watch and look to the ſhop one minute while he laboured.</p>

                     <hi>Paulinus</hi> had now firſt loſt theſe falſe friends, but was loaded for it with the love and commendations of true ones; And I know not which offended him moſt, to be deſpiſed by the firſt, or commended by the laſt. He had (like Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>) great hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe, and continuall ſorrow of heart, to ſee that his brethren and kinſmen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, hated him becauſe he loved Chriſt: And on the other ſide, his humility would not ſuffer him to beare the <hi>labour of love,</hi> I meane the generall applauſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere commendations conferred upon him by his Chriſtian friends. <hi>Severus</hi> in one of his Epiſtles written to him (after hee had ſpent ſome lines in the commendation of his zeale and conſtancie,) contrary to the cuſtome of that plaine age, ſubſcribed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note rend="inter">Te multa dilectio ad mendacii peccatum traxit.</note> his Servant. To the firſt he replyed, that <hi>his exceſſive love had drawn him to the ſin of untruth</hi>: And the laſt he deſired him to deſiſt from, for this reaſon; <hi>Cave ergo ne posthac,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>Have a care hereafter (ſaith he) that you who are a Servant of Chriſt, called unto liberty, terme nor your ſelf the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

Thus <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great, when Pope <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded towards him in his laudatory elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, blaſted them all with this humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; <hi>Quod verò me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Your calling me the mouth of the Lord, a ſhining light, and a ſtrong helper, is nothing elſe but an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my iniquity; for when I deſerve to be puniſhed for my ſins, then do I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of puniſhment receive praiſe.</q>
                     <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> in another of his Epiſtles to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> earneſtly intreated him to ſuffer his picture to be taken by a limner, which he had ſent to him for that purpoſe, that he might have it to ſet up, together with the picture of Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> before the ſacred font in a fair Church which <hi>Severus</hi> was then in building. This friendly motion <hi>Paulinus</hi> was very much offended with, and would by no means conſent unto, teling <hi>Severus, that too much love had made him mad</hi>; And in his eighth Epiſtle, reaſoning with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this requeſt, <hi>What kind of picture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>would you have from me, the picture of the earthly, or the Heavenly man?

                  <p>But paſſe we now to his <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. In his own Workes we have not one line that mentions this Eccleſiaſticall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor any other paſſage of his life, that might but ſeem to conduce to his own glory. They breath nothing but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, nothing but ſelf-deniall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Wee muſt be guided then through this part of his life by other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and ſuch faithfull records as are come unto us, from the hands of learned and publick perſons; who either upon the generall intereſt and concernments of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103173:169"/>
Church, or their own private merits, and not by reflection were acquainted with him. The firſt that offers himſelf to us, is <hi>Uranius,</hi> his own Presbyter, who in that ſhort nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which he wrote of his life, ſets him forth to poſterity in this following Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; <hi>Cum autem ad ſummum ſacerdotij gradum,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>When he was honoured (ſaith he) with the higheſt degree in the Prieſthood, he did not ſhew himſelf ſuch a Biſhop that deſired to be feared, but one that endeavoured to be beloved. He was never ſo farre angry, as not in his anger to ſhew mercy. Nor could that man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be angry, for he regarded not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and he avoyded hatred. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſate in Judgement, but mercy ſate cloſe by him. He was truly ſuch a Biſhop as laboured to get the love of all. For hee lived a Conſolation to all, and their great example to make ſure their Salvation. Nor is this my voyce onely: even the barbarous Nations who knew my Lord <hi>Paulinus</hi> by report onely, will teſtifie as much. And worthily was hee beloved of all, who was a friend to all. For who was there caſt down, and he did not lift him up? who ever called to him for help, and was not piouſly and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably anſwered? For he was pious, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103173:170"/>
hearted, humble and courteous, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting none, deſpiſing none. He gave to all, he cheriſhed all: he encouraged the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, pacified the violent, thoſe with his words, theſe with his example; Some he comforted with his letters, and thoſe that wanted, with his mony. He loved not any riches, nor any treaſures, but thoſe which Chriſt promiſed to his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Gold and Silver, and the other accommodations of life he approved of, if they were liberally given to the poor, not covetouſly hoorded up. Briefly, he had in him all goodneſſe, for he loved Chriſt. Hee had Faith, Meekneſſe, love towards his neighbours, a conſtant care of the poor, compaſſion upon the weak, and laboured for nothing in his life, but peace and charity. All his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours were to make men good, and to ſave their Soules. What place is there in the World, what ſolitude, what Seas which acknowledge not the good works of holy <hi>Paulinus</hi>? All men deſired his acquaintance, and did extreamly long to have a ſight of him. Who ever came to him without joy or who went from him, but he deſired to ſtay longer? thoſe that could not ſee him in the body, deſired to ſee him in his writings; for he was
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103173:170"/>
ſweet and gentle in his Epiſtles, elegant and raviſhing in his Poems. What more ſhall I ſay? The relations that may be given of him, would be ſcarſe credible, but that his knowne integrity is above falſhood.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Nola</hi> was at this time a very famous and ſplendid City, nothing inferiour to the beſt <hi>Emporiums</hi> of <hi>Italie,</hi> and had withall a very rich <hi>Sea</hi>; which queſtionleſſe was a great occaſion, that the piety of this bleſſed Biſhop was ſo renowned, and ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly ſpoken of in the moſt remote parts of the World. So the juſt and faithfull God exalteth thoſe that humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and honours thoſe that honour him. He had beene faithfull in thoſe things that were his own, and was therefore intruſted with the treaſures of the Church. <hi>Proſper</hi> in his ſecond book, <hi>de vitâ Contemplativâ,</hi> and the ninth Chapter, tells us, how hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of them; <hi>Sanctus Paulinus (ut ipſi meliùs noſtis) ingentia praedia quae fuerunt ſua, vendita pauperibus erogavit: ſed cum poſteà factus eſſet Epiſcopus, non contempſit Eccleſiae facultates, ſed fideliſſime diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavit.</hi>
                     <q> Holy <hi>Paulinus</hi> (ſaith he) as you beſt know, ſold all thoſe princely Poſſeſſions which were his own, and gave of them to the poor: but when he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103173:171"/>
conſecrated Biſhop, he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the revenues of the Church, but was a moſt faithfull Steward and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of them.</q>
So faithfull, that when he lay upon his death bed, hee had not one piece left to relieve himſelf, but was driven to lay out for ſome Cloathes which he had given to the poor, a ſmall ſumme of mony, which God ordained to be ſent to him for that very purpoſe a litle before the hour of his diſſolution. So that living and dying, he kept to the Apoſtles rule, and <hi>owed no man any thing but love.</hi> Hee was a great lover of learned and holy men, and confeſſeth in one of his Epiſtles to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypius,</hi> that his affection to Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> was the firſt inducement which he felt to incline him to Chriſtianity. His deareſt and moſt intimate friends were Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> Saint <hi>Martin</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Tours, Delphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> his Succeſſour; <hi>Alypius</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Tagaſta, Januarius</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Naples,</hi> afterwards a Martyr, <hi>Victricius</hi> the <hi>Rhoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magenſis, Aper, Severus,</hi> and <hi>Nicetas</hi> of <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103173:171"/>
and pillars of the Church, but to his own <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Domeſticks</hi>: he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf the moſt unworthy, and the moſt unable of all his brethren. <hi>Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> the Monk, ſent from <hi>Severus</hi> to ſee him (according to the cuſtome of thoſe times) waſhed his feete. This was a ceremony, which in that age of holineſſe could not be refuſed. But <hi>Victor</hi> by this did not onely waſh his feet, but his face alſo; for he drew tears from him, becauſe hee might not deny him the performance of that Evangelical ſervice. <hi>Servivit ergo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi peccatori, &amp; vae miſero mihi quod paſſus ſum; he ſerved me a ſinner</hi> (ſaith the holy Biſhop) <hi>and woe is to me becauſe I ſuffered him.</hi> But he ſtaid not at tears, for as ſoone as <hi>Victor</hi> had done waſhing his feet, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite his ſervice, he fetched him clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and held the baſon while he waſh'd his hands. He was not like that inſolent <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> that did caſt off his humility with his <hi>Cowle,</hi> and being asked by his brethren, <hi>why he was then ſo proud, that was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch an humble Monk,</hi> made anſwer; <hi>that in his Monachiſme, when he went ſo low, and ſtooping, he was ſearching for the keyes of the Abbey; but now having found them, he did hold up his head to eaſe himſelf.</hi>

                  <p>The Prince delighting much in Flowers and Sallets, would very frequently viſit <hi>Paulinus,</hi> and took ſuch delight in him, that he forſook all his Court-aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates to enjoy the company of his new Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner.

                     <hi>Paulinus,</hi> with all his joyfull Captives, was now landed in <hi>Campania,</hi> where all the Inhabitants, as upon a ſolemne feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day flocked together to welcome him, and to poure their joyes into his boſome; ſome received their Sonnes, ſome their brothers, and ſome their husbands: both the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and the received were beholding to <hi>Paulinus.</hi> They commended, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and admired him: He exhorted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and confirmed them. Mutuall Conſolations are a double banquet, they are the Churches <hi>Eulogiae,</hi> which we both give and take.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103173:177"/>
as in his moſt vigorous years. <hi>His ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al force was not abated, nor the Eye of his Soul any way dimmed.</hi> Hee did not coole towards his <hi>ſetting,</hi> but grew more large, more bright, and more fervent. Bearing trees, when their fruit is ripe, bend their boughes, and offer themſelves to the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers hands. He knew that his time of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was at hand, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi>-like he made his <hi>Doctrine to drop as the raine, and his ſpeech diſtilled as the dew. Hee poured out his milk and his Wine, and made them drink abundantly.</hi> To labour in the heat of the day, and to give over in the cool, is great indiſcretion, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſhould be alwaies hotteſt towards the end of the race.</p>

The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to break, he felt the uſuall motions of holyneſſe awaking his Spirit, to which (though weak) he chearfully obeyed, and ſitting up in his bed, celebrated <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> himſelfe. By this time all the <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of his dioceſſe were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together at the door, and came (like the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi>) to ſee the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their aged Father.

The Gueſts of Eternal Glory were now entred under that narrow roof, where (after the abdication of his great worldly honours) he had lived ſo long in all holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and humility. For in that inſtant of time (ſaith <hi>Uranius</hi>) he was diſſolved, the bleſſed Angels teſtifying that they were preſent to conduct his happy and glorious Soul into the joy of his Maſter.
