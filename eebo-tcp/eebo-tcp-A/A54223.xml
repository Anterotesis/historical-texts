         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SAtan,</hi> that Great Enemy to the Work of God, failing of his End in all thoſe Attempts he hath made to Hinder, Pervert or Deſtroy it by the earneſt Endeavours of ſome of the moſt Envious among the many <hi>Sects</hi> in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath at laſt pitcht upon an Old <hi>Kanker'd Apoſtate</hi> (the beſt <hi>Spoke</hi> in his Wheel) and therefore call'd an <hi>Ingenious Quaker</hi> by the <hi>Publiſher,</hi> becauſe he has endeavour'd to promote the Common Deſign of our Overthrow in this World.</p>
            <p>It is a manifeſt Token to me, that the <hi>Devil</hi> is hard beſet, his Affairs brought to a low Ebb, and his Condition Deſperate, that he is fled to his laſt Refuge of Palſe Brethren, and very <hi>Apoſtates.</hi> A Treachery that ſhall evermore infame this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <hi>Alexander</hi> with Good Men, and encreaſe his Account with the Great and Terrible Judge of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>But is it not ſtrange to ſee, that <hi>Independents, Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> now in Arms againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſhould ſo heartily hugg the Labours of one they eſteem ſuch, and which is more Remarkable, as a true and primitive One too; as if they had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60241:3"/>
been all this while angry with us, <hi>not for being</hi> Quakers, <hi>but for being not True Ones;</hi> which is ſuch a thing, as would make a Body think them to be the Only Right <hi>Quakers,</hi> at leaſt Well-Wiſhers to them; and we but a Pack of <hi>Apoſtates.</hi> O how In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous is this Author of the <hi>Spirit of the Hat!</hi> A fit Title for it; in which there is ſo little Head, or at leaſt no more Brains then in an Empty Hat: and as little Fear of God, and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty towards Men, as could be well found within ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. I ſay, how ingenuous is he to Rail againſt Power, <hi>and Love it;</hi> to decry Authority, and ſeek it; to accuſe <hi>G. F.</hi> for Tyranny, and uſe ſo much in doing ſo; to be Angry, not that there is Rule, but that he has no Share in it; to repute our Cenſure of a Diſturber about ſuch Unprofitable and Unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cuſtoms, as to keep on the <hi>Hat</hi> in publick Prayer, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s <hi>Excommunications,</hi> and to rebuke a Malepert Stickler againſt the Church's Peace, Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patlon and Oppreſſion: But which is rareſt of all, <hi>Independents, Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Sociuians,</hi> are to Hedge their naked Cauſe with this Man's <hi>Feathers,</hi> and his Lyes are to be their Refuge, and 'tis that very <hi>Hat</hi> we would have <hi>off</hi> in Prayer, they deſire to cover their Head within this day of Battel againſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are they ſuch Friends to that Token of Irreverence to God? Will they Spit in our Faces for not pulling off our <hi>Hats</hi> to them, and yet glory in the <hi>Envious Labours</hi> of a Man that denyes it to God himſelf, and therefore cannot be owned of us? Shall we be counted Conceited and Ignorant to forbear that Ceremony to Men; and this Vile <hi>Apoſtate</hi> reputed ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp;c. for making ſo bold with God? What! is it become a Crime in the <hi>Quaker</hi> to perform that ſincerely to his Creator, which is with ſo much Formality every day done by his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers? O Partial! O Unreaſonable and Down-right Impious Generation! who are not only ready to invent, pervert and miſconſtrue us about Matters of Religion; but can take part with an <hi>Apoſtate, a Clamourer, a meer Alexander, Phygellus, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes, Hymenaeus, Philetus:</hi> in ſhort, <hi>a very Mutineer</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to beſpatter us and our Principles in the World; and that becauſe we abhor, renounce, and rebuke with Severity

that Rude Imagination of the <hi>Hat</hi> on in Publick Prayer which did we uſe it, we ſhould be but eſteem'd by you the Worſe, or you go from your own Principles. Nay, is it not unjuſt with a Witneſs, that we ſhould be ſo vehemently de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny'd by ſome, becauſe we Preach not with our Hats off; If yet we muſt be run thus furiouſly down for diſowning a Perſon, <hi>that in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing keeps it on;</hi> Certainly it muſt needs be manifeſt to all the Impartial World, that ſuch procedure is freighted with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Ranker of Malice, Fury and Revenge;</hi> and which is more, with Folly too: They have writ their own Anſwer in their baſe Accuſation, for either they, I mean the <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, buy and diſperſe the Pamphlet, own him for a <hi>Quaker,</hi> or they do not; If not, it is no Diſcredit to us, that he ſhould pretend to be preciſely one, and us to be <hi>Apoſtates:</hi> If he be one; then either a better or a worſe: if a <hi>better,</hi> and that by better is underſtood, more ſeparated from the ſeveral Sects of <hi>Profeſſors;</hi> then behold, how much more kindly they receive a <hi>True Quaker</hi> in his firſt Principles and Practice, then ſuch as they conceive to have Apoſtatized: It would make one think, <hi>that they are no Abettors of thoſe Prieſts and Profeſſors, that writ ſo ſharply againſt them in their firſt Appearance:</hi> If <hi>worſe,</hi> and that by worſe is underſtood apoſtatized, or gone back; then is not his End anſwered, which he pretends was to teſtifie againſt our Apoſtacy, that is, Our Running into <hi>Forms, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> like to other Profeſſions; that is, <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, &amp;c.</hi> and if ſo, I wonder, with what Confidence thoſe Profeſſors dare undertake our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace by it, when at the ſame time that he thinks to render us Odious, <hi>he makes the Reaſon of it to be our becoming like unto them.</hi> Certainly if our <hi>Order, Diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>Church-Authority be Apoſtacy,</hi> we cannot be the only People, that are concern'd in his Meaning. In ſhort, the Matter is ſo ordered, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they venture to urge againſt us, ſtrikes them ſorely. What then can the Profeſſors do in all this Buſle? Why thus much; a Turbulent Spirit is diſowned by the <hi>Quakers:</hi> he contemns their Church-Authority which ſo renounced him: for this he cries; <hi>They are like</hi> Rome, <hi>and are quite Apoſtatized:</hi> and if
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60241:4"/>
ſo, may the ſober Profeſſor ſay, then we are all <hi>Apoſtates</hi> too, it being but what we our ſelves do practiſe, and that frequently.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, There is nothing, that this <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Smith</hi> hath ſaid more Diſgraceful of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> then that the moſt uncorrupted of them ſhould deſpiſe Government <hi>(his own notorious Fault;</hi> and I know not why, unleſs becauſe he is not our Dictator) who under-went, and ſtill do all Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips that befall our Teſtimony; that the Principle of Truth and Righteouſneſs might govern <hi>not only Individuals, but whole Societies.</hi> We ſhall not think our ſelves nor Principles much put to it to vindicate theſe Aſſertions: 1. That we are a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Body. 2. That we have, as ſuch, a Power within our ſelves. 3. That by the Power and Spirit of the Eternal God we have condemned, as well as juſtified many Practices. 4. That being in Holy Peace and Unity, and that Singular Spirit of the <hi>Hat</hi> getting place with ſome, and ſecret Rents, Diviſions, and Animoſities being like to enſue among us, as among the firſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> we did with ſuch other Carriages, as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unbecoming the Bleſſed Goſpel, condemn that of keeping the <hi>Hat</hi> on in time of publick Prayer to Almighty God (to whom alone from a ſenſible Mind we perform that Holy and Due Reverence) as introduced by a ſingular, Conceited and Deceitful Spirit. 5. That the Author of the <hi>Spirit of the Hat, &amp;c.</hi> hath reſiſted many <hi>Loving Treaties, Serious Invitations, and abundance of Good and Wholeſom Advice, for his own Good, and the Church's Peace,</hi> and becauſe he is not owned in that Practice, which, ſhould we, God's Spirit would diſown us in ſo doing: therefore, as a Man enraged beyond all Bounds of not only <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but Manhood, with Folly, Madneſs, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Revenge has he endeavour'd our Ruin among Men. Now that here in he has not ſhown himſelf the <hi>Primitive Quaker,</hi> and great Lamenter of our Apoſtacy, as he pretendeth, may be clearly ſeen, in that he doth endeavour to render the Good as well as Bad among us ſuſpected by thoſe, whom he confeſſeth, cannot have that Diſcerning he hath; and conſequently their Lives and Miniſtry ineffectual; Next, to do it at this time of the Day; What greater Demonſtration of Implacableneſs can
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60241:4"/>
there be, when ſo many are againſt us? and that as <hi>Quakers</hi> in any ſenſe; yea, for owning thoſe Principles, he himſelf aſſerts: their hands are ſtrengthned thereby. <hi>Lamentation; Murder: Mercy; Revenge: our Recovery; our utter Deſtruction:</hi> and nothing below it muſt have been ſought by that Diſcourſe; but it all retorts from our Impenetrable Armour upon himſelf, and he will prove at laſt only to have diſcovered his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs by this Impious Attempt. Whence, if any thing appears, it is this, that becauſe he is indeed gone back from what he was, and we remain what we were, the World, that once perſecuted him, and ſtill doth us, count him now a very White Boy; and I am perſwaded. let him but continue to write againſt us, though a pretended <hi>Quaker,</hi> I dare warrant, they will reckon him a very Good <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this Sort of Unruly Beaſt that the <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> (who themſelves would have caſt him out an Hundred times) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for an <hi>Ingenious Quaker,</hi> though their bare Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him againſt us, were Ground enough to ſuppoſe him either an Impoſture or Renegade, as indeed he is little better; ſince firſt he pretends to be that in Religion which he is not: And ſecondly, that he is ſlipt from what he once was, or at leaſt pretended to be. I will briefly obſerve the moſt weighty things of his Libel, and which indeed comprehend the Whole, and ſo cloſe this Animad verſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>No Liberty out of the Power;</hi> which he compares with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> thus: <hi>No Liberty out of the Church. What! Liberty to the</hi> Sectary? <hi>No. What!</hi>

            <p>His next great <hi>Cavil</hi> is about his <hi>pulling off the HAT at Publick Prayer,</hi> either upon Conviction, or the Judgment of the Body; wherein he tells us, <hi>That not only ſome of us counſell'd, or requir'd him to yield, becauſe the Body would have it; ſaying,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>That was yielding to the Power: But his not ſo yielding, but perſiſting is no Diſſention; but our Diſowning any Perſon for that Cauſe, is a Breach of the Great Goſpel-Charter of Liberty.</hi> Let him deny this to be the Strength of his Book if he can or dare; and which is as ſoon blown away, as the Chaff before the Wind.</p>

            <p>Now it is manifeſt, that this very Perverse and Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Man, when he at firſt came among us, and walkt with us; that he was not in any ſuch Practice. <hi>As keeping on his Hat in time of Publick Prayer;</hi> but believ'd, and in ſome meaſure walked in the Way we profeſs, conformable as we are, and we hope, for Conſcience ſake.

is to be credited, this is ſound Doctrine; If the ſeveral <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> then gathered were not to paſs Judgment, till the <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> were convinc'd of, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd their Miſtake, they had never done it, ſince upon ſuch Conviction &amp; Acknowledgment they ceaſed to be ſuch; unleſs we ſhould believe, that notwithſtanding they were convinced in their Conſciences of their Errors or Diſſentions, they ſtill perſiſted in the Belief of them, which I will not affirm. If then a <hi>Society</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> ſo anointed, as aforeſaid, have that <hi>Power,</hi> We do by Authority thereof, as a <hi>Chriſtian Society,</hi> judge all Perſons concern'd with the Spirit of this <hi>Author</hi> to be thus far led by a Deluſive, Turbulent, Unchriſtian Spirit, which, if once given way to, there is no Imagination ſo Sordid and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, as it would not lead to; and by this will we ſtand in the Day of the Lord, when it will be proved no <hi>Popery,</hi> but <hi>Goſpel</hi> to do ſo with him, and this <hi>Novice</hi> appear a <hi>Wretched Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</hi>

            <p>His Objection, <hi>Were I among you, could I Marry, if an whole Nation, ſince you deny it to Diſſenters from you?</hi> is Childish in every thing but the Malice of it. If all <note place="margin">pag. 13.</note> the World but he were Believers, he might ask the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> that Queſtion, who ſaid, <hi>Be ye not unequally yoak'd together:</hi> It is not the Fault of the Body that he diſſents, but his own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Whimſies. His Suggeſtion, <hi>that we would then deny him a Burial, becauſe we ſhould deny it him alwayes as one of us;</hi> but eſpecially our now Uſurping his Property in a Burial Place, is a down-right Forgery.</p>
            <p>That our <hi>Friends require any Man to practiſe what they are not convinc'd of,</hi> I utterly renounce in their Name, and that as an Infamous Slander. But that we will be <note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> well ſatisfied with any Member's Diſpractice of an orderly Performance, once cheerefully own'd, is alſo true, and moſt reaſonable and orderly.</p>
            <p>That <hi>we Exalt our ſelves</hi> is a Calumny of his making; but we know our Places in the Body. And for his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Every Member is Equal;</hi> it is falſe: For though <note place="margin">Pag. 15, 16.</note> it belongs to the ſame Body, yet not to the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60241:6"/>
ſome are in that ſenſe more Honourable then others. This ſhows an Aſpiring, Diſcontented Mind in him, that where he can't be Superiour, he would be Equal.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, <hi>that with ſorrow hath he ſeen pulling down, haling out, and thruſting forth of our Meetings, and that we went as far as our Power, and wanted only more to puniſh.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But could we do ſo, as he wickedly &amp; falſly ſuggeſts, we ſhould have been perhaps more formidable to our Inſolent, Envious &amp; Perverſe Oppoſers, who come not for Conſcience ſake, or to ſeek Satisfaction, which we ſhall never refuſe, but to Diſturb, introduce a Rabble, beget Laughter, or any thing that might diſquiet our Aſſemblies, and as much as in them lies, render them Unprofitable to the People. If we ever ſo us'd any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Inquirer or Oppoſer, let us know them. It is Baſeneſs it ſelf to ſuggeſt our Ill-uſing of People in general, and none named: perhaps we have refuſed and condemn'd the bawling Oppoſition of ſuch Apoſtate Slanderers as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but we appeal to God's holy Witneſs in all Conſciences, if that has been, or is our Practice, which is inſmuated againſt us, much leſs that his Uncharitable Expreſſion, <hi>If he had Power equal to our Will, we would puniſh,</hi> ſhould have any place; the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the common Adverſary.</p>
            <p>For his ſaying, <hi>that the Miniſters are Ravening Wolves, that prey upon the Flock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Equals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is eaſie with him to Slander, but hard to prove. What one Miniſter ever made a Prey upon this Authors Perſon or Eſtate, let him give us his Name. <hi>If Preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel in ſeaſon, and out of Seaſon, Riſing early, and laying down late, Suffering, Travelling, and Spending and being ſpent in Body and Eſtate, Sacrificing the Joy, Strength, and Pleaſure of their Youth, to the Service of the Living, Eternal God, and the Salvation of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Souls,</hi> if all this makes them Ravenous Wolves of Pray, then hath he rightly denominated them; but if this be Love unfeign'd to God and Men, then will that Righteous Judge certainly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60241:7"/>
reckon with this Apoſtate for all his Slanders and Calumnies againſt his Faithful and Painful Meſſengers.</p>
            <p>For <hi>not being judg'd by the Laity, but their Peers,</hi> as he wickedly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes; be it known to all, That if any ſuch Perſon have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an Injury againſt any of thoſe, who are not exerciſed in the Miniſtry; then as well thoſe as the Miniſtry are proper Judges: but in Caſes that may more ſtrictly concern the Exerciſe of his Gift, it is moſt equal &amp; reaſonable, that ſuch other faithful publick Labourers as may be gotten together with ſome of the more approved among us, whom we can call Elders, ſhould be Judges in the Caſe. But how? Only as they are upon ſerious Waiting to receive Counſel and Wiſdom from God, directed of his Holy Spirit to ſpeak, act, or determine. Now what great Matter of Evil, <hi>Apoſtacy, Popery, Tyranny, Lordlings,</hi> &amp;c. can there be in ſo orderly a Practice? O this Libertine, Ranting Spirit! that therefore hateth us, becauſe we would have it Ruled, Guided and Govern'd with the Curb of Truth; and not under a Pretence of Goſpel-Liberty run out into all Exceſs, in which we have ſome Cauſe to fear this pretended Lamenter hath too deeply involv'd himſelf. True Liberty is not to Commit Sin <hi>Innocently,</hi> as ſome fancy, but to be freed from Sin, which is ever <hi>Nocent,</hi> and will prove deſtructive of all who are ſeduc'd by it.</p>
            <p>Nor is he leſs untrue and unrighteous to us, when he ſayes, <hi>That as others Err'd in ſetting up the Scriptures as the Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Tryal, and Touch-ſtone of Doctrines and Spirits, ſo we do</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 21.</note> 
               <hi>greatly Err in ſetting up the Body above the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no ſuch Doctrine as the Latter maintained among us. It is well known that the Former is by the many Profeſſors, yea thoſe, who boaſt in his Treachery and Lyes; But this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hath been, and ſtill is, and we hope, ever will be our Belief, that no meer Body of People, without the Guidance of God's Spirit, are capable of Determining in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Concernment: For it is not an Hundred Perſons (ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly void of the Holy Spirit) coming together, that makes them any whit more certain in their Judgment. The only and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60241:7"/>
Qualification to that great Work being Diſcoveries and Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit? A Body then, without the Holy Spirit, can be no Touch-ſtone; but a Body, attended with the Holy Spirit, certainly is. The Queſtion then is not. <hi>If we prefer the Body above the Spirit?</hi> for that is the <hi>Falſe Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of this <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> who is inraged, that we ſhould ſo ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, and ſuch Contentious Perſons as he is; But, <hi>Whether we, as a Believing Body have the Holy Spirit, or no?</hi> Of which much hath been ſaid by way of Vindication already in other Tracts; and we ſhall leave it to God's Witneſs in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of thoſe we are concern'd with in Matters of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, whether we are acted by that holy Wiſdom and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which gives true and ſound Judgment. We know we are of <hi>God;</hi> and the World, whether <hi>Apoſtates</hi> or others, that thus withſtand our Teſtimony, are in the Gaul of Bitterneſs, and Bond of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>His Objection, <hi>That the Hat on in Prayer is a Trifle, or of no ſuch moment, as juſtly to occaſion ſuch a Buſle,</hi> makes for us; ſince he can't be other then a Trifler at beſt, for all his high Pretences, who hazards the Church's Peace, gives this Diſturbance, bears this Ill-will, and ſhows that Revenge for a Trifle; 'Twere well if his Conſcience were ſo nice in Caſes of more Weight: I fear he is as well a <hi>Demas</hi> as an <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that <hi>his Cries againſt our Miniſters decent and clean Apparel,</hi> is but a better ſort of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer for his own Ruſty Phariſaical kind of Garb, the Effect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of his fordid Avarice.

            <p>But it is a Wonder to me, that the Coſtly Clothes and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Feaſt (to Exceſs and Deriſion) of that Exalted <hi>J. Penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and his Beloved <hi>Mary Boreman</hi> (who in Token of her Self-Denial, and Attainment to a more excellent Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, exchanged her Cloth Waſte-Coat for a Silk Farendine Gown, her Blew Apron for one of Fine Holland, and her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Bodice for Rich Sattin it ſelf; to ſay little of her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Fine Coaches, and ſeveral other things <hi>(once accounted

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with ſuch Deceit for Shame.</p>
            <p>He ſays, That <hi>we deſert the Light, for the Judgment of the Body;</hi> A wretched Begging of the Queſtion: <note place="margin">pag. 18.</note> We do deny that to be Light in him, which oppoſeth it. <hi>He at other times grants the</hi> Body <hi>has Light, though not ſome Elders:</hi> But the <hi>Body</hi> judgeth him; How will he do then? For him to ſay, he believes the <hi>Body</hi> to be in the Right, and yet ſubject them to his own Conceits, is what deſerves to be diſdain'd of all underſtanding Men. He ſhould have gone to thoſe Elders, and cleared himſelf, if he had ought againſt them, and not place their Miſcarriages (as he thinks) to the Account of the whole Body. Were he any thing of a True <hi>Quaker</hi> (and that he pretends to) he would have abhorred to add thus to their Indeavours, that ſtrike at True as well as Falſe: And if by True is underſtood ſomething more refined then we are, he may be ſaid to add to our Sufferings ſo much the more. What, but a Dark, Envious, Inveterate Man would have done ſuch a thing at any time, but eſpecially at this Juncture and Seaſon?</p>
            <p>Behold the <hi>Hat</hi> now, and what a notable Spirit it affords us; one drop of which, by Antipathy, were enough, one would think, to cure any one, not too far gone in Prejudice and Schiſm! O that all who profeſs the Truth of the Living God, may be kept out of ſuch Temptation, that they may never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> and Quiet of their own <hi>Souls,</hi> to the Introduction or Promotion of any thing ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable, Senſeleſs and Unprofitable both to <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> but Eyeing the Bleſſed Truth in their Inward Parts, may by it be Exerciſed in Body, Soul and Spirit, to all Godly Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among Men; ſo will God be glorified, and they preſerved.</p>
            <p>For his other Stories, Some things are true, &amp; hurt us not, but ſhow our Care to preſerve Unity &amp; Order, though they will the JUDAS, that both reveal'd &amp; augmented them: Other Paſſages

are greatly abuſed, and down-right Lyes told, as before, three of which I cannot forbear to mark out, with a Challenge to prove them, notwithſtanding the following Teſtimonies. Firſt, <hi>That our Miniſtry is Vitious and Wanton, guilty</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 22. 23, 43.</note> 
               <hi>of Whoredoms; and that Strumpets are among them.</hi> This we do in the Name of the Holy God deny, and defie any Man on Earth to prove any part of this Ungodly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Charge againſt our Miniſtry, to ſo much as belong to any one Perſon by us accounted of it: If any ſuch thing be, let the Accuſer, his Witneſſes, and the Accuſed be brought forth, and an Hearing ſhall never be refuſed. But let me ask this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> If ever he knew ſuch a one? If he admoniſh'd him? If upon Continuance in ſuch Ungodly Living he told it to the <hi>Church,</hi> before this Publication of his Ungodly Slanders to the World: If he ſays he did, he adds to his Lyes; be it then True or Falſe in it ſelf, he has done but like a Treacherous <hi>Renegade;</hi> I faſten an Action of <hi>Defamation</hi> upon his Head, and that in the High and Holy Court of Heaven, before God the Righteous Judge, who will avenge the Cauſe of the Innocent upon their falſe Accuſers.</p>
            <p>Next, <hi>That we, with the Papiſts, prefer a Looſe Perſon before a Non-Conformiſt, or ſuch like,</hi> is an horrid Lye. We own, and cannot but cheriſh Sobriety, and a Conſcientiouſneſs to God in all, which we never could Prophaneneſs; but where Men, like the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> have a Shew of Religion, and their Fury hath eaten out their Moderation, inſomuch, as that they are become Envious and Perſecuting, ſuch we ſay are worſe then <hi>Publicans,</hi> as ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers ſhall enter the Kingdom of God before them.</hi> But neither is this the Caſe in hand; for he is far leſs excuſable, who having walked with Upright People, deſerts them, then thoſe Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts that were never of them. <hi>Non-conformity</hi> may be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, but <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> is wilfull diſtorting, and erring from the Faith, Worſhip and Diſcipline of the True <hi>Church:</hi> and as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> turn'd <hi>Turk</hi> is obſerv'd to be moſt Cruel to the Profeſſion; ſo none ſo great Enemies to the Poor <hi>Quakers,</hi> as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60241:9"/>
thoſe who have been reputed of them. The worſt Enemies are thoſe of a Man's own Houſe: 'Twas <hi>Judas</hi> the Diſciple that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd his Lord; and none we hear of, did <hi>Paul</hi> more wrong then <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Copper-Smith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>His Judging their Recantations, that deny'd their former Acts of Diſſention, and gave Teſtimony againſt them to have been done in an hour of Temptation,</hi> is a Lye in it ſelf, and in him high Incharity, and at moſt but a Begging of the Queſtion: I Challenge him to prove it; If he can't, he is a Belyer of God's Convictions upon the Soul. Their profeſt Sincerity and Brokenneſs of Heart, and Contrition of Spirit, had been enough to have Melted any thing but an <hi>Adamantine Alexander the Apoſtate,</hi> who not only was <hi>Bad;</hi> but we never heard that he proved <hi>Good</hi> again; the Doom I fear of this Perverter of the Right Way of the Lord, who will certainly reward him according to his Works. But becauſe I deſign not to be long, nor yet to give an Account to the World of our <hi>Church-Procedure,</hi> nor are we oblieged to it for every nameleſs Accuſer, let this ſuffice to ſhow the Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Revenge both of the <hi>Author</hi> and his <hi>Publiſher,</hi> and their great Inconſiſtency with the Deſigns of each other, and his with ſound Reaſon, Scripture, and Himſelf.</p>

               <p>AS for that part of the <hi>Bemoaning Letter</hi> (ſo called) which doth more particularly concern me, I obſerve this; That the Author under the ſpecious Shew of Pity and Compaſſion to the Oppreſſed, doth traduce me, as well as others; Firſt, <hi>In ſetting me in Oppoſition againſt</hi> John Bolton: Next, <hi>In Inſinuating as if I had been ſo Hipocritical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for Peace ſake to Judge that in Publick, which I Juſtified in Private.</hi> As to the firſt I ſay, There may be between two of one Judgment, through a Miſ-underſtanding of each others Words and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions a ſeeming Oppoſition, and yet really none; and ſo was the Caſe between <hi>J. B.</hi> and my ſelf: For the Intent of my words, and that which anſwered my Judgment, was, That it would not recommend any to us, to judge a Thing for Evil, unleſs they believed it was ſo; but that every one ſhould be left to God's Witneſs in their Conſciences, to Condemn what that condemns, and to Juſtifie what that juſtifies; and not to condemn or juſtifie barely upon the Motion or Judgment of others; which is true, and will ſtand to our Juſtification againſt this Slanderer, who would introduce, <hi>That the Tyranny of our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is ſuch, as to impoſe upon the Weak and Simple that which they cannot believe:</hi> But I being miſ-apprehended, there was an Occaſion to call for the Judgment of the Meeting; for if my words had extended ſo far, as that nothing was to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Evil, unleſs the Guilty Party ſaw it to be ſo, (which is the Principle of the <hi>Ranters,</hi> and not of the People of God called <hi>Quakers)</hi> the Zeal of the Lord might well riſe againſt it, where it was ſuppoſed to be; for that would excuſe all Scared Conſciences, who commit Sin with Greedineſs, and drink up Iniquity, as an Ox drinks Water: But when my Words were repeated, and explained, and the Intent of my Mind ſeen and underſtood, <hi>J. B.</hi> was ſatisfied, and all others, as far as I know. So it appears that I had no Occaſion, neither did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that in Publick, which I Juſtified in Private; and the Falſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60241:10"/>
Accuſation is caſt off, and returned upon the Author. And herein I muſt commend the Care of <hi>J. B.</hi> that he would not have any thing of a Wrong Judgment remain with a Brother.</p>
               <p>And this I have further to add, that though <hi>latet anguis in herba,</hi> yet the Snake is ſeen in the Graſs; and that this twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Serpent hath no place in my Heart, but is forever judged by me, as coming from the Bottomleſs Pit, and thither muſt return; and God's Truth is over all Juſtified, and ſhall ſpread over the whole Earth to his Glory, who has began the Work, and will finiſh it in his Time; and theſe Miſts and Fogs, that do ariſe from the Pit, cannot darken the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who is appeared in the Hearts of a Remnant, and whoſe Glory ſhines, and will ſhine over all, to the fulfilling of that which was propheſied of him in Times paſt, <hi>That God would give him the Heathen for an Inheritance, and the utmoſt Parts of the Earth for a Poſſeſſion.</hi>

the Oyle of Joy, and River of Gladneſs; for the Antient Path, which is Holineſs to the Lord, that was, and is caſt up, and the Joy of many Generations was, and is come, and the Angel of his Preſence that rewarded Diſobedience with Judgment, was known; and his Mighty Arme, that wrought Wonders of old, that was and is with us. And Oh! that the Nations knew this their <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Viſitation!</hi> For of a certain Truth, the Lord God of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hath appeared unto us, and his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is, <hi>He hath ſeen, He hath ſeen the Afflictions of his holy Seed, by reaſon of Sin and Iniquity, and he is come down to deliver out of ſpiritual Darkneſs and Bondage;</hi> Many have been and are the Witneſſes hereof, and are raiſed and raiſing to teſtify thereunto, and their Teſtimony ſhall endure and remain. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as of old, many that have confeſſed to this Teſtimony, have turned aſide, and given heed unto Fables, and forgotten the right Way of the Lord; and many Spirits have riſen up to Stop the Paſſage of this bleſſed Work, and many have turned aſide, and ſome are fallen, as in the Temptations and Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Wilderneſs in <hi>Iſraels</hi> journying toward the bleſſed Land; and as record is made in the Scriptures, of what befel them in their Travels, that Ages to come may hear and fear, and not tempt and provoke the Lord as they did; The ſame in ſome meaſure being in this Age alſo manifeſt, in which I my ſelf was concerned, and ſaw the Snare, and through the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy of the Lord am delivered from, and have often had it in my Heart, to leave it on Record to Ages to come; <hi>Therefore let him that reads underſtand.</hi> When we had ſeen the great Plunges in <hi>Egypts</hi> Land, and had travelled through the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and ſaw the Wonders of the Lord in the Field of <hi>Zoar,</hi> and Sang the Song of his Prayſes upon the Banks of Salvation, and were Travelling on in the Wilderneſs to <hi>Canaan's</hi> Bleſſed Land, we were Proved, Tryed, Tempted and Aſſaulted by many Enemies; and as we kept unto the <hi>Angel</hi> of his <hi>Preſence,</hi> we were kept and preſerved from all Danger; <hi>That was a Pillar of Fire by Night, and a Cloud to cover us from hurt by Day;</hi> and <hi>Angels Food</hi> we knew, and the <hi>Water out of the Rock</hi> we ſaw, and <hi>drank of the River</hi> of his Good Pleaſure; and the <hi>Deſert did rejoyce,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60241:11"/>
and the Wilderneſs did bloſſom as a Roſe:</hi> But after all this we taſted the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Merra,</hi> and through want of Watchfulneſs liked not the <hi>Food</hi> of <hi>Angels;</hi> but deſired other Meat (and Quaile ſell amongſt us) upon which Judgment came; and many fell for Diſobidience, and ſome are yet Monuments of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and ſome yet withſtand their Viſitations. And that none may pretend <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and that <hi>all may be left without Excuſe,</hi> the thing was this: A Spirit aroſe in <hi>John Perrot,</hi> pretending, that the putting off the Hat in prayer was a <hi>Romiſh Tradition,</hi> and that a higher Diſpenſation was to be waited for. This, and much more was aſſerted under a pretence of a <hi>more excellent Way,</hi> accompanied with pretences of a more ſtrickt and mortified Life, which I ſought for; and was grieved, that ſome that made a profeſſion thereof, did not walk anſwerable unto this: in which trouble I, with ſeveral was amuſed and muddled, and not Watching in that, that diſcovers the Enemy in every Appearance, did not underſtand the <hi>working</hi> of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor that <hi>Power</hi> that <hi>withſtood</hi> this Spirit, though often warned thereof by them that <hi>kept</hi> their <hi>Habitations:</hi> For in a <hi>Myſtery</hi> it did wotk, and ſtill doth, and lead many to the <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and Death is its Food: for into prejudice it brought many, that did eat as a Canker, and the Good was not diſcerned; but they were, and ſome yet are as the <hi>Heath in the Deſert, that knows not when good comes.</hi> And the Spirit, that introduced that Practice, is manifeſt; and him by whom it was firſt aſſerted, hath merited in the Hearts of ſeveral the <hi>Appellation</hi> and <hi>Deteſtation,</hi> as of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> that <hi>cauſed many in</hi> outward <hi>Iſrael to Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now as to the Inſinuations by the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Letter,</hi> concerning the Meeting at <hi>Devonſhire houſe,</hi> in which my name is mentioned, and my Caſe ſtated as a grand Proof of the Lordlyneſs and Corruptneſs of the <hi>Second Days Meeting</hi> there, I have this to ſay; I have as often been <hi>refreſhed</hi> and <hi>comforted</hi> in the Good <hi>Preſence</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that there I have <hi>found</hi> and <hi>felt,</hi> as in any <hi>Meeting</hi> I ever was in.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60241:12"/>
nothing againſt; but that the Meeting could not paſſe it as their <hi>Approvement,</hi> I being not in <hi>Unity</hi> with the Meeting as to that matter aforeſaid: So that the <hi>Letter</hi> doth not preſent the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter truly as it was; but in a <hi>prejudiced Spirit</hi> ſtates things, to render the Meeting, and its proceeds odious, both in that and ſeveral other particulars, which I expect others may reply unto.</p>
