            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT On the behalf of William Dockwra, Merch<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Concerning the PENNY-POST.</head>
            <p>WHereas the ſaid <hi>Dockwra</hi> did above Nine Years ſince at his Sole Charge, firſt ſet up, that New and Uſeful <hi>Invention</hi> of the <hi>Penny-Poſt,</hi> ſo univerſally approved, and well known to be a Great and Publick good. He was moſt unjuſtly deprived thereof, by the Power of the late King <hi>James,</hi> when <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> under Colour of Law, and kept out of Poſſeſſion in the late Reigns, without any <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>anner of Reparation to this Day; as appears more fully by his Caſe lately Printed.</p>
            <p>Therefore finding himſelf obliged, for Vindication of his juſt rights, and in orderto the Reparation of his great damages; to make Addreſs to the Parliament for Relief, he did accordingly exhibit his humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, and upon Reading of the ſame there, it was Unanimouſly referr'd to the <hi>Commitee</hi> of the whole <hi>Houſe,</hi> for conſidering the Publick Revenue.</p>
            <p>Soon after ſome Unnamed Perſon, did Print, and Diſperſe a Paper, which he call'd; <hi>An anſwer to</hi> Mr. <hi>Dockwras Caſe concerning the</hi> Penny-Poſt: wherein, by citeing Part only of the <hi>Poſt-Office</hi> Staute, and aſſerting ſeveral untruths, and by frameing a Trvfling Parallel, between the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Penny Poſt</hi> (but leaving out the Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>terial, and Eſſential Parts of the Practice, wherein they are utterly diſagreeable and inconſiſtent) he put the whole Caſe in a Falſe Light, and as much as in him lay, uſed his Talent towards the juſtifying of thoſe Illegal and Arbitrary Proceedings, und<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r which the ſaid <hi>Dockwra</hi> with his Family of a Wife, and Eight Children, have been ſo many Years oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of which Paper, beſpeaking the Author, to be a Man of as little Senſe, as good Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. The ſaid <hi>Dockwra</hi> is well ſatisfied the preſent Governour of the <hi>General-Poſt Office,</hi> had no hand therein; as knowing his Abilities too great, and (believing his Ingenuity and Juſtice) to be far above thoughts ſo low, and attempts ſo malicious.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the ſaid <hi>Dockwra,</hi> had prepared a <hi>Reply</hi> to that pretended <hi>Anſwer,</hi> which he had by him ready to waſh off the Varniſh of that Officious Undertaker, and ſolidly to Evince to the Parliament his Legal Title to this <hi>New Invention</hi> (never known or practiſed in the World before) and to expoſe the wicked many Thouſand Pounds (juſt to bring the <hi>Penny-Poſt</hi> to Perfection) and having Dutifully attended the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> to that End. The Parliament adjourned, before the Revenue was fettled; ſo that the ſaid <hi>Dockwra</hi>'s Caſe came not on to a Hearing this Seſſion, for which Reaſon, he did not think ſit to Print his <hi>Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But finding ſince the Adjournment of the Parliament, the ſame ſort of Papers have been thrown into <hi>Coffee-houſes</hi> and other Places, and Care taken, Induſtriouſly to ſpread falſe reports about Town, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iſſue of the ſaid <hi>Dockwra</hi>'s Petition, which may beget undue Impreſſions.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Dockwra</hi> thinks it Incumbent upon him, to Advertiſe the Publick hereby, that h<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
