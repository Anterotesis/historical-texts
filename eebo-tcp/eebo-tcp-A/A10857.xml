            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>In keeping your promiſe, you haue done well, and ſo well as I can, I will anſwere your demaund: in mine opinion, I think it impoſſible to be a good Muſition, except a man be ſeene in all the ſeauen liberall Sciences, for I know many great clarkes in Diuinitie, Phiſicke, Law, Philoſophie, &amp;c. that haue ſmall, or no knowledge at all in Muſick; nay, ſome that quite reiect it. Now ſith it behoueth a good Muſition to bee ſomewhat ſeene in all Arts, I conclude, that this all (with the help of an od crotchet) is the reaſon why Muſitions are ſo curious.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Trulie ſir, your concluding all, is both ſhort &amp; ſharp, how be it I muſt graunt you this, that it is behouefull a Muſition that would bee excellent, to be ſeene in all or the moſt part of the ſeauen liberall Arts, and ſo neere as I can, I will ſhew you which, and how neceſſarie thoſe are, that a Muſition ought not to be ignorant off. Firſt hee muſt be a diuine, that is, he muſt be diuinelie giuen, he muſt aboue all things ſerue God, that God may bleſſe him, in all his good indeuoures; hee muſt read the ſcriptures, for it is the fountaine of all knowledge, &amp; it teacheth the diuine harmonie of the ſoule of man: for Muſicke is none other then a perfect harmonie, whoſe diuinitie is ſeene in the perfectneſſe of his proportions, as, his vniſon ſheweth the vnitie, from whence all other, (concords, diſcords, conſonancies, or others whatſoeuer) ſpringeth, next his vnitie, his third: (which is the perfecteſt concord that is in all Muſicke) repreſenteth the perfect, &amp; moſt holie Trinitie; his fift, (the moſt perfect conſonance in all Muſicke, for that it is the verie eſſence of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords) repreſenteth the perfection of that moſt perfect number of fiue, which made the perfect atonement, betweene God, and man; His eight, (which as it is, but as his vniſon,) repreſenteth his <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega:</hi> &amp; as what is aboue his eight, is but as a repetition, as from his vniſon, as it were a new beginning; ſo it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our returne from whence we came, as it were, in notes of Muſicke, in a long or ſhort time, ſweet or ſowre compoſition, and thus, (I hope, without offence to that moſt holie <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega)</hi> I conclude, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie of diuinitie in a Muſition. Now that a Muſition ſhould bee a Phiſition, I ſee no ſuch neceſsitie, But that Muſicke is Phiſical, it is plainlie ſeene by thoſe maladies it cureth. As it cureth melancholie; it much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth againſt madneſſe; If a man be in paines of the gout, of any wound, or of the head, it much mittigateth the furie therof: and it is ſaid, that Muſicke hath a ſalue for euerie ſore. But of neceſsitie, a Muſition muſt be a perfect Arethmatition, for that Muſicke conſiſteth altogether of true number, and proportion, and thus, at this ſo cheefe, and neceſſarie ſcience of Arithmaticke, I hould it beſt to ſtay the proceſſe of Muſicke, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the neceſsitie of other than theſe, which I haue mentioned to bee fit in a good Muſition.</p>

               <p>Firſt, you ſhall vnderſtand, that wee terme the fore-finger, and the little finger (of the ſtopping hand) two extreames: for that they be the outmoſt parts thereof; &amp; that in going down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a point, (fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head of the Lute) the point is alwaies begun with the forefinger, as thus: <gap reason="music">

               <p>Yes Sir, that there be: for what auaileth it to ſtop neuer ſo neate, fine and cleane, and if it be flubberd with a bad touch, or ſtroke: therefore, let theſe rules following, be obſerued diligently, without the which, all fine play of the Lute is ſpoild, and nothing worth. Note, that you ſtrike cleane, plump together in a full ſtroke of many parts or ſtrings, ſometimes loude, ſometimes ſoft, letting your right hand, anſwere the left hand at the inſtant, ſtriuing with no ſtroke: and to conclude, the touch of the one hand, to anſwere the ſtop of the other hand, in the full harmony of conſent, (called a <hi>Simpathie,)</hi> and then to know what ſtrings to ſtrike, with what fingers, mark all theſe rules following, and let them not be forgotten.</p>
               <p>You haue heard, that euery ſtrok is more naturally to be ſtriken downeward then vpward, which is very true, but aboue all, the <hi>Baſes</hi> are to be ſtriken downeward, and for the ſame purpoſe, you ſee how aptly the thumb fitteth that office, and likewiſe the fingers remaine as readie to ſtrike vpward and meet the thumbe with their troupes of notes, as who ſhould ſay the one were readie to aid the other; and ſo they bee, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeuerall, one afore the other, as ſometimes firſt the thumbe, and the fingers after, ſometimes the fingers firſt, and the thumbe after, and ſometimes both together, as heere vnderneath you ſee. <gap reason="music">

All theſe reaſons well conſidered, you ſhall finde in them ſuch neceſſitie, ſuch truth, ſuch eaſe, with ſuch content &amp; delight, as you will confeſſe, that it were impoſſible to play well with out the knowledge therof: For true Art maketh hard things eaſie, labour maketh hard things perfect, or (to ſpeake more truely) ready. Now, when you can play vpon the Lute, I will (God willing) ſhew you how your Lute ſhall inſtruct you to ſing; in ſomuch that you may be your owne teacher, and ſaue the charge of a ſinging man, and then what by your skill in playing vpon the Lute, and the knowledge you haue in the prickſong, you may verie eaſilie attaine to play vpon the Viol <hi>de Gambo,</hi> either by <hi>Tabliture</hi> or by prickſong notes. For the carriage of your left hand vpon the Lute, is likewiſe juſtly to be obſerued vpon the baſe Viol, as ſhall bee more plainely declared in his due place after the Lute leſſons.</p>
