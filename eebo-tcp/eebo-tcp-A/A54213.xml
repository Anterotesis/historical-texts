         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OF all the Evils that attend <hi>Controverſie</hi> about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
there is none more odious and provoking
then that of <hi>Miſtating</hi> Principles, and giving <hi>That</hi>
under mens Names to the World for their Doctrine and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which they abhor to believe, much more to aſſert and
divulge to others. And this I hope I may without Offence
add, That to be <hi>Miſrepreſented</hi> hath moſtly been the Lot of
<hi>Truth</hi> in all Ages, and her peculiar Difficulty and Suffering from
the World: For, no ſooner has Almighty God bleſt Mankind
with further Diſcoveries of his heavenly Will and divine Helps
to perform it, then ſome or other, and thoſe not a few, have

and Abetters of it; nor have thoſe Adverſaries been of the
Rabble, Men of no Letters, Education or Pretence to Religion,
by no means; much the contrary, the Learned Crew, the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> that great Corporation of Religion; it hath been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſuch, the <hi>Chemarims,</hi> men of the Black Robe, that
from a Pretence to greater Knowledge then others, an Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in the Studies of Divinity, a peculiar Warrant and
Miſſion, with the Countenance of Worldly Authority, have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60240:3"/>
uſed their Skill and employed their Abilities to traduce Truth,
and ſtigmatize her Followers, expoſing both to the Fury or
Mockery of the World: tell me when this fell out otherwiſe,
and allow me Scripture Story but to be true and ſacred.</p>
            <p>I pretend not now to write an <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> no not to epitomiſe
that which is already writ, nor need I, for the Caſe is evident;
but becauſe Examples are ſo ready, I will inſtance in him that
ſaid, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life:</hi> One while the

Cuſtoms, and then he was a <hi>Deſpiſer of</hi> Moſes, <hi>a Breaker of
the Law, one that made void the Traditions of the Fathers:</hi>
Another while, <hi>he was a Mean Fellow, but a Carpenter's Son;</hi>
and what Man of Quality would follow him? or who would
make a Meſſiah of a Mechanick? or a Saviour of ſo ſervil
an Off-ſpring? But when this would not do, then he was a
<hi>Samaritan, and had a Devil, and caſt out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub
<hi>the Prince of Devils;</hi> thereby rendring his Perſon hateful to
the <hi>Jews,</hi> that refus'd all Commerce with the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and
his Wonderful Works ſuſpected of a Diabolical Power, leſt
the People ſhould believe in him: But this Trick failing, and
the People believing, leſt any of Note ſhould be taken with
him, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ling out, <hi>that he was a very Idiot, one that knew not
Letters; and that none followed him but thoſe that are curſed,
and know not the Law,</hi> the Rabble, the Vulgar and Illiterate
People: But when this Stratagem ſucceeded not to leſſen his
Reputation, and queſtion his Pretences, they bruted up and
down, that for all his pretended Perfection, <hi>he was a Looſe
Perſon, a Wine-bibber, a Companion of Publicans and Sinners,</hi>
not fit to be the Leader of a Strict Sect, nor qualified for ſo
Glorious a Work as that of the Meſſiah's. God ſtill blaſting
their Deſigns, and the People flocking after him, admiring his
Doctrine, his Authority, his Wiſdom and his Miracles, the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Council of Doctors and Rabbies roundly accuſe him
of <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and have the Confidence and Cruelty to ſeek
his Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> telling <hi>Pilate,</hi> that <hi>They have a Law, and by their Law he
ought to Dye;</hi> but <hi>Pilate</hi> ſcrupling the Matter, and finding
their Proofs ſhort, faints in their Buſineſs, which they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,

with one loud Cry, as if it were a Dare to <hi>Pilate</hi> to deny

hoping though <hi>Pilate</hi> would not concern himſelf with their Laws
and Cuſtoms, yet that being <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Deputy and Officer, he
would not ſuffer any man to live that was a declared Enemy
to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Government; and they had their End.</p>
            <p>Nor did his <hi>Diſciples</hi> fair better, who were accounted <hi>Enemies
to the Law &amp; Scriptures, Seducers, Deceivers of the People, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

Promiſes, Adoption,</hi> and if we will take their word for
it, <hi>Children of God, in Bondage to none;</hi> though its not to be
doubted but that they were by Nature <hi>Heathens,</hi> and for all
their great Profeſſion <hi>Infidels</hi> in ſpirit, and great Slaves to Sin,
and Children of the Evil One all this while. Now, this has
been our Caſe, who are in Reproach called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, we muſt honeſtly and plainly confeſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
almighty God and all Men, that we have been of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Maſs of Mankind, and had our Converſation in the times
paſt, in the Vanities, Pleaſures, Sports and Luſts of this World,
living in ſome reſpect without God and Chriſt in the World
(though under a Profeſſion both of God and Chriſt, as
the moſt Part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> (ſo called) do at this Day;) and
in this dead Eſtate to the living Senſe and Enjoyment of God
and Chriſt in our Souls, the Lord viſited us, and by his own
convincing and reproving Light, Power and Spirit hath he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned
us, and brought us to behold him, whom we under all
our Profeſſion, of Religion, had more or leſs grieved and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with our vain Thoughts, Idle Words, and unholy Actions,
and to Sorrow with <hi>true godly Sorrow,</hi> and be in <hi>unfeigned Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,</hi>
as for our firſt born or our only Child, the Lord thus
redeeming us through his holy Rebukes and Judgments from
an evil Converſation, and converting us to himſelf by his own
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60240:4"/>
Righteous Law in our Hearts. And when it had pleaſed God
thus to rouſe us out of our carnal Security, and fire our Houſe of
empty Profeſſion about our Ears, and open the Books of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and call us to Judgment, kindling his holy Terrors in
our Hearts, becauſe of our paſt Converſation, that had been
in the vain and ſinful Faſhions and Cuſtoms of the World, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
God our Father, and not born of him, and Chriſt Lord,
and not by his holy Spirit, neither had taken up his daily Croſs,
to the ſlaying of our own Wills and carnal Affections, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the great Profeſſion that we in Words made of
him and the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> we came to ſee that true
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was another Thing then the World apprehended,
and that as he was no more a <hi>Jew</hi> that was one outward, <hi>ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was he a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>that was one outward, but he was a true</hi>
Jew <hi>and</hi> Chriſtian <hi>that was one inward, whoſe Praiſe is not of
Men, but of God;</hi> in this Zeal that God had begotten in us for
his own living Way, the ſpiritual Circumciſion, the right
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> namely, <hi>To be Chriſt like, to do the Will of God
in Earth as it is done in Heaven, to live unſpotted from the World,
and no more we to live, rule and order, but Chriſt, that liveth in
us, which is to have eternal Life abiding in us.</hi> In this godly
Zeal, I ſay, for this pure and living Way, we frequently te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
to all People what God had done for us, where he found
us, what he diſcovered to us, what he condemned us for, what
he redeemed us from, and what he had brought us to, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommending the Light of Chriſt within, that manifeſts
the Mind of Chriſt unto them, vehemently decrying the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Profeſſion they worſhip God, the eternal Spirit in, and
ſhewing to them a more excellent Way, becauſe a more pure
and ſpiritual Way; manifeſting to them how that they called
Chriſt their Lord, and did not obey him, their Saviour, and
were not ſaved from Sin by him; yea, how they magnify'd him
in the Hiſtory, and crucify'd him in the Myſtery, warning them
of their carnal Faith, Hope and Security they lived in, which
cleanſed not their Conſciences from dead Works, nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the vain and wicked Spirit of the VVorld, particularly
exhorting them to turn away from their hireling Teachers, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60240:4"/>
had cauſed them to err, who though they ſay'd, <hi>Thus ſaith the
Lord,</hi> the Lord never ſpoke by them, and God ſaid of old,
ſuch <hi>ſhould not profit the People,</hi> who fed and clothed themſelves
of the Flock, but had no heavenly Bread, no green Paſtures,
no pure Fountain to feed and refreſh the Flock with; and that
all ſhould learn of the Lord, that teacheth his people himſelf
by his own good Spirit in their inward Parts, according to
the Tenure of his ſecond and everlaſting Covenant, <hi>that they
turn not again unto Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this Teſtimony ſake hath the Devil raged, and plotted
our Ruine ever ſince we have been a People, now like a Lyon,
then like a Lamb; one while in the Appearance of a Serpent,
another while in the Shape of a Dove; but the Lord God Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah
hath kept us hitherto, none of his Weapons hath yet
proſpered, and 'tis our Faith none even ſhall; for our Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is in him whom the Winds and Seas obey.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they tell us of our Novelty, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did Chriſt;
Abraham <hi>was before thee,</hi> ſay the <hi>Jews; Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I am,</hi>

Rewards and Puniſhments;</hi> and which is yet further
obſervable, as it fared with or deareſt Maſter and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
then. The <hi>Scribes, Phariſees, Saduces, Galileans,</hi> &amp;c. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
juſt before to devour one another, immediately united and
combined to oppoſe, traduce, trap and enſnare them; ſo has
it fallen out with us; for the Hand of every party hath been
lifted up againſt us; I ſcarcely know one that is under any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Notice in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> (however violent and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable
among themſelves) that hath refuſed that common
League and Confederacy, or that hath not by ſome or other of
its principal Agents vigorouſly, if not ſcornfully and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
decry'd and oppos'd us, yet are we alive and a people,
bleſſed be the Name of the Lord; this leads me to ask the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
why did they ſo uſe our bleſſed Lord and his Diſciples?
the Anſwer is eaſie, <hi>Becauſe they ſaw him not, they knew
him not, nor his Followers as they were; they had loſt their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Savour,</hi> and profeſſed the VVords and Sayings of <hi>Moſes</hi>
and the Prophets, not in their Life and Spirit; and I can give
no other Reaſon why we are ſo little known to the World of
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> in our Age, then that they hold generally the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
profeſſion out of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nature, Life and Spirit; for we are
the moſt miſ-underſtood and miſtaken of people, whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that our <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> of every Party have charged us with
Doctrines and Principles not of our owning, but their own Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
if not Inventing, which is worſe; 'twere too tedious
to enumerate all their Attempts: there are not leſs, I believe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60240:5"/>
then One Hundred Books extant, two thirds of the moſt of
them are Imagination, Romance, Fiction, and no Judgment
or Doctrine of ours. This is Notorious by our Anſwers:
and I hope every man's word is to be taken about what his own
Faith is, though not in the Proof of his Faith, to be a True
Faith.</p>
            <p>Of later Times, two Perſons have excelled in this Way of
Oppoſing us, <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> and <hi>John Faldo;</hi> they are both
Anſwered, according to their reſpective Tracts; and their
further Defence remaineth hitherto unattempted by any.</p>
            <p>'Tis with a Paſſage in my Anſwer to <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s firſt Book that
this ſame <hi>I. C.</hi> ſtiled, <hi>A Miniſter of the Goſpel,</hi> and a <hi>Skirmiſher</hi>
too, offers at an Encounter. I queſtion not his Courage ſo much
as his Skill; he ſhows Will enough, but his Abilities fail him: I
am willing to perſwade my ſelf, that he is more <hi>Novice</hi> then
<hi>Souldier</hi> in this War, and that this is rather a Spurt of Heat,
then a Deliberate Action; for, Wiſe Men count their Coſt,
Fools only invade without Force: I hope he will not be angry
with me for this Opinion of him; I am ſure he ought not, if
he be a <hi>Miniſter of the Goſpel;</hi> I know not how he will take
it as a <hi>Skirmiſher,</hi> an Employment of ſo different a Nature;
but certain it is, that Miſtake is more pardonable then Malice,
and Ignorance excuſable then Fiction: I would not willingly
fall upon him with thoſe ſevere Terms, and put him upon that
Difficulty I have been conſtrained to treat others with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to; I would chuſe rather to inform then chide him;
only I muſt tell him, that he is fallen into the Road of as great
and arch a Perverter of our Writings and Sayings, as any
Enemy that ever appear'd againſt us, and improved his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
upon us, by as many Foul, Impious and Deteſtable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
(even to a <hi>Tautology)</hi> as that of any other Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
hath done, which would make one think, that there was
more of Deſign then Accident, and Premeditation then Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency
in the Buſineſs. Be it as it will, the Man pretends to
be offended at me, &amp; endeavours to make others offended too,
'Tis highly fit as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-man, that I do my beſt to remove
the Reaſon of it, and that I ſhall, by the Help of Almighty God.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60240:6"/>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I will ſet down that Paſſage of mine, which he
makes the Reaſon of writing his Pamphlet, &amp; annex ſome of the
Conſequences he draws from my words, by which he would
render them and me Odious to his Reader, and then fall to my
Defence, which will not be difficult, and I hope not tedious to
my ingenuous and inquiring Reader.</p>
            <p>No Command in the Scripture is any further obliging upon
any man, then as he finds a Conviction upon his Conſcience—It
is Conviction that can only oblige to Obedience—When any man
is convinced, that was commanded another, is required of him,
then, and not till then he is rightly authorized to perform it.</p>

            <p>That this Poſition opens the Flood-gate to all Error, Atheiſm,
Impiety and Wickedneſs; and that it is the Overthrow of all
Law and Government, <hi>p.</hi> 2 That ſins of Ignorance are no ſins;
for all Conviction is by Knowledge—that this juſtifies Paul<hi>'s</hi>
Blaſphemy and Perſecution, and groſs ſins againſt the Goſpel,
becauſe he did it ignorantly, <hi>p.</hi> 3. It juſtifies all Erronious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Practical Miſapprehenſions, and whatever Vices lie
in the Vnderſtandings of men—<hi>Penn's</hi> Poſition doth juſtifie the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, the <hi>French</hi> Maſſacre, the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution,
the Ten Perſecutions of the Primitive Churches, the Gunpowder
Treaſon, <hi>Judaiſm, Mahometaniſm, Paganiſm, Popery,</hi> and
all Erroneous Sects and Parties in the World, with all their Falſe
Principles and Practices. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It is Life Eternal to
know God and Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> John 17. 3. <hi>Penn</hi>'s Poſition ſaith,
If you are ignorant and unconvinced, no Law can lay hold on
you, if you be deluded, and practiſe according to the Conviction
of your deluded Mind you are warranted by the Command of God,
which do all center in Conviction, <hi>p. 4. Again,</hi> If this Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60240:6"/>
be true, then Conſcience and Conviction is God; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Conſcience ſayes, muſt be done, be it right or wrong; and
it lies in the power of Conſcience to make void all the Laws of
God, and to do what it pleaſeth—It will alſo follow, that he
is the moſt free from Sin who hath the moſt feared Conſcience, and
that the ready Way to Obedience and Salvation, is to debauch and
ſear the Conſcience—If Conviction be the Ground of Obedience
and the Authority of Scripture depend upon the Rectitude and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Conſcience, then all Rational Laws, Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both divine and human, are overturned, and a ſtop is put to
all Religion and Piety towards God, to all Conſcience, Honeſty
and Charity towards Men—So Princes and Rulers may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and make never ſo good Laws, Conſcience may come and
ſay, I deny all theſe Laws, and the Maker of them; Children
may refuſe to obey Parents; Servants, Maſters, and Inferiour
Superiours; if Conſcience ſhall be unconvinced, and if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
Subjects, may murder their Princes; Children, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
Servants, their Maſters; one Man, another; there can be
no Law, but Conſcience, and whatſoever Conſcience ſayes muſt
ſtand, <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6—The <hi>Quakers</hi> Conſcience ſayes one Thing,
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> another, the <hi>Pagans,</hi> the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi>

Thing which obligeth to Duty, <hi>p. 6, 7. Theſe with Abundance
more of the like Nature are the Conſequence he rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows
upon, then draws from my Words, as particularly he
hath laid them down; pray hear his Farewel after ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and virulent Skirmiſh,</hi> I would be glad to make the beſt of your
Poſition, but I muſt profeſs my Conſcience and Conviction, <hi>p.</hi> 13,
I refer my ſelf and what I have here writ to Impartial Cenſure,
warning and entreating all People, as they love their Souls to take
heed of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi>—Keep your Poyſon to your ſelf, and none will
periſh by it but your ſelf; but if you will needs vend it, and in the
View of the Nation, and ſuch at leaſt as know the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue,
ſet up a Poſition ſubverting all Religion, Law and Government,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60240:7"/>
and levelling all holy and profitable Rules and Commands to Mens
Luſts, leaving no Man in the World under any Obligation, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Duty to God or Man, further then he is convinced in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
be it known to you, that Jeſus Chriſt hath his Servants
abroad, to bear Teſtimony for him againſt ſuch <hi>GOD-BLAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHEMING
AND SOUL-DAMNING ERRORS;</hi> and
if you repent not, this that I have written ſhall riſe up in Judgment
againſt you, and ſhall be an Aggravation of your Miſery in that
Day.</p>
            <p>Prepare to anſwer the righteous Judge, if your Conſcience be
blinded and ſeared now, it will be open and awaken then.</p>
            <p>This Reader concludes his two Sheets of <hi>Skirmiſh</hi> upon me:
But by the way, it ought to ſound very ſtrangely to my Reader,
<hi>that a man ſhould profeſs Conſcience and Conviction for this long
Anathema againſt Conſcience and Conviction:</hi> But by that time
he is as well acquainted with theſe ſort of men as I am, he
will leave off wondring that ſuch men contradict themſelves;
indeed they live by it.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall I do or ſay to this <hi>Goliah?</hi> Behold the <hi>Spoil</hi>
of his <hi>Skirmiſh!</hi> He has invaded my <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul, Religion</hi>
and <hi>Life;</hi> theſe he thinks he leads away in Tryumph after him;
for I am (if he may be believed) by my Doctrine an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> a <hi>Traytor,</hi> a <hi>Regicide,</hi> a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racide,</hi>
a <hi>Murderer</hi> of my <hi>Kindred</hi> and <hi>Neighbours,</hi> a <hi>Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of all Government Divine and human,</hi> and a <hi>common Enemy
to Mankind, unfit for this World, and for Heaven in the next,</hi>
unleſs I repent, which ought to be very queſtionable to ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and impious a Wretch, as this pretended Miniſter of the
Goſpel in his <hi>Skirmiſh</hi> hath been pleaſed to render me; what
remains, but that the Dogs or the Lyons devour me, the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or Government ſacrifice me? I am only fit for <hi>Prey,</hi> if this
be true; what now ſhall I do, Revile him? <hi>by no Means;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
my ſelf by a bitter and invective Anſwer? <hi>no ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
but may not I be angry with him? <hi>not a Jot;</hi> what then?
<hi>Pity and Inform him, though a Parſon;</hi> I think ſo too; wherefore
overlooking all ſuch Provocations, I begin and proceed in this
Method.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60240:7"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I cannot but take it very ill, in Caſe I were unſound
in any one Doctrine, not through Inadvertency, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
and premeditately, that he without any further Search or
unqueſtionable Proof, ſhould fault and impeach the Way I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
and upbraid an entire People with my Miſtake; I ask if
this be the VVay to perſwade me that he is a true Miniſter of
the Goſpel, one that is zealous to promote the Commandments
of God, that in doing this hath broke <hi>That</hi> of loving his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as himſelf, and doing unto others as he would have them
do unto him; <hi>William Penn</hi> holds a groſs Error, <hi>therefore the
People call'd</hi> Quakers <hi>and the Way they profeſs muſt be skirmiſh'd
upon with the foul Names of Murderers, Rebels, Traitors, Atheiſts,
Hereſie, Blaſphemy, &amp;c.</hi> What Part of <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy</hi>
is this? none I think, I am ſure there is neither Law nor Goſpel
for it; but 'tis too frequent with many to live in the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of thoſe Commandments they verbally admire, even then
when they are pleading for them.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, I muſt needs obſerve to him his Diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
in telling me, <hi>He would be glad to make the beſt of my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi>
after he had manifeſtly made the worſt he could, his two
Sheets being ſtuft with the moſt abominable Conſequences it
had been poſſible for any Man to invent or aggravate againſt
me; this ſeems to be a Degree beyond Ignorance, and looks
very ſcurvily for a Man of his Function and Pretences, <hi>Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing</hi>
laid aſide.</p>
            <p>But that which weighs the moſt with me to ſuſpect my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Adverſary</hi> of unfair Dealing (to let ſuch Words as Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſlip for this Time) is his taking my Matter to Pieces, clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Sentences, and dropping that by the Way, which read
with the reſt would in my Apprehenſion have defended the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
from the Poſſibility of any reaſonable Exception. Shall four
Lines and an half of a Book of above 250 Pages, and thoſe
cull'd too out of three ſeveral Places, reprobate the Book, the
Author, his Religion, and the Body of People he relates to?
I hope he has ſo much Conſcience and Conviction left upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Thoughts (if for my ſake he is not out of Charity with
both) as to condemn this Sort of proceeding with us; but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60240:8"/>
perhaps he will tell me, I make too much of it, and that it was
but a Skirmiſh; if ſo, then no Battail or ſolid Encounter of both
Armies, and if not, how come we and our Religion to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
and taken in his Apprehenſion; doubtleſs this muſt go
but for a Vapour, and proves the Parſon more a Man of his
Words then of his Deeds.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all the Ground of my Jealouſie, for unleſs he had
met with my Book by Accident, and had caſt his Eye only on
thoſe three Places, not reading what went before, came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,
or followed after, (a thing ſcarcely poſſible) and upon
that tranſcient Notice had ſally'd forth, and skirmiſh'd upon me
(a Raſhneſs no Man in his Wits would be guilty of) or
that when he had fallen ſo patly on thoſe three places, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſee no more for Fear of being better informed, a Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
greatly unbecoming a Man of his Pretenſions, it muſt
and will follow, that he did knowingly and on Purpoſe omit
both giving his Reader the Reaſon of this Part of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
between me and <hi>John Faldo,</hi> and my Senſe at large in
Defenſe of our firſt Poſition; which done, would have ſav'd
him the Trouble and Danger of a <hi>Skirmiſh,</hi> and me the preſent
Pains of giving him this <hi>Repulſe.</hi> And here I entreat the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
Patience for a little Digreſſion, if yet it be one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Faldo</hi> writes a Book call'd <hi>Quakeriſm No Chriſtianity;</hi>
in it he charges the People call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> with ſeveral errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Principles, whereof one is in general Terms, <hi>That we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Scriptures,</hi> upon this he beſtows 9 Chapters. One of them
is taken up with this Title, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>affirm the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
Commands, Promiſes and holy Examples expreſſed in
Scriptures, as ſuch, not to be at all binding upon them.</hi> To this
Book I return'd my Anſwer, entituled, <hi>Quakeriſm a New
Nick Name for Old Chriſtianity;</hi> I follow him Chapter by
Chapter in my Courſe, I undertake him upon this Head. To
prove his Charge he produces a Paſſage out of <hi>Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>'s
Writings, much at the ſame Rate that this <hi>Adverſary</hi>
quotes me, and ſuch Harmony they hold, that they fall both
upon the ſame Conſtruction of us, as if they had compared
Notes, or had abuſed us by Inſtinct. This I complain of in my
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60240:8"/>
Anſwer to <hi>J. F.</hi> how comes <hi>J. C.</hi> to make the ſame falſe Step,
and yet have read that Anſwer; <hi>E. Burroughs</hi>'s Words were
theſe, as cited by <hi>J. F. That is no Command of God to me, what
he commanded to another; did any of the Saints which we read
of act by the Command which was to another, not having the
Command to themſelves</hi>—This <hi>J. F.</hi> improves at the ſame
Rate that <hi>J. C.</hi> doth mine, to wit; <hi>That it opens a Way to all
Lewdneſs and Impiety, and hath all Iniquity in the Womb of it,</hi>
extending theſe Words to all Laws, which (as I make appear in
my Anſwer, however overlookt by this Man) were limited by
<hi>E. B.</hi> and me to <hi>Temporary and extraordinary Caſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had <hi>J. F.</hi> been quiet here, I could have hoped that he had
both ſeen and ſorrowed for his Miſtake; but he perſiſts in his
horrid Abuſe of <hi>E. B.</hi> and begins at the ſame Rate with me for
defending him; This is in his <hi>Vindication</hi> of his former Book,
to which I <hi>Rejoyn</hi> at large in Defenſe of my Anſwer, reſume
the Controverſie entirely, diſtinguiſh of his Fallacies and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations,
and aſſert and maintain our own Principles,
confirming them with ſome Hundreds of reputed Authorities,
as well of former as more modern Ages. In this Diſcourſe
(hitherto unattempted by any) I make a further Defenſe of
<hi>E. B</hi>'s and my own Senſe from <hi>J. F</hi>'s Miſ-conſtruction, which
it had become this pretended Miniſter of the Goſpel to have
conſulted, before he had engaged himſelf upon ſo ſtrange a
<hi>Skirmiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Injury done me may more diſtinctly appear, I ſhall
here ſet down once more (I hope without Offence to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
the preſent Parſon's Text, not his Sermon, that's too
tedious.</p>
            <p>—No Command in the Scripture is any further obliging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Man, then as he finds a Conviction upon his Conſcience—It
is Conviction that can only oblige to Obedience—When
any Man is convinced that what was commanded another is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him, then, and not till then he is rightly authorized to
perform it.</p>
            <p>I omit to mention his Comment; but every Thing that is

vicious, prophane and diabolical he makes to follow upon thoſe

NO COMMAND IN THE SCRIPTURE IS

Thus far goes my <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> and I hope far enough to defeat

Field; I will not abound in my own Senſe, but ſhall leave

and extraordinary Nature, which are both by <hi>J. F.</hi>
and <hi>J. C.</hi> ſo odiouſly relented and improved, even to all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm
and Impiety.</p>
               <p>But for further Satisfaction to my Reader and to compleat
this Adverſary's Defeat, I will ſuppoſe him making this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
and Objection, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I grant that both</hi> J. F. <hi>and my ſelf have unworthily wrong'd</hi>
E. B<hi>'s Words and Senſe, and</hi> W. Penn<hi>'s too, as to the main ſcope
of the Controverſie, believing they intended what they ſaid, not
of all the Commands of God, and I am willing to let go the laſt of
the three Paſſages I cite in my Pamphlet,</hi> viz. <q>When any Man
is convinced that what was commanded another is required
of him, then, and (not till then, he is rightly authorized to
perform it, <hi>believing this related to extraordinary Caſes;</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi> but
I am yet diſſatisfied with the other two Paſſages ſtill,</hi> viz. <q>No
Command in the Scripture is any further obliging upon any
Man, then as he finds a Conviction upon his Conſcience—It
is Conviction that can only oblige to Obedience.</q>
                  <hi>I ſtill believe that all thoſe horrid Conſequences I skirmiſht him
with, are due to that Doctrine:</hi> What more can <hi>J. C.</hi> ſay for
himſelf then this Objection imports? I ſhall now defend my
Words, as he hath laid them down, from any ſuch Inferences
as he has given in their Name.</p>
               <p>To make my <hi>Anſwer</hi> clear, it is to be conſider'd; firſt,
<hi>What is that Conſcience I mean;</hi> next, <hi>What the Conviction, and
by whom given,</hi> which underſtood, corrects his Folly (to ſay
no worſe) and ends the Debate with his Defeat.</p>
               <p>To ſay nothing here of the various Definitions that are of
Conſcience, nor is it ſo proper, for the Queſtion is about what
Conſcience, I ſhall keep to the Diſtinction in Scripture; the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60240:16"/>
Scripture mentions two Sorts of Conſcience, a Good and an
evil Conſcience; the Queſtion will be, which I meant; if the
laſt, as ſayes <hi>J. C.</hi> I am gone; if the former, he is routed; not
the latter, ſay I, for two Reaſons, the one, becauſe a wicked
ſeared Conſcience, as ſuch, rejects all Conviction, the
other, becauſe I have particularly declared againſt <hi>I. F.</hi> that
ſpoke not of any ſuch Conſcience; nay, I have excepted and made
Proviſion againſt any ſuch Conſtruction in my very <hi>Anſwer;</hi>
ſo to take and render me then is injurious. But if I meant it
of a corrected, rightly qualified Conſcience, ſuch as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom. 2. 14, 15. that bear Witneſs in the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<hi>to the Work of the Law of God writ in their Hearts,</hi> then
it will follow, that this Skirmiſher is beſide the Saddle, and
hath ſhouldered himſelf out of the Point.</p>
               <p>But next, what is Conviction that obliegeth? is it Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
only? or a <hi>Diabolical Suggeſtion to kill, rob, lye, &amp;c.</hi>
as ſayes <hi>I. C.</hi> no ſuch Matter, but a clear Underſtanding and
ſound Judgment, and upon right Concluſions, from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of the Light, Grace or Spirit of God, that attends
all People whoſe Day is not over for their Conviction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to God; this I do verbally provide for in my <hi>Anſwer</hi>
and <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to <hi>I. Faldo,</hi> yet hath J. C. ſo ſtrangely render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both me and my Aſſertions therein; certainly this Man is
the greateſt of <hi>Novie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> in our Controverſie and Religion, or
incomparably baſe; for either he ſuppoſeth that we do not
hold, <hi>That all Men are enlightned with a meaſure of ſaving
Light ſo as that Men cannot plead ignorance of what is fit for
them to do,</hi> which is our known Principle, and he confeſſeth
it, <hi>p.</hi> 13. or that if he doth ſo know, he muſt admit that this
divine Light is idle and inſufficient to convince People; or
<hi>laſtly,</hi> believing neither, he doth very ill to tell the World in
our Name, that we make <hi>debauched and ſeared Conſciences our
Rules of Obedience to Salvation,</hi> and ſubject the Laws of God
and Man to the Acknowledgment of ſuch depraved Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and
where the Law is not known, there is no Law; now <hi>I. C.</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60240:16"/>
would have us believe, <hi>p.</hi> 8. &amp; 9. that the very
Ten Commandments,<note place="margin">p. 8. &amp; 9.</note> as well as the Sayings of
Chriſt, and Writings of his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are ſo ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and myſterious, that carnal Men, as ſuch, cannot know
them, no not ſo much as to underſtand what God mans when
he ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> Now if this Tale be true, what's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of J. C. for if the Scrpiture ſayes <hi>Where there is no Law,
there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and Reaſon aſſures us, <hi>that where a
Law is not known, there is no Law,</hi> and that J. C. <hi>tells us,
that no Man that is not ſpiritual can know God's Law and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
even when they are publiſht,</hi> and that the Spirit of God
only gives the ſpiritual Knowledge of them; will it not una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
follow, <hi>That no Command obligeth without Conviction,</hi>
ſince no Command tyes without Knowledge, <hi>which is Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
ſayes J. C. <hi>p.</hi> 3. yet again the whole Bible J. C. receives for
Truth, either by <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Revelation,</hi> both which Wayes
require Conviction; for if he goes upon the Foot of <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
he muſt be ſatisfied in his Conſcience that thoſe who writ,
divulged, preſerved and recommended it have not put any
Trick or <hi>Abuſe</hi> upon him, which is Credit upon a Sort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction;
if he embraceth the Bible upon the Revelation and
Teſtimony of the Spirit in himſelf (the old <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Plea) that is
not poſſible without Conviction, for Evidence is Knowledge, &amp;
Knowledge Conviction; and if I muſt have the Conviction of
God's Spirit for the whole, I muſt have it for the Parts; and
therefore <hi>no Command in Scripture is any further obliging upon
any Man then as he finds a Conviction upon his Conſcience;</hi> the
contrary makes God a very hard Maſter; for 'tis to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſay, that
he reaps where he hath not ſown, that his Laws are not binding
where they are not known, and that he requires an Obedience
without giving Men the Underſtanding of their Duty: again,
they are Chriſt's own Words, <hi>I will ſend the
Comforter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 7, 8.</note> or rather <hi>Advocate unto you, and
when he is come, he will convince the World of
Sin.</hi> I demand if the Conviction of the Spirit is not here made
the Rule of Judgment and Practice.<note place="margin">Chap. 15. 24.</note> Again,
<hi>If I had not done among them the Works that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60240:17"/>
none other man did, they had not had Sin;</hi> here Conviction goes
before Sin, and that makes Death follow Sin: <hi>For the Wrath

                  <hi>who hold
the Truth in Vnrighteouſneſs, becauſe that
which may be known of God is MANIFEST IN THEM,
for God hath SHEWED it unto them.</hi> So the
Prophet,<note place="margin">Mic. 6. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath SHEWED unto thee O Man
what is good. And upon whom doth not his Light

                  <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 5. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>In him was Life, and the Life the Light
of Men; that was the true Light which LIGHT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETH
EVERY Man that cometh into the World. For it is a

                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>but ALL THINGS
THAT ARE REPROVED are made

Salvation hath APPEARED unto ALL Men, teaching
us, that denying Vngodlineſs and VVorldly Luſts we ſhould live

                  <hi>and knoweth all Things; Beloved, if our

nor <hi>Soul-damning</hi> Error (as ſays J. C. <hi>p. 14.)</hi> to affirm
that there is no Obligation without Conviction, nor Duty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

dedicate Temples to an unknown God? and
lay it down for an Axiom of Divinity, That Men ſtand oblig'd,

and clear the Juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>No doubt in the leaſt, and a Seaſonable <hi>Peccavi</hi> for what he
has done, for, how wide is this off what I have ſaid, of which
I. C. has ſaid ſo very ill? I ſay, <hi>No Command is obliging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Conviction;</hi> I. C. ſaith, <hi>No Command is obliging without
Conviction, provided he doth not hinder his own Convincement.</hi> As
if I ſtated it, that <hi>Let men ſhut their Eyes, ſtop their Ears, rebel,
blaſpheme, give themſelves up to all Superfluity of Naughtineſs
till Conſcience is ſeared as with an hot Iron, yet without the
Conſcience be convinced, or that God by Force make it to ſee, hear,
and be ſenſible whether it will or no, men are not obliged by any
of his Commands;</hi> for this is the very Way he ſtates the Caſe
for me, though I do ſo particularly provide againſt any ſuch
diſſolute and infamous Pretences. This is ſo plain, that when
I ſay, that Conviction only obliges to Obedience, I add, that
what works the Conviction is the Manifeſting <hi>Light.</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<hi>Grace</hi> or Quickning <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Heart of Mankind; ſo
that let us now ſee the real Difference betwixt this <hi>Skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher</hi>'s
Grant at the End of the Day, and what he ſo furiouſly flew
upon in the Beginning. Saith he, <hi>I am bound to obey no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but what I am convinced of, provided I do not neglect or
reject the means of my Convincement.</hi> p. 11. Say I, <hi>No Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is further obliging upon me, then as I find a Conviction in
my Conſcience by the Light, Grace or Spirit of God,</hi> unto which
all men ſhould have regard; for that follows in my ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60240:18"/>
as an Explanation and Guard to that Aſſertion, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
neglected by my Adverſary, only to make Room
for this vain and fruitleſs Skirmiſh. Now unleſs my Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Grace of God, be neglecting the means of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as moſt undoubtedly it is not it being the only Way of true
Conviction) what <hi>Iota</hi> of Difference is there between my
Aſſertion, and his Conceſſion? For Inſtance, no man is bound
to anſwer a Queſtion he doth not hear, ſay I; no man is
bound to anſwer a Queſtion he does not hear, <hi>if he did not ſtop
his Ears, or refuſe to hear,</hi> ſaith he, as If I admitted, <hi>that men
might ſtop their Ears, and yet be excuſable,</hi> which is to read
my Aſſertion thus, <hi>No man is bound to anſwer a Queſtion that
he will not hear; and no Command is obliging upon a man that
will not be convinced.</hi> The moſt contradictory to my Aſſertion
that can well be, eſpecially when I neither lay the Obligation
upon every Conviction, but that only which comes from the
Holy Spirit of Truth; that is alwayes preſent to convince all
of their Duty, nor ſubject that Conviction to the corrupt wills
of Men.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here ſum up all my Authorities into one, and that is

               </q>
               <p>Now for his next Contradiction, which is in ample manner
thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God and</hi> CONSCIENCE <hi>will never ſmite for meer</hi> (p. 11.)
<hi>and total Impoſſibilities;</hi> what are they I. C.? <hi>to obey a Command
which it is utterly impoſſible to know or be convinced of:</hi> Very
well, enough of this before; but what's the Matter with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?
how comes this ſtrange Advance of a ſuddain from
the Bar to the Bench? what, a <hi>Regicide,</hi> a <hi>Parricide,</hi> a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi>
an <hi>Adulterer,</hi> a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> a <hi>Thief,</hi> a <hi>Traytor,</hi> a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and now a <hi>Judge,</hi> and ſuch a
Judge too as takes Place next God himſelf in Judgment; <hi>God
and</hi> CONSCIENCE <hi>will never ſmite</hi> and condemn, &amp;c. O
Powerful Conſcience! and O Righteous Conſcience too!
what, a juſt Judge at laſt! both able and equal? certainly
then it can be no Error to follow thy Dictates, nor make thy
Convictions the Meaſures of our Obedience; but tell me O
Conſcience, if Princes and Rulers make never ſo good Laws,
with thou come and ſay, <hi>I deny all theſe Laws and the Makers of
them; Children may murder their Parents; Subjects, their
Princes; Servants, their Maſters; one Man, another?</hi> p. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Doſt thou require men to do all theſe Impieties <hi>underpain
of Damnation?</hi> if not, go to <hi>I. C.</hi> for Satisfaction; for he
has grievouſly abuſed thee.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, <hi>Reader,</hi> So perplext is the Man in his <hi>Skirmiſh,</hi>
that he ſeems to have ſcar'd no Body ſo much as himſelf; he
has frigtned himſelf with his own <hi>Bulbeggar;</hi> and as it happens
with young <hi>Hottſpurs,</hi> Conceit carries them on, but leaves
them in the Fray, to get off as they can: ſo it has fallen out
with <hi>I. C.</hi> he is in, and he known not how to get out again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One while he appeals to God and Conſcience;</hi> If God and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60240:19"/>
Conſcience approve me, <hi>p. 2. here he makes</hi> Conſcience <hi>the
Rule of his Writing as well as God; another while,</hi> We may
do the moſt horrid Crimes, and yet Conſcience ſtood to them, and
not only not ſmite us, but approve us and praiſe us, <hi>p. 5. By and
by,</hi> God and CONSCIENCE will never ſmite and condemn
for meer Impoſſibilities; <hi>here again it is joyned with God in
Righteous Judgment. p.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> If Conviction be the Ground of Obedience, and the
Authority of Scripture depend upon the Rectitude and Purity of
Conſcience, then all rational Law, Order and Government di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and human is overturned, and a ſtop put to all Religion and
Piety towards God, to all Conſcience, Honeſty and Charity toward
Men. Let God command what he will, Conſcience may come
and ſay, I deny this Command and him that commandeth it, <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>I deſire to know of this Man, by what Trope or Figure it is
that he makes adhering to Conſcience the Way <hi>to overturn
and ſtop Conſcience:</hi> that's the firſt Caſe of Conſcience I have
to ask of him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is this, how Conſcience can be coupled with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
and Charity, nay, with God himſelf, and yet have the
Impudence to tell God, <hi>I deny thy Command and thee too;</hi> is
not this ſtrang Divinity? ſurely this Man is but a Parſon by the
by; for he violates the common Rules of Theology, as their
own Schools teach.</p>
               <p>But once more in Honour of Conſcience, and to make her
amends, as he began with the leave of Conſcience, he ends,
if we will believe him, with the Judgment of Conſcience, hear
him.</p>
               <p>I would be glad to make the beſt I can of your Poſition, but I
muſt proteſt my Conſcience and Conviction; <hi>thus doth he make
that his Guide his whole Pamphlet reprobates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Contradiction is this, that Conſcience is made by
him to be <hi>killed</hi> with Sin, as if it were a juſt Principle; and by
and by he renders it the ſeared active Sinner, <hi>p.</hi> 5. One more,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>he tells us, that</hi> he grants that without the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we could not at all come to the Knowledge of the Scriptures, <hi>p.
12. yet</hi> that the Light within gives the Drunkard leave to be
drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60240:19"/>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> The Light within, which ſhould be his <hi>GUIDE,</hi> like
a negligent drunken Coach-man ſleeps, and the Horſes run wood,
or he drives into Pits and Bogs; ſo doth the Light within take
Part with the Fleſh and Satan againſt you, <hi>p.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Theſe Contradictions ſpeak for themſelves, though againſt
him; the Reader may eaſily judge at what a Paſs this <hi>Parſon-skirmiſher</hi>
hath reduced himſelf, that writes at this Randome
Rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what further of his elaborate Studies in Divinity? why
this,</hi> If Scripture go <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> farewel God, and Chriſt, and
Heaven, and all Law, and Rule, <hi>p.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Now God forbid that the Scriptures ſhould go; but ſince
in telling a <hi>Fib</hi> of us (as if we ſlighted them) he has adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
ſuch an <hi>Axiom</hi> abroad in the World, I think fit thus to
animadvert: Doth God, Chriſt, Heaven, all Law and Rule
depend upon Scripture? ſtrange Change! <hi>the Creator depends
upon the Creature; the Saviour</hi> upon his Meſſage; Heaven
upon the Hiſtory of it? Ridiculous, as well as blaſphemous-Well,
but this is the worſt Senſe; let us ſee if we can find the
beſt, and that is this, <hi>Farewel to our Knowledge and Enjoyment
of God, Chriſt, Heaven, &amp;c. if the Scriptures were loſt;</hi> but this is
alſo Extravagant, ſince God hath not ſo tyed up himſelf to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
the Scripture it ſelf tells us of a Law writ in the Heart,
and that this is not an Inferiour State neither,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.</note> but
that of the New and everlaſting Covenant. Again
was there no God, Chriſt or Heaven, Law or Rule before Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
the contrary is notorious, the World had enjoyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages before the Scriptures were in Being; Paradiſe needed
them not; and <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> had them not; and
can this Parſon think there was no Knowledge of God, Chriſt,
Heaven, Law or Rule in thoſe Ages? wonderful! what croſs
Proſpects doth this Man take of Religion! But what becomes
of his ſpiritual Laws writ in Mans Nature? p. 8, 9. if all
would be loſt with the Scriptures (which God preſerve) how
croſs is this to the Apoſtle's Sentence in this very Place, <hi>Rom.
2. For the</hi> Gentiles <hi>which have not the Law, do by Nature the
Things contained in the Law, and are a Law unto themſelves:</hi>
it ſeems here was God, Heaven, Law &amp; Rule without Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60240:20"/>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He would needs have it, <hi>That men may commit all
ſorts of Impiety upon Conviction;</hi> ſee <hi>p.</hi> 4, 5, 10, 11. whereas
all theſe Evils are committed againſt Conviction, ſayes every
Orthodox Man, be they Sins of <hi>Wilfulneſs, Searedneſs</hi> or <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance;</hi>
for Wilfulneſs reſiſts Conviction; Scaredneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes,
ſmothers or kills it, if it be poſſible; and Ignorance is
Darkneſs or Blindneſs, which is juſt oppoſite to Conviction.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he thought any thing would do againſt the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
eſpecially if <hi>Skirmiſh</hi> and <hi>Imprimatur</hi> began it; but can
he in his Conſcience think (for now he tells us he hath one, and
he can appeal to it too) <hi>that the Light within helps to the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of Scripture, and ought to be our Guide;</hi> and yet
that it ſhould be a <hi>leud drunken, fleſhly, ſatanical Principle, and
a Rebel againſt God</hi> that gave it for thoſe excellent Ends <hi>of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scripture, and regulating our Converſation accordingly?</hi> ſhall
I return him his own Saying? <hi>Quit talia fando temperet a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymis?</hi>
though we had all gone aſtray, I ever thought our
Guide had kept the Way, and that ſhould be our Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
but this Man teacheth other Doctrine, namely, that
the <hi>Guide God hath given us leads to be drunk, and takes Part
with the Fleſh and Satan againſt God.</hi> What follows, but that
every Man is diſcharged from adhering to ſuch a Guide, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince the People in the Coach are not to be blamed, if
the Coach-man drive them into Pits or Bogs; but ſeriouſly Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is there no <hi>Soul damning</hi> or <hi>God blaſpheming Error</hi> in this
Doctrine, that chargeth him with making ſo ill Proviſion for
the Rule of Man's Life; <hi>would'ſt not thou take a better Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
left thy Horſes, with thy Wits ſhould run wood?</hi> And
hath the Almighty ſo ill helped us with a Guide, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
ſo many heavy and eternal Puniſhments, in caſe I
miſs my Way? This falſe Step in Divinity drives me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
three or four more, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>The next is this, <hi>That the</hi> Indians <hi>have no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Good or Evil;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 8, 9, 11.</note> which beſides that contradicts
the Teſtimony of Travailers, and the Judgment of
all Learned Men; and which is more, the Scripture too, that
demanded of old, <hi>Vpon whom does not his Light ariſe?</hi> and
tells us, <hi>That every Man has a Meaſure of Light,</hi> and <hi>that

himſelf; for he tells us of <hi>Laws of God writ in Man's Natures,</hi>
which includes <hi>Indians,</hi> if <hi>Indians</hi> be Men.</p>
               <p>His next Error expreſſed or implyed by ſeveral places of his
Pamphlet is, <hi>That all men are not convinced, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or condemned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>though they may have the Means of
it.</hi> I affirm that all men are Convinced, though they lay it
not to heart; for men ſee their Sin, unleſs they have ſinned
their Sight away, in caſe that can entirely be. <hi>God hath ſhewed
unto thee O Man what is good:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mic. 6. 8.</note> What Man is this?
the <hi>Iew?</hi> yes, and the <hi>Gentile</hi> too: <hi>O Man!</hi> that is,
<hi>Mankind;</hi> and can man ſee the Good and not the Evil, or
can he ſee either and not be convinced? <hi>Monſtrum Horrendum
Ingens:</hi> Pray how is man left without Excuſe, if God ſhows
him not Good and Evil? and can he ſee, and not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced?
Sight is Conviction.</p>
               <p>But when all is done, granting the Man his black Opinion
of Conſcience and Conviction; what can he ſay of a <hi>Quaker</hi>'s
Conſcience I cannot ſay of a <hi>Proteſtant's?</hi> Will he beray his

               <p>By this hath God awakened and redeemed us from a vain

the old World, and ſtrive with this. To no other Spirit is our
Teſtimony, neither Conſcience or Conviction, then that
which is according to the Nature of it. And as I can make
my Appeal to the Neighbours of <hi>I. C.</hi> and all other People
elſe-where, if ever our Conſciences or Convictions have led
us to any ſuch deteſtable Enormities, as he charges upon our

ſo do I warn all, to whom this comes, that they judge
us not with Unrighteous Judgment, nor readily receive the
Reports and Suggeſtions of prejudiced Men againſt us and our
holy Way. Its no eaſie thing to Fleſh and Blood, for us to
live uprightly in the Profeſſion of it: meer Outſide, Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

               <p>Therefore my dear Country-men, Grieve not God's Holy
Spirit; encline your Hearts to his pure Word; 'tis nigh you
(as <hi>Rom. 10.)</hi> that you ſhould obey it and do it; it will reform
and regenerate you; it will create all things new, from an
Hard to a Broken Heart, from a Vain to a Contrite Spirit; new
Affections, new Deſires, new Love, new Friendſhip, new
Words, new Works, new Cuſtoms and Faſhions (not like

have kept his holy Sayings; Remember what Chriſt Jeſus ſaid
(by whom God will judge the Secrets of all Hearts in the Day
of Account) that <hi>for every Idle Word which Man ſpeaketh, ſhall

               <p>As one that knows the Terrors of the Lord, I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
all men to turn to the living God; <hi>For if the Righteous
ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the Vngodly and Sinner appear? for
the Kingdom of God ſtands in Righteouſneſs, Peace and Joy in the
holy Ghoſt;</hi> and Sinners have nothing to do there: Neither
think, that you are ſaved by Chriſt from Wrath, and not
ſaved from Sin; or that he has ſaved you from the Guilt, though
the Nature and Acts of Sin remain; no ſuch can walk with
God here; for they muſt be tranſlated, changed, renewed; much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
can they enjoy the Lord hereafter. Wherefore caſt about,
and ſee how it is with you; hearken while it is to day; your
faithful <hi>Monitor</hi> is in your own Boſom, and <hi>Waits</hi> and <hi>Knocks</hi>
to be let into your moſt inward Affection, that he may be your
Delight, the prime Object of your Love; and bleſſed are
they that are not offended in him, but believe in him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
him before all men; the <hi>Outſide Jew</hi> deſpiſed him then, the
<hi>Outſide Chriſtian</hi> ſleights him now; but bleſſed be God, this
ſpiritual Appearance of Chriſt in the Soul, to the <hi>Jews</hi> (the
Profeſſors) a Stumbling-block, to the <hi>Greeks</hi> (the Wiſe Men)
Fooliſhneſs, is unto us, who have believed therein, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power of God to our Salvation; and the worſt deſire I have
for you is, That you alſo may ſincerely believe, and when
Time with you ſhall be no more, receive, with all thoſe that
in the Self-denying Life of holy Jeſus walk, and ſaint not, to
the End of their Dayes, Glory, Honour and Eternal Life,
<hi>Amen.</hi>
