            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>WIlliam Mildmay,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> having Right to, but out of poſſeſsion, of an Eſtate Real and Perſonal, <hi>viz.</hi> to part in Fee
Simple, and to the reſt for Life, Remainder to the Iſſue of his Body with Remainders over, and his Brother and other
Friends having forſaken him in the laſt Great Plague, and not having Money to ſubſiſt, he reſorts to the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
who was his full Couzen Germain, who very kindly entertained him and his Servants at the Petitioners houſe in
<hi>Cambridgeſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Petitioner, at the earneſt ſollicitation of Mr. <hi>Mildmay,</hi> undertakes a Suit in his name againſt one <hi>Clutterbuck</hi>
and others, for recovering the ſaid Eſtate, and laid out therein above 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and in 1669 obtained a Decree for
the ſame.</p>
            <p>That Mr. <hi>Mildmay</hi> being ſenſible of the Petitioners kindneſs, and of the unkindneſs of his other Relations, and having
had a Wife, but never any Child, and being then a Widdower and (as himſelf expreſſed) uncapable of ever having a Child,
and having often declared he would ſettle his Eſtate upon the Petitioner and his Children, did, about the year 1670, and
ſince, by ſeveral Deeds ſettle his Eſtate accordingly, reſerving to himſelf, for his Life a Maintenance of 200 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>
and upwards.</p>
            <p>That after the ſaid Settlement Mr. <hi>Mildmay</hi> declared to ſeveral perſons he had ſetled his Eſtate on the Petitioner his
Kinſman and beſt Friend, and the Tenants had notice thereof, and Attorned and paid their Rents to the Petitioner, and
called and owned him Landlord unto the year 1676.</p>
            <p>That Mr. <hi>Mildmay</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1676. coming up to <hi>London</hi> on ſome buſineſs, was drawn into Company, who betrayed
him into a Marriage which was one Day propoſed, and the next Day had, with one Mrs. <hi>Brewſter;</hi> but ſo ſoon as he was
Married and came to conſider what he had done, he went away and left his Wife without Bedding her.</p>
            <p>That ſince this Marriage, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>October</hi> 1676. Mr. <hi>Mildmay</hi> is prevailed on to ſettle the Eſtate (formerly ſetled on the
Petitioner without any Truſt or Power of Revocation) upon his ſaid Wife, or on Friends in Truſt for her and Mr. <hi>Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may;</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Mildmay</hi> and his Wife and Wives Truſtees in <hi>November</hi> 1676 exhibit a Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> to overthrow the
Settlements made on the Petitioner, and for <hi>Equity</hi> alledge the ſame were obtained by Fraud, or were only in Truſt for
Mr. <hi>Mildmay;</hi> and tho the Petitioner hath by his Anſwers fully denied both a Fraud and Truſt, and proved the Deeds to be
abſolute, and to be read to and underſtood by Mr. <hi>Mildmay</hi> before he executed them, yet the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> has decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Settlements on the Petitioner to be a Truſt, and Decreed the ſame to be ſet aſide.</p>
            <closer>Therefore Prayes the ſaid Decree may be reverſed.</closer>
