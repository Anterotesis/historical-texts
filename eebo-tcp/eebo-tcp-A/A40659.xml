            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome, at the first sight, may much admire what <hi>IACOB</hi> meant,<note place="margin">Gen. 53.11.</note> in sending so <hi>mean</hi> a <hi>Present</hi> to so <hi>mighty</hi> a <hi>Person</hi> as <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Egypt: A
<pb facs="tcp:52861:3"/>
little balm, and a little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, spices, and myrrhe, nuts, and almonds.</hi> For, as the quality of most of them was not costly, so their quantity (a <hi>little</hi> of either) was not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>The same exception lies against my presenting this small Treatise to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. <hi>Zoar, Is it not a little one?</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure thereof so plain and homely, that it is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the <hi>notice,</hi> much less the <hi>Patronage</hi> of your Ladiship.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52861:3"/>But for <hi>Iacob,</hi> all is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in three words: They were <hi>the BEST FRVITS of the land.</hi> Indeed, as <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Country plentiful with provisions for self-subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; so it was but barren of Barter with Forraign Lands; chiefly, because God intended it for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire place in it self, and not to mingle either Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise or Manners with other Nations.</p>
            <p>The same in effect I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge in mine own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, that this is the <hi>best</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb facs="tcp:52861:4"/>
of Thankfulness, that my present condition can afford; and my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not capable in any other way to deserve the least of those many favors which your Honour hath conferred upon me.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Iacob</hi> sent so small a quantity of each kinde (not because he grutched greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, but) conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater bulk would rather be more wearisome to the Bearers, then wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the Receiver: I, in like manner, (who could
<pb facs="tcp:52861:4"/>
have <hi>more,</hi> not <hi>better ware</hi> in this <hi>Work</hi>) to avoid te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness, have purposely shortned the same.</p>
            <p>And although your Honour shall not (as in <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Present) finde <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> here, (which was never offered to God in any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice) I mean, though in this Treatise there be no <hi>luscious,</hi> &amp; palate-pleasing <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Eloquence,</hi> yet I assure your Ladiship (if daigning to read it) that you will meet with <hi>Balm</hi> (and that of the best kinde, from <hi>Gilead</hi>) therein; the
<pb facs="tcp:52861:5"/>
true <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which we may gather to our selves in all our <hi>Temptations,</hi> from Christs here triumphing over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in the <hi>wilderness.</hi> Be pleased therefore, Madam, favourably to accept the <hi>fruits</hi> of my weak endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>But why speak I of the the <hi>fruits,</hi> whilst I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a pleasant passage, acted by the simplicity of a poor Spaniard? When a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> sent unto him for some <hi>Pears</hi> growing in his Hort-yard,
<pb facs="tcp:52861:5"/>
poor man presently pluckt up the tree, fruit, root, and branch, and presented it unto him. What, sudden fright, and servile fear, to prevent danger, made him to <hi>over-do,</hi> in his willing unwilling compliance with that churlish and cruel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor; that, my real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and cordial grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, doth cheerfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, in my addresses to your Honor, one of the most civil of your Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as Courtesie is the truest badge of ancient Nobility. I desire, that not

onely the leaves, buds, blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms, green, ripe fruit I can bear, be presented to your Ladiship, but could wish that the whole tree were worthy of your Honours acceptance.</p>

They are led into a temptation, who go on in their vocation, and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation encounters them; so that (because they may not go back in their Calling) they must either go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, or under it, or thorow it. Now a man in his Calling, is twice as strong to resist the temptation, as one out of it. A Fish is twice as strong in the water, as on the shore; but a four-footed beast is twice as strong on the land, as in the water. The reason is, because the water is the proper element of the one, and earth of the other. Thy Calling is thy element, wherein thou art most able to resist temptation. When <hi>Esau</hi> came against him, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9.) <hi>Iacob</hi> with two excellent arguments importun'd Gods protection: One from Gods command, <hi>Thou saidst unto me, Return into thy country:</hi> the other from his promise; <hi>Thou saidst unto me, I will deal well with thee.</hi> Both these reasons mayst thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force upon God to preserve thee, when a temptation assaults thee in thy calling: His Command, <hi>Six

of them <hi>Saviours</hi> of their people by temporal deliverances from their enemies: But he knew not certainly (though he shrewdly suspected) that he was the only Son of God by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal generation, and who by his death and Passion should save man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from their sins. Wherefore the devil did not wholly despaire, but tempted Christ with some probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of success.</p>

            <p>Four principal Reasons may be assigned of Christs fasting.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Because as <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan mans ruine with eating, Christ would begin mans repairing with abstinence. Physitians commonly cure by the contraries, and prescribe fasting to surfets.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Because Christ was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to begin his Ministery; and fasting was the solemn initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into that Office. Thus when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were separated for the work of preaching, <hi>Then fasted they, and prayed, and laid their hands on them, and let them go,</hi> Act. 13.3. And I understand, so much the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters retaine of the primitive cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, That they observe a fast on their day of ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Because Christ was to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52861:18"/>
cope with and encounter one of the subtillest, sullenest, and stubbornest of all devils; Whereof there is a kinde, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.21. <hi>A kinde that goeth not out but by fasting and prayer.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Christs fast was a total absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meat; The Popish <hi>Lent</hi> is only an Exchange of the sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for the fish-market; They ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from flesh, and feed on fish; which fish is also termed flesh in the Language of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.37. <hi>Another flesh of fishes.</hi> And be it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to palate-men, whether such

               </gap>ocative to wantonness then flesh it self.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Christ's fasting was done in all humility, whilst the proud opinion of Merit is annexed to their <hi>Lent</hi>: which <hi>Lent</hi> how it first came and afterward encreased, is worth our observation.</p>
            <p>First, The Primitive Church kept but one day in commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Christs fasting.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Montanists, being hereticks, first mounted it to full fourteen dayes fast.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians (disdaining that they should out-do them in point of abstinence) brought it up to fourty dayes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Clergy afterwards, to reach a note above the rest, hight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to fifty dayes.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Monks, to have a querk above their fellows, swelled it to sixty.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Fryers, to appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, made it seventy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52861:19"/>Lastly, there was a designe of some to make it eighty, (such would not follow Christs example, but out-run him) had not the Pope in policie retrenched them, and fixed it on fourty days.</p>
            <p>However, though the Popish Lent be not justly founded on Christs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, yet on this occasion we may naturally raise this Doctrine;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christians ought to set aside some sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for Fasting.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Physicians, by rules of Health, will perswade a natural fast: Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, by reasons from Wealth, a civil fast: Divines, by arguments from Piety, a religious fast. And if a threefold cable will not hold you, what will prevail on your pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctice?</p>
            <p>First, the Physician. Tell me, ye <hi>Londoners,</hi> since Suppers have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been disused in this City, I mean with such whose work onely is to over-see, (otherwise the hard <hi>labourer is worthy as of his hire,</hi> so of his supper) cannot you ride as fast, run as far? Are not your faces as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52861:20"/>
clear, your feet as strong, your whole body as able and active for all purposes and intents, as ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Politician. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the situation of our Country: <hi>Zebulun</hi>'s blessing agreeth unto it; <hi>It is a haven for ships.</hi> Mariners and Fisher-men must be maintained as well as others. Indeed, one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saith, <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof:</hi> but another saith also, <hi>The sea is his, and he made it</hi>; and we may and must feed on what it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords. Besides, Statists by such Fasts preserve the stock of Flesh. By the Levitical Law, in a birds nest the young ones were not to be killed with the dam: But, should not some such Fasts be seasonably observed in <hi>England,</hi> Pigs would be killed with Swine; Calves with Kine; Lambs with Sheep; the new Store destroyed with the old Stock; to the great loss of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Divine perswades a religious Fast; that men with S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52861:20"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>may beat their bodies down, and keep them in subjection</hi>; that so the body being subject to the soul, soul and body may the better be subject unto God in religious duties.</p>
            <p>But in the great variety of Ages, Climates, and Constitutions, it is impossible to give Rules how long men should fast. Take this general Direction: So diet the Steed, that it may neither kick and cast the Rider, nor tire under him in going his journey. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14, <hi>Take no thought for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof</hi>; but take order to <hi>fulfil the labour thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let thy Fasting have these three Qualities;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sincerity, Humility,</hi> and <hi>Moderation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Sincerity,</p>
            <p>It is a Mock-fast, to abstain from Meat, and not from Sin; to scruple the eating of a crust, and in the mean time (<hi>Psal.</hi> 14.4.) by oppression to <hi>eat up Gods people as if they were bread:</hi> Arrant hypocrisie, to be squeamish to swallow a crum, and in the mean time to <hi>devour widows houses:</hi> Not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52861:21"/>
to taste a drop of wine, and yet in the mean time (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17.2.) <hi>to be drunk with the wine of fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Humility; otherwise Popish superstitious Fasts are good onely to fill the bowels with winde, and the heart with pride.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Moderation. This (will some say) might well be spared; seeing you have seen amongst Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants as few fair faces spoiled with over-much Fasting, as silk Stockings worn out at the knees with Praying.</p>
            <p>I confess the accident rare, but sometimes it happeneth; and I could name a noble Lady, whose religious life is lately printed, who some hours before her death, being in perfect minde and memory, called for a cup of wine, and spake to her kinswoman, <hi>If God</hi> (said she) <hi>restore me to my health a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I will never mascerate my body so much, to disable it, as I have done with my fasting.</hi> Moderation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be used therein.</p>
            <p>Before we come to Christs being
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52861:21"/>
               <hi>an hungred,</hi> observe a second Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in the text: As it was a wonder that for fourty days Christ eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; so was it, that during that time nothing eat Christ, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company he had, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.13. <hi>And was tempted of Satan; he was also with the wilde beasts.</hi> Now what was it kept Christ from their violence? even his Innocence, and that character of Soveraignty which God had stamped on him: <hi>Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus</hi> could be back'd by none but by <hi>Alexander,</hi> to whom the horse willingly submitted himself, and whence <hi>Philip</hi> his father presageth that his son would become Monarch of the world.</p>
            <p>The wilde beasts owned Christ for their Lord and Master, <hi>Dominum cognoscite vestrum</hi>; and therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no injury to him. Thus after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>the ass-colt whereon never man sate before,</hi> Luke 19.30. quietly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our Saviour.</p>
            <p>If therefore the creatures start from their wonted obedience unto thee, reflect on thine own sins as the principal causes thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52861:22"/>One who had been undutiful to his father, complained of the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his own son: <hi>None</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath had so graceless a childe as my self.</hi> To whom his son, with more truth then wit, more wit then grace, replied, <hi>Yes, my grandfather had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When thou complainest that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver master had such undutiful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the creatures as thou hast, such barren earth, such unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some air, such curst kine, such resty horses; might not these dumb crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (if borrowing a mans voice) return unto thee, <hi>Yes, thy Master hath?</hi> God hath as rebellious a servant in thy sinful self.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, Christs innocence commanded the wilde beasts into obedience; muzled the Bears mouth, brake the Tygers teeth, blunted the Boars tusks, pared the Lions paws; onely the Devil, that lion, after fourty days fasting, adventured to seize on him.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>And afterwards he was an hungred.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52861:22"/>Three principal reasons may be alleadged for Christs hunger.</p>
               <p>First, because he was now to leave the Wilderness, and come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Country that afforded plenty of food: God therefore, who had formerly tied up his appetite, now let it loose again.</p>
               <p>The second Reason, to shew you the truth of his Humility. His fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so long, spake him God; his being hungry afterwards, spake him Man: His fasting, and being an hungry afterwards, spake him God-man, and a fit Mediator.</p>
               <p>The third Reason, to toll on the devil to tempt Christ with some hope of success, that so Satans shame and confusion might be the more, when overcome. Christs being an hungry in some sort tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the devil to tempt him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirited Satan with some probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conquest: for Satan before was almost out of heart at the long miraculous fasting of Christ; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one thing comforted him, that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> fasted as long, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52861:23"/>
yet were but meer men, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.17. <hi>subject to like passions as we are.</hi> This, I say, kept Satan in heart, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Christ's long fasting, he might be subject to sin; and when he found him an hungry, his hope was doubled, that <hi>all was his own</hi>; which made him tempt Christ with the more confidence.</p>
               <p>From Christ's hunger at last, after so long fasting, we conclude,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Men cannot conclude the constant tenure and continuance of their souls, from some extraordinary acts by them performed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men sometimes are enabled by God to go beyond themselves, and are raised in some kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances to so high a pitch, that they can never reach it afterwards. But if this good temper should stay with them some terme of time, he cannot thence truely infer a perpetuity of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One may be chaste fourty days together, and not feele the least motion to lust; yet <hi>afterwards be wanton.</hi> One may be patient four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52861:23"/>
days together, and not finde the least provocation to passion; yet <hi>afterwards be immoderately angrie.</hi> God's Spirit may vigorously quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee for a time, and then leave thee to thy self: I say, He may then leave thee to thy Natural and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as here he left Christ to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural infirmity; who, after fourty days fasting, was <hi>afterwards an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie.</hi>

               <p>This he doth by two devices.</p>
               <p>First, by insinuating a <hi>si,</hi> a suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of doubt, into the most posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pregnant promises of God. Where God saith, <hi>Call upon me in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52861:29"/>
the time of trouble, and I will hear thee</hi>; Satan infers, <hi>if he will hear thee.</hi> Where Christ saith, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved</hi>; Satan suggests, <hi>if he shall be saved.</hi> In a word, the devil endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to alter the property of all Gods promises for the worst, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting a supposition for Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: as, where God had lately said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17, <hi>This is my beloved Son</hi>; the devil spoils a direct text, with a doubting gloss, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by heightning the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Gods servants, to be so great, as inconsistent with their son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: as here he would perswade, Christs hunger argued him no Son of God, except he could presently relieve himself. So he tempts Gods children to believe, that their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, infamy, captivity, and other tribulations, plainly prove them no sons of God, unless they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently rid themselves of them.</p>
               <p>Gratifie not Satan in the deepest

               <p>Lastly, be jealous of Satans best temptations, which (as here to Christ) pretend most courtesie and

kindness in them.

to themselves, partly on the pretended apparitions of ignorant Monks, <hi>That the devil is horned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The best moral I can make of so fond a conceit, is this: The devil's temptations are <hi>horned,</hi> or <hi>forked, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornea argumenta.</hi> So that chuse which you will, he hopeth to gore the soul: Thus in the last verse, to our Saviour, <hi>If thou be the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>But what saith <hi>David?</hi> (Psal. 75.12.) <hi>I will break the horns of the ungodly:</hi> which here was truely performed by Christ, who found out a <hi>medium</hi> betwixt the two extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; namely, that a man without <hi>bread</hi> might support himself, by a faithful and patient dependance on Gods promises. <hi>Hunger</hi> (saith our English Proverb) <hi>will break thorow stone walls:</hi> and Satan hoped that Christ's hunger should transport
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52861:33"/>
him so far, as to turn those stones miraculously into bread. When, contrary to his expectation, Christ turns a place of Scripture (being the bread of life) into a stone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hit, wounded, and repelled Satan: <hi>He answered and said, Man shall not live by bread alone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Observe therein,</p>
            <p>First, what Christ did not do: he did not work a Miracle to gratifie Satan.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what he did say: he fenced <hi>himself,</hi> and foiled <hi>his foe,</hi> by alleadging of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Most of the difficulties in this text will be explained, if we but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and expound one wonder which we meet with, of Christ's working in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The Wonder is this, that Christ afterwards (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.) turned water into wine at a Wedding, and would not now turn stones into bread in the Wilderness. For,</p>
            <p>1. Both were equally easie, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52861:34"/>
both required an infinite agent.</p>
            <p>2. Wine is but a meer superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but bread is of absolute necessity to mans life: yea, men may quench their thirst from water, when they cannot satisfie their hunger from stones.</p>
            <p>3. Wine, at that time and place, was a superfluity of a superfluity; it appearing by the text, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.10. <hi>they had well drunk.</hi> Understand it, not so excessively, but still there was a <hi>plus ultra</hi> for honest mirth, or otherwise our Saviour would not patronize drunkenness.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that miracle he did to gratifie guests; but here he was concerned for his own support; and yet refus'd to work it.</p>
            <p>The reason of all this, is; He did that miracle in <hi>Cana</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of unbelievers to the faith, and the confirming of weak belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the faith. The text saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.11. <hi>This beginning of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles did Iesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples believed on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52861:34"/>Now here he refused to turn stones into bread, because,</p>
            <p>1. It was unnecessary: Christ now being to leave the wilderness, might either buy, or else request food elsewhere.</p>
            <p>2. It was unseasonable to do it at Satans suit and solliciting, who would be ready to brag that he had Christ at his command, to practise miracles at his pleasure: wherefore neither Satan nor his Imps, <hi>Herod, Luke</hi> 23.8. and the Pharisees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.1. could prevail with Christ to shew them a signe, when either out of curiosity, wantonness, or craft, they required the same.</p>
            <p>3. It was unprofitable, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hopes of Satan's conversion. The blinde man (being pressed often to repeat the manner of Christs curing him) said bluntly to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?</hi> Why should our Saviour work a wonder Satan being present? <hi>would he also be Christ's convert?</hi> He could not, he would not believ to salvation</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52861:35"/>Lastly, it was unlawful to tempt God to work a needless miracle, when there were other ways to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without it.</p>
            <p>Which leads our meditations to observe,</p>

               <hi>his son</hi>; yet he would not cure <hi>those frequent infirmities</hi> wherewith <hi>Timothy</hi> was troubled. <hi>Paul</hi> that cured the crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Lystra</hi> of his lameness, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.10. healed the father of <hi>Publius</hi> principal man in <hi>Melita</hi> of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.8. raised <hi>Eutiches</hi> to life when killed with a fall, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.12. Why should not he presently heal <hi>Timothy,</hi> but onely prescribe him a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52861:35"/>
more liberal diet? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomacks sake, and thine often infirmity?</hi> Yea, why did not he cure himself of that acute dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8 when <hi>he received in himself the sentence of death?</hi> The reason of both is this: They were stewards, not owners of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power, and might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross it for their own good, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense it, for the behoof of others, and principally for the converting of unbelievers.</p>
            <p>Nor were their destructive mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles employed in their own revenge. <hi>Alexander the copper-smith,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 Tim. 4.14.) <hi>hath done</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>much evil: the Lord reward him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works.</hi> Some will say, Had I been in <hi>Paul</hi>'s place, I would never have sent him to God for his reward, but would presently have paid him my self, and smote him (as he did <hi>Elymas</hi>) with blindness. But <hi>Paul</hi> would not be judge in his own cause; it being probable, that <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> his fault was more publike, not

onely committed against <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 13.8. but also against <hi>Sergius</hi> the Deputy, seeking to <hi>turn him away from the faith</hi>; whilst <hi>Alexander</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence was more particularly aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Paul</hi>'s person, and therefore the Apostle (for fear of pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Come we now to consider the several ways whereby God won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully supports them, who in want feed on his promises. Some will say, <hi>Words are but winde:</hi> but God's are real words, such as fill and fat those that depend upon them.</p>

When I behold the children of poor people, I perceive a Riddle, and contradiction between their fare and their faces: lean meat, and fat children; small beer, and strong bodies; brown bread, and fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions. Nor can I attribute it to any other cause but this, That the rich folk generally make <hi>long meals</hi> and <hi>short Graces,</hi> whiles poor men have <hi>short meals</hi> and <hi>long Graces</hi>; I mean that they rely more upon Gods blessing then their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by strange and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ways, he can furnish them with food in the greatest of their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Whereof we will make onely a fourfold instance.</p>

Two things, namely, their Calling and Custom, begets their Confidence. If God hath called thee and used thee in the height of honour, he will preserve

thee therein. But <hi>Adonijah,</hi> who <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted himself</hi> to the <hi>pinacle,</hi> 1 Reg. 1.5. must beware a downfal: and they who <hi>climb</hi> up to Greatness by a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their own sins, commonly make but one step in their falling down, from the top to the bottom.</p>
               <p>Let me give also this counsel to those who stand on the <hi>pinacle</hi> of <hi>Dignity</hi>; Always look upward (not with proud eyes, to contemn your inferiours, but) with thankful eyes to God that gave thee that honour. This will keep thy head steady, and thy brains from being turned with a <hi>Vertigo</hi> of Pride. Take heed of looking downward, I mean, to finde out a reason of thine advancement in thine own merit and desert; but say always with <hi>David, What am I, or what is my fathers house, that thou hast brought me hither,</hi> to this Pinacle of preferment?</p>

Reason; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.29. <hi>No man ever yet hated his own flesh. No man</hi>; he must be a beast, or a devil, that doth it. 3. Against Scripture: <hi>Thou shalt not kill.</hi> Say not, No law is particularly made against mans killing himself. Perchance it was purposely omitted (as the Law against Patricides amongst the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>) partly, because Charity would presume, none could be so wicked; and partly, lest mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption should abuse the Law, sins <hi>punisher,</hi> to be sins <hi>remembrancer.</hi> But whereas it is said, <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self</hi>; love of <hi>our selves</hi> is the <hi>original,</hi> love of <hi>our neighbour</hi> the <hi>copie.</hi> If therefore the killing of our neighbour, much more of our selves, is forbidden.</p>
               <p>Miserable are the pretences men make for this sin.</p>
               <p>First, To prevent or remove pain. This proceeds from the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Scriptures, and the unbelief of the torments of hell: Otherwise it is not the removing, but the increase and exchange of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52861:53"/>
pain; <hi>where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, To shan shame. Both these motives to <hi>Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> met in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.3, 4. <hi>He was sore wounded of the archers</hi>; there was pain: and <hi>he feared le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was not the way to avoid, but increase shame. <hi>Of him shall the Son of man be ashamed,</hi> Mark 8.38.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To procure Praise; which cannot be only, when it is purchased by the breach of God's Law. Say not, <hi>Samson</hi> did the same, whose faith is praised, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Do thou as <hi>Samson</hi> did, and it shall be forgiven thee: Pluck down at once two fundamental pillars of a Church.

            <p>Of the first:</p>

            <p>First, God's Injunction, <hi>Shall give his angels charge.</hi> This solemn charge proceeded not from the least distrust God hath of Angels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, but from the great desire he hath of mans protection. A word being enough to the Wise.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Angels Attendance; <hi>Thou shalt not dash thy foot against a stone.</hi> An expression which alludeth to what befel <hi>Balaam,</hi> when a (not protecting, but prosecuting) Angel, so withstood him, (<hi>Num.</hi> 22.25.) that his ass <hi>crush'd his foot against the wall.</hi> The foot (we know) is not onely the <hi>extremest,</hi> but <hi>meanest</hi> part of the body; and shews the extensiveness of Angelical protection. If the foot

be kept, surely the head shall not be hurt; but Christ shall be preserved <hi>cap-a-pe,</hi> with an universal safety.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Man's Protection. I say, <hi>Man's Protection.</hi> The words being spoken principally of Christ as a person, and secondarily of him and his, as they make up one mystical Body, whereof Christ is the Head. In which sense, it will fall to the share of the meanest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Christian, to come within the compass of this Angelical protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: conceive him but the <hi>last joynt</hi> of the <hi>least toe</hi> of Christ's <hi>foot,</hi> yet is he a lively member thereof, and by the promise in the Text to be secured.</p>

            <p>What shall we return to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,<note place="margin">

               </note> which they themselves disavow, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9. <hi>See thou do it not.</hi> No praying to them; whereof no promise, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, nor precedent in Scripture. But first, make honourable mention of them; give them their titles. It is uncivil to speak of Gentlemen,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52861:59"/>
Knights, Lords, Dukes, Kings, without the additions of Worship, Honour, Grace, Majestie. So, name Angels with their due Epithets; <hi>Good angels,</hi> (contrary to <hi>evil angels, Psal</hi> 78.49.) <hi>Excelling angels,</hi> Psal. 103.20. <hi>Holy angels,</hi> Matth. 25.31. <hi>Angels of light,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.14. <hi>Elect angels,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21. Such honour have all his Angels.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Learn Humility by them. No better thanks can be given the Angels, then if thou beest made the better by them. Much was the condescension of <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Germane Emperour, when at the Siege of a City he served in daily pay under our King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. Hence that in the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, <hi>Meruit sub rege in Gallia,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>Belgica.</hi> But the distance is not so great between an Emperour and a King, as between Angels and Men: yet they, without any regret, attend on the servants of God.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Be thankful to God for them. <hi>David</hi> knew as well as we, what service the Angels performed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52861:59"/>
for us; yet it never troubled him, what he should do in requital there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whose thoughts were taken up to deserve an higher engagement, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.12. <hi>What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will take the cup of salvation.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which benefits, Angels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection was a principal. Serve God, and thou shalt satisfie the Angels for all their attendance about thee.</p>
            <p>Come we now to behold the words as abused by Satan.</p>
            <p>Here some will tax the devil for mis-citing the text, because, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>Lest thou dash thy foot</hi>; Satan inserts, <hi>Lest</hi> [<hi>at any time</hi>] <hi>thou dash.</hi> But, though Satan accuseth us, we will not accuse him without cause. An Indefinite is equivalent to an Universal. <hi>At any time,</hi> though not literally expressed, is vertually implyed in the words. His grand fault in mis-alleadging the words, is this, That as <hi>Hanun</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.4.) cut off the beards and cloathes of <hi>David's</hi> Ambassadours <hi>in the middle</hi>; so Satan cites this Scripture <hi>by halfs.</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:52861:60"/>
I confess, not for <hi>number of words,</hi> but for the sense thereof, he leaves out a <hi>moytie</hi> of the text, the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and operative words therein, which were not onely of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission at large, but the <hi>Quorum,</hi> viz. <hi>in all thy ways.</hi> God promising his protect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Satan is an excellent Textuary, and most knowing in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He knoweth every Book, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, Verse, Word, Syllable, Letter, in the Old and New Testament, even in the Original Languages wherein they were written. He needeth no <hi>Concordance</hi> alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically to finde out places, who hath them all <hi>ad unguem.</hi> But it is observable, that in all the Scripture, from <hi>Genesis</hi> to <hi>Revelation,</hi> Satan knoweth not one text which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth comfort unto him. Many are unto him doleful messengers of despair; as that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>He took not on him the nature of angels.</hi> That, <hi>Iude</hi> vers. 6. <hi>And the angels which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52861:60"/>
kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, unto the judgement of the great day.</hi> Many texts present him with sadness, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his incapability of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for want of a Saviour; partly from his impossibility to repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his implacable and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible malice. How far more happie is the poorest soul, who, though not <hi>book-learn'd,</hi> hath onely a magazine of some select places, and promises in Scripture (gotten not onely <hi>by heart,</hi> but <hi>in his heart</hi>) whence he may apply consolation to his soul! Satan may be cunning in Scripture, but the Scripture cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not enough to hear Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>in point of faith or fact; but, with the</hi> Bereans, <hi>we must</hi> examine whether the things be so.</p>
            <p>Five things herein must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after.</p>
            <p>1. Is the thing alleadg'd, in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or no? It is strange, that many things, by vulgar errour, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52861:61"/>
common credulity, pass for currant to be in Scripture, when no such matter is to be found therein. Many things are taken up <hi>by content,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either weighing or telling them. <hi>Ye have heard it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy,</hi> Matth. 5.45. But, where is it said, <hi>Thou shalt hate thine enemy?</hi> Surely nowhere in Gods Word, though some silly Jews might igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly suppose it there.</p>
            <p>2. If it be in Scripture, Is it <hi>just so</hi> as they cite it? Is it not alleadged defectively, with <hi>Adoni-bezek, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off a thumb, or a toe?</hi> or redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, with the Gyants of <hi>Gath,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6. with <hi>a finger or a toe too much?</hi> Is it exactly and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately, as by them quoted?</p>
            <p>3. If <hi>just so,</hi> Is it <hi>truely printed?</hi> This is quickly discovered, by comparing one Bible with another of a different impression. Here (be it spoken to the shame of careless <hi>Correctors</hi>) it may be said, It is <hi>printed,</hi> where it could never be said, It was <hi>written</hi>; dangerours <hi>errata</hi>'s
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52861:61"/>
unrecall'd, unconfess'd, having crept into many Editions.</p>
            <p>4. If <hi>just so,</hi> and <hi>rightly printed,</hi> Is it <hi>truely translated?</hi> I speak this in opposition onely to the <hi>Rhemish</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, so full fraught of affected falshoods in favour of Popery; and in honour of our last Translation under King <hi>Iames,</hi> performed (by the confession of forraigners uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein) <hi>usque ad orbis invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, Whether that Scripture, <hi>if there, so there, truely printed, rightly translated,</hi> be not <hi>unproperly applied?</hi> The Papists have a good stroke herein (especially in the point of the Pope's Primacie, wherein the Scripture of it self is silent.) As these words were abused by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; so the next in the same Psalm, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 91.31. <hi>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder, the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet</hi>) were blasphemously profaned by Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he trod on the neck of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour. The precept to <hi>Peter</hi> in a vision,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52861:62"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 10.13. <hi>Rise, kill and eat,</hi> was produced by the Pope, to warrant his war against the <hi>Venetians</hi>; though the same words obliged him to <hi>eat</hi> their corpses, as well as to <hi>slay</hi> them. But, devil-like, he could leave out what was against him, and make use of the rest. Those words of the same Apostle, <hi>Behold, here are two swords,</hi> Luke 22.38 are abused to prove the Pope's double power, Temporal, and Spiritual.</p>
            <p>Moe instances might be added, but are better forborn. For, though alleadged by us, not with the least approbation, but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, and detestation of such blasphemies; yet they can hardly be told, or heard, without leaving in our hearts some diminution of the Majestie of God's Word (the dignity whereof all ought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) and therefore it is ill trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our corruptions with the bare reporting of such Scriptures abused, for fear of the bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects our badness may make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:52861:62"/>Lastly, Hence we observe, Gods protection cannot rationally be expected of them, who wilfully run out of their Vocation. Out of thy Calling, out of God's keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>What is thy profession? A Carpenter? An honest Calling: Christ's reputed father was of the same. Fell timber, frame fabricks, build houses, thou art <hi>in thy ways</hi>; God and his angels will keep thee.</p>
            <p>What is thy Calling? A Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? A necessary Calling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we could neither be warm, nor clean. Cast thy Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle truely, (the swiftness whereof is the lively embleme of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mans life, <hi>Ioh</hi> 7.6) labour faithfully, God and his Angels will keep thee; thou art <hi>in thy ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Art thou a Souldier? <hi>Do violence to no man, neither accuse any fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and be content with your wages.</hi> March, Charge, Retreat, do Duty according to Command, <hi>God shall
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52861:63"/>
cover thy head in the day of battel:</hi> for, thou art <hi>in thy ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if thou invad'st the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office, presuming to <hi>preach,</hi> who never was <hi>sent</hi>; look to thy self; thou canst not, without usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, pretend to God's keeping: for thou art <hi>out of all thy ways.</hi> Nor do I fear the frowns of any, if of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended hereat, and reproving me for giving this just reproof. I am sure I am in my Calling, <hi>in my ways</hi>; and therefore, with comfort and confidence, may rely on God and his Angels protection.</p>
            <p>To conclude, though the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels may be instrumental to keep our <hi>feet</hi> from <hi>dashing</hi> against a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <hi>stone,</hi> that is, to keep us from tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poral danger; yet there is a <hi>stone</hi> that passeth their power to preserve men from being hurt thereby; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>stone</hi> mentioned by <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 21.44. <hi>Whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken: but on whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it shall fall, it will grinde him to powder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:52861:63"/>Let our prayers be to the God of these Angels, That he (who onely can) would keep us from <hi>stumbling</hi> at that which should <hi>stay</hi> us, and from taking dangerous offence at our Saviour, the onely preserver of our souls.</p>

            <p>First, To what and exercise our diligence and industry.</p>

            <p>Now suppose one on the top of an high wall or hill, there are three ways for his coming down:</p>

            <p>2. <hi>Industrious.</hi> Understand ye here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,

by, a way out of the <hi>common road, unusual</hi>; but neither <hi>unlawful,</hi> nor <hi>miraculous</hi>; acquired by mens <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>brains,</hi> in case of extremity. Thus, when Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. had his life way-layed for by King <hi>Aretas,</hi> in the City of <hi>Damascus,</hi> his way from the <hi>wall,</hi> by the <hi>stayrs,</hi> was obstructed, where souldiers were set to surprize him. What then? did <hi>Paul</hi> presently vault from the wall, and cast himself desperately into the embraces of a miracle? Oh no. The brethrens brains <hi>being at a loss,</hi> beat about, and (according to the promise, <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 10.19.</note>

            <p>There is also a Practical <hi>Stayr-case</hi> recommended unto us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Adde to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Let us thus adde grace to grace, and raise our souls to heaven by those <hi>degrees</hi> which God hath appointed.

            <p>The first answer to these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52861:74"/>
cometh unto us recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the authority of Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> affirming, that the Devil did <hi>show,</hi> that is, by his <hi>gesture</hi> and <hi>pointing</hi> demonstrate to Christ the <hi>glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y of the world</hi> (which might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done in a moment) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Satan at his leasure did largely <hi>comment</hi> on his foresaid <hi>manual Indication,</hi> hightning and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing worldly wealth, power, and pomp, to the greatest advantage, with that flattering <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and fallacious <hi>Logick,</hi> wherein that lying spirit doth excell. So that we have onely the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> and <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate</hi> of Satans oration set downe in text, without the embellishments, and amplifications thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he enlarged himself to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p>The second answer is of such, who conceive Satan chose out a select parcel of ground, probably in <hi>Asia</hi> and the Eastern parts (where Nature is most triumphant and orient in pleasure and treasure) within the compass of Christs sight,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52861:75"/>
and presented it as a <hi>sample</hi> unto him, whence he might ghess the glory of all the rest. And I see no cause to the contrary, but that Satan might make his election in <hi>Palestine</hi> it self; which Country, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to its spiritual advantages, but meerly for the outward fruitfulness thereof (as appears in the text) is twice terme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A third sort answer, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the world was not <hi>really</hi> shown, but onely seemingly, and in <hi>appearance,</hi> represented by Satan (the <hi>master-Iugler</hi> in all delusions) to the sight of our Saviour. So that all worldly wealth, being (in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of an eternal and stable good) but a <hi>shadow,</hi> this <hi>Pageant</hi> was but <hi>the shadow of a shadow,</hi> quickly vanishing away. Either because the brittle constitution thereof would abide no long continuance, or that Satan purposely withdrew it presently, to make Christ more e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I will not interpose my opinion, which answer to prefer; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if all three be compounded together, enough may be collected out of them, to give a modest and sober minde convenient satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>I say, <hi>principal</hi>; the other <hi>senses</hi> being also active to the same ill end, but in an inferiour degree.</p>
               <p>We will not stir a step out of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52861:76"/>
first book of the Bible, to give four plaine and pitifull instances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Gen. 3.6. <hi>When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and pleasant to the Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. Herein, in some sort, her <hi>eye</hi> was taster to her <hi>mouth</hi>; she presumed (before she tried) it would be delicious to the palate, it was so delightful to the look.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. <hi>When the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were</hi> (what? wise? vertuous? religious? oh no) <hi>faire, they took them to their wives.</hi> And we know what a graceless brood of <hi>Giants,</hi> was the issue of such <hi>equivocal</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.10. When <hi>Lot lifted up his eyes</hi> (not in prayer to God, to direct him in a <hi>choice</hi> of such concernments, but) <hi>to behold the plain of Iordan, that it was well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered everywhere</hi>; which made him unadvisedly fix his habitation there, to his great disturbance, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods greater mercy, final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:52861:76"/>Fourthly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.26. When <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife looked back to Sodom, and was severely punished, though <hi>Abraham</hi> did the same (in the very next verse save one) without either <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>suffering</hi>; partly because no such <hi>prohibition</hi> was layd upon him; partly because <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>better tempered eyes,</hi> not to look (as too probably she did) with lusting after the wealth therein.</p>

                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.73. <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which way shall we <hi>turn away our faces from beholding vanity?</hi>

                  </note> which, as it is so bad, we should not look on it: so, it is so common, we cannot look beside it. If we turn our eyes from the right hand to the left; if from before our face, to behinde our backs, we do but exchange one vanity for another; seeing <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity.</hi>
               </p>

not to be avoided; the two next, <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>laudable,</hi> highly to be praised; the last, (but most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly practised) <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> justly to be condemned.</p>
               <p>The first, to behold vanity with a <hi>transient eye,</hi> as a passenger, who rides post through a Country, and sees men, buildings, meadows, fields, woods, but can give no account of them, as minding their own business all the while.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The next, and that commedable,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52861:77"/>
                  <hi>beholding worldly vanities,</hi> is with a <hi>contemning</hi> &amp; <hi>disdaining</hi> look, slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poverty &amp; emptiness thereof.</p>
               <p>The third, still more to be praised (as speaking a greater degree of grace) is with a <hi>pitying</hi> and <hi>bemoaning</hi> eye, (not to <hi>the things themselves,</hi> but) to <hi>souls of men</hi> so delighting in, and doating on them, that <hi>they,</hi> for <hi>whom</hi> Christ shed his precious blood, should undervalue themselvs so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, as to set their affections on so useless, yea dangerous objects.</p>
               <p>But to behold worldly <hi>vanities</hi> with an <hi>admiring</hi> and almost <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> eye, as the Disciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.5. gazed on the <hi>fabrick</hi> and <hi>furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Temple,</hi> is much to be condemned in all Christians.</p>
               <p>Now whereas Satan shews our Saviour, all the <hi>glory</hi> of the world, but suppresseth all the <hi>sorrows</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and concealeth the <hi>cares of the world,</hi> mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22. we observe,</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:52861:78"/>He was suspicious, had he really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the <hi>world,</hi> with all the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations inevitably appendant thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it would have disheartned our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour from the acceptance thereof.</p>
               <p>Beleive it, they have not the soundest sleeps within them, who lie on the softest beds beneath them, and have the finest Curtains about them.

               <p>The Scholar who reading to his Master in haste mistook THORN for THRONE, committed an ingenious fault; and the wofull experience of some, will justifie that his <hi>Error</hi> was too true an <hi>Anagram:</hi> and therefore the craft of Satan concealed the <hi>grievances,</hi> shews onely the <hi>glory</hi> of the world.</p>

               <p>Of the three, this Bait was far most pernicious; If we consider,
<list>
                     <item>1. The sin to which he tempted, was more damnable.</item>
                     <item>2. The meanes whereby he tempted, were most plausible.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The outward <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, was <hi>Holy,</hi> the middle <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>; but the third, or innermost, the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holiest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the <hi>hellish</hi> method of Satans Temptations, the first to <hi>Despair,</hi> was <hi>profane</hi>; the second to <hi>Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> was <hi>profaner</hi>; the last to <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, profanest of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:52861:79"/>Now we will insist on three reasons, why Satan keepeth the worst alwaies for the last.</p>
               <p>First, because he is of the nature of a serpent, <hi>That old serpent called the devil,</hi> Rev. 12.9. and that beast is sufficiently knowne to carry his worst poison in his hindmost parts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because he alwaies delighteth to be one of the <hi>Antipodes</hi> in opposition to Gods proceedings, who (being the Author of <hi>concord</hi>) makes ever the <hi>sweetest musick</hi> in the <hi>close,</hi> as the other the worst jarring therein. Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.10. <hi>kept the best wine</hi> unto the last, Satan in this his Temptation, reserved to the last the <hi>dregs</hi> and <hi>lees</hi> of his sowrest and sharpest vinegar.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because <hi>morsus ferarum morientium dirissimi,</hi> the bites of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beasts are the sharpest; and when Satan must depart (a death to him) and leave off to tempt us, he will badger-like, <hi>make his teeth meet,</hi> and take his leave with leaving a deep impression.</p>
               <p>Beware the <hi>last last</hi> Temptation
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52861:79"/>
of Satan, on the day of our death. Then, he will (as we say) <hi>make a bolt or shaft of it,</hi> put it to the push, either <hi>lose himself,</hi> or <hi>gain thy soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read Iohn. 7.37. <hi>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Iesus stood and cryed,</hi> &amp;c. But how loud will the Devil that <hi>Lion</hi> roar, in the great and last day of thy life, when it is with him, <hi>the last time of tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!</hi> either now conquer, <hi>or let him hereafter for ever hold his peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is sad tidings (will the weak<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </note> Christian say) to all in my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Alas, the Devil too oft prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against me in my strength and health; I shall certainly then be foil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when, being weakned with long sickness, I shall be assaulted with death, and the Devil, both at the same instant.</p>
               <p>Be not dejected,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> God will keep thee unto the end, and in the end, <hi>and will not suffer thee at the last gaspe, for any paines of death, to fall from him.</hi> Comfortable is the expression, <hi>Psa.</hi> 68.20. <hi>Unto God the Lord belong the ISSUES from death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:52861:80"/>Wherein observe, first, Death is not a total and final extinguishing of mens being, but there is an <hi>emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,</hi> an <hi>Issue</hi> out of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the Plural, there be <hi>Issues,</hi> two <hi>Exits</hi> out of death: Mat. 25.4. <hi>And these shall go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, These <hi>issues</hi> are not in the power of <hi>man</hi> or <hi>angel,</hi> to order and dispose of. Alas, were it in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of some men to order them in this uncharitable age, so full of fractions and factions; those of an opposite judgement unto themselves, would hardly find a favourable Issue <hi>from death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, and most to our comfort, these Issues are only in the sole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of God himself, who of his mercy will make us conquerors over Satans temptations; by whose gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wherein observe,</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Seller,</hi> Satan. For,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52861:81"/>
though he boasts himselfe for a giver, <hi>Will I give thee</hi>; it was not <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> but <hi>excambium,</hi> wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to have <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> yea an over-valuable consideration. Thus Simoniacal Patrons boast, how frankly and freely they give their Livings, when indeed they sell them to unworthy Incumbents, either by retention of tithes, or receiving of money.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The things to be sold.</hi> Lawyers charge their Deeds with words enough, seemingly to the same purpose, though certainly the <hi>Learned</hi> know a necessary difference in them: <hi>Profits, Emoluments, Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments, Obventions, Appendants, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances,</hi> &amp;c. The Devil compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them in one word, <hi>All</hi>; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brancheth it into two parts, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>sellers power</hi> to make a good state: <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet; Nothing can give to another, what it hath not it self,</hi> formally, or vertual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Satan herein pretends consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; he would not deceive our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52861:81"/>
by felling him a crack'd title, but shews his evidence, how he came possess'd of the same: <hi>All these things are delivered unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The condition:</hi> Satan would not give Christ the world in <hi>Frank-almonage,</hi> but on the price of being worshipped: Yea his worship must be performed according to the best fashion, with all state, solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ceremony thereof, with <hi>fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe.</hi> Observe the Devils sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, he will trust nothing, but to make sure work, would have all paid him, before he would part with any thing; No <hi>worship</hi> first, no worldly wealth for it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>One thing is wanting</hi> (and that a material one) <hi>to strike up the bargain,</hi> viz. a <hi>chapman</hi>; and we have him half in the text, one desired and sought for; but not found out, and obtained. For Christ refused Satans termes, which marr'd his market, seeing no indented Deed can be perfected, without full consent of both parties.</p>

               <hi>Is there not a cause?</hi> Satan out of designe suppressed it, as sensible that now it made as much against, as formerly for his advantage. For, should Christ seriously consider, that he was the Son of God, he would never ask a blessing at the hands of him, who was his Fathers professed Enemy.</p>

               <p>We find the Character of Christs mildness, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Hee shall not strive, nor cry.</hi> Yet we hear him <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loud</hi> in my Text, when <hi>striving</hi> with Satan. And just cause he had, when his Fathers honour was so deeply concerned.</p>
               <p>Here let us recount how often we finde Christ angry in Scripture.</p>
               <p>This was the first time in my Text; and Satan had the <hi>good Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> or <hi>first-fruits</hi> of Christs anger, bestowed deservedly upon him. And as Satan had the <hi>top,</hi> and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christs anger, so shall he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52861:90"/>
have the last, and the close thereof, yea be-forced to suck out the very <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ees</hi> and <hi>dregs,</hi> of his <hi>Indignation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ was angry, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.15. when with a scourge of cords he drave the Buyers and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers out of the Temple; but then it was in his Fathers quarrel, whose <hi>house of Prayer</hi> they had turned into a Den of Theeves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.5. <hi>when he had looked round about on the people with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> (but for what? for any perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Injury they offered him? O no, but) <hi>for the hardness of their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, When offended with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Matth.</hi> 16.23. he said unto him, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> giving <hi>Peter</hi> worse language for disswading then ever he did <hi>Iudas,</hi> for contriving his passion, whom indeed he once called <hi>Devil,</hi> but never bid him, <hi>Get thee behinde me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not be over-positive and confident; but perchance Christ may be found once <hi>again angry</hi> in Scripture: but this I dare presume to affirm, It is not then in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52861:91"/>
but (like meek <hi>Moses, Numb.</hi> 16.15. <hi>very worth</hi> in the case of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rah</hi>) when his Fathers honour or our good was interested therein.</p>

               <p>Yea it is remarkable, Christ took all the three places wherewith he repelled Satan, out of one book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and two of them out of one (the sixth) chapter thereof.

               </note>How came Satan now to leave our Saviour, rather then before? As if his last answer was more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual then his former. Twice before, he had refused the profer, and refuted the reasons of the devil; and now he did no more.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>First, negatively. It is not to be attributed to any latent operation, or mystical efficacie of the <hi>number of Three,</hi> as if the <hi>third</hi> resistance drave the devil away (thrice <hi>crossing,</hi> thrice <hi>sprinkling</hi> of water, &amp;c. folly, with Papists, to fix any force either in the <hi>thing,</hi> or the <hi>triplication</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) or as if Satan would tempt us
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52861:96"/>
onely <hi>three</hi> times, who will do it more then <hi>thirty</hi> times <hi>three.</hi> But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan left him,</p>
            <p>First, Because he (who long had look'd for that which he was loath to finde, <hi>viz. whether Christ was the Son of God</hi>) was now, to his great sorrow, sufficiently satisfied in the <hi>affirmative,</hi> that he was so; and therefore desisted from farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry therein.</p>
            <p>It is observable, how much Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans knowledge was (I will not say bettered, but) increased in one Chapter (<hi>Mark</hi> 1) within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of eleven verses. For, verse 13. he <hi>tempted</hi> Christ, namely, to try <hi>whether he was the Son of God</hi>; and verse 24. <hi>he confesseth him: I know thee</hi> (with deare-bought knowledge, to his owne confusion) <hi>who thou art, the holy One of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Satan could not <hi>go higher,</hi> and therefore he would not <hi>go lower</hi> in his <hi>Temptations. Ecquid aliquid altius?</hi> Was there any act worse then <hi>Idolatry</hi>; or greater temptation thereunto, then the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52861:97"/>
               <hi>wealth and glory of the</hi> whole <hi>world?</hi> It stood not with the state of Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tans malice, to present our Saviour after this, with some <hi>petty</hi> allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a puny sin, and therefore he thought fittest for the present to desist.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Satan <hi>went away,</hi> to save his credit, being on the matter <hi>driven away.</hi> Christ spake, <hi>Get thee hence,</hi> as a Commander <hi>with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; and his words were (for the time) a <hi>Mittimus</hi> to dispach the Devil out of that place; who, beholding Christ his holy anger, now raised up to an height, presently with shame <hi>sneaked</hi> and <hi>slunk</hi> away.</p>

                  <hi>Holy Indignation is an excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcism to drive Satan away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The surest way to fright the fiercest Lion, (that of the <hi>crowing of a Cock,</hi> being denied by many, doubted of by most) is by shaking of a <hi>fire-brand</hi> before his face. Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tan, that Lion, feares the flame of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52861:97"/>
holy and heavenly anger (such as here <hi>sparkled</hi> out in our Saviour) so that the <hi>climat</hi> grew too <hi>hot</hi> for him; he could dwel no longer therein. But we must be sure, that <hi>ours</hi> be <hi>holy Indignation,</hi> otherwise the <hi>strange fire,</hi> of common and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal anger, doth <hi>allure,</hi> not <hi>affright</hi> the Devil; yea the light thereof giveth him aim the more steddily to direct his temptations at our souls. Yea when his <hi>fiery darts</hi> meet with our <hi>fiery passions</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oh how <hi>unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> (without Gods mercy) is the <hi>combustion!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> saith abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, <hi>The devil leaveth him</hi>; but Saint <hi>Luke</hi> giveth us the <hi>Limitation</hi> thereof; <hi>he departeth from him,</hi> for <hi>a</hi> SEASON. And seeing <hi>departing,</hi> and <hi>coming</hi> are <hi>relative termes</hi>; we finde Satan afterwards re-assaulting our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.30. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence Learn,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Satan though he leaveth us,</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:52861:98"/>Of the three grand enemies of our soul, <hi>One</hi> beginneth long before the <hi>other two,</hi> but all end and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with us, at the same instant. The <hi>flesh</hi> starteth first, not onely from our <hi>birth,</hi> but <hi>being</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold, I was born in inquity, and in sin hath my Mother conceived me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> come after, namely when a child (sooner or later according to his capacity) is able, with the consent of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and will, to commit an actual sin. But all three determine in and at the same moment, namely just at the time of our death: till then, be sure Satan will not leave thee.</p>
               <p>Yet let none be disheartned at Satans <hi>never leaving to tempt them,</hi> but, in a comfortable opposition thereunto, let them consider that Gods protection will never finally <hi>leave</hi> to preserve them. Indeed, for some time (especially to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of a wounded conscience) he deserteth his servants, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52861:98"/>
with Christ, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Yet we have the certain promise of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stant assistance; which he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly perform: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I will never LEAVE thee, nor forsake thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here under favour, I conceive that though our Saviour was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards often tempted with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, yet the notion and nature of his <hi>future,</hi> much differed from his <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> temptations. His former were chiefly for Satans <hi>information,</hi> and the other were onely for Christs <hi>vexation</hi>; the former partly to <hi>try,</hi> the later solely to <hi>trouble</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; the Devil then knowing full well, that he was the Son of God.</p>

               <p>First, at his <hi>conception, Luke</hi> 1.26. An Angel, <hi>Gabriel</hi> by name, first brought the blessed tidings thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After his <hi>birth</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. both celebrated the same with their singing, and imparted to shepherds the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In his <hi>Infancie, Mat.</hi> 2.19. An Angel gave notice to <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Herods</hi> death, and that now Christ might safely return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:52861:100"/>Fourthly, In his <hi>Temptation,</hi> here in my text.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, At his <hi>Passion,</hi> when his Agony began in the Garden, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43. <hi>There appeared an Angel unto him from Heaven, strengthning him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some will say, Seeing it is the general opinion of <hi>Divines</hi> that the blessed <hi>elect Angels</hi> are established and <hi>strengthned</hi> in Christ, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one of them to <hi>strengthen</hi> Christ at this time? But let such know, it was the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ, (which is less and lower then the <hi>Angelical</hi>) which here received <hi>strengthning</hi> from him. Besides, the Angel being then in a <hi>calm,</hi> and Christ in the <hi>Tempest</hi> of an Agony, no wonder if a meaner might mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster comfort and support to one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise and at other times far his superiour.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, At his <hi>Resurrection, Mat.</hi> 28.2. when an Augel (which rolled away the stone from the Grave) attested the same.</p>

10. when two Angels declared the manner of his returne unto Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Nor is this <hi>Angelical attendance</hi> confined to Christ alone, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended also to all Christians in some degree, as <note n="*" place="margin">Page 99.</note> formerly we have large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, and here intend no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition thereof; where also we have proved, that in compensation of their <hi>service</hi> (though other <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> be due to <hi>Angels</hi>) no <hi>worship</hi> may lawfully be tendered unto them.</p>
