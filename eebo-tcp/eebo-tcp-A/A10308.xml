         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

proſecute my owne gréefe, and the generall wayling
of euery gentle minde. Wherein as well ſuperiours,
as inferiours, (caſt from the quiet ſtaie of their former
affectes) ſéeme to beare their indifferent partes.</p>
            <p>If the loſſe of true nobilitie, whereon as vpon a rocke
of ſafe protection, conſiſteth the happie gouernement
of euery floriſhing common weale, though by honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

one looſeth the hope of expected virtues, and the other is
bereft the ſtrength of theyr peaceable fortunes, yet
not by repulſing the iniuries of forraine pride, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſummons of diuine election, but by the poyſoned
rancour of domeſticall treacherie, as by this horrible
murther executed on the right honourable the Lorde
<hi>Bourgh</hi> may wel appeare, whoſe vertuous deſires, were
ſtedfaſtlie fixed vppon true honors exerciſes, and whoſe
heroycall conſtitution, euer abhorred the baſe practiſes
of vicious and ignoble qualities. But as the fayreſt roſe
is apt to be conſumed by a cancker, ſo Enuie the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
handmaide of honour, continuallie ſéeketh the ruine
of noble perſonages.</p>
            <p>For in the courte amongeſt the princelike traine of
her Maieſties followers, there wanderd (as the pureſte
wheat is aſſociated with infectious wéedes) one <hi>Arnold
Cosby,</hi> a man of proud conceipte, borne to miſchéefe, and
predeſtinated to deſtroie that which his lothed life is too
farre vnable to redéeme.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Cosby,</hi> what for countries ſake béeing an Iriſhe
man, or for the curtious affabilitie of the Noble man
(whoſe ingenuous towardneſſe carried a good conceite
of euery one) was ſo fauoured and well eſtéemed of him
as he thought nothing loſt wherein hee might pleaſure
him, til at laſt (as is the cuſtome, of ouerbold inchroching
vpſtartes) by too much familiaritie he grewe contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and the more to manifeſt his arrogancie and the
mallice of his ſwelling ſpirite, tooke a ſleighte quarrell,
(after ſundrie diſpightfull diſgraces offered) to prouoke
and challenge the Lord <hi>Bourghe</hi> by a vile and impudent
letter, which one night vnder ſigne of fawning ſubtilty,
ſecretly he clapt into his hand. And though the offence did
not procéede by him, but principallie roſe by the reportes
of an other gentleman of <hi>Cosbyes</hi> acquaintaunce, which
offered to maintaine them to his téeth, daringe him to the
fielde, yet did he refuſe to fight with him, bendinge the
force of his conceiued hatred, onely againſt the Lorde
<pb facs="tcp:11042:3"/>
               <hi>Bourgh,</hi> and would not forſooth otherwiſe bee pacifyed,
but with his life and ruine of his carkaſſe, for ſuch were
his wordes in his impudent letter, ſtuft with a rable of
bumbaſted braues, ſcornefull tearmes, and odious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,
binding him vpon his honour and manhoode,
the next morning to méete him in <hi>Wanſworth</hi> fieldes.</p>
            <p>The noble gentleman whoſe modeſt eares did glowe
at the immodeſt and ſhameleſſe lynes, as his milde and
curteous demenour, was neuer ſeene to iniure the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt,
ſo béeing impatient of the leaſt wrong ſmiled at his
follie, and thought, though he were no waie his equal, yet
in ſo much as he was a Souldiour and in that reſpecte a
gentleman, it would not be much preiudicall to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
if he met him, and with the chaſteſment of his ſword
taught him his duetye with better manners, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not in hatred of ſoule, thirſting after bloud, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by his oppribrious letter he did: but in ſobrietie
ſent him word backe he would méete him, which reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I ſuppoſe was contrarie to <hi>Cosbeyes</hi> expectation,
who imagined be like the Lord <hi>Bourghe</hi> woulde haue
ſtoode vpon tearmes of ſuperioritie with him, or elſe hée
would not haue béene ſo liberall in his challenge.</p>
            <p>But the night drue on, and <hi>Cosbyes</hi> ſtomacke that of
late did blowe foorth from his windie puft breſt the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
of horrour and death, began nowe to quaile, at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
of two or thrée wordes, ſpoken in a milde and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
vaine, and therefore as fitted the oportunitie of
time he entred into counſel, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curſſed ruler of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
howe hée might worke miſchiefe, and yet defende
his owne credite from blot of infamie. Well ſomewhat
was deuiſed and concluded vpon, as after by his actions
might be gathered: for the daie no ſooner appered, but as
prefiguring ſome diſmall accident, it couered the earth
with a lowring countenaunce, and black cloudes in ſigne
of enſuing miſeries, diſtilled repentant teres from their
watrie browes. When <hi>Cosby</hi> well ſtudied for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and pricked forwarde with a deſire of deceiuinge
<pb facs="tcp:11042:4"/>
hope, which his wicked thoughtes had before hatched in
his braine, left his lodging and came to the Lord <hi>Bourghe</hi>
with a caſe of Rapiers, bidding him take his choyce, for
thoſe ſhould be the inſtrumentes of life or death betwixt
them.</p>
            <p>After this they mounted themſelues and rode
on towardes <hi>Wanſworth,</hi> neither of them hauinge made
any one priuie to their intent the one would not, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of his honour, the other in feare his villainons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
ſhould bee diſcouered: I neede not aime at the
thoughtes of <hi>Cosby</hi> by the waie, they may bee coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be ſuch, as commonly procéede from a minde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditating
murther. When they were come to the place
appointed, <hi>Cosby</hi> as it ſhould ſéeme, béeing firſt arriued,
had made himſelfe readie to fight, the Lorde <hi>Bourgh</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſomewhat later, was not altogeather ſo ready, yet
had caſt of his cloake, tyed his horſe, and drawne hys ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier.</p>
            <p>Now marke the feare, wherewith treacherous hearts
doo continually tremble, though they haue neuer ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie
ſtudyed the platforme of their pernitious deuiſes.
For <hi>Cosby</hi> although he had trained this freſh ſpringing
hope of cheualrie and honour, into a ſolitarie place farre
from reſorte, and earlye in the morninge when fewe
had occaſion to be in the fieldes, yet did hee (as miniſters
of diueliſh ſtratagems vſe) faint and gladlie would haue
bin at home againe, as by his delaies is euident, for firſt
he intreated the L. <hi>Bourgh</hi> to meaſure rapiers, the equal
length wherof he knew ſufficientlie for him ſelfe proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them.</p>
            <p>Then did he requeſt him to breake his rapiers point (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouching
it was triall enough of their manhoods, in that
they had met in field) and to ſcarre their faces, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
and ſay they had fought. But the L. <hi>Bourgh</hi> as
one that lothed his former brags, and deteſted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, told him flatly, he ſcorned ſuch puſillanimity,
nor came he to plaie boyes plaie. Why then quoth <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11042:4"/>
my L. t'were beſt put of your ſpurres leaſt they chaunce to
hinder you.</p>
            <p>Now had the deuill which all this while had béene abſente
from his ſeruant, fitted him at length with a pollicie to worke
his will and endamage his owne ſoule. And now, euen nowe,
the fatall houre was come, wherein the bloudy homizide ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to quench his thirſt in bloud, and to acte the tragidy of his
former ſcelerous inuentions. For as the L. <hi>Bourghe</hi> (whoſe
noble minde ſuſpecting no treacherie) knéeled downe, putting
his rapyer in his left hand, and with his right, intended to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buckle
his ſpurres, the monſterous treachetour, taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
as it fell, not like a Souldiour, or a Gentleman,
but lyke a brutiſhe manquellour, and murderous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratour,
voyd of all virtue and humanitye, with all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
his coadiutor the deuill could lend him, ranne his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyer
twelue intches into his breſt, which ſtucke ſo faſt, as hee
was conſtrained to ſet his foote vpon him and plucke it foorth,
and being caſt downe with the force of the thruſt, <hi>Cosby,</hi> that
wicked and bloodye <hi>Cosby,</hi> coulde not be content with one
mortall wound, nor might his inſatiate furie be ſtaunched, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his vitall bloud ſtreamed in ſundrie conduites, to gorge
the fell outrage of his gréedie mawe, therefore letting fall hys
rapier, tooke his dagger in his right hande, and therewithall
gaue him thrée and twentie woundes more. Which ſcarſe
could ſuffice, for that he feared, if any breath remained in hys
bodie his tongue might bewraye the manner of that horrible
murther, and therefore would not haue left ſo, but that he ſaw
reſcue néere, which made him take his horſe to eſcape, which
was when he came vnto that place, a luſtie ſtrong Geldinge
as any is in England, but he was no ſooner on his backe, but
he preſently fell lame, and was not able to carie him, ſuche is
the iuſt iudgement of God that abhorreth murderers, and wil
not theyr villainie be concealed.</p>
            <p>Beſides for all thoſe woundes, which the Lord <hi>Bourghe</hi> had
receiued, it pleaſed God he ſhould liue two or thrée houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
time enough to commit him ſelfe to his mercie, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
the treacherous manner of his death, which hee did in
the hearinge of the right honourable the earles of Eſſex
<pb facs="tcp:11042:5"/>
Eſſex and Ormewood, in a houſe in <hi>Wanſworth,</hi> whether hee
was conuaied by the meanes of one <hi>Iohn Powell</hi> yeoman of
the bottels in her maieſties houſe, who comming to the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue,
purſued the murtherer vntill hee ſhrouded himſelfe in a
thicke wood, where he might eaſilie haue kept him ſelfe cloſe
a long time, but that the prouidence of God hauing nowtaken
place to puniſh, where before the deuill had kept poſſeſſion, for
ſin he wold not ſuffer him to reſt, but ſo ſoone as it was night,
brought him backe to <hi>Wanſworth,</hi> and the firſt houſe he came to
was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe wherin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breathles bodie of the Lord <hi>Bourgh</hi> lay,
wherunto he was no ſooner approched (which is a thing eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to be noted,) but his wounds bled more freſhlie then when
