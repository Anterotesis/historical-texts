            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> was of the Illuſtriou Blood of <hi>Ottoman;</hi> his Birth had exalted him to the Empire of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and his Valour was ſo bright that it dazled the glory of thoſe four great Princes who preceded him in it: he had almoſt brough <hi>Europe</hi> under his ſubmiſſion, as he had made all <hi>Aſia</hi> tremble. Hi Laws were revered in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>markable Parts of the Earth; and never had any man acquired to himſelf a Renown more glorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> Emperour of th
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59666:6"/>
                  <hi>Tartars,</hi> put a ſtop to the courſe of this proſperity: he was of a low and obſcure birth, but having with violence through the ſuccour of Arms placed himſelf upon a Throne, which others with tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling aſcended, his happy deſtiny ſurmounted that of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s; he triumphed over him, and at that time when he look'd upon <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> as eaſie conqueſts, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated his Country, reduced his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to a peregrine condition, and carried him Captive to <hi>Samarcanda,</hi> which was <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s moſt belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed City, as being built by him. The Wife and Daughter of <hi>Bajazet</hi> were partakers of his misfortune; the former of whom died a little while after, but the Daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either more couragious, or of a more robuſt and reſolute Spirit, was better able to reſiſt the attaques of Fortune, and became the admiration of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> as ſhe had been of all thoſe who had ſeen her in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Palace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59666:7"/>
                  <hi>Themir, Tamberlain</hi>'s Eldeſt Son, who was one of the firſt, felt the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this admiration: he had an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Empire over his Father's mind, and had abuſed it by his ill conduct, even to the baniſhing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danaxus</hi> from the Court, otherwiſe called the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs,</hi> his yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brother; and he had improved this affection to a thouſand cruelties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the unfortunate <hi>Bajazet:</hi> it was He, who had ſacrificed in his ſight the eldeſt and deareſt of his Sons, ruined the famous City <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia,</hi> took away the Princeſs <hi>Aſteria</hi> his Daughter from the Palace of <hi>Burſa,</hi> and without any pity aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all the Empire of that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Prince, to the violence of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Love puniſhed him for all thoſe Inhumanities, and his heart, as barbarous as it was, was ſenſible of the Charms of the fair <hi>Aſteria,</hi> ſo that much againſt his will he did learn the uſe of ſighs; and though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59666:7"/>
they were prevented with too great outrages from being favourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, yet his Rage to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſpiſed by the generous, but reſolute Princeſs, threw him into the laſt extremity of deſperation.</p>
               <p>He was violent and furious in his Temper; and though he had been capable of Sentimenrs more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet the Princeſs was inſpired with no mean and inconſiderable ones. He ſpoke as ſoon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf preſt to it, but it was with ſo much boldneſs, that <hi>Aſteria</hi> found ſhe was coming under a new perſecution, more afflictive and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting to her, than all the other: ſhe anſwered the paſſionate Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Themir</hi> with a disdainful, fierceneſs, which many times ſet him in ſuch a heat and fury that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expreſſed but with a great deal of difficulty. He imagined that <hi>Bajazet,</hi> whoſe courage was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by his misfortunes, did forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this averſion, and by a new
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59666:8"/>
piece of Injuſtice, removing him from his Daughter, he was ſhut up in a priſon at a good diſtance from the Palace, and <hi>Aſteria</hi> kept in her Apartment with a greater Guard than ſhe had before.</p>
               <p>This procedure gave an acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Princeſſe's hatred, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged her more than ever, which made <hi>Themir</hi> become more furious. He went to viſit <hi>Bajazet</hi> in his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and indeavoured ſometimes by intreaties, and ſometimes by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, to bring him to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but having made an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable attempt, he ſtraight had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the blind Friendſhip of his Father, and diſcovering his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, and the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that might attend it, he did ſo effectually prevail upon his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, that he brought him to that paſs of undertaking all things that might be for his ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>He went then directly to <hi>Asteria</hi>'s Apartment, with a reſolution not to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59666:8"/>
ſpare any means likely ro make her flexible. He made her offers, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and from thence fell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and ſtill finding her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in deſpiſing his giſts and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he became ſo furious, that he thought he was obliged in point of honour to conquer her; and told her with an abſolute imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tone, that if ſhe was reſolved to perſevere in her Obſtinacy, he knew very well how to make her repent of it in the perſon of her Father.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs at thoſe words was ſtruck with a mortal terrour; Do not invelope <hi>Bajazet</hi> in a Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance where he is not at all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaid ſhe to him, pouring down a torrent of tears; the Juſt refuſal I make to marry the murderer of <hi>Ortobulus</hi> my Brother was inſpired into me by my own reſentments, which were every way legitimate, and if it merits any puniſhment, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ought to ſuffer it. Leave the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59666:9"/>
days of <hi>Bajazet</hi> to their Natural end, they cannot laſt very long, and no ways trouble the tranquillity of your Son; you ought to exerciſe your vengeance upon my life only, and it is againſt me that every thing proves an earneſt ſolliciter to you. No, no, replied <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> I know better how to chuſe my victims, and ſince for my Son's misfortunes, his days are faſtened unto yours, you ſhall live, but you ſhall live to ſee that Father, who is ſo dear to you, expire in ſufferings, and you ſhall never boaſt without a puniſhment, theh aving ſcorned the Alliance of the greateſt Prince in the Earth. He went out as he ended thoſe words; and the overwhelmed Princeſs fell into a dreadful ſwoon in the arms of her Woman, who had much ado to recover her from that weakneſs.</p>
               <p>The cruelty of <hi>Tamberlain</hi> did not only conſiſt in words, <hi>Aſteria</hi> had order the next day to go to

                  <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s priſon, and to diſpoſe him for death, or for a marriage of her with <hi>Themir.</hi> Fatal Choice! for a Daughter who did ſo dearly love her Father, and deteſt that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Lover! the ſight of <hi>Bajazet</hi> had never been permitted her ſince their Separation; ſhe had often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, and would have given the beſt part of her blood to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; but the fatal condition that was put upon it rendered it then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable to her, ſhe refuſed to go, and reſolved to do her ſelf ſome violence, but at laſt conſidering that that Obſtinacy might poſſibly haſten her Father's death, ſhe obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuffered her ſelf to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, all over-whelm'd in tears, to the place where they were to bring her; ſhe found there the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor ſo changed that ſhe received his embraces without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſpeak a word. <hi>Bajazet</hi> asked her what return had obliged the Tyrant to grant her to come
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59666:10"/>
and ſee him: the laſt of all his cruelties, Seignior, ſaid <hi>Aſteria</hi> to him; the ſevereſt effect of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtices; in a word, what ever he has in the world that can be moſt tormenting to us. She then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to him in a few words the ſad myſtery of her viſit, and taking away from him all hope that <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> could ever be made flexible, ſhe gave him fully to know that there was nothing between a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and cruel death, and the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age that was ſo much deſired. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> could not forbear ſighing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often during her Diſcourſe; and ſometimes caſting upon the Princeſs ſuch looks as were full of pity, and then again throwing moſt fierce and disdainful Ones on thoſe <hi>Tartars,</hi> who by the Emperors order had waited on her. <hi>Tamberlain</hi> then muſt judge of my Sentiments by his own, ſaid he to her, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades himſelf that I am capable of betraying the blood and the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59666:10"/>
of my Son, in joyning you to his executioner: No, my dear <hi>Orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi> added he, lifting up his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try eyes to Heaven, your <hi>ſhade</hi> ſhall never bluſh at an action ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worthy him who had given you a Being: you judge well, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, purſued he, to think that mine is hateful to me, and that in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable eſtate to which I am redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, I ſhall not make a great ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the <hi>Manes</hi> of <hi>Ortobulus,</hi> and to your repoſe, though I ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon it to the cruelty of my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: but, my <hi>Asteria,</hi> I will tell you more, and thoſe Miniſters of the horrid Acts of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> that do attend you, may report it to him; that though this Marriage might reſtore me to my higheſt Fortune, and I might hope from it for felicities as tranquill and untrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as my deſtiny has been uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; yet faithful to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my Son, and jealous of a glory, which all the proſperities of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59666:11"/>
the <hi>Tartars</hi> cannot obſcure, I would reſiſt what he exacts from us with the ſame courage you ſee me now refuſe it. Thus then, Seignior, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the Princeſs, you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved for a death that will expoſe me to all that can be imagined moſt bloody and diſmal. Think, that for my deſpair, I may be able to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive you: that the weakneſs of my Sex does neither permit me to make ſuch eſcapes, or go about ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, as if I had the ſtrength of the contrary: that I ſhall always remain <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s Captive, and the victim of <hi>Themir</hi>'s violences: and that through pity you owe this converſation to the perils where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I am threatned: Think your ſelf, replied the Emperour, that you will become the companion of all my miſeries; if you force me to prolong thoſe dayes which the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of my fate hath rendered but too long already: think, that after the loſs of an Empire, and liberty,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59666:11"/>
there is more weakneſs in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones diſgraces, than in ſeeing ones ſelf ſacrificed to them; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of exciting an unworthy pity which my glory would utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow, do you remember you have your extraction from the moſt illuſtrious blood in the World, and ſo look upon my death as an action that will crown all the former ones of my life: I ſhall leave you Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom poſſibly the bounty of Heaven will regard and pity. My death will ſuffice to appeaſe its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and from it you may receive aſſiſtances that will ſecure you from falling under thoſe evils which ſo much diſquiet you. Ah! Seignior, anſwered <hi>Aſteria,</hi> let us then joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect theſe Succours, for I will have none of them, if you do not likewiſe partake with me: Will you then marry <hi>Themir?</hi> Interrupted the Emperour coldly, will you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that the <hi>Ottoman ſhade</hi> ſhall reproach you for the ſhameful
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59666:12"/>
mingling the blood of <hi>Tamberlain</hi> with his? I would have you live, Seignior, cried the Princeſs out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grievouſly, or elſe I would die with you: At theſe words her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits failed her, which obliged them to carry her back to the Palace, without having made any concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and though <hi>Bajazet</hi> was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly touched at her grief, yet did he ſee her go away without changing his Reſolution in the leaſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf in putting up vows to Heaven for her, he waited his death with that undauntedneſs, which is only the partage of great and generous Souls.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who had been witneſſes of <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s viſit, made a very faithful relation of it to <hi>Tamberlain</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi> without ever forgetting the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy or the fierceneſs of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s anſwers. But yet they made ſome further efforts upon him and the Princeſs, to obtain of them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they deſired; but at laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59666:12"/>
the more they were preſt to it, the more they ſhewed their ſtubborneſs and reſolution, the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Prince was taken from his Priſon, and conducted to the place where Criminals were commonly put to death. All thoſe <hi>Tartars,</hi> that made any profeſſion of vertue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that action; <hi>Axalla, Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi>'s favourite, and one who was greatly renowned for his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary valour, uſed his utmoſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prevent it; but the Prince had a greater influence upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſpirit, and the unfortunate <hi>Bajazet</hi> was unworthily conducted to the Scaffold where he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to loſe his head.</p>
               <p>But how conſiderable ſoever the perſon was, yet was not this Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty ſuffered to have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: he went to the fatal place, as if he was the meaneſt of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, without any thing to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh him, beſides his reſolution, and an Air of greatneſs which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59666:13"/>
for all his miſeries to deſpoil him of: he was ſorrowful, but withal ſedate; and if his eyes had not in them all that vigour and ſprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as before, they loſt not their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity from any proſpect of fear or weakneſs. The houſes were deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, for all people flockt to the place of execution; And that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion having obliged a cavalier, who was juſt then arrived at <hi>Samarcanda,</hi> to demand the cauſe of it of ſome Inhabitants; he no ſooner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, but ſpurring on his Horſe with all the violence imaginable to the Scaffold, he rode through the throng, and came up cloſe to it juſt in that particle of time, as they were going to put a period to the days of one of the greateſt men in the World. His cryes and name ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended that fatal blow: Hold, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he out, it is <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> it is the ſon of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> who commands it of you. This Prince was dearly beloved by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59666:13"/>
with an extream affliction reſented his abſence; ſo that they ſolemnized his return with ſhowts of joy, which for ſome little time he gave way to; and then pray'd th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He ran to the Palace, where he gave an agreeable ſurpriſe, to thoſe whom his abſence had afflicted, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to <hi>Axalla,</hi> who alwayes had a moſt paſſionate love for him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the difference <hi>Tamberlain</hi> had put between his two Sons, the merit of <hi>Adanaxus</hi> diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his breaſt againſt the natural inclination he had for <hi>Themir,</hi> and his unexpected ſight cauſed in him ſo ſenſible a joy, that it forced him to expreſs it in a ſhower of Tears; the Prince received his embraces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees, and continuing in this ſubmiſſive poſture, Seignior, ſaid he to him, you ſee again at your feet a raſh man, who aſſured of your

'Tis an Enemy of a famous name and of a blood that is illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who is no longer in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to prove fatal to you, and whoſe precipitated loſs may be a blemiſh to your reputation. Think, Seignior, how happy it is to be in an eſtate to do favours of this kind to perſons who have reigned gloriouſly, and who are depreſſed meerly through the capriciouſneſs of fortune. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that of all vertues in Monarchs, Clemency is the moſt glorious, and deſerving praiſe: And at the name of a Son who conjures you to it, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize yours in the favours of a great, though now a wretched Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
               <p>

Thoſe words of the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> did not leſs aſtoniſh <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> then his return had affected him; he could not refrain commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within his breaſt the generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Son; but the importance of his demand ballanced this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made him remain unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. If it was any thing perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to him, to ſee proſtrate at his feet a Son worthy of eſteem, and the uncertainty where he had paſſed his life rendered him yet more dear, yet <hi>Bajazet</hi> contemning, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious to his deſigns, kept up his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. You ought to let me reſent the pleaſure of ſeeing you again, ſaid he to the Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermixing it with the trouble to demand of me a kindneſs which it is impoſſible for me to grant you: <hi>Bajazet</hi> has but too much deſerved that death to which he is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; he is an inſolent Captive, whoſe arrogance nothing is capable to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, who never ſpeaks my name
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59666:15"/>
but with contempt, and who would not ſpare my life, if he had over it that power which I have over his. I have for a long time indur'd it, but now my patience is quite worn out, and there are ſo many reaſons which authorize what I do, that I ſhould be blamed of imprudence or weakneſs, ſhould I act otherwiſe. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reaſons you are pleaſed to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for his ruine, Seignior, Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> you yet have more to pardon him; The Example you will leave to poſterity, the pleaſure that comes from a good action, and your own glory, which would be deeply concerned in cauſing ſo great a Prince to fall, whom his ſevere deſtiny has delivered into your hands, ought to triumph over all thoſe other conſiderations. Think, Seignior, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> has not long ſince ſeen what you are at preſent, yet the fate of Arms is capricious, it may do again for him what it has done for you; and if you are out of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59666:15"/>
a proſpect of fearing; you have Sons, who may one day meet with Conquerours, and who may implore the ſame grace I now demand: Do not you then give an Example of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, but make ſome reflection upon the uncertainty of what future times may prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamberlain</hi> began to ſtagger at the preſſing Reaſons of the young Prince of <hi>Tanaïs,</hi> he revolved in his mind the circumſtances of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s fate, what he had been, what he was, and conſidering that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was riſen from a mean fortune to one of the moſt glorious conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, and that he might by ſome return or other fall into the laſt of miſeries, even that in which he ſaw his Enemy. You have conquered me, Prince, ſaid he to his Son, the tenderneſs I have for you carries me above my reſentment, and in a day that Heaven ſends me a Son which I have lamented, it is juſt Igrant you ſomething may teſtify
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59666:16"/>
how acknowledging I am: Let <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> live, I am willing to conſent to it, but my Son, you muſt endeavour to overcome his pride, and make, if poſſible, an unjuſt Princeſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, whom the condition of a Captive, my entreaties, my offers, the love and ſubmiſſions of <hi>Themir,</hi> have not been able to get her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to marry him, and if you are as ſenſible of my ſatisfaction as I am of yours, order it ſo, that the conſent of <hi>Bajazet</hi> to this marriage, be the reward of that life you render to him. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> underſtood by that diſcourſe, that <hi>Themir</hi>'s love for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteria</hi> was the cauſe of that cruelty that <hi>Tamberlain</hi> was going to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and overjoyed that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him, he made what haſt he could to prevent its being ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>He got himſelf upon the ſcaffold, where <hi>Bajazet</hi> with an unſhaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy did wait his doom. He cut the Cord that tyed that Prince his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59666:16"/>
hands, and ſaluting him with as much eſpect as if <hi>Bajazet</hi> had been upon he <hi>Ottoman</hi> Throne. Receive, Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, ſaid he to him, this ſervice from a man, who happy as he eſteems him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in rendring it to you, would not at the price of all his blood but have done it, and who would give a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lives ſuch as his, if he had them, to make you forget the neceſſity that obliged him to give you ſo ſhameful a mark of that eſteem and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he has for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adanaxus</hi> had a charming Meen, and delivered his words with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo tender and generous, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was more enamoured with his ſight, than with that life he had conſerved to him. He regarded him with all the attention poſſible to be given to a diſcourſe ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and as if his misfortune had not wrought any alteration upon his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Although my life be given me upon condition, ſaid he to him, and by it I prolong thoſe evils which I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59666:17"/>
ſhould be glad to put a period to, yet I receive it from you without a difficulty, and the condition in which I am, does not keep me from being ſenſible of this obligation, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent virtue you diſcover does already intereſs me in what concerns you, and I receive no ſmall conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that I have furniſhed you with a means of giving ſuch remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable proofs, of it. Let us go, Prince, purſued he, holding out his hand to him, let us return from the Scaffold to the Priſon, and there wait for the laſt decrees of heaven: You ſhall ſee me again, <hi>Aſteria,</hi> added he, drying up ſome tears, which the remembrance of that Princeſs drew from his eyes, you ſhall ſee me again, if that tender love of yours for a miſerable Father, has not made it fatal to you.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the people by their cryes were applauding the generoſity of <hi>Adanaxus</hi> and the ſafety of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he was reconducted to his priſon, and the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59666:17"/>
orders for all things that might ſweeten it to him, returned to the Palace. He there met with <hi>Themir,</hi> who complemented him, but with ſo much coldneſs and indifference, that one might viſibly obſerve in it the remains of that old hatred that had obliged <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to leave <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi> He was extremely troubled to find him ſtill ſo implacable, but as he did not intend to make a long ſtay at <hi>Samarcanda,</hi> being called elſewhere by powerful reaſons, he reſolved for ſome time to bear with the injuſtices of his Brother; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſpent part of the Evening with <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> he withdrew to his Apartment with <hi>Axalla,</hi> in a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of joy, that he had relieved <hi>Bajazet</hi> from ſo ignominious a death.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they were without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, they began to ſpeak to one another in their uſual way of an open freedom: There had continually been between them a very ſtrict
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59666:18"/>
bond of friendſhip, and though <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla's</hi> age was already advanced, he was of ſuch a ſweet and obliging temper, that perſons of all Ages were infinitely taken with his company, and he was not leſs charming in his converſation, than was his valour to be feared when ever he came into the Field. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> asked him a thouſand queſtions, both about the war, and indeed every thing elſe he thought himſelf ignorant of; <hi>Axalla</hi> gave him a particular account of all things, and ſtruck him with a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for the inhumane actions of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi> eſpecially for the death of young <hi>Ortobulus,</hi> whom with his own hand he had cruelly murthered, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a battel where that young Prince had done immortal actions, and from whence he went out ſo wounded, that he might have expected the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of a generous Enemy, with a great deal of more reaſon than the death he had received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adanaxus</hi> was enraged at that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59666:18"/>
piece of barbarity, but paſſing from diſcourſes of war to thoſe of love, <hi>Axalla</hi> who had a moſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite reſpect for <hi>Aſteria,</hi> by having ſometimes the priviledge of ſeeing her, gave a moſt noble Character to <hi>Adanaxus</hi> of all thoſe charms that rendred her adorable. She had ſo many, and they were ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly repreſented by <hi>Axalla,</hi> that he was ſurpriſed not to find in the Prince the leaſt motion of curioſity, and blamed him for his too great indifference for Ladies. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your ſelf, <hi>Axalla,</hi> replied the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> ſighing as he ſpake, that Sex has too great an Empire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, and my heart could ſpeak to you more juſtly than any tongue, of the ſenſible proof I have made of it. 'Tis neither any contempt nor any fear of <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s charms, that keeps me from having a curioſity to ſee them: I honour beauty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſee it, and am too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by another object, to have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59666:19"/>
any fear of that of the Princeſs, but I am not willing to preſent before her the Son of a man who within this hour would have rob'd her of her Fathers life, as alſo the brother of him that murthered <hi>Ortobulus.</hi> I will, if poſſible, during that little ſtay I ſhall make at <hi>Samarcanda,</hi> act with ſome profit for his repoſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour before I ſee her, by my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to efface whatſoever the names of <hi>Tartar,</hi> of the Son of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> and of the Brother of <hi>Themir</hi> might have, that is deteſtable to her. What Seignior, ſaid <hi>Axalla,</hi> are you in pain whilſt you continue here, that you talk of your removal? and have you given us a ſence of the joy of your return, only that we ſhould have the greater grief to think of your departure? When you ſhall have heard the reaſons of it, replied <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> you will confeſs they are not unlawful, but that it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for my repoſe to go from <hi>Samar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canda.</hi> You know Seignior, replied

                  <hi>Axalla,</hi> the paſſionate intereſt I have taken all my life for your concerns, and I am in an earneſt impatience to have your reaſons told me, therefore I ſhall be infinitely obliged to you, if you will give me ſome ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them.

I knew <hi>Tamberlain</hi> had a moſt invincible ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and that all the <hi>Tartars</hi> had the like affections, and though I found them unjuſt, yet to do nothing that might one day reproach me, I caſt my ſelf into the Emperour <hi>Paleologus</hi> his party, who made head againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whilſt thoſe two Sons <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Emanuel</hi> defended other Provinces. My firſt eſſay was very favourable to my reputation, and without any ambition of being thought a Hero, I may affirm to you <hi>Axalla,</hi> that my actions began to make the name of <hi>Arſanes</hi> eminently conſiderable. The Emperour gave me many ſignal teſtimonies of his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59666:21"/>
eſteem, and finding himſelf in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger out of which I had the fortune to diſengage him, he made a publick acknowledgment of the ſervice I did him, and would not permit me to be abſent from him.</p>
                  <p>We had a pretty equal ſucceſs in both Armies, the battels were ſo much favoured by the ſeaſon, but Winter coming on we were oblig'd to give our Troops ſome reſt: The <hi>Turk</hi> retired into his Country, and <hi>Paleologus</hi> went back again to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> where his Sons were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to meet him. We arrived there nevertheleſs a Month before them: the Court was very glorious, the Empreſs, beſides her two daughters, <hi>Eudoxia</hi> and <hi>Leonida,</hi> had about her perſon a great many others, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable by their birth, as they were moſt killingly fair to all their behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Mine were dazled with them without being wounded, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which had other perſecutions in reſerve for me, in this occaſion ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59666:21"/>
love unpowerful. The grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Emperour did very obligingly ſound my Elogy to all the world, and unknown as I was at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I bore there a quality but little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to that I ought to have been in. Becauſe the war was in no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood to be concluded, I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpend ſome time at the Court, receiving there a thouſand civilities from the Emperour, the Princeſſes, and from the moſt conſiderable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A few days after our arrival, the Emperour received the news that the Princes had defeated a party of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and taken a good number of them priſoners, but that which qualified the joy of this good ſucceſs, was that among thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners there was a Lady ſo beautiful, that it was reported <hi>Andronicus</hi> was become paſſionately in love with her. <hi>Paleologus</hi> who was ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the uncontroulable humour of his Son, and who knew
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59666:22"/>
very well that he had no moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him, when ever he had a mind to any thing, did much fear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this paſſion, and as ſoon as <hi>Andronicus</hi> and the priſoners were arrived, he perceived his fear was too legitimate. When firſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port came to us of that love, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the frailty and eaſineſs of that Prince's heart, and the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his choice. But <hi>Axalla,</hi> I was puniſhed likewiſe by the ſame fate, for I no ſooner had caſt my eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her who had conquered him, but I felt the kindlings of an ardour in me, which fully aſſured me that I was fallen into the ſame condition. <hi>Axalla,</hi> what all the beauties of <hi>Greece</hi> had not the power to do, was in one moment effected by a Fair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: the ſatigue of a great jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and the grief of her captivity, could not render her leſs beautiful to my eyes. Her paleneſs appeared to me to be infinitely charming, and the indifference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59666:22"/>
ſhe ſhewed to gain any victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, rendred her in my opinion more deſerving to conquer all. Many hearts were forced to ſubmit to her powers as well as mine, and <hi>Neris,</hi> (for ſo the Captive was called) in a ſhort time became the charm of all <hi>Paleologus</hi>'s Courtiers, as ſhe was the object of jealouſie among all the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Ladies.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I perceived my love, and was out of all hopes to overcome it, I found my ſelf the Rival of <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> I was one unknown, he was the Emperour's Son and could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all things, where I could hope for nothing; but as repute and fortune do not always contribute to the felicity of Lovers, but it is love and the diſpoſition of hearts which does determine it, I reſolved to conceal mine and thought I might ſucceed better by that diſcretion than by a publick declaration which poſſibly might be a means to remove me from the adorable <hi>Neris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59666:23"/>
You may very well conceive, <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla,</hi> that that procedure ſo contrary to my wiſhes, did not give me a ſmall affliction, my paſſion encreaſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day and my mind was divided between the neceſſity of being ſilent and that of ſpeaking, ſo that I could not reſolve with my ſelf which to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to, my reaſon made me fly that which a violent inclination compel'd me to look after, maugre all its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks. My eyes ſometimes were not ſo circumſpect as they ought to have been, and when by accident they were caſt upon thoſe of <hi>Neris,</hi> they made her a thouſand declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but whether ſhe did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, or whether ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to do it, thoſe dumb diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were very ſhort and withal but ſeldom.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Andronicus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured the Emperour by all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and ſubmiſſions imaginable, that might perſwade a Father to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign <hi>Neris</hi> to his love. The inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59666:23"/>
of Fortune, he ſaid, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently recompenced by the merit of <hi>Neris;</hi> and beſides her beauty which was extreme ſurpriſing, ſhe abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo many charms both in her wit and humour, that the Prince thought he had a ſufficient Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity openly to make this demand; the Emperour acknowledged all the advantage of <hi>Neris;</hi> and he had a very high eſteem for her, and in his breaſt did not abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Sentiments of <hi>Andronicus;</hi> but having more profitable Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his eye, for the good of the Empire: and the calamities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Greece</hi> was menaced, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to be avoided, but by the ſupport of a puiſſance which might oppoſe the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to divert his Son by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies of State; but ſeeing him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of them, he, like an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Father, forbad him ever to ſpeak to him any further about the marriage: this prohibition increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59666:24"/>
the fierceneſs of <hi>Andronicus;</hi> and made him to anſwer the Emperour in terms that were little reſpectful, and from that time he laboured to put himſelf into a condition to be only dependent upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Things were in theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for two Months, and the Princes ſtayed well near three at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> before I had ever ſpoke to <hi>Neris</hi> any otherwiſe then in general converſation. It was hard to meet with occaſions of ſpeaking to her in private, and I durſt not openly ſeek them; but an accident preſented one to me, which I did not in the leaſt expect, and which you may well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I did not fail to make uſe of.</p>
                  <p>I was walking one Morning in the Palace Gardens, where commonly I was wont to reflect upon my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and for that purpoſe I ſought out the moſt ſolitary places to walk in. I found <hi>Neris</hi> in one of them that was leaſt frequented; and beſides the raviſhing ſurpriſe her
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59666:24"/>
ſight gave me, I had a greater to ſee her in ſuch a place, and at ſuch a time. O <hi>Axalla,</hi> how beautiful did ſhe appear to me, and in what a tranſport was I at my good fortune? One might obſerve in her complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a kind of bluſhing freſhneſs, like to that which is borrowed from Sleep; the undreſs ſhe was then in preſented to ones eyes a thouſand Beauties which moſt commonly ſhe kept concealed. And the trouble ſhe had upon her when ſhe ſaw me, gave me a pretty kind of an I do not know what timidity, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me more paſſionate and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. I cannot tell whether ſhe took notice of it, or whether it was only in civility that ſhe judged it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to withdraw, but ſhe had done ſo, if I had not ſtayed her. Ah, fair <hi>Neris,</hi> ſaid I to her, do not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away with you all the delicacies of theſe places; But ſuffer an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſtranger to enjoy by your preſence thoſe he never thought to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59666:25"/>
meet with. <hi>Neris</hi> ſeemed aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at my diſcourſe, and looking with her face towards the ground; A miſerable Captive, ſaid ſhe, is a very unfit perſon to contribute to the delights of any place, and in a converſation ſo languiſhing as yours you will but throw away that time, which you may imploy to a much better purpoſe. Would to Heaven, Madam, replied I, I could give all that of my life, and withal you would permit it, I would never elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſeek a ſatisfaction which only you can procure me. Such an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs you now expreſs would be altogether new, anſwered ſhe very negligently, and you would have much a do to perſwade me into a faith that you had ſo paſſionate a one for that which till now appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me very indifferent to you. I confeſs, replied I, without preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to dive into what might oblige <hi>Neris</hi> to ſpeak ſo, I took upon me an Indifference abſolutely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59666:25"/>
to thoſe ſentiments that were real in me: But, Madam, the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Heart, and thoſe of the countenance do not alwayes run parallel, and if you pleaſe to have that goodneſs to diſtinguiſh them, I could very well juſtify that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whereof you accuſe me. I accuſe you of nothing, interrupted <hi>Neris</hi> very briskly, and perceive your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference is leſs criminal, than perhaps would be a cloſer applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but whatſoever your move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, the calamities I indure do not give me the libertie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf about them, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of my life is ſo great, that it does not permit me to think of things wherein I have no Intereſt. Ah! Madam, cryed I to my ſelf, in a tranſport of paſſion, you never had a greater in any heart in the World then you have in mine: there is none ſo abſolutely devoted to you, and though you ſeem to ſet ſo light by it, there ſhall never be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59666:26"/>
any capable to give you the ſervices that this ſhall undertake for you. I have made it my great care and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to conceal what I diſcover to you now, that ſo I might not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my ſelf to the fury of a Rival, who at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful then I am, and who I fear has enough to countermand my ſtaying in it; but ſince my fate gives me this opportunity to ſpeak to you without any witneſſes, ſuffer me to explain, Madam, and to tell you, though I appear here unknown yet your condition might be as happy with <hi>Arſanes</hi> as with the Son of the Emperour of <hi>Greece.</hi> All the while I was ſpeaking, <hi>Neris</hi>'s eyes were fixed on mine, and in ſpight of all her reſervedneſs, I knew by her bluſhing, by her ſilence, and by a joy that ſeemed full of fear, which at laſt appeared in her face, ſhe wiſhed there might be no untruth in what I had ſaid. One muſt love very paſſionately to penetrate into all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59666:26"/>
theſe things, but I did not loſe any one circumſtance of them and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an happy application of them to my ſelf, I became thereby both more Eloquent, and hardy. I made uſe of that time that <hi>Neris</hi> was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to give her an account of the birth of my paſſion, and did it with ſo much ſincerity that I began to make her believe it. She ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me at that time, for the coming in of ſome perſons obliged her to retire: But I could very well gueſs it by the looks ſhe gave me; and I flattered my ſelf with this thought, that when one has the art to perſwade well, one is not very far from that of pleaſing well too.</p>
                  <p>From that time I had my eyes more languiſhing upon her, <hi>Neris</hi> accuſtomed her ſelf to their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſometimes likewiſe hers in her ſuppriſe made me ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes as were very obliging; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I found out ſeveral ways
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59666:27"/>
to renew the converſation in the Garden, where I ſpoke in ſuch a tender and preſſing manner, that I brought <hi>Neris</hi> to a compliance of receiving the offer of my love: the firſt mark ſhe gave me of her eſteem, was her making me the confident of her thoughts, ſhe confeſſed ſhe had a natural averſion for <hi>Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> that his greatneſs and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were not capable of ſhaking her, and though he ſhould be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of <hi>Paleologus</hi>'s Throne, he ſhould never be dearer to her heart, nor more agreeable to her eyes. I anſwered <hi>Neris,</hi> that I was afraid this averſion was general for all men: and ſhe made me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by a ſigh, one half of which her Modeſty deprived me of, that in her breaſt the Fate of <hi>Andronicus</hi> did not determine that of the reſt of Mankind. I did whatever I could to improve the diſcourſe, and to find out what her fortune was: But all I could learn from her was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59666:27"/>
that ſhe was born in the heart of <hi>Africa,</hi> of a quality ſufficiently il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, and that ſhe had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Pyrates, and afterwards ſold to thoſe whom <hi>Andronicus</hi> had taken priſoners.</p>
                  <p>My paſſion every day grew more violent, and I wiſhed from my ſoul that Heaven would be pleaſed to find out a way for me to ſhow it to <hi>Neris</hi> by ſome extraordinary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: but that was difficult to bring about in a Forreign Court, where I was without any power. My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny was ſo favourable to me as to overcome that difficulty, and you ſhall hear of an adventure which you could never have imagined.</p>
                  <p>The preoccupation of <hi>Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> ſeemed to increaſe by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance that was made againſt it, and the Emperour not knowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further what means to uſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, thought that abſence only could do the buſineſs, and that he was obliged by neceſſity to deprive
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59666:28"/>
the Prince of an object that became fatal to the repoſe of a State. He had no very ſpecious pretence pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to put that deſign into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and indeed I know not when he would have had one, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious as he was of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humour of his Son, he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to ſerve himſelf with any, which made him reſolve that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſhould be privately carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and that free liberty ſhould be given her to go where ſhe pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>It was an eaſie matter for him to effect it, &amp; Princes do not want per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who, without examining the commands they give them, do blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run to perform all their Orders. The deſign was told them, and the hour ſtated; and <hi>Neris</hi> was taken from her Apartment, about the middle of the night, and making her to croſs the Palace-Gardens, ſhe was conducted to the ſea-ſide which ran by them, where waited a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ready to ſet ſail for the firſt port
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59666:28"/>
dependant upon any other Prince. <hi>Neris</hi> is Naturally of an even and well balanced temper, and not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried out to make any out-cries or rude efforts. But as ſhe thought her Raviſhers were imployed by the Prince, ſhe threatned them with the Emperours Authority, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them the injuſtice they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the perſon of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, who was then without any to defend her; thoſe words reached a place where very frequently I u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſpend the beſt part of the night in walking, I preſently knew it to be <hi>Neris</hi>'s voyce, and finding them going to uſe ſome violence to her: No, Madam, ſaid I, putting my hand to my ſword, you ſhall not be taken away before my Face, and though I be ſingle in your defence, yet poſſibly I may behave my ſelf with ſucceſs enough to make theſe raſh men repent they ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took ſuch an Enterpriſe; thoſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows laughed at the threats I made
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59666:29"/>
them, and dividing themſelves, one part of their company to ingage with me, whilſt the reſt were to carry <hi>Neris</hi> away, they did what they could to get to their Boat. But, <hi>Axalla,</hi> one is not ſenſible of any danger when one is imployed in the preſerving of the object of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted Love. I laid down two of the Villains at my Feet with the firſt paſſes I made, and ſo clearing my way to <hi>Neris,</hi> with a reverſe blow, I ſtruck off the man's Arm who held her, and gave her the liberty of ſaving her ſelf by running through the Garden. Thoſe perſons who were ordered to carry her away, without making any great attempt upon my life, left me to run after her, and by that means reſcued me from a danger, in which I ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe moſt certainly have fell. I purſued them, and forcing them to turn and ingage with me; I had received two dangerous wounds, before ſome of the Emperour's
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59666:29"/>
Guards, who were got thither by <hi>Neris</hi>'s outcries came to my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and knowing me to be highly in the favour of their Maſter, they obliged thoſe that reſiſted me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to their heels; they would not have fled, had they dared to diſcover themſelves, for they were Meſſengers of an Order that was ſufficiently warrantable, but they were ſworn to ſecrecy till they had got her to Sea, and they judged it better for them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Emperour with what had happened, than to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of publiſhing what they had ſuch a ſtrict charge to conceal.</p>
                  <p>I loſt ſo much blood, that my ſtrength was quite gone, and I fell at <hi>Neris</hi>'s Feet in a trance: but yet my weakneſs did not prevent me from hearing the obliging com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſhe made againſt Fate, and the affliction wherewith ſhe did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her ſelf for my misfortune; ſhe her ſelf indeavoured what ſhe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59666:30"/>
could to ſtop my bleeding, but the pleaſure I reſented in perceiving <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> to take ſuch pains, made my blood guſh out with greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſo that all thought it would prove fatal to me; they recondu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me to my Apartment, and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was led by <hi>Andronicus</hi> unto hers, who was come thither at the noiſe he heard of her being taken away; He bewailed me, proteſted ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would be revenged on the Author of that bold attempt, and <hi>Neris,</hi> ignorant all this while of the truth, demanded the next day ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Emperour for it in her name and mine. He was obliged either to grant it her, or publickly to juſtifie the procedure, and not daring to take the latter courſe, through the fear he was in of his Sons furious tranſports, he ſent one of his principal Officers to declare to me the myſtery of that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and to teſtifie to me the grief he was in, that ſhe ſhould be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59666:30"/>
of my loſs of ſo much blood: the ſame Officer was ordered to diſcourſe with me about the means of impoſing ſilence upon <hi>Neris,</hi> and of ſtifling the buſineſs; ſhe believes her ſelf mightily obliged to you, ſaid the Gentleman to me, and at the firſt word will put it up, if you will but adviſe her to it. Counſel her not any farther to ſearch into the buſineſs, but let her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that poſſibly a greater noiſe would bring along with it but more troubleſome conſequences.</p>
                  <p>I knew what I had to ſay to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and was not in a power to hide any thing from her; but that ſo I might have ſome pretence for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her without being under any ſuſpicion; I promiſed to obey the Emperor's will, and that procured me many a happy hour with the fair <hi>Neris</hi> by way of viſit to me.</p>
                  <p>She acquainted me how that ſince that accident <hi>Andronicus,</hi> fearing leſt any other ſhould be ſtrongly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59666:31"/>
preſſing her to marry, aſſured her he had found out a way to marry her himſelf in ſpight of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; you may very well imagine what Counſel I gave her, and what diſcourſes Love put into my head. My prayers and proteſtations ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring her more oppoſite to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> did likewiſe render my Rivals paſſion more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous. She grew into a fury; and one day among the reſt, after ſome propoſitions more preſſing yet than ordinary, he made her know, ſhe was to fear the worſt that could be from his violence, and that he was now weary of uſing only his Intreaties and Submiſſions. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then to leave my Chamber, and went to make my firſt devoirs to the Empreſs, where I met with <hi>Neris</hi> going out of the Princeſs's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and knew by the ſadneſs of her Countenance, that her breaſt laboured under a very great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Prince was juſt gone from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59666:31"/>
making thoſe threatnings to her which I have told you of: her heart was almoſt dead with fear, and her eyes ready to burſt into a ſhower of tears: what has happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to you, Madam, ſaid I to her? your eyes reveal ſomething that is fatal to my love, and if my jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies be juſt, though altogether weak, and a ſtranger as I am here in this place; yet you ſhall ſee I'll make my vengeance be dreaded by them. I can eaſily judge what you can do by that which you have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, anſwered <hi>Neris</hi> to me; But, <hi>Arſanes,</hi> all your generoſity cannot hinder me from <hi>Andronicus</hi> his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions. He continues his addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to me to marry him, and now threatens to uſe his power, if he finds not his Love ſufficient. Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid I, interrupting her, in a great paſſion, and how do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his threats? As a perſon, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued <hi>Neris,</hi> who imagines nothing can be more cruel than for ever to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59666:32"/>
be ingaged to a man whom I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love. Ah! Madam, continued I, you ſhall never then be ingaged to him, relie upon the word and conduct of a Prince, who in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place than <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> would not ſubmit either to the Son of the Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Prince in the world. Have Courage, Madam, take elſewhere upon you a quality more conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your merit, than that of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; the Sea and my valour ſhall find us wayes for it, by conducting you eitherto the place of your Birth, or to ſuch retreats as ſhall be far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from <hi>Andronicus</hi> his attempts upon you: be not afraid of my Love, it is extreme indeed, but my reſpect is extreme likewiſe: You ſhall find in me a paſſionate Guide to whom the perſon is ſacred, and a Defender, who will ſacrifice his fortune and his life to your ſafety. <hi>Neris</hi> hearkned to me with a great deal of indulgence, and teſtified to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59666:32"/>
me by her looks the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her heart; but yet I could not perſwade her to it; therefore I thought my true name might have a greater influence over her than my words, and acquainted her with it: but it would put me to a great deal of pains to expreſs to you the trouble that this Declaration gave her.</p>
                  <p>She looked upon me a good while, as if ſhe had not known me, bluſhed, ſighed, was ſpeechleſs, and indeed all her Actions ſhowed me the confuſion ſo great a ſurpriſe put her into. However ſhe aſſured me, that being fully perſwaded of the reality of my diſcourſe, ſhe would have a grateful ſenſe of my offers, which ſhould be as laſting as her life: but the more conſiderable I became to her ſhe had the leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to hazard ſo great a Prince. I neither forgot to make uſe of Oaths, or Prayers, to conquer thoſe Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and to oblige her to remove
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59666:33"/>
from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but all my ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts were inſignificant: ſhe alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me reaſons of reſpect, to which for fear of diſpleaſing her, I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſubmit; and leaving me, as if ſhe was fearful, ſhe might in her turn be vanquiſhed: do not joyn your ſelf to my misfortunes, Seignior, ſaid ſhe to me, perhaps fate will not diſtinguiſh you from <hi>Neris,</hi> and you may fall into ſuch evil circumſtances, as may make me to deſpair that I was the cauſe of them.</p>
                  <p>I would have followed her to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her not to harbour ſuch a fear, and to aſſure her that in what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver place her fortune ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her, I would inſeparately wait upon her: but the Empreſs croſſing the place where we were, to go to the Walks, perceived me, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to me, obliged me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Andronicus</hi> was not Idle; he had in part diſcovered
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59666:33"/>
the cauſe of <hi>Neris</hi>'s being carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and believing he might do what he had a mind to againſt a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who was reſolved to deprive him of the ſight of his Miſtreſs: he got together a good number of lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty reſolute young Fellows, &amp; made a dangerous Inſurrection. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror reſiſted it as well as he could, and I was ſo fortunate at that time, not to be a little profitable to him. <hi>Andronicus</hi> was taken, and added the ſhame of being overcome, to that of having made an attempt upon the Crown, and the life of his Father. The older and more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced of the Emperors Council, were for having him to ſpend the remainder of his dayes in priſon; Prince <hi>Emanuel,</hi> being of a moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſweet diſpoſition, oppoſed that advice, and with ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages he might hope to have over the unfortunate <hi>Andronicus,</hi> he did ſo ingeniouſly work upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Spirit, that after the firſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59666:34"/>
heats of reſentment were over, he received the Rebel's pardon, and promis'd him to forget the Crime.</p>
                  <p>But he had more need to repent of that too great clemency of his; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus</hi> did not appear ſubmiſſive but to get his libertie, which he no ſooner obtained, but he made a new inſurrection, and as you have heard, almoſt brought the <hi>Grecian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to its laſt deſtruction. I could not ingage my ſelf in theſe diſſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I had in the former been ſo much concern'd as I have told you; but ſcarce had they begun to break out, but <hi>Neris</hi> diſappear'd at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> without any bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to diſcover either the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her departure, or the place where ſhe had choſen her retreat. At firſt I accuſed the Emperour for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſed her to be carried away a ſecond time; and beſides my grief I made to him a confeſſion of my Love, and I conjured him to tell me where I ſhould find what he had
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59666:34"/>
convei'd away from me: But he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proteſted he knew nothing of her flight. I could not turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my ſuſpicions upon <hi>Andronicus,</hi> for he was almoſt driven to deſperation at it, and from that accident derived the chief pretence of his revolt. All hope then abandon'd me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only that of ſearching my ſelf for her, which made me prepare to do it in all the corners oſ the Earth; but I was ſurpriſed by a violent Feaver, which kept me languiſhing very neer two Months at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Emperour had given them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to purſue his ungrateful Son, and to make him fly where he might never hear of him again. Prince <hi>Emanuel</hi> had command of the Army, and as I extreamly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd him, I ſhould have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad to have kept him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but the Remembrance of <hi>Neris</hi> was ſo much upon my Spirits, that I could not think of doing any thing, but to go and find her
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59666:35"/>
out. I parted from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> after I had complemented the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and embarked my ſelf to paſs into <hi>Africa,</hi> where according to what <hi>Neris</hi> had told me, I hoped I ſhould hear ſome news of her. I will not tell you how oft I expoſed my ſelf to death, how many dangers I ran, ſometimes beaten by tempeſts, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſſaulted by Pyrates; how many Countries I have ſeen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unknown to Mankind, with a thouſand other circumſtances of my voyage, they would make my relation too prolix: Let it ſuffice I tell you that I have learnt no news of <hi>Neris,</hi> and that her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſerves only to augment my paſſion. After I had ſpent four Years unprofitably I came again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aſia,</hi> I underſtood the great revolutions that had happened there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the downfall of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, and the captivity of the dreadful <hi>Bajazet;</hi> I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>Axalla,</hi> I could not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59666:35"/>
keep my ſelf from pittying him, and knowing <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s humour, I did fear what has come to paſs, and what I have been ſo happy to prevent: the thoughts of it made me tremble again, and how unjuſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Emperour had been to me, yet did Love infuſe ſomething in him of a paternal tenderneſs: I came back with all the haſt I could to <hi>Samarcanda,</hi> where I arrived juſt in ſufficient time to prevent the misfortune which would never have given me any comfort. You have now in a few words a very faithful account of the eſtate of my life, if you have at any time been ſenſible of the power of Love, you may judg, <hi>Axalla,</hi> if any thing be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to give me a repoſe, ſo long as I ſhall hear nothing concerning <hi>Neris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> having left off ſpeaking, <hi>Axalla</hi> told him for his conſolation all that he could
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59666:36"/>
think was able to make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on his ſpirit. It was late e're they parted, and the Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of <hi>Adanaxus</hi> being renew'd by the recital he had made, cauſed him to paſs the night away in the greateſt ſorrow imaginable.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Princeſs <hi>Asteria</hi> had very deeply reſented the Joy of <hi>Bajazet's</hi> ſafety, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour he had received came from a very dear hand, and the Prince, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his happineſs, had no mind to foreſee that the daughter of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour was the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he had loved under the name of <hi>Neris</hi> in the Court of <hi>Paleologus,</hi> and whom he ſtill loved with ſo violent a paſſion. The report of <hi>Adanax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s return had no ſooner came to the ears of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princeſs, but all her grief for him was ſuſpended. She loved this young Prince as much as her vertue could permit her, he had a very tender place in her remembrance, and ſhe could
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59666:36"/>
not without a tranſport hear he had been preſerved in ſo tedious a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; but when to this news was joyned the ſervice he had lately rendered her in the perſon of <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet,</hi> her joy became ſo powerful, that ſhe could no longer keep it concealed in her breaſt. She did imagine he knew her for <hi>Neris,</hi> and her return into <hi>Burſa</hi> was with too much noiſe not to have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in <hi>Greece,</hi> ſhe flattered her ſelf with the thoughts that he ſtill lov'd her, ſince he came ſo far, and that too to give her ſo eminent an inſtance of it: and looking out <hi>Axalla,</hi> who, as ſhe had obſerved, frequently did viſit him, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly confeſſ'd ſhe had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream kindneſs for the Prince, and moſt paſſionately complayned to him that he had not given her the means to tell him her ſelf how greatful a ſenſe ſhe had of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had done her. I know ſo perfectly the character of your
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59666:37"/>
Soul, Madam, replied <hi>Axalla,</hi> that I foreſaw that gratitude, before it was poſſible for me to ſee the effects of it; and I would fain have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Prince to do what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: But as he is indued with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity beyond example, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to me the unwillingneſs he had to preſent-before your eyes a Prince, who cannot be innocent in your account ſince he is the Son of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> and the Brother of <hi>Themir: Aſteria</hi> grew pale at theſe words, and giving them a cruel explication, ſhe fancied the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of blood had abſolutely ſtifled thoſe of Love, and that <hi>Neris</hi> was no longer charming to <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> ſince he knew her to be the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Bajazet.</hi> But yet ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſomething elſe was the cauſe of her trouble, and the reſt of the converſation was ſpent in general complements and civilities. But as ſoon as <hi>Axalla</hi> was retired, ſhe called a Woman, who had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59666:37"/>
her in All her misfortunes, and from whom none of her thoughts were a reſerve. Ah, <hi>Xaira,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, what have I learnt? Alas, in vain I flattered my ſelf with the thoughts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beloved by <hi>Adanaxus</hi> at his return, and hoped to ſee him again with the ſame tranſports which he expreſſed when I was at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> He was only concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for my Father out of generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Neris</hi> was not in the leaſt the occaſion of that adventure, and far from doing any meritorious ſervice to me, and expecting any recompence from it, he came not to ſee me, but to prefer the duty of the Son of <hi>Tamberlain</hi> to thoſe of the paſſionate <hi>Arſanes.</hi> Alas! <hi>Xaira,</hi> how criminal is my weakneſs rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how good would it be for me to follow that example he ſet before me, if I was capable of intimating it. I had in my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes the comfort to believe he did
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59666:38"/>
not any wayes contribute to them, they were leſs afflictive to me, and in a time when Heaven had taken all things from me, I flattered my felf with the thoughts that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for me a heart which I had no leſs an eſteem for, then for the Empire of <hi>Bajazet.</hi> But I have loſt it, <hi>Xaira,</hi> that heart which was ſo dear to me, that I gave it all my own; <hi>Adanaxus</hi> will not bely the cruelty of the blood of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> and more barbarous then our Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, he procures the ſorrowful <hi>Aſteria</hi> a misfortune which all the cruelties of the Emperour of the <hi>Tartars</hi> were not able alone to give her. I do declare the puniſhment of it by the criminal remembrance I have conſerved of a Man, who has only teſtifyed to me an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant affection, and by the weakneſs which forces me ſtill ſo deeply to reſent his levity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Xaira</hi> interrupted the Princeſs by indeavouring to comfort her, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59666:38"/>
told her all ſhe thought was capable to make her doubt her misfortune, or to reinforce her courage; but ſhe gave no great heed to her, but abandoning her ſelf wholly to her error, ſhe caſt a thouſand reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es upon the young Prince, whilſt he, blindly carried away with the deſire of finding out his <hi>Neris,</hi> was preparing for a ſecond Voyage all the Earth over, and found a great deal of difficulty to give his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity a few dayes reſt at <hi>Samarcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Themir</hi> had ſeen him arrive there with an inraged mind, and could not ſuffer him to continue in it without giving him ſome Teſtimonies of it. He had flattered himſelf with the hopes that he ſhould never have ſeen him again, and perceiving he was not returned, but only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a victime from the effect of his vengeance, he was continually preſſing <hi>Tamberlain</hi> to put <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59666:39"/>
he had granted to the Prince the life of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> or elſe to have him reconducted to the Scaffold from whence he had been taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tamberlain</hi> perſecuted on the one hand with the ſolicitations of his Son, and excited on the other hand by his own natural cruelties, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Prince <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to go viſit the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour and to imploy the credit which ſo ſtrict an obligation had given him with him, to obtain <hi>Aſteria</hi> of him. But though <hi>Adanaxus</hi> was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he ſhould never bring <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Spirit to a compliance to ſuch a demand, yet he owed ſo much obedience to <hi>Tamberlain</hi> as this came to. He went then to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon where <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s Father was, with a reſolution to uſe all the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means he could to gain him to it, and to make him conſider after all, that the quality of being Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of the <hi>Tartars</hi> was not a thing for a Captive Princeſs to contemn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59666:39"/>
Though <hi>Bajazet's</hi> life was only conditional, the ſervice he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs,</hi> had wrought in him all the effect it could do upon a mind that is truly grateful: he had none of thoſe barbarous blindneſſes that leſſen the value of civilities done to a perſon, and then confound them with inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It was not from the hands of <hi>Adanaxus</hi> that the effects of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune did proceed; he knew him not but by a conſiderable ſervice he had done him, and he received his viſit with a great deal of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Seignior, ſaid <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to him, after they had ended their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, if it had pleaſed Heaven to have ſeconded my vows, I would have rendered you my ſubmiſſions in a place more worthy of you than this is, but ſince my good inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prove weak, and mauger all my intreaties, you are ſtill a priſoner. I am come to offer you all that may contribute to make this place leſs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59666:40"/>
grievous to you. Seignior, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Bajazet,</hi> according to the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I now lead my life, it very little concerns me in what place I ſpend it, for all are equal to me in <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>'s Dominions. But do not think, Seignior, that this indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence extends its ſelf even to what I ow you, and that it extenuates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of my obligations to you. I am neither forgetful of the valour, manner, or circumſtances of it: For I proteſt to you my greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is that I am not in a capacity of teſtifying to you my real reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I have done ſo little, Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, replied the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs,</hi> in compariſon of the reparation I owe you, that it deſerves not your remembrance; but as nothing is ſo afflictive to thoſe who love and are acquainted with glory, as to ſee ſuch a perſon as you in fetters, I would willingly do ſo much as may make my intentions paſs for effects. If you have any concern for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59666:40"/>
of thoſe who are likewiſe joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with you in your misfortune, Seignior, you ought to be more pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to your ſelf, and conſider on the means that are offered you to get out of this place. Pardon me, if knowing, as I do, your juſt averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>Themir,</hi> I preſume once more to propoſe him to you for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs your Daughter. In a more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py time I ſhould not do this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to the hatred which exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates you; but the preſſing neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Affairs, the continual fears in which you put <hi>Aſteria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>,</hi> all that which threatens you, and what may happen, are ſuch powerful rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as I am forced to ſpeak to you of it. I am ſenſible that <hi>Themir,</hi> is accuſed of many crimes, and I cannot own that he is not guilty as to your particular: but, Seignior, the love he bears the Princeſs may render him more reaſonable, he would not be the firſt whom this paſſion ſhould have changed, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59666:41"/>
what ſpeaks more in his favour than all things elſe is, that there is not any thing to which upon <hi>Themir</hi>'s conſideration <hi>Tamberlain</hi> cannot be obliged. I confeſs, Seignior, it is a hard thing to conquer ones ſelf in matters of ſuch importance as this; but what cannot the courage of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> do? If I could tell any other means how to deliver you out of this place, I would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this to you. Ah! would to Heavens, that in contempt of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi>'s repoſe, and of my own life, I could imagine any any other way; I would not balance the electing of it; but Seignior, nothing but this remains, of conſenting to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Aſteria,</hi> and therefore I would conjure you to make ſome reflections upon it.</p>
                  <p>Prince, anſwered <hi>Bajazet,</hi> coldly, I do not doubt but that you would ſerve with zeal all thoſe who could any wayes move your pity, ſince I have made ſuch a convincing expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59666:41"/>
of it; but I am both ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and afflicted, that after you have treated me like a Prince, and have ſet ſome value upon the actions of my life, you look upon me as the ſlave of <hi>Tamberlain.</hi> Do not you judge of my Sentiments by my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, it is not in the power of chains and fetters to make me forget my name, nor can any torments debaſe the mind of a Prince who has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Laws to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and has been the deſtiny of many others. You do not poſſibly know, that this <hi>Themir,</hi> which you offer to me for a Son in Law, is the Author of all my ſufferings; that it was his criminal hand, that baſely before mine eyes did ſpill the blood whom I intirely lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoſe vertues promiſed an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs happineſs to my life, and whom I ſaw expire by his ſword without being able to give him any Succour. Ah! Seignior, if you believe me to have any valour and reſolution,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59666:42"/>
judge by the tears that this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance fetches from me, unto what exceſs my indignation ſwells. 'Tis one of <hi>Themir</hi>'s moſt bloody out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, but it is not the only One, <hi>Burſa</hi> pillaged; <hi>Sebaſtia</hi> deſtroyed; my Children become Fugitives; my Wife, oppreſſed with the rigours of her captivity, dead; <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s impriſonment; my own, and the treatments I have met with in it, are as ſo many effects of his furies: and ah! would you have me, Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, renounce my hatred in favour of an Enemy who has ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it? No, no, let <hi>Tamberlain</hi> look to his own Rights, and give me leave to injoy the freedom of my breaſt; it is a comfort to me in my misfortunes to think that this liberty cannot be raviſhed from me, but that I can without any remorſe or ſcruple wiſh to ſee <hi>Tartary</hi> o'r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with Enemies that may be mercileſs; <hi>Samarcanda</hi> abandoned to flames and pillage; <hi>Themir</hi> to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59666:42"/>
ſerve as a victim to the cruelties of a mutinous people; and <hi>Tamberlain</hi> to follow the Chariot of a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as little generous as himſelf. My liberty poſſibly may be too great, Seignior, but I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble my thoughts, and indeed, it is that ſincerity which obliges me to aſſure you, that if Heaven would be favourable to my deſires, I would do no leſs for your fortune than I would for my vengeance; for I have a very valuable eſteem for your merit, and do conſerve in me a heart that is not unſenſible of my obligation to you. I am too much indebted to your goodneſs my ſelf, replied <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> for putting ſo high a value upon ſervices that are ſo inconſiderable; and give me leave to anſwer you with the ſame liberty, there is not any thing I would refuſe to do to deſerve it. But, Seignior, muſt I renounce the hopes of obtaining any thing from you? conſult a little the neceſſity
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59666:43"/>
of the time, and do ſome violence upon your ſelf to eſcape the fatal conſequences that may attend your refuſal: the preſent time is ſo wretched that it puts me into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of dreading the future, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we need to fear, when we have only a life to look after, which derives all its troubles and torments from the length of it. But, Seignior, that I may not be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſlighting your negotiation, and that I may let you know how dear I account your kindneſſes to me; let <hi>Themir</hi> reſtore me my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; let him leave me to injoy the wrecks of my fortune with ſome equality; in a word, let him follow the example of your genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and then I will hearken to his Propoſitions; but a heart like mine knows not how to yield to any thing, when I am in chains, and I have a ſoul too reſolute, to give to the leaſt of my Actions an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59666:43"/>
of a baſe and cowardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adanaxus</hi> found ſo much of the Hero in <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s diſcourſe, that he could not anſwer him any further; only he aſſured him he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his utmoſt power to incline <hi>Tamberlain</hi> to grant him the liberty he demanded; and ſo immediately went to find out the Emperour his Father, to whom he forgot nothing that might any wayes be conducive to bring things to ſuch a concluſion; but the Propoſition was not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor indeed ſo much as hearkned to.</p>
                  <p>What, ſaid <hi>Tamberlain</hi> to him, when poſſibly by a Sentiment that diſcovers too much of humanity, I do conſent that <hi>Themir</hi> ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Daughter of the Captive <hi>Bajazet,</hi> do I not beſtow upon him a Grace that is ſufficiently conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? He would fain preſcribe me Laws in my Empire, and get to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a liberty, who has coſt me ſo
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59666:44"/>
many thouſand men: No, no, ſo eaſie a compliance would load me with an Eternal ſhame; and all <hi>Aſia</hi> would call me to an Account for ſo important a priſoner: Let him pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſince he is reſolved on't, and let <hi>Themir,</hi> to render himſelf happy, make uſe of the Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of his Victory. We have too much neglected them, and the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Bajazet</hi> thinks to prevail upon the Remonſtrances of our weakneſs. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> was very much troubled at this Determination; and though <hi>Tamberlain</hi> was reſolved to have him execute it, and alſo forbad the Young Prince to bring him back ſo much as the leaſt reſiſtance to it, yet could he not forbear making ſome unprofitable intreaties: but at laſt he was commanded to purſue it ſo abſolutely, that he was forced to do it, and he retired into his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as much afflicted at <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s unhappineſs, as if he had known the ſecret Intereſt he ought to take in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59666:44"/>
In the mean time <hi>Aſteria</hi> entered into the Chamber of this illuſtrious Priſoner. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> had obtained their liberty of ſeeing one another; he ſaid that thoſe Interviews might be conducive to the happy ſucceſs of his Negotiation; and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs having heard that the Prince had been long in diſcourſe with the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor, came to know the ſubject of it.</p>
                  <p>Ah! Daughter, ſaid <hi>Bajazet,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw her, how opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do you come to conſole me under that vaſt acceſſion of grief which I have now received. Prince <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus</hi> to whom I am redevable for my life; and who has prevented my having for him ſo high an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, is joyned to our Tyrants for my perſecution, and has made ſuch diſcourſes to me, which coming from him are more inſupportable, than all that <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> or <hi>Themir</hi> were ever able to invent. <hi>Adanax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> perſecute you, Seignior, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59666:45"/>
                     <hi>Aſteria,</hi> after a languiſhing manner! yes, he does, but in ſo handſom a faſhion, purſued <hi>Bajazet,</hi> that in appearance I have no cauſe to reproach him for it; he ſpeaks to me in the behalf of <hi>Themir,</hi> and ſeems to propoſe him to me as the means of facilitating my liberty; but all things well conſidered, it is ſtill to make an attempt upon the juſt motions of my hatred, and this proceeding is more afflictive to me, coming from a Man to whom I am ſo much obliged, then if it had come from my moſt irreconcileable enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs was ſo diſturbed at <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s diſcourſe, that ſhe was at a loſs how to return any anſwer to it; ſhe ſighed, and in ſpight of all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſhe could not refrain ſhedding ſome tears, to which the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour gave ſuch an explication, as they did not deſerve; but, Daughter, purſued he, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her very ſtedfaſtly, I perceive
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59666:45"/>
this greatly afflicts you; would you have forgot what you owe to the reſentments of your Father, and to the blood of <hi>Ortobulus,</hi> and ſhould the <hi>Tartar</hi> Prince have come to ſpeak to me at your intreaty? at mine? Juſt Heavens! cried the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Princeſs: Ah! Seignior, you penetrate into the ſentiments of my breaſt greatly to my diſadvantage, to think I am in the leaſt capable to ingage <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to ſpeak in <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi>'s favour, how you o'rwhelm me with joy, my Child, added <hi>Bajazet,</hi> in giving me this proteſtation, let it be to you an indiſpenſable Law; and becauſe poſſibly we may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways injoy this liberty of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing together, obſerve diligently this I am going to ſay, that what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence ſoever is uſed againſt me, do not you betray any weakneſs at it; prefer this charge of mine to all that a paternal affection can inſpire you with: be you generous by my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and give up your life with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59666:46"/>
mine, if it be neceſſary, rather than betray my juſt reſentments againſt <hi>Themir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Princeſs preſently promiſed the Emperor her Father what he had exacted from her obedience; the diſintereſſed Love of the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> had given her a real ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: ſhe had not the power to defend her ſelf from being in love with a perſon who was ſo worthy of her kindneſs; and being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by a cruel experience, that though he ſhould deſerve it leſs, ſhe could not get him from her breaſt, ſhe withdrew to her own Apartment ſo drowned in ſorrow, and filled with deſpite, that ſhe had almoſt reſolved upon ſome actions that would have been unworthy both of her moderation and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. She made <hi>Xaira</hi> to be called, to whom ſhe recited all that <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> had told her, and accompanying her diſcourſe with a thouſand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches againſt her faithleſs adorer,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59666:46"/>
ſhe ſtirred up ſo much pity in her woman, that ſhe appeared as much afflicted as the Princeſs. He is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, this <hi>Arſanes,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, who ſeemed ſo little capable of infidelity; he betraies both his oaths, and my hopes, and not only forgets the Love he promiſed <hi>Neris,</hi> but he would with his own hands deliver her into thoſe of an unworthy Rival. Ah! <hi>Xaira,</hi> how treacherous is the Sex of Men, how fatal is that of ours, and how wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and little experienced do we diſcover our ſelves, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing that Mankind tells us? <hi>Xaira</hi> made her no anſwer but with her tears, which were mingled with thoſe of the Princeſs, but fate was preparing for them occaſions of grief that were more legitimate, and they ought to have reſerved thoſe they then ſhed for a more preſſing opportunity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bajazet</hi> was Maſter of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Soul, and kept them from
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59666:47"/>
breaking out by any action contrary to his conſtancy; but he could not prevent the impreſſion they made upon his health. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> his viſit had extreamly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him; that of <hi>Aſteria</hi> had much increaſed it, and all this ſucceeding the preparatory of an unworthy puniſhment, and of a long retinue of miſeries, made him fall into a ſickneſs which he no ſooner felt coming upon him, but he judged it would be his mortal one. If he was affected with it, it was only with joy; and the violence of his diſtemper did not in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of his reaſon, for he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with pleaſure by the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of his health, that his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were now ready to take their leave of him, and to end with his life. Yet he lay languiſhing many dayes; but finding himſelf almoſt at his laſt period, he ordered that <hi>Aſteria</hi> ſhould be called; and the Princeſs obſerving in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59666:47"/>
the infallible preſages of his death, fell into ſuch an agony of grief, that it wanted but little to caſt her into the reſembling conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The dying Emperour indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured as well as he could to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her; he commanded her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the aſſiſtances of the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs,</hi> as from the only perſon could give her ſuch as were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and diſintereſſed; and being deſirous to ingage that Prince not to betray his confidence in him; he ſent to beg of him the favour to come unto his priſon. The Prince would not have ſtay'd for this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, if he had not apprehended his viſit might be troubleſome: he went to him in all haſte, and <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> reaching out his hands to him; merciful death is now going to free me from the Tyranny of <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> Seignior, ſaid he to him, and I on a ſuddain feel that fate is robbing him of the pleaſure to bring me new perſecutions, or to exerciſe his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59666:48"/>
generoſity, if ever he ſhould be made capable of it. I ſhould look upon this ſo much longed for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any trouble, if I did not apprehend it would prove fatal to the unfortunate <hi>Aſteria;</hi> and that having no longer the reſolution of her Father to ſupport her, ſhe will fall into a miſery that will be more dreadful to her than the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death in the world. Relieve me, Seignior, from this fear, and pleaſe to give me your promiſe to protect a deplorable Princeſs, whom at my death I commit into your hands. Captivity, death, and the other caprices of fortune have not yet been capable to render <hi>Bajazet</hi> a ſuppliant; but a paternal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has greater influence than all theſe things, and you ſee me with tears beſeeching you to defend <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteria</hi> againſt the violence of <hi>Themir.</hi> She is prudent and couragious; but ſhe is young, and my Child, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me, Seignior, that ſhe ſhall have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59666:48"/>
your pity, and that in her you will conſider the remains of a precious blood, that will owe all her glory to you, if you afford it a generous ſuccour againſt the violence of her Tyrants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adanaxus</hi> was ſo moved by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi>'s diſcourſe, that he could not refrain his tears; he would not have ballanced giving him all the promiſes he was able to exact, if he had not apprehended himſelf too weak to make them good; and this Impuiſſance rendering him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſerved; <hi>Bajazet,</hi> though he knew himſelf ſufficiently generous, ſuffered himſelf to be ſurprized with ſome little diffidence, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Princeſs to be called, that ſhe might indeavour to bring <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus</hi> to a determination by her preſence, or to give her ſtricter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders than yet ſhe had received. She had heard the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> was with the Emperor, and wavering between a ſecret deſire of ſeeing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59666:49"/>
him again, and an inraged paſſion ſhe thought he juſtly deſerved, ſhe had paſt away the time of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s converſation with him in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes as can never fully be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt: there were ſtill ſome marks of her trouble upon her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the tears ſhe was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of at her Father's ſickneſs, had made her eyes all red, as they had put an extream paleneſs into her face; but yet this change made her not unknown to the eyes of the <hi>Tartar</hi> Prince, he came up three or four ſteps to her, and his ſurpriſe not permitting him to come any farther, he ſtop'd and became immoveable: and found himſelf at that juncture of time capable of doing nothing but giving her his moſt languiſhing regards. He at laſt pronounced the Name of <hi>Neris</hi> many times over, with ſuch remarkable demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Love, that <hi>Asteria</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt certain of her errour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as weak as <hi>Adanaxus.</hi> The <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59666:49"/>
Emperor looking upon them with as great an aſtoniſhment as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, was going to demand of them the reaſon of their ſo ſtrange ſurpriſe, but he was prevented by the coming in of Prince <hi>Themir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Poſſibly he hop'd, that as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of his ſickneſs did render him more weak, it likewiſe would make him more complying, and he came to make his laſt eſſay to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his valiant reſolution: but it ſeemed to have an acceſſion by the ſight of <hi>Themir;</hi> and <hi>Bajazet</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that that Prince came but to tyrannize over the laſt moments of his life, was ſo ſeiſed with rage and horror, that he fell into mortal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. The Princeſs ran to him almoſt diſtracted with grief, and the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> making an effort upon himſelf to ſuccour a man who was become ſo dear to him, ſent for all <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s Phyſicians, though their art to him was unprofitable. <hi>Bajazet</hi> gave them no other ſigns of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59666:50"/>
life, but by his looks, which though dying, yet expreſſed the horror he had for <hi>Themir;</hi> and expiring in the Arms of the afflicted <hi>Asteria,</hi> ſhe had reaſon enough to make her reproaches againſt <hi>Themir,</hi> for that his viſit had ſome minutes ſooner haſtened the death of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Bajazet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She did not conceal from him this new cauſe of her reſentment; but forcing away thoſe Sobs which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her Speech; Go on, Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſaid ſhe to him, expoſe me ſtill to thy ſight for ſome time, and by that exceſs of thy cruelty joyn the miſerable <hi>Aſteria</hi> to the Emperor her Father, and to Prince <hi>Ortobulus.</hi> Thoſe words having ſtruck Prince <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to the Soul, he went to conjure <hi>Themir</hi> to render himſelf ſenſible, now it was in his power, and to grant to the tears of <hi>Aſteria</hi> ſome hours of ſolitude. But <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> too much hated his Brother, and had obſerved him to be too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59666:50"/>
diſtinguiſhed by the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Emperor, and his Daughter, to receive his Counſels with any pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I did not come hither, ſaid he very fiercely to him, to receive any advice from you; and I can ſcarcely apprehend the motive of this confidence, though I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly puniſh the Author of it, if I did not obſerve in it ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which I would examine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever I did inflict that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> found himſelf no longer to be in a ſuffering humour, and ſince he knew his <hi>Neris</hi> was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteria,</hi> he quickly perceived in <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> ſuch qualities that might make him diſpence with his wonted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. What would be a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Another, ſaid he to him, muſt be called by another name in the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs;</hi> and if till now the reſpect I owed to the Emperor has conſtrained me to ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; even that reſpect obliges me to defend in my perſon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59666:51"/>
of his blood, and to prevent the doing any outrage to it. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> ſtormed at thoſe big words he ſaid to him, and but that <hi>Axalla</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fortunately came in, the preſence of the Princeſs would not have been powerful enough to have kept the two Brothers from a bloody in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement: but that Illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite making uſe of the power he had over the ſpirit of <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> to oblige him to withdraw, and the extream affliction that <hi>Aſteria</hi> was in, having at laſt conſtrained <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> to leave her to her repoſe, this difference was ſuſpended, and <hi>Axal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> ran to advertiſe the Emperor of it, that ſo he might put his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in force to make an abſolute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation between them.</p>
                  <p>But on the other hand the proud <hi>Themir</hi> was no ſooner got to the Palace, but he cauſed <hi>Odmar</hi> to be ſought for: This perſon had been Governour of the Prince of <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> of a wicked and pernitious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

and a barbarous humour, and who had inſpired into him by a dangerous education, thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences and furious reſolutions, which made him capable of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cruelties, and he would lay his contrivances with ſo much artifice and ſecurity, that though he had been of his blood, they could not have more reſembled thoſe of <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.</hi> As he was <hi>Themir</hi>'s only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, it was in the Counſels of a man ſo capable as he was to give him ſuch as were conformable to the violent tranſports he was at that time in, that that Prince was ſo earneſt to have him found out, that he might be relieved from the trouble that poſſeſt him, whilſt the afflicted <hi>Asteria</hi> poured out a flood of tears for her Father's death, in her Apartment of the Palace, whither ſhe had been reconducted; and <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla,</hi> who found the Emperor inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſome of his Nobles about very important Affairs, could not

               <p>THe Firſt Counſels that <hi>Odmar</hi> gave <hi>Themir,</hi> after he had underſtood what had paſt in <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s priſon, were to ſearch into the Sentiments which induced the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> to be ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his loſs, and <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s grief; and what made him ſo fierce in his Anſwers; and preſſing <hi>Themir</hi> with an opinion that they might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proceed from Love, he inſtilled
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59666:53"/>
into him a hatred againſt the young Prince, which proved the occaſion of a very violent jealouſie.</p>
               <p>They fell preſently upon their ſearch, and as nothing was difficult to them, they made the next day all thoſe come before them, who had attended <hi>Bajazet</hi> in in his ſickneſs; and the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a Prince, who was able to do all things, made them affirm that before <hi>Themir</hi> came into the room, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor, and <hi>Adanax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> frequently flung themſelves into one anothers embraces; at the ſight of <hi>Asteria</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> ſeemed extraordinarily ſurprized, and had often called her by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name then that they knew her by: there was nothing more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to perſwade ſuſpitious ſpirits, than that the acquaintance of the Princeſs and <hi>Adanaxus</hi> was not of a new foundation, but there was a particular underſtanding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue between them. In <hi>Themir</hi>'s
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59666:53"/>
firſt rage, he thought upon nothing, but ſtabbing his Brother before <hi>Asteria</hi>'s face; but <hi>Odmar,</hi> who was more prudent in his cruelty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him that it would be a great deal better to deſtroy ſuch an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with more ſafety, and leſs noiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Themir</hi> too much relied upon <hi>Odmar</hi>'s advice, not to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it; and fearing leſt the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> ſhould find out ſome way to ſee the Pricneſs, he was reſolved to take the ſureſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he could to prevent him in it: and addreſſing himſelf to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he told him, that <hi>Asteria</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of having any further fears for her Father, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving now how to make her eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and therefore it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to have her Guards doubled, and not to permit any body to make her any Viſits. <hi>Tamberlain</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſented to that new precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made <hi>Themir</hi> Maſter of that affair, who immediately commanded

an Officer to go and double <hi>Aſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a</hi>'s Guard, and to forbid any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into her Apartment beſides himſelf; the Officer obeyed him, but as he was coming up to the Princeſs's Chamber, he met <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus,</hi> who was juſt joyned with <hi>Axalla,</hi> as he was coming from it; the ſight of the Guards made the Prince queſtion the truth of it; he preſently asked them what was the occaſion of their being in that place; and having learned it, his firſt choler had e'n almoſt proved fatal to them. He had laid his hand upon his Cimetar, but the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Axalla</hi> repreſenting to him the neceſſity he had to ſuffer <hi>Themir</hi> freely to act his pleaſure, through his want of power to oppoſe him in it with ſucceſs, and that by ſuch a violent procedure he might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly looſe the means of being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Princeſs with the Emperour, who was ſo ſtrangely fond on <hi>Themir,</hi> that he looked

upon him as one, whom he had not the power to deny any thing. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danaxus</hi> was perſwaded by him, contenting himſelf with a deep ſigh; he was juſt going to give <hi>Axalla</hi> an account of his acquaintance with <hi>Aſteria;</hi> not having as yet met with any convenient opportunity to do it, as alſo of the deſign he had to go and aggravate to <hi>Tamberlain</hi> the cruelties that were uſed againſt an illuſtrious, and a miſerable Princeſs, when he perceived <hi>Themir</hi> coming towards him, whoſe impatience of knowing whether his Orders were put in execution had cauſed him to be upon the back of the Guards; they looked upon one another with eyes that no whit diſcovered the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that was between them, and <hi>Themir</hi> beginning the diſcourſe in a very opprobrious and ſcornful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; have you been conſoling <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteria</hi> after the Death of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> ſaid he to him? and may we hope that the acknowledgement ſhe owes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59666:55"/>
you will be any obligation to make her ſatisfie the Emperor's pleaſure and my deſires? you expreſs your deſires by violences ſo outragious to a generous breaſt, replied <hi>Adanax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that I can ſcarce believe they can be favourably heard: and the negotiations I have undertaken in your favour are too ill grounded to give you any hopes of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs; the indeavours you uſe in explaining them, anſwered <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi> do contribute much to the rendring of them unprofitable, and I have great obligations to you which I am ſufficiently informed of, we may one day diſcourſe of them more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, added he, with a furious look; in the mean time, I ſhall go and know of the Princeſs what you have done for me. As he ended thoſe words, he turn'd towards <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s Apartment, and <hi>Axalla</hi> got the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> away, for fear leſt at the return ſome other diſcourſes more fierce and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould make them proceed to worſe actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59666:55"/>
I will leave you near <hi>Aſteria,</hi> ſaid <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to him, when they were got to another place. You are juſt now come from her, have you not procured ſome abatement of her grief? or does ſhe ſtill abandon her ſelf to it with the ſame vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? I did not entertain her long, replied <hi>Axalla;</hi> but, Seignior, ſince you are pleaſed to ſpeak of <hi>Asteria,</hi> preferably to what we may ſay of <hi>Themir,</hi> give me leave to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that you ſeem to be very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of her misfortunes, and the ſcruple you made of ſeeing her has not been able to ſtand againſt the firſt moments of her ſight. Ah! dear <hi>Axalla,</hi> anſwered the Prince, it is not from to day that her ſight has had its effect upon my heart, and to tell you in one word the moſt ſurpriſing thing that ever you have heard; that <hi>Aſteria</hi> whom you ſee at <hi>Samarcanda,</hi> is the ſame <hi>Neris</hi> to whom I did devote my ſelf in the Court of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59666:56"/>
What? Seignior, interrupted <hi>Axalla,</hi> can it be true you tell me? and has the Daughter of <hi>Bajazet</hi> before this laſt Captivity felt the miſeries of a former one? Alas, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> it is but too cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for my repoſe: yes, <hi>Axalla,</hi> it is the Father of <hi>Neris,</hi> to whom <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> has procured all theſe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; I am of that blood which is ſo juſtly hateful to her; but what heightens my affliction to the laſt extremity, is that I have made uſe of all my Rhetorick to get her to be delivered over to the barbarous <hi>Themir;</hi> and ſhe may ſuſpect me of having preferred a baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy complaiſance for the deſires of of my Father, to that fidelity which is redevable from me to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> could ſcarce recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of this ſurpriſe, and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſides the Prince would have had a difficult task to convince him of the reality of what he then heard; but his ſincerity not leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59666:56"/>
in him any room to doubt of ſo extraordinary a truth, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the diſorders that this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was likely to bring into the Imperial Houſe of <hi>Tartary.</hi> Ah! Seignior, ſaid he to the Prince with grief, how fatal is this <hi>Neris</hi> to thoſe States where her deſtiny has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her, and how cruel a way does ſhe take to revenge <hi>Bajazet</hi> of the rigours of his captivity: let us not think of the revenges ſhe may exerciſe over the Children of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> anſwered <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> and reflect upon nothing but how to make her know the real ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Arſanes:</hi> If I did follow my tranſports, I ſhould indeavour to find at her feet either my death or juſtification; but yet I am not leſs reſpectful than ſhe is cruel; my ſight would poſſibly trouble her and yet I ſtudy the tranquillity of her life: go then, and ſee her, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you, you are now acquainted with our Intereſts; improve thoſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59666:57"/>
of the paſſionate <hi>Adanaxus;</hi> the tears that <hi>Neris</hi> ſheds, have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed her anger from me, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe conſiders me as the ſon of the Tyrant, or as a Lover that is unworthy of her, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſhe indeavours to ſhun me.</p>
               <p>So far as <hi>Axalla</hi> durſt venture himſelf in the favour of <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> being more generous then he was politick, he made him a promiſe to do whatſoever he deſired; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Prince reaſſumed ſome hopes, but they were cruelly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; when <hi>Axalla</hi> told him, that having been to ſee <hi>Aſteria,</hi> his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into her apartment had been refuſed him. This indignity was very outragious to ſuch a perſon as he was; but he preſently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that this was an effect of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi>'s precautions, and of <hi>Odmar</hi>'s counſels; and the only thing he then could do, was to adviſe the Prince to patience; but yet it was not in his power to keep him from

making his complaints to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the ſeverities that were u<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Seignior ſaid he to him, <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> is dead; there only now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a fair young Princeſs in your fetters, whoſe Eminence and Sex ſhould make you diſpenſe with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering her to feel the weight of them; yet, Seignior, after the death of a Father whom ſhe ſo dearly loved, in a time that ſhe is capable of nothing but tears; her guards are doubled, ſhe is reduced to ſeek her conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her grief, and you uſe ſuch rigorous and cruel ſecurities, as if ſhe was capable of troubling your Empire, or of tearing your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts from you: and what opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Tartars</hi> will this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cauſe all the reſt of the World to have, Seignior? they will take us to be <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and that not without reaſon; a little more mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would make them frame more advantageous Ideas of us, and the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59666:58"/>
Princeſs <hi>Aſteria</hi> would have the leſs to ſuffer, and the leſs to complain of. I do not mean <hi>Aſteria</hi> ſhall play the Tyrant here, anſwered <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> nor do I think a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour who has deſtined her for his Son, ought not to give any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Idea's of his clemency. You are convinced of her hatred for <hi>Themir,</hi> as likewiſe of what ſhe is able to make him undertake to ſhun it; it is that conſideration which makes me permit thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions he has taken; if ſhe was leſs violent, I would command you to go and ſee her, and indeavonr to perſwade her, but you are the Son of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> and that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keep her from hearkening to you. The Prince would fain have returned his Father an anſwer, and poſſibly would have accquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the reaſon of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſenſible of <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s captivity, but the Emperor did not give him time to do it, but went out about
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59666:58"/>
ſome important affair. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> clearly perceived that he could not change the faoe of things, and therefore retired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>with his mind full of a thouſand bloody imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>In thoſe meaſures the Artificious <hi>Odmar</hi> had cauſed <hi>Themir</hi> to take, there was not a word mentioned of <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> for fear it might be thought it was a reſult of his hatred, and of their firſt fallings out: and <hi>Odmar,</hi> who was continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving himſelf in the favour of the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs,</hi> that ſo he might prevent appearances, would not at all be ſeen in the matter, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with ſecretly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the dangerous poiſon to work of which his breaſt was ſo full: He ſought out whatſoever might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to him the intrigue between <hi>Aſteria,</hi> and Prince <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> and the effect did ſo abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence his cares, that by ſeducing two of the domeſtiques, he came
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59666:59"/>
to underſtand that they had their firſt acquaintance at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that <hi>Adanaxus</hi> had not run through ſo many remote places as they had follow'd him to, but only to find her out. <hi>Odmar</hi> overjoy'd at this new aſſurance, confirmed <hi>Themir</hi> that his brother was now his Rival, and redoubled a rage in him, the effects of which were preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe very reaſons before mentioned.</p>
               <p>In this manner two Months were ſpent, <hi>Themir</hi> daily proved <hi>Aſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a</hi>'s perſecutor which made her lead a life ſuitable to the grief ſhe had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, <hi>Adanaxus</hi> was perpetually languiſhing for her, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſuffered all things to run which way was moſt agreeable to the Son whom he little better then ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>One night, when <hi>Adanaxus</hi> could take no repoſe, he went out of his own apartment into a great long Terrace, full the length of <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>'s
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59666:59"/>
palace; the Princeſs's chamber joyned to it, and it was to be neer it at leaſt that he choſe that place to paſs away his hours of inquietude: The Moon ſhone very bright, and the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> had no ſooner leaned himſelf againſt one of the Balliſters that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Terrace, but turning his head at the noiſe of ſome ſighs he heard emitted near him, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Lady whom he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew to be the Princeſs: her guards, leſs ſevere then their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, permitted her that liberty, which ſhe only made uſe of in the night, and ſhe had ſo little a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of diſcovering her ſelf to him, that ſhe did whatever ſhe could to prevent his ſeeing of her: Not that ſhe did not know <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> but to prevent her errour, ſhe was going to deprive him of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But the Prince did not give her time to do it; he came, and threw himſelf at her feet, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59666:60"/>
kept her by an amorous violence; notwithſtanding all her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to get away from him. 'Tis true her heart did not abſolutely give way to thoſe reſentments; but a motion more powerful then deſpite, pleading in <hi>Adanaxus</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, did ſomewhat qualify an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that could not withſtand the imperious force of Love, and made that innocent joy prevail of ſeeing a perſon dearly beloved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo long and tedious an abſence; the Prince was offering ſeveral times to ſpeak, without being able to find expreſſions: this ſilence was looked upon by <hi>Aſteria</hi> as a Remorſe, though ſhe found her ſelf diſpoſed to pardon him if he was truly penitent, yet ſhe had no mind to make a preſent diſcovery of her weakneſs to him; what tranſports do bring you again to <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s feet, ſaid ſhe to him, is it in favour of <hi>Themir</hi> that you come with this ſubmiſſion, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59666:60"/>
do you addreſs your ſelf to me, as to the unfortunate <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to deſire my hand for the murtherer of my Brother? This reproach gave the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> ſome new hopes, and as jealouſie is not a work of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, he thought if that was the real cauſe of <hi>Aſteria's</hi> anger, he ought not to believe it invincible. I do not lye at your feet as <hi>Themir's</hi> protector, Madam, replied he, it is my Love, which abſence and time has not the power to diminiſh, that has brought me hither again: And if I have demanded the daughter of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour for the Son of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> it was through my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that his <hi>Aſteria</hi> was my adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Neris.</hi> Did not you know it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the Princeſs, have you been the only perſon in <hi>Paleologus's</hi> Court, who has been ignorant of it? my return to <hi>Burſia</hi> madé a ſufficient noiſe to be publickly known; and I am aſſured there is not one that dwels at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who has not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59666:61"/>
heard that <hi>Neris</hi> was <hi>Bajazet's</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Ah! Madam, replied the Prince, do you think your loſs permitted me to wait patiently at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for the effects wherewith it muſt needs be attended, and do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> who had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make you underſtand how abſolutely he was at your devotion, could after your departure with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny quietneſs live in a City where on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your fair eyes had the power to keep him? Ah <hi>Neris,</hi> how injurious is this ſuſpicion, and how ill a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter have you framed of my Love, if you have been capable of any? being overwhelmed with grief for your abſence, I could not find any <hi>Aſylum</hi> for my deſpair, but was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bear it with that ardor, which is inſeparable from the moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate adorers over unknown Seas, and through the deſarts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and without ever being frightened at a thouſand deaths which were daily preſent to my eyes, I ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59666:61"/>
my wandring, and guided only by my grief, even to that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which my deſtiny proved ſo happy as to bring me to you again; and yet you have accuſed me for having unworthily heard news of you in <hi>Paleologus</hi> his Palace, and poſſibly upon that reflection have hated me. What, interrupted <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> once more, is it poſſible that you ſhould not have had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth of my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? No, Madam, purſued <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus,</hi> I have heard nothing but what has preſerved me in my errors; as ſoon as ever you diſappeared, a violent, as well as haſty ſeizure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced my life almoſt to its laſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od; and I was yet languiſhing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that diſtemper, when I embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to find you out through all the places of the World. Remember, cruel <hi>Aſteria,</hi> the confidence you made me, and judge whether I ought to look for you in <hi>Burſa,</hi> whom I thought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Mauritania,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59666:62"/>
in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or in any other part of <hi>Africk,</hi> could I inform my ſelf of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s daughter, when I was running after an <hi>African</hi> Lady, and could I, to ſay no more, be in that remiſſion you ſuſpected me of, ſince I gave you what reſerve all the movements of my life, and all the affections of a heart, which you have wrong'd by your miſtruſtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
               <p>The Princeſs hearkened to <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus</hi> his Juſtification with all that content and ſatisfaction which the certainty of a happineſs that one deſires and hopes for could produce. I confeſs, ſaid ſhe to him, when he had done ſpeaking, my ſuſpicions have been unjuſt; but, Seignior, conſider whither I could do leſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch probabilities of the truth of your deſertion, I was perſwaded you muſt needs know me, and at a time wherein as much a Son of <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi> and Brother of <hi>Themir</hi> as you were, I looked upon you ſtill
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59666:62"/>
no otherwiſe then as a Prince that was very dear to me, then as a Man in whom the blood of our Tyrants did ſtrike no horrour in me; you came back to <hi>Samarcanda,</hi> you did to ſpeak the truth, do a great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for <hi>Bajazet,</hi> but you refuſed to ſee me; and went to demand me of my Father for one that was a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> whom I have a thouſand reaſons to deteſt; was not all this enough to allarm my tenderneſs, can you find any thing in my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to complain of, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cauſe of it, had not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference after ſuch an occaſion been more injurious for you, then the anger which I have not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceal? Yes, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs,</hi> you have too many reaſons to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as guilty, and I have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more to be eternally ſenſible of your favour and goodneſs: But my Princeſs, ought I not to fear that thoſe great Events which have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59666:63"/>
all the earth, thoſe tean and ſufferings which mine have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to you, the outrages you have received from them, and the perſecution you are ſtill expoſed to beſides this birth which I owe to <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> ſhould change my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, and keep me from finding in <hi>Aſteria</hi> the Adorable <hi>Neris?</hi> Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, purſued ſhe, <hi>Aſteria</hi> will alwayes have the ſame eſteem for you as the Slave of <hi>Paleologus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I ſhould be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59666:63"/>
ungrateful, cryed the Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I would not ſacrifice my whole life to eſtify my acknowledgements of your favours, and indeed what is there I ought not do to render my ſelf worthy of the glorious eſteem of my Princeſs! I am convinced you deſerve more, purſued <hi>Aſteria,</hi> and the kindneſs I have for you is no leſs redevable to your merit then your ſervices; but, Seignior, how different is our deſtiny at <hi>Samarcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> from what it was at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> every thing went oppoſite to the deſires of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> and here all things contribute to thoſe of <hi>Themir;</hi> the Emperour bears him out in hiscruelty; the People ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud his crimes; and I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but my hatred to ſtand by me. You make nothing then of my Love, purſu'ed the Prince, do you think that ſhall be idle whilſt <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> is ſo active? Pray, Madam, judg more kindly of it, it cannot be either weak or fearful, ſince it is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59666:64"/>
inſpired by you and the zeal of it will not ſuffer any thing to be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, to give you a diſcovery of its ardour, yes, Madam, whilſt I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy my life, I will be an invincible obſtacle to the vows and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Themir;</hi> I know very well there's no way in the World which he will not attempt to take it from me; but if the <hi>Tartars</hi> fear him, without vanity I may ſay they love me; the Emperour may in little time be leſs blind, and more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and with ſome help poſſibly I may e're long preſent to my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs a more happy condition, then that I am as yet conſtrained to ſee her languiſh in.

But I will aſſure you ſince my Father's death he hath given me ſuch Intimations of it, as I've but too plainly underſtood.

                  <hi>Themir</hi> now no longer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adanaxus</hi> being his Rival, both what <hi>Odmar</hi> had drawn from ſome of his own Servants, and the other Circumſtances in <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Priſon, made it clear to him; but ſtill as <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> was never without his ſpyes,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59666:65"/>
for he employed I know not how many creatures for that purpoſe, he preſently heard of the interview in in the Terrace, and the two lovers who thought they had had no other witneſſes of their converſation than the Night and their love, were both ſeen and heard. <hi>Themir</hi> was even ready to burſt with rage at it, <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> likewiſe was put into a ſtrange fury, and after a long times conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration about what was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be done, the advice was that <hi>Adanaxus</hi> ſhould be permitted to make an attempt that might be more convincing, that ſo they may demand reaſon of the Emperour: But <hi>Odmar,</hi> purſued <hi>Themir,</hi> to what end ſhould we give him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, for him to do me more outrages, are not the affronts he has done me already great enough? No Seignior, added <hi>Odmar,</hi> all that you can do at preſent, will neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh your repoſe nor the ſafety of your love: But urge the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59666:66"/>
to put <hi>Aſteria</hi> into your poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſince you are ſo deſirous to be united to her. Ah, but what ſhall we do with <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> interrupted the cruel <hi>Themir?</hi> What Seignior, anſwered <hi>Odmar,</hi> what other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do that are enraged with thoſe things which prove their trouble, leave to me the concern of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, it ſhall be ſuch as ſhall be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his boldneſs. Well then, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued <hi>Themir,</hi> il'e reſt upon your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and demand of the Emperour the laſt ſureties of his love.</p>
               <p>At theſe words <hi>Themir</hi> went to find out <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> but as he was coming into the Terrace where the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> had entertained <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteria,</hi> he perceived him at the other end of it, the ſight of <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> and the place where he thought he had ſo lately met with a very ſenſible outrage inflamed his fury; he ſtrait forgot <hi>Odmar's</hi> advice, and fancying his Brother was only walking there to ſee the Princeſs, he made up to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59666:66"/>
him with a precipitation that argued his impatience: The young Prince very prudently ſhunned him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his rage: But <hi>Themïr</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it; Stay, ſaid he to him, and give me an account of the reaſons that make you look after my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive, and of thoſe ſecret plots you have laid to night againſt me. Speak with more reſpect of ſo great a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as you think worthy to be made your Spouſe, replyed <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> looking upon him very fiercely, and conſider that you demand a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from a man that owes you none, and who is not now in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to give you any. What, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Themir,</hi> do you think to brave me after you have offended me, or do you imagine that my reſentment will ſpare you? I have ſuffered ſo much from your pride, purſued <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danaxus,</hi> as I am reſolved to bear with it no longer: who has given you the priviledge of commanding
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59666:67"/>
a perſon over whom you have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage than what the name of Elder Brother affords you, that you think to make your ſelf his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Emperour? I ought not to give you an account any otherways than in ſacrificing you to my ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, interrupted <hi>Themir,</hi> putting his hand upon his ſword, and I owe my ſelf that ſacrifice upon too many reaſons: A very weighty blow was the conſequence of <hi>Themir</hi>'s words, which hit upon <hi>Adanaxus's</hi> ſhoulder, who avoiding the ſecond, put himſelf into a poſture of defence and would have done it in ſuch a manner as would have been fatal to <hi>Themir,</hi> if <hi>Axalla</hi> with ſome other <hi>Tartars</hi> of quality, brought thither by the noiſe they made, had not come and flung themſelves between them. <hi>Themir</hi> was ſo baſe as to ſtrike the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> in the arms of thoſe that held him, but ſeeing it was impoſſible for him to ſatisfie his revenge; Your indiſcreet zeal deprives my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59666:67"/>
of a victim I am going now to demand of the Emperour, ſaid he to thoſe that kept him off from the Prince. Away he went as ſoon as he had ſpoke theſe words, and <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus</hi> continuing the diſcourſe, You will not, pnrſued he, let him come before the Emperour, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me the liberty of going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelf? We will follow you thither if you pleaſe, Seignior, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Axalla:</hi> Let us go then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Prince, who came to <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> almoſt as ſoon as <hi>Themir.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the Emperour caſt his eyes upon the blood that ran from the wounds of the young Prince, and he was not ſo little in his affections, as to behold it without a trouble: what blood is that which runs down your cloaths, <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> ſaid he to him, It is mine, anſwered the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> very modeſtly: From whom comes this, purſued the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, with looks that ſufficiently denoted the paſſion he was in? Is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59666:68"/>
there any in <hi>Samareanda</hi> that dares lift up his hand againſt you? Yes, Seignior, interrupted the violent <hi>Themir,</hi> there are thoſe that would give him death if you did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and in it give him that puniſhment he deſerves, in affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with ſo much boldneſs as he has done: I have a thouſand things to accuſe him, he has done me ſecret offences, and when I would have had him given me an account why he did ſo, with ſcorn he anſwered me. As for my diſcourſe, ſaid <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus,</hi> it has been a great deal more moderate than it ought, and as for my action, I believe I could defend a life; for which the Emperour ſtill reſerves ſome kindneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamberlain</hi> then knew with an exceſs of grief, that his Sons found it difficult to vanquiſh that violent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy which had diſunited them, ſince that ſix years abſence had not wrought any change upon them. Though he did in his heart condemn
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59666:68"/>
                  <hi>Themir,</hi> and render juſtice to the diſcretion of <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> yet he had ſuch a tender love for the former, as to ſacrifice all his equity to him, and deſiring to reconcile them, Heaven, ſaid he to them, ſurely has not brought you together, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you in new quarrels, which are ſo hateful to it: Shall I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee you in that happy ſtate of friendſhip, which would render your lives and my repoſe pleaſant to me? ſhall it be in a continual uneaſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by your diviſions? <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> ſaid he to the young Prince, do ſomething to pleaſe me, teſtifie to <hi>Themir</hi> that you are ſorry for the outrage you have done him: And, you purſued he, addreſſing himſelf to the other, receive the ſubmiſſion of your Brother as becomes you: No Seignior, interrupted <hi>Themir,</hi> juſt as <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> who had reſolved to ſacrifice his reſentment to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Emperour, was going to obey him; I will not pardon him,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59666:69"/>
but let him know by the vengeance you owe me, that he is not to go unpuniſhed who will dare to offend him that has the advantage of being your eldeſt Son. Whatever diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions the Emperour of the <hi>Tartars</hi> had to favour <hi>Themir,</hi> yet this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent procedure was very diſpleaſing to him: You may be ſure I would puniſh <hi>Adanaxus</hi> if he were crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, replied he, but I do not ſee he is ſo, for having defended a life which you aſſaulted, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that he is my Son as well as you, and if the priviledge of birth has given you ſome advantages, that ought not to make any difference between you in my breaſt, do not you give me the diſquiet of ſeeing you rebellious to my will: Submit your ſelf to it Prince, ſince I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it you. I muſt acknowledge my trouble, Seignior, in that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo obedient as I ought, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Themir,</hi> but the crime of <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus</hi> then will have very ſtrange
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59666:69"/>
conſequences: you ow to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and poſſibly to my life what I now demand of you: and ſince you refuſe it me I find that I am leſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than I thought my ſelf to be, and that my loſs would not be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to you. He went out at thoſe words, and <hi>Tamberlain</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him more dearly than all the world, (though he learn'd the truth of what had paſſed from other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſons and from <hi>Axalla,</hi> in whom he repos'd his greateſt confidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) commanded <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to do what he could to get the friendſhip of his Brother. If <hi>Aſteria</hi> be grateful, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, you have a ſure way to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the reſentment of the cruel <hi>Themir, Bajazet</hi> is no longer in a condition to impoſe any laws upon her, intercede for your Brother, and do your endeavours to overcome an unjuſt a verſion: She ought to eſteem you and credit you, after what you have done for her; and if you can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline her to be favourable to <hi>Themir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59666:70"/>
you will engage him to your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and to clemency, and you will procure me a repoſe, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to injoy, ſo long as you are diſunited.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> found in himſelf no diſpoſition to give him that obedience he deſired: There were within him ſuch obſtacles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it as were not to be vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and perceiving the Emperour fix'd upon the happineſs of <hi>Themir,</hi> he went away from him, reſolving rather to periſh, than to ſee <hi>Neris</hi> in the power of a Rival, and of ſuch a one whom ſhe mortally hated.</p>
               <p>But whilſt by the diligence and care of <hi>Axalla,</hi> who waited on him, the Chirurgeons applied their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to his wounds, <hi>Themir</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breathing out revenge: how he might deſtroy <hi>Adanaxus</hi> was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing he had been employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſince he had left the Emperour, and he was no leſs ſtudious how he might ſacrifice his brother to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59666:70"/>
hatred, than to poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of <hi>Aſteria</hi> in ſpight of all right or reaſon. <hi>Tamberlain</hi> had put a kind of equality betwixt them, which made him almoſt mad, and in the fury he was then in, not <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> himſelf was ſecure from the horror of his deſigns, he forgot that his Father had ever had any blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able weakneſſes for any beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and whatſoever he had done like an unjuſt man or like one enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, was a pure effect of his blind paſſion, the Prince of <hi>Tanaîs</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him and went unpuniſhed, he could not digeſt the outrage, and it was in the Arms of his dear <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> that he went to ſeek out his cruel conſolations. I am betrayed, <hi>Odmar,</hi> ſaid he to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Adanaxus</hi> triumphs over the weakneſs of the Emperour, and he is ceaſed to be what heretofore he was. I thought it was ſufficient to make my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, to have my revenge granted, and that <hi>Tamberlain</hi> would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59666:71"/>
that Rival to the ſafety of my repoſe. But I am the Victim on the account of love, and if I give him time to gain upon that Spirit which is already wavering betwixt us, I may alſo be the victim on that of nature. But <hi>Odmar,</hi> he muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, it muſt be all his blood that muſt ſatisfie my deſpair, and aſſure my pretenſions. Well, Seignior, he ſhall periſh, interrupted <hi>Odmar,</hi> with that fury that ordinarily follows the reſolution of great crimes, and we will ſacrifice to your repoſe a victim that is ſo much your due: Let us have an ungrateful captive, and if it be neceſſary let us carry your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge even to <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> do you diſſemble and leave to me the care of managing the reſt. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> muſt needs fall under the deſigns that I have laid, and that love which ſo much croſſes yours, muſt be the occaſion of his ruine. I will cauſe him to be ſuſpected by the Emperour for making an attempt upon his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59666:71"/>
Throne and upon his Life, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velop him in the horrors of a crime of which I ſhall not find it difficult to contrive ſufficient probabilities. <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> is jealous of his glory, and of the Soveraign Authority. <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus</hi> ſhall dye hated by his father, his Ruine ſhall appear legitimate, you ſhall enjoy the tranquillity that that can procure you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour by an unheard of inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, protects him and abandons you, you ſhall then break out, the revolt will be permitted you, and it may be ſomething more. But Prince, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued <hi>Odmar,</hi> perceiving <hi>Themir</hi> to grow pale, you change colour what makes you to deſpair, does nature ſtill ſeem to work in you? Ah! think that <hi>Adanaxus</hi> is beloved by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <hi>Aſteria,</hi> and that he may yet uſurp the power and influence you have got over the Emperour's mind, to ſtir you up to a revenge that is legitimate.</p>
               <p>Theſe fatal counſels which flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59666:72"/>
                  <hi>Themir</hi>'s fury, began to work a calm upon his ſpirit, he reſolved to feign obedience to the commands of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> whilſt <hi>Odmar</hi> was laying his deſigns, and the Emperour at laſt taking that diſſimulation for a ſincere return, forgat the diſquiets that their enmity had raiſed in him.</p>
               <p>But whilſt <hi>Themir,</hi> whoſe jealouſie ſtill kept up his cruel humour, hid his bloody intentions under indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent appearances, the Princeſs <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> had ſome ſecret fore-notices of it. She was not ignorant of what the unmerciful Prince was capable, and when <hi>Odmar</hi> was labouring the performance of his horrible deſigns, ſhe trembled for the Prince whom they threatned. At firſt the joy of finding <hi>Adanaxus</hi> faithful again was reſented without having any thing to trouble it, but repreſenting to her ſelf to what perils his love expoſed him; Alas! ſaid ſhe, if the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> came back to <hi>Samarcanda,</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59666:72"/>
but to ſerve as a Victime to the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of <hi>Themir,</hi> wherefore has he juſtifyed himſelf? I was not any whit concerned in his life, ſo long as I doubted his heart; but he is innocent, and now my tenderneſs makes me ſenſible of all that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes him, Ah! <hi>Themir,</hi> ſpare his blood, if you have any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my life, or at leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat all thy crimes by the death of <hi>Aſteria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Princeſs made not theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints upon light and trivial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, <hi>Themir</hi> was not reſerv'd enough punctually to obſerve the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that <hi>Odmar</hi> impoſed upon him; and being tranſported by his choler, when he was with the Princeſs, he gave her by his threatning very great ſuſpicions of ſome bloody en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>
               <p>Time made his intentions break forth, <hi>Odmar</hi> gave out ſuch orders aswere very faithfully executed, and they Iaboured night and day to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59666:73"/>
make the Prince ſuſpected by the Emperour. The weakneſs he had for <hi>Themir,</hi> was not the only one of which he was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>capable; whatſoever concerned his authority, was very afflicting to him, and he was jealous of it after an extraordinary manner. <hi>Odmar</hi> had found ſome perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom the hopes of raiſing their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had made his creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cauſed ſeveral hints to be given to <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> which all agreed in the main, yet they came from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons. His quality of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Governour of <hi>Themir</hi> and thoſe places of eminence he was in, made him greatly honoured among the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and having ſpent his whole life in Cabals, and by a tedious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation thought upon all things that made to his advantage, and was pleaſing to him, it was not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for him to hit upon ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as he had contrived againſt him, and to gain perſons of the ſame conſtitutionsand temper as he was<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

laſt by his wicked and malicious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the firſt thing that ſhocked <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s ſpirit, and that ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reaſon and truth to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fear, was a perſon's telling him that <hi>Adanaxus</hi> had held very blamable correſpondencies with <hi>Bajazet:</hi> Which was preſently back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with anothers acquainting him, that being moſt paſſionately in love with his Daughter, he had returned to <hi>Samarcanda</hi> only to quit him from his fetters; that he had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times made an attempt upon the fidelity of the <hi>Oltoman</hi> Prince's Guards to procure his eſcape; that he ſided with his Sons, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of coming to ſeek their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of him; that to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he held ſecret Intelligences with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine War joyned to the former fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Turks</hi> rallied by <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Sons, might produce very great changes in his Empire. To theſe falſe conjectures were added the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59666:74"/>
reaſons of <hi>Adanaxus</hi>'s extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rhetorick and earneſtneſs to ſave <hi>Bajazet</hi> from his deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and of his care and pains to render the irkſomeneſs of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as pleaſant to him as he could: beſides they refreſhed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours memory with the exceſs of grief the Prince had diſcovered at <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s death; his private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the night on the terrace with <hi>Aſteria,</hi> the difference that had been between him and <hi>Themir,</hi> and in a word all things that might put an evil interpretation upon the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the innocent Prince of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naïs.

               </p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> his being carried to priſon occaſioned a very conſiderable noiſe in <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s Court; he was generally beloved, and his deſtiny was in a high degree lamented, and amongſt the moſt grave and ſober ſort of perſons, there were but few of them who would not with all their Souls have done his vertue juſtice: But there was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59666:77"/>
nothing to be done in his favour: the zeal of his friends was now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to him, and againſt both the commands and the pleaſure of the Emperor, the generous <hi>Axalla,</hi> as being the moſt perſwaded of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anaxus</hi>'s innocence, became the moſt ſenſible of his misfortune: he ſaw no likelyhood of undeceiving a weak Father, ſo great a Lover of his fortune, and prevented by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, who too well knew his humours and his fears, and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged their buſineſs with a great deal of prudence and ſafety; but however he went to ſee the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and to ſpeak to him concerning the Prince, but he was preſently commanded ſilence; and judging that he might indanger himſelf to be ſuſpected, and conſequently to loſe his liberty, if he ſpake any more to a Man, who by his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port had made himſelf uncapable of underſtanding reaſon, he retired with an extream regret but as he did
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59666:77"/>
not ſo much fear his diſgrace any otherwiſe then as it might give him an abſolute defeat from being any longer in a condition of ſerving <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> he made it his buſineſs to gain over to him the gallanteſt perſons of the Court, that he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might have a party to ſpeak in the favour of <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour his juſtification, and try if they could not in time melt down <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>'s heart into ſome tenderneſs for his captiv'd Son.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Themir</hi> was tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing; <hi>Odmar</hi>'s projects met with ſuch ſucceſsful beginnings, that he could not but expect the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of them would be reſembling: The Emperour would hearken to nothing but the counſels of his Rage and Error, and the ruine of the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> appearing now paſt all prevention unto the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of it, his barbarous Brother was before hand pleaſing himſelf with the agreeable thoughts of it;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59666:78"/>
and his hopes buoying him up, with ſuch a delightful flattery, he went directly to <hi>Aſteria,</hi> whom he found in a condition conformable to her grief. But in ſpight of all her tears and heavineſs, (more charming then ever yet ſhe had appeared to the ſight of <hi>Themir)</hi> her eyes, which an extraordinary paleneſs rendered languiſhing, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding full of a Majeſtick cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Is he only guilty becauſe he has with pitty reſented the unhappineſſes of <hi>Bajazet?</hi> And as this compaſſion obliges me to have a reſembling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt for him, ſhould you have proved falſe to you furious tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports upon my conſideration, if you had ſpared him? I ought to have
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59666:78"/>
done that which you reproach me for, anſwered the unjuſt Prince of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and this Rival ſufficiently deſerves my hatred, ſince I ow your averſion to him. You only ow it to your crimes, interrupted <hi>Aſteria,</hi> to thoſe barbarous ſentiments which have made you find ſuch ſweetneſs in the death of <hi>Ortobulus,</hi> in the ruine of my Mother, in the loſs of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> in my captivity, and in a word in all your unworthy threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of me. Thus Madam, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Themir,</hi> you impute all the events of fate to me, and I am culpable ſtill, becauſe <hi>Adanaxus</hi> conſpires againſt the Emperour. I ſhall not go about to juſtify my ſelf any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to you; but fear leaſt you do not quite exhauſt my patience; ſuch a haughty pride does not alwayes meet with ſubmiſſive Souls, and ſince I have ſuffered ſo much from your ingratitude, I may very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make uſe of my rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. I underſtand your mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59666:79"/>
purſued the Princeſs; but ſince I have nothing more to fear for <hi>Bajazet,</hi> they have not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to frighten me: conſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſometimes puts bounds to its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it is not alwayes deaf to the prayers of the unfortunate and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but does reſerve ſtill its thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the puniſhments of Tyrants. You ought then to make a Tryal, anſwered <hi>Themir,</hi> how far one may go without its ſuccour and to begin to make a more profitable uſe of my Authority.

He went away as he ended thoſe words; and though they had ſtruck a terror into the Princeſses ſoul, yet it was no ſmall relief to her to ſee the <hi>Barbarian</hi> go out of her room, and leave her the liberty of finding conſolations in her conſtancy
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59666:79"/>
againſt all the afflictions ſhe was o'rewhelm'd with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla,</hi> and his friends did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly labour to put a ſtop to the moſt preſſing of them, they exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all the care they could, when were thoſe moments that the Emperour found in his breaſt any return of tenderneſs for his young Son, at laſt they began to find him in a humour to hearken to what might be ſaid in his favour, then it was they conjured him to make a ſolid reflection upon <hi>Adanaxus</hi>'s car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and what ſeverity ſoever he reſolv'd to uſe againſt him, he could not find any of his actions blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and deſerving condemnation: his moderation in the unworthy treatments of <hi>Themir,</hi> his ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the commands of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and particularly to the laſt he had received from him, coming again into his memory, he began to fear he had acted with too much precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and reproaching himſelf for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59666:80"/>
it as a default of paternal love, he perceived himſelf in one of thoſe inquietudes which ordinarily do uſher in a deep repentance. He was as ſoon come to himſelf as he had been provoked, being incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of himſelf to be carried out to any great violences, but ſubject to a credulity which made him often take Chimera's for truths, and the wicked and poiſonous counſels of flatterers for a ſincere zeal. Theſe kind of humours almoſt continually go from one extremity to the other, <hi>Tamberlain</hi> paſt from that ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably for the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs,</hi> that he could not take any comfort in his being ſo much inraged againſt him. I have been too cruel ſaid he in thoſe reflections, to condemn <hi>Adanaxus</hi> upon diſcourſes which I've not given him time to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and anſwer: Thoſe accuſers, may not they be deceived in what they charge him with, and is his juſtification impoſſible? Weak

Prince, continued he, ſearch into the procedures of your Son with more mildneſs and tranquillity; what, would you ſacrifice him to your fears, and poſſibly to your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? Conſider that a Prince ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated upon the Throne of <hi>Aſia</hi> ought to prevent accidents with a greater moderation; have you ſeen <hi>Adanaxus</hi> in the troops of <hi>Bajazet</hi> during that abſcence which has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived you of him? Has fame, that publiſhes all things, ever told you any thing of him that you have need to complain of? and in the extremity to which <hi>Bajazet</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced when <hi>Adanaxus</hi> arrived at <hi>Samarcanda,</hi> can you find any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that his return was deſign'd by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prince, or by his daughter? He ſaw him not but by thy orders, and did not obtain his life but by arguments very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to thy glory, and which it was impoſſible for thee not to yield to. Thoſe very arguments which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59666:81"/>
have convinced me, become now thy crimes, thou wouldſt make him ſuffer puniſhment for having perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee to be generous. No <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi> do not thou become the talk or rather the horrour of the world by ſuch an action, but ſeek the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of thy Son and not his ruine, and if he be deeply ſmitten with the charms of that beauty, ſo fatal to the repoſe of thy blood, content thy ſelf in bringing deſpair to his affection by giving that <hi>Aſteria</hi> to <hi>Themir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This change of the Emperour was ſoon obſerved, by the friends and perſecutors of the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs: Odmar</hi> was quite enraged at it, and did not doubt but that the love and care of <hi>Axalla</hi> did much contribute to it, he would with all his ſoul have deſtroyed him with <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> but how ruinouſly ingenious his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and revenge were, it could do nothing againſt <hi>Axalla's</hi> glory, and he was obliged to confine his rage
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59666:81"/>
only in ſeeking out ways he thought might be moſt fit and proper to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terplot him, in hindering the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>Adanaxus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Tamberlain</hi> came more and more to himſelf, and was conſidering among all thoſe that were about him, who ſhould be the man he had beſt pitch upon to be ſent to examine the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> and from his mouth to be informed when and how he got his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>Bajazet</hi> and <hi>Aſteria:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great deal of balancing upon the election, he concluded that <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> ſhould be the man, one who was of a conſiderable eminence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, he was endowed with a great deal of wit and honeſty, <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> knew <hi>Adanaxus</hi> had a high eſteem and ſervice for him, and <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> appearing more fit than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take upon him ſuch an office, and to diſcharge it with honour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the commands of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and performed them with as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59666:82"/>
much juſtice as zeal. He went to the young Prince, and addreſſing himſelf with all that reſpect which was due to the Son of the Emperour, he humbly beſeeched him not to take it ill, if he propounded ſome queſtions to him that he had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from his Father. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> ſatisfied with his ſubmiſſion, frankly told him all he had before acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Axalla</hi> with, and afterwards his ſurpriſe, when at the death of <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> he knew his <hi>Aſteria</hi> again for <hi>Neris: Talmis</hi> being informed of the truth, made a very faithful recital of all the circumſtances to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and fortified them with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that were ſo powerful for the innocence of the Prince, that <hi>Tamberlain</hi> was more than half per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of them, but yet he thought it prudence to ſee whether the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and <hi>Adanaxus</hi> would be found in the ſame ſtory. He went to her Apartment early the next morning, and after he had excuſed himſelf for
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59666:82"/>
the unſeaſonableneſs of the hour he had choſen; Madam, ſaid he to her, I am not of right to flatter my ſelf with the thoughts of obtaining any grace from you, yet I am come to demand one of you, upon which all my tranquillity does depend. The Princeſs thought that <hi>Tamberlain</hi> was come again to be ſollicitous for <hi>Themir,</hi> and therefore looking on him very ſtedfaſtly, It is not likely in good earneſt, replied ſhe, you ſhould effect a thing that the death of <hi>Bajazet</hi> has not been able to make me reſolve upon. 'Tis not that now which brings me to you, purſued the Emperour, I only am come to demand of you how <hi>Adanaxus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his acquaintance with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what correſpondence <hi>Bajazet</hi> had with him, and what intelligences he may ſtill have with your Brothers; and I ſwear to you, that were he convicted of a thouſand deſigns ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon my Empire or my life, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danaxus</hi> ſhould find his pardon from
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59666:83"/>
your confeſſion, and that I will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice my moſt juſt reſentments to your ſincerity. Thought the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs could not much believe <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi>'s diſcourſe, yet becauſe ſhe had nothing to hazard in telling him the truth, ſhe made him the very ſame relation as the Prince had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Talmis:</hi> but indeed if ſhe did paſs over her tender affections to him, it was eaſily diſcoverable, that ſhe did it through modeſty. It is ſufficient Madam, ſaid the Emperour to her when ſhe had done ſpeaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will keep my word with you, and ſet <hi>Adanaxus</hi>'s Priſon wide open to you. You will do him juſtice, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Asteria,</hi> and his innocence is manifeſt enough to oblige you to reſtore him his liberty.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſtories agreeing together wrought a calm upon a great-part of <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s troubles, the ſincerity of the Princeſs he himſelf diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Talmis</hi> was no way ſuſpected by him, and nothing now remained but
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59666:83"/>
only to confound the accuſers of <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> the Emperour was juſt going to ſend for them when he ſaw <hi>Odmar</hi> coming up to him: The feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed compaſſion he ſhewed for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> made <hi>Tamberlain</hi> believe he would receive abundance of joy at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of his juſtification. <hi>Odmar,</hi> ſaid he to him, the pity you have teſtified for my Son, and which I condemned in you was juſt: all things perſwade me that he is not guilty, and you have appeared ſo ſenſible of his misfortune, that you cannot but receive as great a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to learn the happy ſucceſs of it. This was a thunderclap that made the perfidious <hi>Odmar</hi> think it would have ſtruck him dead upon the ſpot, but as he was the beſt man in the world to manage a diſſimulation, he concealed his trouble and confeſſed that he was overjoyed at this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He asked the Emperour whence it proceeded, and by what means
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59666:84"/>
he came to be informed of the Prince's innocence. <hi>Tamberlain</hi> with all the obliging civility imaginable, gave him an exact account of it, and continuing to entertain him with the ſame confidence; It is neceſſary, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, that thoſe who have been the cauſe of <hi>Adanaxus</hi>'s diſgrace, ſhould be examined before him, and that their puniſhment ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his glory, if he was not found guilty of any crime; make them to be ſought out <hi>Odmar,</hi> they are known to you, and I my ſelf will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the ſource and progreſs of this calumny. Seignior, anſwered <hi>Odmar,</hi> ſo haſty a procedure will go near to exaſperate them, therefore let us manage the buſineſs with more ſecrecy, and if you pleaſe to take my advice, do not diſcover your thoughts, one word is enough to allarm them, and their flight will defeat you of the revenge you may take, it will be hard for me to get them together, and bring them here
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59666:84"/>
upon other pretences, give me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time to bring this to paſs, and in the mean while conſerve againſt the Prince <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> all the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your firſt anger. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution ſeemed reaſonable to the Emperour, he embraced <hi>Odmar,</hi> and entruſting him with the conduct of this affair, he put a ſtop to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery he ſo much deſired.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Odmar</hi> was gone from him, he gave his rage the full ſwinge, and after he had examined whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might put things into diſorder again, and make the accuſations ſeem probable, he ſaw every way ſo many things to confound him, and ſo little ſecurity, that he thought he could not do better than to ſend away the informers. As they had done nothing without his orders, he immediately took this precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſent them from <hi>Samarcanda</hi> the ſame night, and having given them time enough to advance their flight, he went to find out the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59666:85"/>
with a grief and perplexity in his face ſo admirably counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it appeared natural. I ſaw ſufficiently, Seignior, ſaid he to him, that there was but one word neceſſary to render your intentions publick, and to counterplot your abſolute ſatisfaction: I have been in vain looking out for thoſe whom I was charg'd to bring before you: they are fled, ſo that none of them are to be found in <hi>Samarcanda.</hi> Well then, anſwered the Emperour, this flight does fully convince me of the innocence of <hi>Adanaxus.</hi> If he had been guilty, his enemies would have ſtayed without ever fearing any thing of the event of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Yet <hi>Odmar,</hi> we had beſt ſend ſo many in purſuance after them, that we may from ſome of them hear what is become of thoſe fugitives. Yes, Seignior, anſwered the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Tartar,</hi> that is but requiſice, and that I will labour with all the care I can. In ſhort, he ſent out ſeveral
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59666:85"/>
perſons, but he knew very well which way to ſend them ſo that they ſhould never be the wiſer: But yet all this could not be managed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome noiſe: the friends of the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> had great reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of joy at it, and <hi>Axalla,</hi> who only was cautious of himſelf upon the conſideration of <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> ſaw now that it was time to complete his happineſs, and addreſſed himſelf to the Emperour to ſollicite him for it: The Emperour preſently yielded, and commanded him to go to the Tower, and bring the Prince from it: This was a very pleaſing order to a perſon who had ſo tender a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for him as <hi>Axalla</hi> had; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of it with tranſport, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had continued with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour a little while longer, to take away the reliques of his inquietude, he ran with the reſembling fury of a Lover to his dear <hi>Adanaxus.</hi> Though the Prince could not expect any thing that might be fatal from
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59666:86"/>
                  <hi>Axalla,</hi> yet he had a thouſand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Idea's in his fancy when he ſaw him: Muſt I then dye, my dear <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla,</hi> ſaid he to him embracing him, and are you come to be a companion of my misfortune? No Seignior, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Axalla,</hi> I come to reſtore you liberty, which only your virtue and the juſtice of the Emperour has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you. He then acquainted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the change of his condition, the weak effort his enemies had made againſt him, and the Prince uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the conſequences which that might occaſion, appeared unſhaken, he went towards the Palace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelf by the way of <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and he had the joy to know by the acclamations of the people, that they had been as ſenſible of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, as they were of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>When he came up to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour he threw himſelf at his feer, which action made him bluſh through confuſion, as it did alſo
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59666:86"/>
cauſe him to ſigh through repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> ſaid he to him, after he had done embracing him, I have not done any thing againſt you which I am not reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and as I no longer doubt but that the crimes you have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of are only forged, ſo I would already have revenged you of thoſe who were the inventers of them, if they were not got out of the reach of my anger: To be plain with you, I am ſufficiently ſenſible of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, for it I have believed my tender affections to you, and you are alſo redevable for one part of your juſtification to the Princeſs <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteria.</hi> You have the freedom to go and pay her your acknowledgments for it, and judge of the return of my friendſhip, by this firſt effect of my indulgence. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> bluſhed to hear his Princeſs named; and it was not difficult for <hi>Tamberlain</hi> to interpret the emotion; but after he had learn'd from the Prince's mouth,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59666:87"/>
the ſame things that <hi>Talmis</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to him; You have a Rival in <hi>Themir,</hi> ſaid he to him, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions are ſtrengthned upon my promiſes, and whom I cannot deny my protection againſt your flame, though I know that you have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a longer ſervice, as well as of the gratitude of the Princeſs: But <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> is it not poſſible to conquer your ſelf, and by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous effort—Seignior, cryed the Prince, if I were unfaithful to <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> I could become ſo to you: He that can prove a Traitor to his love will never have any great conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for nature, and I ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf worthy of your Chains, if I were capable of doing the leaſt effort to break thoſe of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>As the young Prince ended theſe words, <hi>Themir</hi> entred; his paleneſs expreſſed the deſpair he was in, and the looks he darted upon <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> ſufficiently teſtified that his Soul was
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59666:87"/>
full of a thouſand bloody reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Tamberlain</hi> ſeemed as if he did not mind them, and asked him if he came to ſhare in his brother's joy to which he returned no anſwer, and the Emperour according to his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al complaiſance, not being willing to preſs him any farther, contented himſelf in giving to the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> the careſſes that were due to him, and publickly proteſted that there were not any puniſhments which thoſe who had unjuſtly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, ought not to expect.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Adanaxus</hi> had the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to retire, he took the benefit of that the Emperour had given him, to ſee <hi>Aſteria,</hi> and the jealous looks of <hi>Themir</hi> were not powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prevent him from it. It would be very hard to tell, which of the two were the moſt ſenſible of the pleaſure they reſented in ſeeing one another again: Silence and ſighs are the firſt marks of thoſe kind of joys, and there is more ſaid in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59666:88"/>
trouble and confuſion, that in a ſet and orderly diſcourſe. Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how eloquent were the eyes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danaxus</hi> then, and how attentive were thoſe of the Princeſs to hearken to them? As he entred he flung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her feet, and after he had been there a good while, without her having the leaſt power to make him riſe, at laſt, Madam, ſaid he to her, the great myſtery of my love is known to the Emperour, this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge has not hindered my liberty, and I am come to pay you my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements for having procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it me. What an honourable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is it to me to ſee my ſelf proſtrate at your feet, and not to ow it to any thing but your ſelf. You ow me nothing for having done juſtice to a truth which was profitable to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> interrupted the Princeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though I ſhould not have this teſtimony to your ſervices, my heart would have compelled me to render it you. Is it poſſible for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59666:88"/>
me to forget, without the laſt ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that you have been prodigal of your blood for <hi>Neris,</hi> treated a wretched Unknown like a Princeſs, run through Seas and Land to ſeek me out, and have done ſo many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſervices for the unfortunate <hi>Bajazet?</hi> You ſet too high a value upon thoſe that are ſo little deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, replied <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> but as for me my Princeſs, what do I not ow you, to ſuffer at your feet the Son of <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> and the Brother of <hi>Themir?</hi> I do not confound the vices of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> with your vertues, replied <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteria,</hi> nor your ſervices with the outrages that have been done me; and if I do hate your Brother as one that is worthy of my averſion, I love you, Seignior, becauſe you deſerve to be beloved, and becauſe <hi>Bajazet</hi> has not impoſed upon me ſuch laws as are contrary to the ſentiments of my breaſt. You ſee now my fears were but too well grounded, and you ought not to doubt but that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59666:89"/>
the misfortune you have eſcaped was a deſign of the Prince of <hi>Tartary,</hi> for the future take more precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt him, let the Emperour know it was <hi>Themir</hi> that would have ruined you. Alas Madam, anſwer'd the Prince, the Empire that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has over the mind of <hi>Tamberlain</hi> makes your commands be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult, none can accuſe him without rendring himſelf at the ſame time ſuſpected by the Emperour, and to teſtifie the leaſt ſuſpicion againſt him would be to prove my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer. And what will you do then purſued <hi>Aſteria?</hi> Adore you, my Princeſs, interrupted <hi>Adanaxus</hi> with a melting fervency beyond expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and this devotion ſhall be the glorious imployment of my life. Your fidelity is dear to me, replied ſhe, but in this preſent occaſion it is not ſufficient for me, and if you love me you muſt think upon ſome way to conſerve your ſelf, and what would you do your ſelf, Madam,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59666:89"/>
added the Prince, I would replied <hi>Aſteria,</hi> deſpiſe <hi>Themir</hi> unto my laſt breath, render by my reſiſtance all his pretenſions uſeleſs, and though I would not do it for my ſelf, believe me I would do it for you. Ah Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, cryed the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs:</hi> ought I to be afraid of any thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this glorious aſſurance? Alas, Seignior, anſwered <hi>Aſteria,</hi> this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance as ſincere as it is, can it do any thing againſt Irons, Priſons, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, and to conclude, againſt all the other ways that <hi>Themir</hi> is able to make uſe of to deſtroy you? Can my affection render you immortal, and am I more certain of your life, becauſe I love you? Give me the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to ſee you miſtruſt all things, and then I ſhall value what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do to put your ſelf in a condition that may ſecure you from your enemies. Yes Madam, purſued <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> I will obey, I will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of my life, I will foreſee, if it be poſſible, the deſigns that may be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59666:90"/>
hatched againſt me, and I will forget nothing that may make me capable of deſerving the favours of my charming Princeſs.</p>
               <p>At the end of theſe diſcourſes, and ſome others much reſembling them, <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> who ſince he found that his <hi>Neris</hi> was <hi>Aſteria,</hi> had never met with an opportunity to demand of her thoſe adventures of hers that he was ignorant of; burning with an earneſt impatience of knowing them, conjured her to give him a Relation of them which ſhe preſently conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and thus began her diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>WHen <hi>Andronicus</hi> defeated the <hi>Turks</hi> who were to be my guide, I was going from <hi>Burſa</hi> to <hi>Sebaſtia</hi> to meet my Mother, who was to paſs the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Emperour; our Troops were on the ſide of <hi>Thrace, Bajazet</hi> had deſigns upon <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and it was not believed that in the Winter <hi>Paleologus</hi> his Sons, harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the little oppoſition they found, would venture to go into the leſſer <hi>Aſia;</hi> but in their way they took us; I concealed my name, not knowing into what hands I was fallen; but having learnt it was in <hi>Andronicus's,</hi> and afterwards under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his ſentiments for me, I made
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59666:91"/>
it my particular buſineſs to keep it from being known, and through the natural averſion I had for him, and the fear of ſeeing <hi>Paleologus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of his Son's Love and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the victime of a peace between the two Empires; it fell out very luckily for me that I did ſo, the Emperour of <hi>Greece</hi> would not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize an alliance unknown, and in all probability unequal; which gave me a very ſenſible joy, becauſe my hatred for <hi>Andronicus</hi> augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſoon as ever I had a ſight of you. I quickly perceived how my heart pleaded in your favour by the trouble and melancholineſs I reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when I beheld you render your ſubmiſſions with too much aſſiduity to the Princeſs of <hi>Greece:</hi> and time, and your procedure having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me of your heart, I bluſh'd ſometimes to think I was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and that when I with ſcorn refuſed the vows of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus,</hi> I hearkened with pleaſure
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59666:91"/>
to thoſe of one unknown: but that confuſion produced no effects which were not favourable to you. I told you nothing of my true birth, not ſo much out of any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfulneſs, as out of a certain ſcruple I then had: I was very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know whether you had only a kindneſs for my perſon; but I did it out of policy, after you had told me yours. I was not ignorant of <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s hatred to the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> and fearing leſt your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould reſemble his, I made that a ſecret to you, the reſerve of which I thought I ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced by my weakneſs for you. I began in the mean time not to be in a power to be ſilent to you, but had inſallibly told you all, if <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus</hi> had but for ſome days ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the deſign he had been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating ſince the unhappy ſucceſs of his enterpriſe at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> but he made me be carried away then when I thought leaſt of it, and thoſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59666:92"/>
fellows more hardly and reſolute then thoſe of the Emperour, imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me in a Veſſel, which in a ſhort time brought us to a very ſtrange and lovely Houſe, which they were aſſured of. At firſt I accuſed the Emperour for this ſecond carrying me away, but I was undeceived, when <hi>Andronicus</hi> reduced to his flight by the wicked ſucceſs of thoſe unfaithful enterpriſes of his againſt his Father, came to find me in the place where I had been conducted: I was fearful of all things from the violences of a deſperate and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit; and therefore to inſpire him with a greater reſpect then I thought he might have had to one unknown, I told him I was daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Emperour of the <hi>Turks:</hi> This news appear'd to him to be much to his advantage, and he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that in reſtoring me to <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet,</hi> he might not only obtain me from him, but he might with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er facility conquer his Father's Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59666:92"/>
in promiſing to ſhare it with me. He then accquainted me with his deſign, and deſired me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it as an effect of the paſſion he had to pleaſe me. You may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe that the hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Bajazet</hi> made me reſolve upon ſome complaiſance: at laſt we arrived at <hi>Burſa,</hi> and we were received there with all the joy that could be inſpired into the Emperor, and my Mother, by the return of a daughter whoſe loſs they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed: The <hi>Grecian</hi> Prince had very extraordinary honours paſſed upon him, but when he explained his Intentions to <hi>Bajazet</hi> and that he perceived him much averſe to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them, he fell to reproaches, and from thence to threats, which had but too bloody effects. He went in great fury from <hi>Burſa,</hi> and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards his Father's Army, which he found driven back by the valour of <hi>Ortobulus,</hi> who had the command of ours in the Emperor's
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59666:93"/>
abſence, even within ſight of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> He made his peace by a thouſand ſubmiſſions, related his adventures, and ſeeing the <hi>Greeks</hi> every way weakned, he himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly laboured the relieving of the <hi>Tartars. Tamberlain</hi> ſollicited by <hi>Andronicus,</hi> and jealous of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s glory whom he hated, got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the forces of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and brought where ever he went both horror and deſolation. At laſt this <hi>Tamberlain</hi> famous by our diſgraces, and eminent by our misfortunes, without any pitty burnt our Cities, ſacrificed our people, and reduced, by that fatal ſucceſs that did attend him, a Prince who was ſeen ready to ſhare almoſt the World, with the reſt of the Princes, to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition into which he is fallen.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe evils were happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, notwithſtanding my grief I did not looſe the remembrance of <hi>Adanaxus,</hi> nor forget the cares of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59666:93"/>
informing my ſelf of him. I was confirmed of your abſence, and was perſwaded that you muſt needs learn who I was, I did imagine you had not gone from <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> but only to eſcape fighting with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this very thought gave me a great conſolation: at laſt Seignior, <hi>Burſa</hi> was ravaged, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Sebaſtia, Themir</hi> haled us from the Palace, and made us take this voy age to <hi>Aſia,</hi> where we were ſeen to follow the Chariot of that cruel Conquerour; and which coſt my Mother her life. Our captivity preceded that of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s ſome few days, and I have often heard him ſay, that being over whelmed with a mortal grief, after <hi>Ortobulus</hi>'s misfortune whom <hi>Themir</hi> had maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred before his eyes, and the loſs of the laſt battle, having ſuffered his Horſes to carry him up and down without any deſign or hope through unknown deſarts. He met with a Shepherd, who was all alone by
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59666:94"/>
the ſide of a River pleaſing himſelf with playing ſome rural airs upon his Oaten pipe, the Emperor look'd upon him a long time admiring at the ſweetneſs of his condition, and then ſighing: Oh! Too happy Shepherd, ſaid he to him, how worthy is thy ſtate of envy, to have nothing to ſpend but thy dayes, which bloody ambition never croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s calamities will furniſh you with matter for your Songs, and you may hereafter in your pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Numbers ſay, unfortunate Prince thou ſhalt never more ſee thy delightful <hi>Sebaſtia,</hi> nor thy dear <hi>Ortobulus.</hi> This Shepherd with the ſight and words of the Emperour, offered him his little cottage, but that retreat was not very long ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable to him. <hi>Themir</hi> by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition for him quickly reſembled his fate to that of ours. She ended this diſcourſe with a thouſand tears, which made <hi>Adanaxus</hi> repent that he had been the unhappy cauſe of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59666:94"/>
them, and after he had imployed ſome time in drying them up, he left her, to teturn to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Odmar</hi> was flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the tranſports of <hi>Themir</hi> with the hopes of a more ſucceſsful crime, and promiſed him the ruine of <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxus</hi> with very powerful aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and counſel'd him to go once more, and make his laſt efforts to <hi>Aſteria.</hi> Seignior, ſaid he to the Emperor, I've now diſpenſed with all that has hitherto made me ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the contempts of <hi>Aſteria,</hi> will you give me your conſent to impoſe upon her inclinations to make me happy, for I do not think you will authorize <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to thwart my pretenſions, and eſpecially upon the account of <hi>Aſterïa,</hi> whom I may call my conqueſt, by the blood ſhe coſt me whilſt he abandoned you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indeed I have no intention to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to you, anſwer'd the Emperor, but you have your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59666:95"/>
to ſatisfy your Love. But Son, are you ſtedfaſtly reſolved to marry a Maid that cannot love you, who will look upon you as her Tyrant in your moſt pleaſing moments, and become a torment to your Life. <hi>India, China, Egypt, Arabia,</hi> have Princeſſes, who will procure us ſuch alliances as may be advantageous, and who are bleſt with charms, if Fame may be believed: You will bring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to your ſelf a more quiet happineſs, and the daughter of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> will ſee her folly puniſhed by a contempt ſhe will repent ſhe had ever merited. No, Seignior replied <hi>Themir,</hi> I will have no other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs then that I demand of you. Well then added <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> give her ſome days reſpite to her mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Seignior, interrupted <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir, Aſteria</hi> will never ſoften by time, and it is unprofitable to throw it away. I will not preſcribe you any long time, purſued the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and then you ſhall have all my
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59666:95"/>
Authority. <hi>Themir</hi> complyed with the Emperor and by an affected kind of ſubmiſſion got himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for it. He preſently went to fling himſelf at the feet of <hi>Aſteria;</hi> and <hi>Adanaxus</hi> being a greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution to him then his love, he ſought out <hi>Odmar,</hi> who adviſed him to give the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> the liberty of ſeeing the Princeſs for ſome few days, that ſo he may be deprived of it for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adanaxus</hi> did not trouble himſelf about forming of bloody deſigns, but imploying all his deſires to his Love, one obliging word from the Princeſs did move him more then the poſſeſſion of an Empire could have done.</p>
                  <p>He ſpent one evening with her with as much ſweetneſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, as if he had neither had Rivals nor enemies, and was taking his leave of her with the raviſhing joy of a ſucceſsful Lover, when he heard a crying in the Palace, that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59666:96"/>
the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> was dead. It is impoſſible to expreſs <hi>Aſteria's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments at theſe pitiful cries, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danaxus</hi> was ſo newly gone from her that ſhe had not had the time to undreſs her ſelf ſince that ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to hear his death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, ſtruck her with an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that gave her almoſt a mortal paleneſs, and ſhe fell into a ſwoon that held her ſo long, as made her women believe ſhe was quite expired.</p>
                  <p>The cryes increaſed up and down the Palace, <hi>Tamberlain</hi> was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at it, and <hi>Axalla</hi> enraged at the cruel deſtiny of ſo young a Prince, ran to the place where the maſſacred body lay (which was at the foot of a pair of Stairs that led to <hi>Aſteria's</hi> Apartment.) He embraced it all bloody as it was, but it was not long e're by the light of ſeveral Flambeaus that the Servants brought, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that the perſon departed was <hi>Themir</hi> and not <hi>Adanaxus:</hi> Oh
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59666:96"/>
how great was <hi>Axalla's</hi> joy? What was the ſurpriſe of <hi>Odmar</hi> in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his dear hopes in the condition he thought the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs</hi> had been. The Emperour was alſo come to this place, and by his tranſports teſtified, how cruelly the loſs of a Son ſo tenderly beloved, was like to be revenged. <hi>Adanaxus</hi> came thither too at the ſame time, and troubled at <hi>Themir</hi>'s fate; how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtable ſoever he would have been, if he had not bewailed it. Ah! Seignior, ſaid he to <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is the murtherer of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſhall only dye by my hands. 'Tis I, interrupted <hi>Odmar,</hi> with an undaunted reſolution, 'tis I who have given to the unfortunate <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi> that deſtiny which I only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for thee: and when I thought thy death certain, I my ſelf was the publiſher of it by my outcries. I ſaw you go to <hi>Aſteria's</hi> Apartment, and having long ſince reſolved thy deſtruction, I waited here to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59666:97"/>
thee, to give a pleaſing ſurpriſe to <hi>Themir</hi> by the noiſe of thy death, my firſt deſigns not having been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, I would not ow the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this laſt to any other hand, than mine own: but fortune has proved baſe to me, and betrayed my intentions, and <hi>Themir</hi> who in all likelihood would have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with reſembling ones, is now unfortunately fallen under the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of my ſtabs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

render juſtice to nature; for <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> was my Son, and in the firſt days of your own, your abſence du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the war of <hi>China,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of your Queen at <hi>Cambalu,</hi> favouring my ambition, I very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily made an exchange of them: your young Prince died naturally in the exile to which I had ſent him, and mine enjoying his place, would, had it not been for this fatal acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, have reigned over the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars:</hi> He was ignorant of his birth, and I had uſed my utmoſt induſtry, and addreſs to make him dear to you, and <hi>Adanaxus</hi> to meet with your hatred, or at leaſt your indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, whom I looked upon as the only obſtacle that could trouble me. But yet after the precaution of ſo many years, and the flattering Idea's I fed my ſelf withal, I have inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely deprived my ſelf of him, theſe are the effects of unconſtant fortune, ſhe yet demands one more, and he who has not trembled to

reach the heart of his Son, ought not to have any pity for his own. At thoſe words he ran a poniard up into his body, and then throwing himſelf upon that of <hi>Themir,</hi> he there expired in a moment. The death and the laſt words of <hi>Odmar</hi> produced new cauſes of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Tamberlain</hi> had not the power to recover himſelf out of his, to think that he had given the whole Empire of his Soul to an impoſtor, who had committed ſo many inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices againſt him, and cauſed the ruine of his true Son. This dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful accident which was ſo great a juſtification to the Prince of <hi>Tanaïs,</hi> obliged the Emperour to make him a publick reparation for what was paſt, and not being able to tarry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer in a place that was float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch odious blood, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to his Apartment, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Adanaxus</hi> after he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the wretched Bodies ſhould be buried, returned to the
