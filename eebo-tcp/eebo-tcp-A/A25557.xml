            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO MALICE DEFEATED: OR, Some Reflections upon Madam <hi>Cellier's</hi> CASE.</head>
            <p>SO Damnable and Malicious are the Popes Imps grown, eſpecially the Female Sex, though both as bad a Torment to <hi>England,</hi> as Hell to them: They cannot be content to come off with their Damnable PLOTS, by running down the KINGS Evidence and upbraiding them: But preſently they print and publiſh a parcel of Helliſh Lies to excuſe their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed infernal Practiſes, thinking thereby to deceive the World with their impudent and deceitful Lies: Knowing full well the Pope will pardon all they do in his Service, for they have not been ſuch bad Servants to him; but for the Thouſand pounds, they ſay, they ſpent in their damnable and deceitful plottings againſt the Proteſtants: He will, you may be ſure; pay them double, and it may be give them three Hundred Maſſes for the uſe: Yet, I do not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but God will diſcover, your helliſh cloven Foot under your long Coats, to your Shame and Confuſion, and the Nations good.</p>
            <p>I do ſuppoſe that the Pope gave you a pardon before your Caſe was writ, or otherwiſe you would not have deceitfully ſaid, <hi>You did not fear Death; nor the Smell of Newgate;</hi> and ſo have ſealed ſuch a Parcel of damnable Lies, and impudent and helliſh Language up with your Blood.</p>
            <p>Your popiſh, upbraiding helliſh Speeches ſhews you have a damnable, wicked and helliſh Spirit within, and a Pocky Cloven Foot without. But the God of all Truth will render unto the Wicked according to their Deſerts, and bring to light all your Damnable practices: and releaſe his people from your damnable helliſh Claws.</p>
            <p>You ſay, Capt. <hi>Thomas Dangerfield,</hi> who is worthy of the Name, has been a wicked man; if he had not, he would not have concerned himſelf with your Damnable, Deceitful and curſed PLOT.</p>
            <p>But, to make the Nation amends, he hath Diſcovered your Damnable and ranck-poyſon <hi>PLOT;</hi> which in ſo doing, he hath done the Nation more good a hundred-fold, than ever he did them harm: for in his Diſcovering this your Damnable and Curſed <hi>PLOT,</hi> he hath ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an honeſt man, both to his King and Country; as you will, I am afraid, know to your Coſt.</p>
            <p>If the Pope, and all his Imps ſtand by you; (as, <hi>D. B. P. S. A. P. C.)</hi> you will be mightily miſtaken, if you think that your Female Sex, or Male Sex, can run down a Nation, far better than where your Old Grand-ſir, the hatcher of miſchief dwels; I mean <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Devil in the Pope lives. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈1 span left blank〉</desc>
               </gap> But, pray Madam, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you go any farther, take my Advice, (and do not Curſe me, when you ſee this your <hi>Looking-Glaſs)</hi> which is, Make an open Confeſſion to God, and all the world, of all your Damnable and Curſed Practiſes, and this Nation will be bound to pray for you: but, if you continue in your falſehood, and believe the Popiſh Religion, than I will give you my farther Advice; that ſince you have done more harm to this Nation, than ever you or the Popes Agents can make good: Go you over to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there ſpend the reſt of your daies in a Nunnery, there let your clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Foot with your rank body and poiſoned Mind continue till you dy: but then God have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on your Soul; for the pope can give none.</p>
