            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Argument and diſpoſition of the Pſalme.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oued I am vndoubtedly to beleeue for certaine, that the doctrine comprehended in the monuments of the Prophets and Apoſtles, is deliuered from the true God, and that all other Religions, ſtriuing with the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, are fabulus, and againſt God, both blaſphemous and deadly; When I conſider the doctrine of our Religion, to be more auncient then the opinions of other Nations, and to be confirmed by manifeſt diuine teſtimonies, I doe alſo behold, (not without great pleaſure) the diſcent or race of our Teachers, euen from <hi>Adam</hi> to the diſciples of the Apoſtles. Finally, ſeeing by meruailous meanes the Church is preſerued, which beareth about thys doctrine euery where in the world, and ſeeing that the moſt wiſeſt, and moſt modeſt perſons, had rather ſuffer all torments then to caſt the ſame away: I doubt not, but that the Church of CHRIST thinketh rightly of God, truely calleth vpon God, is truely heard, and ſhall haue her rewards in the ende. But much more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently I am ſo mooued to beleeue, ſo oft as I conſider or thinke vppon the ſayings of our Prophets, touching the fatall or diuine mutations of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world, touching the perpetuall order of the gouernments thereof, alſo tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the comming, Paſſion, and Reſurrection of our Redeemer, of whom GOD in the beginning before ſpake, that he woulde ſende him vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, to take away ſinne, and death, and to reſtore vnto vs righteouſneſſe and life.</p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe prophecies, (which properly and plainly doe preache of CHRIST,) this Pſalme (in mine opinion) hath the ſpeciall place, which with ſo great light of wordes and efficacie of meaning, ſetteth before our eyes the paſſion and reſurrection of Chriſt: as I cannot eaſily beleeue, that neyther <hi>Apelles</hi> nor <hi>Durerus</hi> the moſt excellent Paynters, if they had ſeene
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1118:6"/>
Chriſt before theyr eyes, (as he was hanged vpon the Croſſe,) could better or more euidently haue expreſſed the ſame with theyr colours. For although Dauid liued certaine yeeres before Chriſt was ſent in the fleſhe, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, beeing fully inſpired with the light of the holy Ghoſt, he ſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Chriſt, (ſuffering for vs, and rayſed from death to life,) with ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table words, that this 22. Pſalme, may ſeeme more rather a declaration of the preſent deede, then a Prophecie of thoſe things that were to come. For the Prophet taketh his beginning euen from thoſe very words which Chriſt himſelfe vſed, as he hanged in his extreame agonie, and hee foreſheweth the venimous illuſions wherewith thoſe enemies of Chriſt, (beeing then in hys moſt greeuous calamitie) inſulted againſt him: afterwardes hee addeth a moſt lightſome and large deſcription, wherein he moſt euidently layeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, the ſpeciall or chiefe parts of this Tragedie. viz. <hi>They pearced</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>my hands and my feete, &amp;c. verſe. 17.</hi> Alſo, <hi>They parted my garments amongſt them, and cast lots vpon my vesture. verſe. 18.</hi> To theſe deſcriptions are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie complaints, prayers, &amp; conſolations inſerted, which containe moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent affections.</p>
               <p>In concluſion, there is added a moſt gladſome narration, or diſcourſe of the reſurrection and glory of Chriſt, which he enioyed after he had ſubdued his enemies vnder his power. Let vs therefore loue and oftentimes reade this moſt ſweete Pſalme, not onely to the end that it may inſtruct vs concerning the deedes doone by our Captaine and Redeemer, but alſo for thys cauſe, that it may confirme vs againſt Academicall doubtings of our aduerſaries, which oftentimes mightily ſhake mens mindes: whither the doctrine which the Prophets and Apoſtles haue left for monuments, be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himſelfe, who in very deede is Creator and conſeruer of all things, whom onely to worſhyp with true godlines of minde, &amp; whom to obey it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs. Againſt theſe weapons may a man oppoſe (as it were a Buckler,) the godly and continuall meditation of this Pſalme, which witneſſeth, that the greateſt matters of all, are from God declared vnto the Prophets, which things the euent it ſelfe alſo hath approoued and ratified. Sithens therfore, ſure it is, that theſe Prophecies haue theyr groundes from GOD, it muſt needes be alſo, that the other doctrine of the Church, is of and from GOD. But now let vs heare Dauid himſelfe, ſpeaking familiarly with vs.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Moſt heauie or ſorrowful lamentation is this, which farre paſſeth our thinking or ſpeaking, and a complaint of the minde, ſtriuing wyth temptation of abiection: for, it cannot be, but the ſame perſon which ſuſtained Gods wrath, came into that cogitation, as if he were forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and caſt away from God. And although we in this inſtant and preſent fortune, doo not attaine vnto the greatneſſe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint, which Chriſt earneſtly, and not diſſemblingly there vſed: yet notwithſtanding, ſome of the members of his Church féele ſome ſmall taſte of theſe agonies.</p>
               <p>When our firſt Parents had begotten of themſelues two Sonnes, they were brought into good hope it ſhoulde come to paſſe, that euen theſe ſhould become as it were, the firſt young plantings of the true Church, and with ioyfull minds thought they vpon the promiſe made vnto them by God, touching their ſéede alſo: afterwards, when they ſaw their chéefeſt hopes ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly to be quailed by the death of <hi>Abell,</hi> (whoſe ſlaine bodie they beheld,) and his other wicked brother to become a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, no doubt then they were in ſo great mourning &amp; ſorrow, that they often might cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me</hi>? Why repreſſeſt thou not the raging deuill, and breakeſt not, nor enfeebleſt his power? <hi>Dauid</hi> béeing driuen into exile, and not onely bereaued of his Kingdom, but (which was far greater then his Kingdome) béeing ſpoyled of all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of holines and righteouſnes, no doubt vnderſtoode well
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1118:7"/>
this verſe, and with often ſpéeches repeated the ſame, eſpecially heere, looking vpon thoſe diſtreſſes whereof hee knoweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be both the Authour and originall, crying in this verſe: <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> Vnto theſe perſons is King <hi>Ezechias</hi> alſo to be added. For when he (béeing himſelfe, as it were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with a greeuous and deadly ſicknes) ſaw death euen at the dore, he beganne to cry out, ſaying: <hi>Like a Lyon hath the Lord broken my bones. <hi>Eſay. cap. 38. verſe. 13.</hi>
                  </hi> And <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet may well be numbred with theſe alſo, as it ſéemeth where he ſayth: <hi>The comforter that ſhould refreſh my ſoule, is far from me. <hi>Lam. cap. 1. verſe. 16.17.18.</hi>
                  </hi> For what thing may happen more ſorrowfull and lamentable, vnto a pittifull ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der harted man, and a louer of godlines, then to ſee his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, together with the Temple, moſt miſerably fired or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and his Cittizens, partly to be ſlaine, and partly carryed away into vnknowne places by the enemies. But Chriſtes ſorrowes, and greeuous perplexities, had much more bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them: for Chriſt bare in himſelfe the whole maſſe of our ſinne, he felt the wrath of God poured vpon him, euen as if he had polluted himſelfe with our filthineſſe. Therefore thys great and vnſpeakeable burthen, not onely expreſſed vnto him a bloody ſweat, but alſo this tragicall complaint, which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Chriſt had a greeuous conflict with the tentation of abiection.</p>
               <p>Truly it is a great and huge calamitie, to looſe or forgoe viſible helpes or ſuccours, and to be forſaken of fréendes, but this by no meanes can be compared to the forſaking of GOD. For the eternal Father, exerciſed not in the puniſhment of his Sonne, his vertue and diuine power, but ſuffered him to bee tormented with horrible miſeries both in ſoule and bodie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the <hi>Word</hi> (as <hi>Iraeneus</hi> moſt grauely ſaith in his third Booke and <hi>21.</hi> chap.) <hi>ceaſſed in Chriſt, that his humane nature might die in him and be crucified:</hi> that is, <hi>The word,</hi> or ſeconde perſon in Trinitie, abuſed not his power againſt hys calling, but gaue place vnto his Fathers wrath againſt ſinne, and became obedient vnto his Father vnto death, euen the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1118:7"/>
death of the Croſſe. Thus haue I breefely ſpoken touching the firſt and the ſeconde verſes, that the Reader may thus be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed therein. For this ſame greatneſſe of the complaint, can not be vttered by any ſpeech, but is to be learned in godly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and in the vſe or courſe of our life.</p>

                  <p>But thou continueſt holy, ô thou worſhippe of Iſraell.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The thirde verſe ſetteth downe a conſolation againſt the moſt ſorrowfull complaint aboue recited: for as hee that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſhypwracke (beeing by the violent rage of the ſtorme toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp and downe) if happily he fall vpon any Rocke, or boorde of the broken ſhyp, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, a boorde to ſwim vpon, he layes all the holde thereupon that hee can, and ſo amongſt the outragious roring ſtormes of the North, ſuccoureth himſelfe thereupon for a ſeaſon. So Chriſt in midſt of the waues of his troubles and tryals, embraceth conſolation to himſelfe, wherby he eſtabliſheth and confirmeth his minde, leaſt he ſhould faint or quaile, and be ouercome of the cruell enemy. And the firſt place of conſolation, is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God. <hi>[But thou continueſt holy]</hi> when thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thy ſelfe knowne amongſt vs, and haſt giuen thy worde vnto vs, it reſteth agréeable thereby, that our prayer and our gronings are not in vaine nor fruſtrate. For neither in deede vainly, nor without cauſe, hath God ſo oftentimes made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knowne with ſo euident teſtimonies. Let vs not eſteeme theſe things to be as vaine viſions and imaginations, or delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and paſtimes: God hath doone great and mighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters heereby: he would ſhewe plainly, that he is carefullie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for our ſaluation, and he would heereby deliuer vnto vs, the teſtimonies of his word and doctrine, wherein hee impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto vs, the heauenly gyfts and ſocietie of his bleſſednes. Finally, he hath for that cauſe manifeſted himſelfe, ſo as hee would witneſſe, that he will both be acknowledged and called vpon, and that he will alſo heare and ſaue vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1118:8"/>Like as therefore the Sonne of God, in his moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtormes or tempeſts, hath firſt a reſpect vnto the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of God, (as men ſay the <hi>Phenician</hi> Marriners, eſpying theyr <hi>Cynoſura,</hi> that ſtarre in the night, guiding them in the Skyes, they are of good confidence as it were to ariue in a ſafe Port.) So let euery one of vs, firſt and formoſt caſt our minde and eyes vnto the notable teſtimonies of Gods manifeſtation, and beeing with theſe confirmed, let vs craue of God, help and deliuerance, or at leaſt mittigation of our preſent calamities. And where he addeth, <hi>[ô thou worſhip of Iſraell,]</hi> the ſtudious ſort may knowe, that the nowne Relatiue is put for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.

But hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth aunſwere by way of examples, ſhewing the difference
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1118:9"/>
which was betwéene him and the reſt of the Fathers. As if he ſayde they were men, but, <hi>I am no man, but a worme.</hi> Thys humilitie wherin Chriſt vouchſafed for our ſakes to debaſe and abiect himſelfe, exceedeth all wiſedome and eloquence of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and of men. For although Chriſt was in forme of God, (that is, in nature and power equal with God,) yet he vſurped not this equalitie of God, namely, againſt his calling: but, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> moſt wiſely ſaith: <hi>He humbled himſelfe in the ſhape of a ſeruaunt. <hi>Phil. 2.7.</hi>

               <p>And although the greatnes of theſe things cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of vs, yet let vs render thankes vnto the Sonne of GOD, that he is carefully mooued for our ſaluation, and that he manifeſted thys hys vnſpeakeable humility &amp; loue towards vs, in thus ſuffering for our ſake. The other parts of thys ſixt and ſeauenth verſe, may enough be vnderſtoode out of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory left vnto vs in the wrytings of the Apoſtles. Wherefore I come to the next verſe, wherein there is a poyſonfull &amp; dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly byting taunte of the vngodly High Prieſtes, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, inſulting againſt Chriſt.</p>

               <p>The eyght little verſe, is a byting taunte of the reprochfull crew of the Iewiſh Nation: as if they ſaid: goe to thou goodly Champion, ſeeke nowe to ſaue both thy ſelfe and vs? And as the vngodly Iewiſh people did ſpitefully reuile the Sonne of GOD, ſo Epicures doo in all ages, ſcorne and mocke at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religions or ordinaunces: and when the ſame are about to hinder theyr profit, they then endeuour all they can to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the Goſpell, and practiſe all impietie and crueltie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his members. But there is an enemy much more hating Chriſt, namely the deuill: hee firſt by his hatred towards GOD, pluckt away our firſt Parents from him.</p>

               <p>The ninth and tenth verſes, containe a third place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, which is taken from the prouidence of GOD: and it appeareth by this one little verſe, that <hi>Dauid</hi> heere with phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical eyes beheld or looked vpon mans nature, and to haue gathered dilligently therby al teſtimonies of Gods prouidence touching the ſame. For although in the world a moſt beautiful order of the heauenly motions, the moſt acceptable ſeaſons of dayes and nights, the reuolution of the yéere, the meruailous compaſſe or courſe of the Sunne, and other Planets, the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the earth, and finally the whole nature of things, be ſette before vs to acknowledge the will and preſence of God: yet notwithſtanding, there is not a more excellent teſtimonie, (that there is a God, and that by his prouidence, the worlde is gouerned, and that hee prouideth for all things appertaining to man, and not onely to all, but alſo for euery one,) then is the whole creation or faſhioning of man, and euery figure &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of mankind.</p>
               <p>For, that I may let paſſe to ſpeake of forming or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioning an Infant in the wombe, what can be ſo meruailous, as the bringing foorth of the Infant into this worlde? For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God himſelfe play the Midwiues part, and fulfil that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it cannot vndoubtedly be brought to paſſe, that any one Infant, ſhould come forth ſafe and ſound into the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1118:10"/>The <hi>Anatomiſts,</hi> that is, they of that ſcience which cutte mens bodies, and lay the parts diſtributed before theyr eyes, doo know the place <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> (which name is deriued, as of the moſt holy and diuine work of generation) is moſt ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſed or ſhut, and that not any thing, be it neuer ſo little, can pearce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioynt of that bone: and yet out of theſe ſtraights God meruailouſly bringeth foorth the timely Infant, as it were in a certaine due ſeaſon, and by the outſtretched ioynts of the thyghes.

               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, this alſo is moſt pleaſant to be conſidered, that God (vnto the young childe as yet in the wombe) prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and ordaineth foode or nutriment, fitte and conuenient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the Mothers breaſts. For after the child is once concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the Menſtruall blood is diſtributed into three parts. The firſt part, which in puritie excelleth the others, is diſperced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Matrice, to nouriſh the young one quickning by a little and a little. The ſecond part, ſomewhat leſſe pure, aſcendeth into the place of the Mothers dugges, to be there turned into Milke, which within a while after, may nouriſh and ſuſtaine the childe borne. The thirde part, of the others eſpeciallie leaſt pure, is ſetled in a certaine thinne ſkinne of the Matrix, vntill ſuch time, as together with the childe newe borne, the manie menſtures of the Mother are ſent foorth.</p>
               <p>Séeing therfore God performeth the Midwiues dutie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs all, and not that onely, but alſo procureth proper nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe younglings, as yet vnborne, doubtleſſe we muſt confeſſe, that the liues of men are cared &amp; prouided for of him alſo. Wherefore let vs daily comfort and confirme our ſelues, with the remembrance of theſe wonderfull workes, ſo often as we are diſtreſſed for or concerning our liuing, or for defence and deliuerance out of greateſt perrils. And let vs cry out with the Prophet. <hi>Thou haſt brought mee out of my Mothers wombe, and haſt nouriſhed me with my Mothers breaſt:</hi> therefore no

               <p>The eleuenth verſe, mixeth a moſt ardent Prayer, with complaints and conſolations before expounded.

               <p>The two verſes following, amplifie the propoſition of the narration: for where he ſaid before breefely, <hi>Trouble is harde at hand,</hi> now he ſheweth foorth and explaineth this breuity. For he telleth with how great perrils or daungers hee is inſnared, and with notable Metaphors painteth out the crueltie of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1118:11"/>
Phariſies hatred: hee calleth the Biſhops and Rulers of the Iewiſh people Oxen and fatte Bulles, becauſe vnder pretence of the Miniſtery, they vſurped vpon them tyrannicall power, and obteyned ſuch authority, that both al their ſayings and doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, were allowed by the iudgement of the rude multitude, and embraced with great reioycing of them. But much more plainely vnderſtoode héere it is, that he compareth the bitternes of the High Prieſtes hatred againſt Chriſt, vnto the rage of a Lyon, by whoſe roring all other beaſts are made afraid. And the Prophet héere alludeth this vnto the firſt promiſe, wherein GOD himſelfe proclaimed battaile againſt the deuil, ſaying: <hi>I will ſette enmitie betweene thee &amp; the Woman, yea, betweene thy ſeede, and her ſeede.</hi> Neyther indeede may it otherwiſe be, but that the deuill burneth with beaſtly cruell hatred againſt Chriſt and hys Church, ſithence hee knoweth, that by this one Captaine, hys power is broken and enféebled.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Hée amplyfieth the narration to the diſcription by parts or diuiſion: firſt of all he ſaith: <hi>He is poured out like water.</hi> This part containeth a moſt ſwéete conſolation, for it is witneſſed by Chriſt, that hee hath paide a ſufficient raunſome for ſinne: for although the bloody ſweat, wherewith the Sonne of God was all ouer waſhed, when he was in the Garden, might haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified his Fathers wrath: yet notwithſtanding, leaſt any man ſhold be ouercome with deſperation, by reaſon of the greatnes of his ſins, hée gaue his ſoule euen vnto the death, and ſhed his bloode (then the which nothing is more precious,) like water moſt plentifully to redéeme vs, or as it were, bring vs out of bondage into libertie.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore hold ſtill our opinion againſt the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatians,</hi> the commaundement of GOD is immutable or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, that although our ſinnes be great, yet when wee truely repent, let vs returne vnto GOD, with full truſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for Chriſt his ſake: and let vs not deſpayre for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1118:11"/>
greatnes of our fault, but that the power of Gods Sonne, is to be accounted of, and to be preferred farre beyond all the ſinnes of euery man. And let vs not adde blaſphemy vnto our other faults, which accuſeth God of vntruth, and denieth that mens ſins can be forgiuen them. Like as <hi>Saule</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned, becauſe they beleeue not, that for the Sonne of Gods ſake, their ſinnes are forgiuen them.</p>

               <p>Hée ſayd before, that all his whole body was ſo dryed vp, as there was no moiſture therein left. Now he complaineth of the féebleneſſe of his bones, wherin a cheefe ſtrength was wont to be. They were diſperſed and ſo ſhaken, that they coulde not performe theyr dutie. Thirdly, hee deſcribeth the melting or conſumption of the hart, <hi>My hart</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is melted within me, as waxe melteth at the fire.</hi> O inſpeakeable humility, Chriſt heere ſuſtaineth the wrath of God, and is made faultie, as if he had defiled himſelfe wyth mine, thine, and all mens ſinnes. Thys féeling of Gods wrath againſt ſinne, is the obiect and cauſe of horrible feares which Chriſt ſuffered, that we ſhoulde not ſuffer them.</p>

Therefore elegantly compareth hee heere his weakenes vnto a Potſhearde, which is dryed at the fire, and hath no moiſture or liquour left therein. Let vs therefore loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon Chriſt, thinke vpon both theſe, viz.

power of GOD béeing rayſed vp from death to life, and now making his tryumph ouer the multitude of his enemies, gaue thankes, not vnto <hi>Iupiter</hi> as <hi>Aemilius</hi> did, but vnto his <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father,</hi> who had crowned him with the glorious victorie which is beneficiall vnto the Church. That benefite he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to retaine in perpetuall memory, and to celebrate the ſame with a thankfull hart vnto all eternitie. But therwith alſo he deſcribeth the chiefe effect of his reſurrection: he affirmeth that he is againe raiſed from death to life, not to the end he ſhould be idle, or thenceforth not to be buſied in any good worke, or that he ſhould boaſt himſelfe onely of his wiſedom and power, and ſo hold for moſt aſſured, that he ſhould alwaies remaine in moſt great and eternall pleaſures: but he ſayth expreſly, that he is riſen for this cauſe, to the ende hee may gather vnto God hys Church by the miniſtery of the Goſpell, which may praiſe and worſhip him in the life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>This then is the ſpeciall effect of his Reſurrection, namely the gathering of his Church, which comes to paſſe by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Goſpell, which the Apoſtles diſperſed or publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed throughout the whole worlde. So in an other place it is ſayd: <hi>Thus it behooued Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe againe the third day, and that in his Name, repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould be preached among all Nations, beginning at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. <hi>Luke. 24. verſe. 46.47.</hi>
                  </hi> Truly héere is ſette before vs a manifold conſolation. The Sonne of GOD affirmeth, that hee will preach the Goſpell, yea though the worlde repine and repugne the ſame, and that he will publiſh another doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Law.</p>
               <p>Hée wyll therefore preſerue the Miniſtery, and theſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and learning, and hée alloweth the endeuours of them which preach the Goſpell. Let vs comfort our ſelues with thys conſolation, ſo often as wee doo conſider the daungers of the Church, though fatall puniſhments oppreſſe the worlde for theyr Idolatries, Epicuriall furies, luſtes, &amp; other miſchiefes which are innumerable: yet ſure and certaine it is, that the Church of God ſhall remaine, which amidſt the thickeſt of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1118:14"/>
enemies ſhall preach the worde of the Goſpell of Chriſt. And neyther will Chriſt ſuffer, that at any time the knowledge of him ſhall be vtterly forgotten of men, but hee himſelfe wil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Office of teaching, like as in this place hee ſayth. <hi>I wyll declare thy Name vnto my Bretheren, in the midſt of the Congregation will I praiſe thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But euen in theſe ſelfe words, there is deliuered vs a moſt ſwéete doctrine, touching the efficacie of the Goſpell preached by miſerable and weake perſons. The world iudgeth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to be a deceiuable doctrine, and derideth her Miniſters as it were vnprofitable bablers, which goe about to take quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the chiefe ſtrengthes of humane ſocietie from amongſt men: but theſe prophane iudgements Chriſt dooth heere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute: yea, (ſaith he) <hi>I my ſelfe will preache, and will bring to paſſe, that the Miniſters ſhall not be diſcouraged with vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table contention, but that the Miniſterie of the Goſpell ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede be the power of ſaluation to all that beleeue.</hi> Although therefore the Miniſters are in trueth but <hi>Earthen veſſels,</hi> yet ſure it is, that theyr preaching is effectuall, and ſhall profit manie men.</p>
               <p>Hetherto alſo approcheth the thyrd conſolation, which the moſt ſwéet phraſe <hi>[Brother]</hi> ſetteth before vs. <hi>I wil declare thy name vnto my bretheren.</hi> I pray you what may be more ſwéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought or ſpoken, then that Chriſt calleth all men his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which heare learne and embrace the Goſpell. And that Chriſt indéede doth loue vs with a brotherly loue, that doth hys taking of humane nature vpon him declare. For that he might ioyne vs in a moſt néere bonde with hym, hee became fleſhe of our fleſh, and bone of our bones, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth. <hi>Heb. 2. ver. 24</hi> Thys taking and knytting of our nature, is a teſtimonie of a great loue towards vs. But the Paſſion of Chriſt declareth thys effect much more euidently, wherein hee ſuffered puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to the righteouſnes of GOD, and fully paid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for vs. For it was his good pleaſure, to redéeme and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vs, which were oppreſſed with moſt gréeuous miſchiefes, as, ſinne &amp; death, into our auncient dignitie and former liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1118:14"/>Héereby it appeareth, that there is no ſuch loue of any bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards hys naturall Brother, as is the feruent loue of Chriſt towards vs, whereunto he giueth the name of brother. So often therefore as thou beginneſt to pray, and that thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe hindereth thee, be thou turned in minde &amp; thought vnto thys little verſe of Chriſt, wherin he expreſly calleth Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuers his Bretheren. For ſithence he is our Brother, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs moſt feruently, let vs not doubt, but that we are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and heard, (though vncleane and manifoldly guilty we be) yet for the interceſſion and prayer which our Brother maketh for vs: and neyther is there any thing ſo ſurely layd vp in the vnmeaſurable treaſure of Gods goodnes and mercy, which hee will not willingly bring foorth, and fréely partake with thys, when he is requeſted of this High Prieſt and Mediator, whom the name of a Brother maketh not abaſhed nor aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in all our lyfe long, in all our dangers, and in our daily prayers, let vs thinke vppon this moſt ſwéet name Brother, and inculcate the ſame to our mindes, that wee may ſurely beleeue, our Brother ſitting at the right hand of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will helpe vs, and beſtow vpon vs preſent and eternal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. Let it ſuffiſe to haue héere bréefely thus much noted of theſe words: becauſe the greatneſſe of the matters cannot be conceiued in words.</p>

                  </hi> And <hi>Ezechiell</hi> in his <hi>34. chap. verſe. 23.</hi> ſayth: <hi>And I will ſette vp a ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard ouer them, and hee ſhall feede them, euen my ſeruaunt Dauid he ſhall feede them, and he ſhall be theyr Sheepheard.</hi>

                  <hi>And ye my ſheepe, the ſheepe of my paſture are men. &amp;c.</hi> But if any man deſire to know, what manner a one <hi>Iehouah</hi> is, the Shéepheard of the Church, there is nothing that wée may ſo eaſily make tryall of: for the Sonne of GOD nowe and then in the tenth chapter of <hi>Iohn,</hi> rehearſeth this affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>I am the true Sheepheard, <hi>verſe. 11.16, 27, 28, 29.</hi>
                  </hi> And S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in hys firſt Epiſtle and ſecond Chapter, ſayth expreſlie: <hi>You haue ſometime ſtrayed like ſheepe, but are now returned vnto the ſheepheard and Biſhop of your ſoules. <hi>verſe. 25.</hi>
                  </hi> The ſame meaning may be confirmed by a right compariſon of the members in the preachings of the Prophets. For <hi>Eſay</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, in hys forty Chap. prophecieth of S. <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> the forerunner of Chriſt, and of Chriſt himſelfe: Of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> he ſayth: <hi>The voyce of a Cryer in the wildernes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ye the way of the Lord. <hi>verſe. 3.</hi>
                  </hi> Of Chriſt hee ſaith: <hi>Hee ſhall feede his flocke like a Sheepeheard. &amp;c. <hi>ver. 11.</hi> Ezechiell</hi> in hys thirtie foure Chap. vndoubtedly calleth Chriſt <hi>Dauid,</hi> by an vſuall phraſe in the propheticall ſpeech. <hi>verſe. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But hauing now determined the grounde of our purpoſe, that thys Shéepeheard and Lord of Hoſtes, is the Son of God our Mediator, let vs ſee if it pleaſe you, what maner of Shéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard he is, what he dooth, what works he exerciſeth, and with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1118:20"/>
what buſines hee is encombred: for hee ſitteth not idle in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, reioyſing onely in his owne power &amp; wiſedome: <hi>But hee giueth gyfts vnto men, namely, Paſtors and Doctors, that the body of the Church may be builded. <hi>Ephe. 4.11.</hi>
                  </hi> For firſt, hée féedeth vs with the preaching of hys Goſpell, and ſwéetlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth afflicted conſciences with the vſe of the Sacraments, which are the ſureſt pledges and ſeales of the righteouſneſſe of Fayth: and leaſt thys Miniſtery whereby the eternal Church is gathered vnto GOD, ſhould vtterly perriſh, he oftentimes ſtyrreth vp fitte Teachers, and inſtructeth them with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie gyfts to the expounding and ſetting foorth of the doctrine.</p>
               <p>So in thys laſt age of the world, hee hath gyuen vs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Teacher, viz. <hi>D. Martin Luther,</hi> a reſtorer of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpell more purer, and great companies of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. Thys benefit, or thys firſt kinde of féeding, it behooueth all mens mindes and tongues to haue in reuerence, and wyth prayſes to extoll euen vp to the heauens: but our harts are too cold in giuing of thanks, and in reuerencing ſo great a benefit. We muſt pray vnto GOD therefore, that he woulde illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate our mindes with thankfulnes, which both acknowledgeth and honoureth the Author of ſo great a benefit, and obeieth him him in the duties of loue and other vertues.</p>
               <p>Next of all he gouerneth vs with hys holy Spyrit, that we may doo ſome thinges acceptable vnto God: that is, that wee truely acknowledge and call vnto GOD, truly beléeue, giue thankes, and obey him in our calling, and calamities. For without thys Gouernour of our minde, will, and hart, (whom he hath promiſed to giue thoſe that aſke,) men ſtyrred or ſet on by the deuill, eaſily fall into Epicuriall furies, or into other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticall errours, alſo into tragicall miſchiefes and inextricable calamities, like as the examples of notable wits doo ſhew, who wanting this guide, are ſtayned with horrible infamies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he reſtraineth the raging deuill, that hee cannot accompliſh all the bitterneſſe of his hatred: and with his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand and miniſtry of good Angels defendeth and kéepeth his ſilly ſhéepe againſt this roring Lyon, which ſeeketh to catch,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1118:21"/>
ouercome, and carry away the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he bringth into the right way, and healeth thoſe that goe aſtray and offende, without contumacie or ſtubborne diſobedience: neyther caſteth he vs away, which are the ſhéepe of his paſture by reaſon of our infirmities, but hanging about hys necke, he louingly beareth vs, and with hys blood waſheth vs when we are filthy and deformed. Thys admirable, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible louing kindnes of our Shéepheard, let it ſtirre vs vp: <hi>So, as, we denying all vngodlines and worldly luſts, may liue godly, iuſtly, and ſoberly in thys preſent worlde, looking for the bleſſed hope and appearing of the glory of the great GOD,</hi> as S. <hi>Paule</hi> moſt ſweetly wryteth in his ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Titus, verſe, 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, vnto all theſe, hee addeth as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, viz. a <hi>ſurplus</hi> or ſuperaboundance, for the helping ſuſtentations of this our life: namely, fruitfulneſſe of the earth, &amp; of the liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, proſperous health, liuing, clothing, meane dwelling places, peace, good Princes, quiet and ſweet wedlock, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie gyfts in our calling, good ſucceſſe in our counſels &amp; ſtudies, proſperitie of our children, and finally, other good gifts which are innumerable.</p>
               <p>But wilt thou vnderſtande howe neceſſary the benefits of thys Paſtor are, then haue in thy mind the ſilly Sheepe, and vnto her compare the great infirmitie of our own nature. The ſilly Sheepe hath in herſelfe, neyther any wit nor counſell, but the fleſh wandereth at randome till ſhe light into the Wolues iawes: and what is the wandering ſheepe, when ſhee cannot without the Shéepeheards helpe be brought againe to the fold? Furthermore, ſhe neither hath any courage nor defence, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe may or is able to reſiſt or withſtand, the violence and aſſault of the Wolues. Finally, that I may manifeſt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in one word: The ſhéepe is a beaſt, fooliſh, fearful, weake, and layd open for all iniuries of the Wolues, if ſhe be deſtitute of the Shéepheards watching and warding.</p>
               <p>Neyther indéede is one Egge ſo like another, or Milke like vnto Milke, as the ſtate of humane nature is reſembling thys
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1118:21"/>
figure. For in the darke places, and in the darkeſome night, our mindes doo wander aſtray, neither haue they any proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which reſpecteth life euerlaſting: we all like ſhéepe haue wandered out of the way which leadeth vnto eternall bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yea, except we be layd vpon Chriſtes ſhoulders, and be carried hanging about his necke, we ſhall (plunged headlong in darkneſſe and errours) perriſh euerlaſtingly. And what in vs is there, wherewith wee are able to reſiſt the deuill when he aſſaulteth vs? There is no ſuch wiſedome or power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out GOD, but the deuill is able to ouerthrow and quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it: which things ſith ſo indéede they be, let vs in our daily prayers, remember that we are the ſheepe of this Shéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and let vs flée for ſuccour vnto him, and craue help, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and gouernment of him.</p>
               <p>But in thys place, ſome man woulde aſke the queſtion, why the Shéepeheard of the Church ought to be <hi>Iehoua,</hi> that is, the true GOD, Creator of heauen and earth? There are many cauſes for which it is néedfull, that the guide and Sheepeheard of the Church, ſhould not onely be man, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by nature GOD.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, Nature onely which hath ende, cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the workes of the deuill, namely, ſinne and death, and reſtore vnto the Church righteouſneſſe and life euerlaſting. The ſecond is, no creature can alwaies and euery where bee preſent with the Church and euery member thereof. The thyrd is, no creature can ſée the ſights of the hart, and diſcerne true inuocation from hypocriſie. And the fourth cauſe is, no creature entreth into counſell with the diuine nature.

                  </hi> It is a moſt ſure rule, hee that hath the word of God, he hath God himſelfe: hee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath God, to him can nothing of the principall bleſſednes be lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe God was before the worlde was made, and by his word he made all things, therefore the word of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and bringeth all things vnto vs: but contrariwiſe, hee that hath not the word, hee hath nothing, but fainteth amidſt the floodes, like vnto <hi>Tantalus,</hi> and as he ſéemeth moſt to haue any thing, ſo yet within a while after, euen that is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, according to that ſaying of Chriſt: <hi>To hym that hath, ſhall be giuen: and from him that hath not,</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the word) <hi>euen this that he ſeemeth to haue, ſhall be taken away from him. <hi>Luke, 19, verſe. 26.</hi>

               <p>In the firſt verſe hee deſcribed the Shéepehearde of the Church, and called him <hi>Iehoua,</hi> and added therewith, that through thys Gouernour, nothing ſhoulde be wanting vnto vs: now with a pleaſant phraſe, he ſetteth foorth the féedings or manner of lyuing which the flock hath. For like as Shéepe doo féede vpon thrée-leaued graſſe, and of greene graſſe, and drinke of the Riuer which (runneth through the ſtones) more purer then <hi>Amber</hi> paſſeth into the fielde: ſo the Church is fed with the Goſpell, <hi>Which is the power of God vnto ſaluation to all beleeuers. <hi>Rom. 1, 16.</hi>
                  </hi> and drinketh out of the pure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Prophets and Apoſtles, conſolation, which is the beginning of life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>But let thys contrarietie or <hi>Antitheſis</hi> of doctrine be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which greatly beautifieth thys verſe. Philoſophie and the Law doo not deliuer a man from ſinne and from death, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1118:23"/>
doo leaue the halfe dead man ſuccourleſſe, as the Leuite and the Prieſt did in the tenth Chapter of S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell. <hi>verſe 31, 32.</hi> For Philoſophy is onely a meditation of death, that is, a funerall complaint, deploring mans miſeries and death.</p>
               <p>The Lawe, not onely bringeth no helpe to humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſpoyled &amp; gréeuouſly wounded, but alſo more and more encreaſeth the dolor or greefe of the wounds, moyſting them with the Vineger of malediction or curſing. But the Goſpell bringeth peace and life, to thoſe that beléeue in the Sonne of GOD, and ſetleth theyr mindes (with full confidence of this Mediator) in God. How much therefore places ſandie &amp; ſette with thornes, doo differ from pleaſant and ſoft Paſtures: and how much filthy muddie Pooles, doo differ from the cléere and moſt wholeſome Springs, ſo much difference there is betwixt Philoſophie, the Law, and the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>For, as no man is able to take meate out of the fire, or water out of the Flint ſtone, ſo is it not onely hard &amp; difficult, but indéede alſo not poſſible, to finde remedie of vnfained ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, eyther from Philoſophy, or from the Law. But they which by the preaching of the Goſpell, doo ſee the ſaluation of God, <hi>(which is prepared before the face of all people,)</hi> theſe with <hi>Simeon</hi> doo ſing that ioyfull tryumphant ſong, <hi>Lord now let thy ſeruaunt depart in peace according to thy worde. &amp;c. <hi>Luke, 2, 29.</hi>
                  </hi> that is, nowe I féele my ſelfe to reſt in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, now doo I take the taſte of eternall life, and doo eaſilie deſpiſe the miſeries of thys life, after that I haue acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my Mediator the Sonne of GOD, and ſo acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, haue taken ſure hold of him, by fayth: and haue receiued by him, both remiſſion of my ſinnes, and reconciliation alſo with God, according to the ſaying of S. <hi>Paule: If GOD be wyth vs, who ſhall be againſt vs? <hi>Rom, 8, verſe 31.</hi> Who ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death, howe ſhould he not with him, giue vs all things alſo. <hi>verſe, 32.</hi> Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? it is GOD that iuſtifieth. <hi>verſe 33.</hi> Who ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt which is dead, yea or rather which is riſen againe, who is alſo

               <p>Thys diſcription appertaineth vnto the Church properlie called, that is, vnto the Congregation which is borne a new of the holy Ghoſt.

And ſeeing the Church hath neede of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, thys Pſalme exhorteth all Princes and Gouernours of Common-weales that they would vouchſafe theyr honeſt and peaceable ſuccours, vnto ſuch as teach and learne the Goſpel, and not to exerciſe crueltie againſt thys poore &amp; needy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which retaineth the heauenly doctrine.

For although the Church is not tyed vnto tytles of Biſhops, and ordinary ſucceſſion, as they call it: yet, is it not with out a Head and Gouernour. For the Heade of the Church, is the Sonne of GOD, vnto whom (from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father,) all power is giuen both in Heauen and Earth. Thys Gouernour, wiſe and mightie, gathereth vnto himſelfe a Church, euen out of all mankinde, by the preaching of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1118:27"/>
Goſpell, and defendeth the ſame from the tyrannie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, that it may be his euerlaſting inheritance: and out of this place is taken manifold doctrine and conſolation. For firſt, it witneſſeth, that Chriſt is truly and by nature God, and for becauſe the Name of the true God, is giuen vnto Chriſt, and that the worke of creation, is properly aſcribed vnto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the omnipotencie onely, it is néedfull that there bee in Chriſt, a nature both diuine and omnipotent. Let therefore thys teſtimony be adioyned vnto other ſayings, which make moſt plaine and notable manifeſtation of the diuine nature of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he admoniſheth great and ſmall, to remember that they are not <hi>Lords of the earth,</hi> but onely Court keepers or Bailiffes, and that they muſt render vp accounts of theyr Stewardſhip adminiſtred: of thys ſentence, if Gouernours or Rulers woulde be earneſtly mindfull, vndoubtedlie they would doo their duties in the feare of the Lord &amp; in humilitie: neyther woulde they with ſuch libertie, exerciſe tiranny &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine. At thys day, becauſe many doo falſly imagine, that they are Lords properly called of theyr owne riches, they beare ſway with puffed pryde, and carrie hautie mindes, &amp; doo fléeſe theyr Subiects with immoderate exacting them: but after a while, they ſhall render accounts to the Lord of the Feoe, and like vaſſals vndutifull, ſhall ſuffer great and iuſt puniſhment, with the loſſe of their Feoe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he teacheth of Chriſtian libertie, in the which ſence verily it is cited by S. <hi>Paule,</hi> in the <hi>1.

               <p>Fourthly, hee giueth conſolation vnto the godly ones, which for the profeſſion of the true doctrine, doo liue in exile.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1118:28"/>
For, ſeeing <hi>[the earth is the Lords.]</hi> let vs not doubt but hee taketh care of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the godly ones may haue meane har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and ſuccours: according to that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many dwellings, &amp;c. <hi>Iohn, 14, verſe, 2.</hi>
                  </hi> And we ſee at this preſent day, many notable examples of Chriſtes prouidence, preparing for his Church, and the godly exiles, ſafe dwelling places, and giuing <hi>Halcyon dayes,</hi> euen in the midſt of the raging ſeaes and ſtormes of Germanie.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore craue and expect of Chriſt the Lorde of all the worlde, ſuccours and harbours, and other benefits ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for this life, and let vs not (diſcouraged with feare of baniſhments) caſt away our profeſſion of the Goſpell: for as much as hys promiſe is true, and nothing fallible, namelie, <hi>Firſt ſeeke ye the kingdome of God, and all other things ſhall bee gyuen vnto you. <hi>Math, 6, 33.</hi>

               <p>Hée proponeth a queſtion concerning a matter, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all others, namely, which, what a one, and where the true Church of GOD is? and thereunto maketh aunſwer. The Church (ſaith hee) is a Congregation embracing the word deliuered from GOD, and acknowledging calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon and worſhipping God, according to the rule of his word, and abhorring from all opinions and worſhippings which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not with that rule.</p>
               <p>Thys deſcription is made more notable, by conſidering an <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> or contrariety betweene the true Church, and the pontificall crew, which for riches and promotions, falſely challenge vnto themſelues the moſt holy name of the Church. For in thys pontificall crewe, firſt dooth vanitie floriſh and rule the roſt, that is, confuſion of opinions and worſhippings. for who knoweth not how filthy things are Idoles, prayer for the dead, and the prophaning of the Lords Supper in funeral Maſſes, and Maſſes for money? It is manifeſt alſo, that their Bookes touching canonicall ſatiſ-factions, are full of errors, darkning the light of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1118:29"/>Finally, ſure it is, that theyr Bookes ſpeake not rightly, touching remiſſion of ſinnes, and to be the ſuppreſſion of faith embracing remiſſion of ſinnes: yea, and that by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie opinion is defended. viz. That men ought alwaies to doubt of the remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the harts of hypocrits are vncleane, that is, without true feare of GOD, and without fayth, becauſe they are proude with the perſwaſion of theyr wiſedome and righteouſneſſe, in loue with themſelues, and debaſe &amp; deſpiſe others farre vnder themſelues, as did the Phariſie in the <hi>18.</hi> of S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell. Theſe ſinnes with a malignant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, repugne the feare of God, and the confidence in the mercie of GOD. Thirdly, theyr tongue is full of periuries, that is, blaſphemies againſt the true doctrine, which they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly condemne of heriſie and ſedition. Laſt of all, their hands are imbrued with the blood of the godly ones, which they ſley for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, and for the reprehending of theyr Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Nowe on the contrary part, let the Image of the true Church be conſidered. Firſt of all, the true Church embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Goſpell giuen by Chriſt, and declineth not vnto va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that is, dooth not corrupt the doctrine, mingling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto lewde opinions and worſhyppings, but ſhunneth and with all her hart trembleth to haue corruption of doctrine, and voluntary ſeruing of God. Moreouer, ſhe hath a cleane hart, that is, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> interpreteth it: <hi>A hart purified by Fayth. <hi>1. Peter, 1.22.</hi>
                  </hi> And as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth, <hi>commeth with boldneſſe vnto the throne of Grace. <hi>Heb. 4.16.</hi>
                  </hi> Finally, ſhe hath not a blaſphemous tongue, nor hands defiled with the bloode of the holy ones, but rather ſuffereth the vnrighteous iudgements of the world, and is layd open to al chaunces of ſuddaine dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But heere is a neceſſary admonition to be repeated, that thys deſcription of the Church ſo properly called, is not ſette downe as touching hypocrites, intermingled with the true Church in outward ſocietie: for although they of the true Church, profeſſe true doctrine, and are not polluted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1118:29"/>
Idoles, yet in hart they are careleſſe, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Such, a great multitude are there alwaies in the Church, like as the Parable of the ſeede ſignifieth. <hi>Math. 13.</hi>

               <p>But let the word of righteouſneſſe be vnderſtoode, not of diſcipline, which is an vncleane hypocriſie, but of the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of righteouſneſſe in thys life, and of the righteouſneſſe finiſhed or conſumate after this life, which ſhall be ſuch as the Lawe requireth, namely, the excellent acknowledgement of GOD, and the loue vndefiled.</p>
               <p>Bleſſing is oppoſed againſt curſing, and ſignifieth deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Gods wrath, deſtruction of ſinne and of death, and the gyft of the holy Ghoſt beginning in vs newe light, &amp; ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying vs vnto life euerlaſting.

               <p>For like as the Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaack, Iacob, Moſes, Dauid, Daniell</hi> and others, in theyr manner of praying, dyd know that they ſpake vnto this true God, who had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knowne in his promiſes, and by bringing the people out of Egypt: and did pray &amp; beleeue that they were receiued and heard, euen for the promiſed ſeede ſake: ſo doo we alſo call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſame true God, who is the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, crucified for vs, and raiſed from death to life: and for thys Mediators ſake, we beléeue that we are heard.

               <p>Neyther is he onely gracious, but alſo iuſt, that is equall according to one rule which he hath ſette downe: for as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth and accuſeth all men, without exception, by the voyce of the Lawe, ſo he receiueth all men without partiality, according to the frée and vniuerſall promiſe of his Goſpell: <hi>Come vnto me</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>all yee which labour and are loden, and I will refreſh you. <hi>Math. 11.28.</hi>
                  </hi> And although by the miniſtry of the Lawe and the Goſpell, hee teacheth ſinners which are curable, and alſo by puniſhments, which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhers and publiſhers of ſinne, yet in all theſe he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſuffereth vs not to be tempted aboue our ſtrength, but giueth an ende with temptation, that wee may be able to beare the ſame.</p>
               <p>So hee, not onely with <hi>Nathans</hi> ſpeech rebuked <hi>Dauid,</hi> but for a certaine ſeaſon tooke his kingdome from him, and hauing chaſtened him in his iudgement, reſtored him into his kingdom.

               <p>Concerning this profeſſion (ſuch as all the godly ones haue, and ſuch as is both neceſſary and poſſible to be) doth the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior</hi> ſpeake: and the whole ſentence containeth both moſt ſweet doctrine and conſolation.

               <p>Both theſe vertues are neceſſary, a confeſſion of the true doctrine, and a ſeperating of our ſelues from the enemies of the Goſpell. For as the loue of truth, cannot be without a bitter hatred of Sophiſtry or diſſimulation: ſo, needfull it is, that the keepers of the heauenly doctrine, doo withall theyr hart abhorre and abſtaine, from <hi>Caines</hi> murthering Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: and this ſeperation of the true Church from the falſe, is moſt lightſomly apparant.

               <p>Firſt it appeareth ſufficiently, that the true doctrine, is not onely to be proponed, but that falſe doctrines are alſo to be refuted: for although politique men doo hate nothing more, then to contende for Religions, yet needfull it is, that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Idolatries and errours, ſhould be reprehended, yea if the

                  </hi> For ſéeing men neither haue any deſire for, or flee from that they knowe not, it is needefull that the ſleights and ſnares of deceitfull perſons, ſhould be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vnto the worlde, and that the vizors ſhoulde be plucked off from their falſe perſwaſions.

               <p>Next of all, let vs wiſely and feruently beware, leaſt with diſſembling felowſhips the true doctrine be obſcured, becauſe, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>A little ſowre leuen marres the whole lump of dowe. <hi>Gala, 5. verſe 9.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue oftentimes elſe-where ſaid, that in al our praying, there are fiue things to be conſidered: Firſt, what God is whom we call vpon.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1118:49"/>
his promiſe of hearing vs. Fourthly, the thing which we are to craue. Fiftly and finally, our Fayth, beléeuing that we are accepted before God, and heard by him.</p>
               <p>Theſe fiue ſpeciall points dooth <hi>Dauid,</hi> moſt aptly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe in the beginning of this Pſalme. For the proper name <hi>Iehoua,</hi> pointeth as it were the finger vnto the true God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to the people of Iſraell, and diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Ethnick</hi> Gods. But the commandement and promiſe are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, in the mention of the Oracle, or Mercie-ſeate, whereof it is written in the <hi>25.</hi> of <hi>Exodus, <hi>That from thence GOD would ſpeake vnto the people, and there would he heare them calling vpon him.</hi>
                  </hi> For God wold be called vpon in that place, and vnto thys place he enioyned the people. Thys figure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently pertaineth vnto Chriſt: for the Church calling vpon GOD, is enioyned to come vnto the Mediator, and is not heard but for his ſake, as it is written. <hi>What ſoeuer yee ſhal aske the Father in my Name, he ſhall giue it you. <hi>Iohn. 16.23.</hi>
                  </hi> But <hi>Dauids</hi> fayth ſhineth in theſe words, <hi>[My ſtrength]</hi> for no man can without acknowledgement &amp; confidence in Chriſt in hys prayer, call vpon God.</p>
               <p>Finally, the thing to be craued, is deſcribed when he ſaith: <hi>Leaſt I become like them that goe downe into the pit.</hi> And a little after, <hi>O plucke me not away, nor deſtroy mee with the vngodlie ones.</hi> Therefore notably is it ſaid of one of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers: That <hi>Prayer</hi> is a moſt hard worke or labour, becauſe not onely the intention is required, but alſo the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the reuelations and teſtimonies of God, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to be made from the <hi>Ethnicks</hi> maner of praying, and a thinking vppon the promiſes, and a fayth in the ſame repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>But who can expreſſe the greatnes of this affect? <hi>Thinke no ſcorne of me?</hi> For as in the ciuill conuerſation of men, the mouth ſilent, or muſing countenaunce, makes ſome ſhewe of diſdainfull meaning: ſo in the ſpirituall conflict, God ſeemeth ſilent, and as it were eſtranged from vs, when hee deferreth our deliueraunce, and ſuffereth vs to be vexed in great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1118:50"/>
As when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was not only ſold of his Bretheren, but alſo caſt into priſon, with daunger of life and good name, what els might he thinke, but that God was deafe and dumbe all that while? But thys ſorrowfull or heauie cogitation, is to be vanquiſhed by fayth, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth: <hi>Yea though he kyll me, I will yet truſt in him, and hee ſhall be my Sauiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thys victorie giue vs O God, through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and ſtrengthen our infirmitie, which is ſo farre vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enter into ſuch conflicts, except it be fully by thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and armed with the fortitude of Fayth.</p>

               <p>But I pray you conſider with what colours hee painteth out the moſt miſchieuous beaſts: he calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expreſly, <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and wicked ones,</hi> becauſe hypocriſie is a ſinne diſagrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the firſt Table.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue before, now and then ſaide, that there are two kindes of trials or vexations of the Church: for ſome doe cruelly afflict the body, and ſpoyle vs of the benefits neceſſary for the body: theſe are ſickneſſes, pouertie, baniſhments, dangers of life, and loſſe of wife and children. Theſe inconueniences, although they are not ſlender, yet are they more eaſily borne, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our harts doe ſhine, the acknowledgement of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, benefits, and preſence of God, healing &amp; embracing vs for his Sonnes ſake. <hi>Laurence</hi> indeede was conſumed vppon the hote burning coles, and <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned to death, but ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them was merrie in the midſt of death, becauſe they perceiued in theyr hart, a ioyfulnes, riſen of the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſence and mercy of God.</p>
               <p>There are alſo other tryals or troubles, much more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull and bitter, which pearce into the very ſoule and ſpirit; namely, when with beholding the preſence and goodneſſe of God, for a certaine ſeaſon we feele no priuate thing, but the ſorrowes of death, and the dangers of hell: and do feare that we are for euer caſt away amongſt the deuils: theſe deiections or downe-caſtings of vs, can not be deſcribed with words, but the examples ſhewe after a ſort, this degree of tryals or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>

               <p>In Philoſophy, a man beléeueth water is warme when he hath dipped his finger, and experience hath taught that it is warme: but in embracing the word of God, there is wrought a contrarie thing: Perſwaſion, that is, Fayth, goeth before conſolation.

Seeing therefore it is a hard and difficult thing, to keepe ſuch a courſe, as our ſhyppe may eſcape both the Rockes, viz. Pryde and Deſperation, let vs daily pray with the Apoſtles, <hi>Lord increaſe our fayth. <hi>Luke 17. verſe 5.</hi>
                  </hi> For true it is, that the Church ſingeth of the Spirit of Fortitude, Loue, and Chaſtiſement:

Whereof the firſt is out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> writ lightſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: and the other is repeated out of the thirty-two Pſalme. <hi>Paule</hi> lacked not for witneſſes, the conſciences of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall companie, like as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto this man doe all the Prophets beare witneſſe, &amp;c. Acts. 10.</hi> But with a ſinguler aduiſement, he alledgeth two witneſſes, whoſe dignitie &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie is great, namely <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as the ſhyning Sunne, is the Captaine of the heauenly company, ſo is <hi>Moſes</hi> the Moderator of all the other Prophets. For the other Prophets holde that for ratified, which they ſee determined of this Graund Maiſter. But <hi>Dauid</hi> is the naturall or lawfull Diſciple of <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; (amongſt the Prophets which follow <hi>Moſes,</hi>) ſhyneth as it were <hi>Heſperus</hi> or the morning ſtar
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1118:67"/>
amongſt the glimmering Night ſtars. And although all thys mans wrytings are ful of teſtimonies (touching the free remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes,) which are beſtowed vpon the faithfull ones, for Chriſtes ſake the Mediator: yet notwithſtanding, ſeeing <hi>Paule</hi> out of thys Pſalme, taketh his proofe of a cauſe, the greateſt and largeſt of all others, there is no doubt, but the thirtie-two Pſalme, in all the multitude &amp; ſcope of the Pſalmes, glittereth like a notable precious ſtone of rare vertue. But let this ſuffiſe to haue beene breefely before admoniſhed, touching the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and dignitie, wherewith thys Pſalme excelleth many others.</p>

               <p>I ſayth he, went about with many ſleights of ſecrete dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to couer, and as it were with certaine ſayles, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreade my ſinne: but whilſt I am aſhamed to confeſſe my ſinnes, I fel into ſo great feares and downefals, riſing by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Gods wrath, that I am almoſt at deathes dore. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looking circumſpectly about all my buſines, I had nought els remaining, but one moſt ſafe receipt from feares, that I might acknowledge and confeſſe my fault, and craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with confidence, not of clemencie to be deſpayred, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly promiſed for the Mediators ſake. Therefore the reſt of the holy ones, looking well vppon myne examples, may learne likewiſe to confeſſe theyr ſinne, and flee vnto the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of GOD, and there to reſt, as in a moſt ſafe Hauen or Harbor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thys is the manner whereby we obtaine remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, Thys is the way, either eaſie or hard, to come

vnto iuſtification. By thys way it is néedefull that wee goe. And if any man will ſeeke for other way, let him call vppon Fortune, as it was wont to be ſaid.</p>
               <p>The thirde place is a conſolation, the greateſt of all, and moſt cheefely neceſſary, which affirmeth, that the Church ſhal remaine, yea euen amongſt the ſtormes &amp; tempeſts of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: ſurely at thys day all men haue neede of this conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing not onely the Turkiſh Armie, but alſo inteſtine and inward warres yet in Germanie, ſticking by the rybbes, are within our beholding.</p>
               <p>The fourth place is, a moſt ſwéete promiſe of Gods go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, which in ſo great infirmitie of our nature, amongſt ſo many ſnares of the deuill, and finally in ſo great a heape of buſines and dangers, we cannot want at all.</p>
               <p>The fift place is, a preaching of repentance, which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, that God not onely reprehendeth ſinne by preaching the Law and the Goſpell, but alſo compaſſeth vs about with tokens of our guiltineſſe, namely, horrible calamities, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and priuate, which are the puniſhments for ſinne, and the admoniſhments vnto repentance.</p>

                  <head>Of the firſt place.</head>
                  <p>FOraſmuch as Grammer is the foundation of all true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, firſt of all let vs ſée, what is the natiue ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the words which <hi>Dauid</hi> vſeth, ſpeaking in the Hebrue tongue. <hi>Naſa</hi> with <hi>He</hi> in the ende, or <hi>Naſa</hi> with <hi>Aleph,</hi> ſignifieth to take and lift away, which therefore is vſually ſayde: <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> that ſoundeth in the Hebrue tongue thus: Bleſſed is hee who is lightened of hys iniquitie. And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt ſeemeth to follow thys figure, when he ſaith: <hi>S. Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt called Chriſt the Lambe of God, which taketh awaie the ſinnes of the world. <hi>1. John. 36.</hi>
                     </hi> Namely, that a man may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſinne is an intollerable burden, and plunging vs downe euen to the very bottom of hell. Of which burden yet notwithſtanding we are ſo deliuered, that the Sonne of God taketh it vpon himſelfe, and lighteneth or eaſeth vs thereof.</p>
                  <p>I will adioyne heereunto, the words of the reuerend <hi>D. Martin Luther,</hi> in hys expoſition vpon the fourth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis. If you apply the word <hi>Naſa</hi> vnto the corporal thing, it ſignifieth to take vnto you, or to lift vp on high, as in the 6. Chapter of <hi>Eſay</hi> it is ſayd. I ſaw the Lord ſitting vpon an high throne, and lifted vp. <hi>verſe, 1.</hi>
                     </hi> But thys is in a far other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then that in thys <hi>32.</hi> Pſalme. <hi>[Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſinnes are taken away,]</hi> and yet notwithſtanding both one. The Grammarian vnderſtandeth that in <hi>Eſay,</hi> he vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not thys, becauſe hee knoweth not the matter. For it is one thing, <hi>To ſitte vppon an high throne,</hi> and another thing, <hi>To take away ſinne:</hi> that is, to forgiue, take away, or doo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: but ſpecially it is elegant and fine, that, (by the worde <hi>Lightening,</hi>) hee compareth ſinne to a great burden, vnder
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1118:69"/>
which, <hi>Caine</hi> lyeth oppreſſed, ſo that hee cannot take breath, except it be remooued from him. But the Epiſtle vnto the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues, declareth the manner whereby we are lightened, and eaſed of thys burden, where he ſayth: <hi>By fayth Abel offered a better ſacrifice. <hi>Chap. 11, verſe, 4.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chaſchab.</hi> Touching thys word, excellently well ſaith the man of God, <hi>D. Martin Luther,</hi> expounding the <hi>15.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Geneſis. I doe not greatly gaine-ſay, whether you take, that, to [repute,] or to [conſider of,] for the matter commeth all to one effect. For when the Maieſtie of God thinketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon me, that I am iuſt, that my ſinnes are forgiuen mee, that I am free from euerlaſting death, &amp; I with thankſgiuing in faith do apprehend this cogitation of God touching me, I am then iuſt, not by my works, but by fayth, whereby I hold faſt Gods thinking vpon me: for the cogitation of God, is infallible ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Therefore when I wyth a firme fayth, take hold of thys cogitation, I am not iuſt with a wandering and doubtfull opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Fayth is a firme and certaine, eyther cogitation or confidence in God, that he is mercifull for Chriſtes ſake, that for Chriſtes ſake, he thinketh for our behoofe vppon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of peace, and not of affliction or wrath. For theſe are Relatiues. The cogitation of God or his promiſe, and the fayth whereby I hold faſt the promiſe of God. Therefore S. <hi>Paule</hi> hath rightly rendered the word <hi>Chaſchab,</hi> by the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to repute or eſteeme of, which alſo alludeth vnto co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, as the worde of <hi>[reputing.]</hi> For if thou beléeueſt God promiſing, GOD reputeth thee for iuſt: but hetherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede ſerue theſe. Nowe let vs ſpeake of the ſentence Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and Affirmatiue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bleſſed are they</hi>] that is, the iuſt before GOD, and the heyres of euerlaſting life, not they which performe diſcipline without faith, which is wretched, and vncleane hypocriſie, not vnlike to figge leaues, wherewith our firſt Parents coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their nakedneſſe after theyr fall: neyther they which extol themſelues by reaſon of the prerogatiues of Circumſition, or
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1118:70"/>
of Sacrifices. But they (who caſting away and vtterly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all confidence in theyr workes and merits) doo flee vnto the mercy of God, for hys Sonnes ſake the promiſed Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and doo beléeue that theyr ſinnes are freely forgiuen them, and that whether they be faultes doone and paſt, or preſent blemiſhes, the ſame are couered, and not imputed vnto them. For although God requireth our vertues, and will not haue vs cherriſh our ſelues in the luſtes of the fleſh, but earneſtlie commaundeth vs, that we ſhould not onely bridle them, but vtterly mortifie them: yet notwithſtanding, they can nothing auaile vs in the iudgement of God, for they are polluted, and all to defiled with concupiſcence.</p>
                  <p>Except therefore God doo turne away his eyes from our ſinnes, yea alſo euen from our righteouſnes and vertues, and repute vs iuſt for hys Sonnes ſake, whom fayth taketh holde vpon: all is loſt on our ſides: the onely mercy, or the onelie reputation of God, ſaueth vs. Heere therefore is our doctrine grounded, that we are made iuſt before GOD, onely by the mercy of GOD, forgiuing and couering, and not imputing ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Out of thys Fountaine hath <hi>Paule</hi> drawne hys diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Romans and Galathians, wherein hee attributeth righteouſneſſe vnto fayth, and not vnto works, or to the Law. But in thys place, a plauſible and populer cauillation is to be refuted, which bringeth vnto the proper and natiue meaning of thys Pſalme, as it were a certaine darke night. For our aduerſaries doo ſay, <hi>Why doe not you vnto thys Pſalme cited by Paule, adioyne other Pſalmes in like manner, expreſſing of workes? As the man is bleſſed which conſidereth of the poore and needy. &amp;c. <hi>Pſal. 41.</hi>
                     </hi> If by the figure <hi>Synecdochen</hi> (ſay they) ſayings of works and fayth might be ioyned together, there would be ſeene a very fitte interpretation, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie ſhould be taken away. I aunſwer. <hi>Alwaies in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings touching works, firſt it is needefull that the doctrine of reconciliation ſhould be comprehended.</hi> Becauſe although <hi>Dauid</hi> dooth well in making battels, yet the worke is not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1118:70"/>
pleaſing to God, neyther dooth he call vpon God for helpe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he firſt craue and beléeue to haue his ſinnes forgiuen, for he hath alwaies ſinnes in thys life: but when by faith hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth forgiueneſſe of hys ſinnes, it is needfull that this faith ſticke to the promiſe of the Mediator, and not to his owne works. Thys ſentence therefore remaineth firme, that recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation ought to goe before, and that thys is by fayth doone freely: ſo thys ſaying firſt ſhineth foorth, <hi>[Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiuen,]</hi> beyonde all other ſpéeches, which afterwards doe make mention of works. And ſeeing reconciliation is made by fayth freely, the <hi>Synecdoche</hi> muſt be ſhut out and ſhunned, which confuſeth the doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and of Works, and imagineth that reconciliation is made by meanes of our works.</p>
                  <p>For, let the weightineſſe of the wordes be marked in the Pſalme: firſt he nameth <hi>Forgiueneſſe,</hi> which is <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whereby God ceaſeth to be angry with man, and wil not caſt him away into eternall puniſhments, but receiueth him into fauour, loueth him, and will gouerne and ſaue him: and both hys actuall ſins paſt are forgiuen him, and alſo the great infirmitie which as yet remaineth, yea in the very regenerate perſons in thys life. Which thing indeede is more notablie ſignified in the words following. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe ſins are couered,</hi> which may be vnderſtoode, both of actuall, and ſinnes remaining in mankinde, like as elſewhere it is ſayde, <hi>Pſalm, 130. <hi>If thou Lord wilt be extreame, to marke what is doone amiſſe, who ſhall abide it?</hi> verſe. 3.</hi> If GOD ſhoulde poure out all his wrath againſt our ſinnes, no man ſhould be able to endure the greatneſſe of hys puniſhments: Like as <hi>Saule, Iudas, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiron,</hi> were ouer-whelmed wyth ſuddaine terrors.</p>
                  <p>But of the holy ones it is often ſayd, as in <hi>Eſay</hi> the fourth Chapter: <hi>I haue couered thee with a ſhadow in the day. <hi>verſe 6.</hi>
                     </hi> That ſhadow is our Mediator, the Sonne of GOD, for whoſe ſake, both our actuall ſinnes are forgiuen, our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are mittigated, and our preſent &amp; manifold infirmitie,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1118:71"/>
(though it be a ſinne ſtriuing with the Law of God) yet is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, that is forgiuen for the Mediators ſake, making inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for vs.</p>
                  <p>Thys greatneſſe of the mercy of God, muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that we may giue thanks vnto GOD, and our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be the leſſe hindered: for our owne diſtruſt alwaies mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mureth, crying out againſt vs, <hi>Why dooſt thou pray, ſeeing thou art vniuſt, and vnworthy?</hi> But againſt thys diſtruſt, let the greatneſſe of Gods mercy be thought vpon, who wil heare vs, and receiue vs, though we be vncleane, becauſe hee coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with a ſhadow, our ſinnes, and our vncleaneneſſe, like as it is ſayd in the eyght to the Romans: <hi>There is now no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are in Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>ver. 1.</hi>
                     </hi> Thirdly it is ſayd: <hi>Bleſſed is the man vnto whom God imputeth no ſinne:</hi> as if he ſaid. Truely euery man hath ſinne in his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, like as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth <hi>1. Iohn. 1. <hi>If we ſay we haue no ſinne, wee are lyars,</hi> verſe. 8.</hi> There reſteth in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, a great doubting of God, ſome lewde ſecuritie, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, confidence in humane helps, and many wandering flames of luſtes.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe of theſe miſchiefes, God may iuſtly condemne vs, and puniſh vs with horrible plagues. But hee imputeth not our ſinnes to vs, that is, he is not angry with vs, as wyth guiltie perſons: and thys mercy he will haue to be ſo aſſured vnto vs, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayth: <hi>The Mountaines ſhall remooue, and the Hylles ſhall fall downe, but my mercy ſhall not depart from thee, neyther ſhall the couenaunt of my peace fall away, ſayth the Lord that hath compaſſion on thee. <hi>Chap. 54. ver. 10.</hi>
                     </hi> That is to ſay: although all that is in the worlde, ſhoulde vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly perriſh, yet know thou, that this my promiſe touching the Mediator, ſhall remaine firme and ſtabliſhed: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doo thou by fayth embrace the ſame, and with thys conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſupport thy ſelfe: yea though many offences, and many confuſions of humane things, with diuers temptations, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne and aſſault thy fayth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:1118:71"/>Neyther is there any guile in hys Spirite.</q>
                  <p>That is, where the acknowledgement and confeſſion of ſinne is, where acknowledgment of the mercy of GOD, and promiſed free reconciliation is, holding faſt by fayth, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinne, in ſuch a hart there is no hypocriſie, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſinne, or arrogating righteouſnes vnto it ſelfe. For the firſt place, or principall propoſition, containeth two partes, namely, that all men are vnder ſinne, alſo a promiſe, that God will forgiue ſinne. For if we be iuſt, not for our worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or merits, but by God not imputing ſinne, and by him forgiuing ſinne, it ought to be a thing moſt euident, that all men haue ſinne, and that God is able to impute ſinne vnto al men: therefore the ſumme of the firſt place of this Pſalme is, we are ſo reputed iuſt, when wee acknowledge and confeſſe our ſelues to haue ſinne, and doo beléeue that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs by Gods mercy for Chriſtes ſake.</p>
                  <p>This ſentence doo not onely the ſayings of the Scripture confirme, but alſo the confeſſions of the godly Fathers: for ſo S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> in his Dialogue againſt <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Heretique, ſayth: <hi>Then are wee iuſt, when wee confeſſe our ſelues to be ſinners, and that our righteouſneſſe commeth not of our own deſert, but of the mercie of God.</hi> And S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (whom <hi>Proſperus</hi> citeth) ſayth: <hi>Our righteouſnes, although it bee true, for the true end of good, wherunto it is referred, yet ſuch it is in thys life, that it rather is apparant in remiſſion of our ſinnes, then in the perfection of our vertues.</hi>

enough, touching the iuſtification of the Elect, and thoſe that are called: he adioyneth héereunto a new kinde of preaching, touching the Croſſe and glorification of the Church, which is a meruailous defence, conſeruation and gouernment of the poore and needy Congregation diſperſed, and truſting in the Name of the Lorde. For becauſe the deuill burneth with a deadly hatred againſt GOD and hys Church, he neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to enflame hys inſtruments, the Tyrants &amp; Heretiques, to exerciſe theyr crueltie againſt the afflicted renmants of the Church, and to deface the doctrine with ſcandales &amp; diſcordes of opinions.</p>
                  <p>Time would ſoone fayle me, if I ſhould repeate the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all ages, which declare the beaſtly crueltie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill againſt the feeble flocke, which is the keeper of true doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Therefore omitting the recitall of examples, which by reaſon of antiquitie, are farre remote from our memory, let vs conſider the dangers, calamities, and conflicts of our time. For if euer the deuill at any time whetted his teeth, euen now ſurely as it were looſed from his chaynes, hee rangeth in the world, ſtyrring battels vpon battels, and engendering diuers monſters of opinions, that with ſlaughter and lyes hee might oppreſſe and extinguiſh the Church, now wexing old. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore raging in thys laſt age of the worlde, hee rangeth Lyon-lyke, which in much ſlaughter as a Conquerour, lyeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate vpon hys pray wyth hys iawe embrued with blood, and when hunger is driuen away, yet for all that layeth not away hys wrath, but heere and there throwing downe Bulles, hee threatens the Calues, and now wexeth ſhow with a wearie tooth: becauſe he ſeeth that day draweth neere, wherein hys exceeding filthineſſe ſhall be layde open, and hys endleſſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall more and more be increaſed.</p>
                  <p>But againſt thys raging furie of the deuill and the world, thys Pſalme ſetteth downe a Trench or defence, which no power created can ouercome. For as God hath appointed the Sea within hys limits and bounds, to the ende it ſhoulde not with daily Deluge ouerwhelme vs: ſo hath hee encloſed the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1118:75"/>
deuill within hys boundes, which to kéepe and containe his furie, it is needfull. For although the Church in ſome part be perſecuted, yet the Church is the Conquerour, and the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants are by meruailous meanes preſerued and defended, not indéede with Bowe and Sword, but by the Lord God, as it is ſayd, <hi>Hoſea. 1. verſe. 7.</hi> Wherefore, in the moſt ſorrowfull ſpectacles of ciuill broyles, and which as yet ſticke by the rybs of Germanie, and in beholding the confuſion of opinions, let vs caſt our eyes vnto thys moſt ſwéete promiſe: <hi>But in the great water floods they ſhal not come nigh him.</hi> As if he ſaid: Thou art vnto me a defence or ſhade, thou kneweſt to deliuer me out of temptation, whether it be by glorious deliueraunce in thys life, or by inwarde conſolation, or by other meanes, which are pleaſing vnto thee, and are wholeſome for me. Laſt of all he ſayth, <hi>Thou ſhalt compaſſe me about with Songes of deliueraunce.</hi> For as they who when they ſeeme to bee taken pryſoners, haue eſcaped ſafely, and ioyfully haue ſunge ſome ſolemne ſong of victory: ſo ſhall I with all thy vniuerſall Church, magnifie thy goodneſſe, wherein thou haſt not giuen vs as a pray vnto the enemies iawes, and haſt deliuered our ſoule as the ſilly byrde out of the Fowlers ſhare: finally, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſnare thou haſt deliuered vs, as it is moſt ſweetlie ſaid in the <hi>124.</hi> Pſalme.

God againſt ſinne, nouriſh not euery your luſtes, continue not in offending againſt your conſcience, but caſt yee away the purpoſe of ſinning, and flee yee vnto God in confidence of hys Sonne, and in thys fayth receiue yee the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and begin ye newe obedience acceptable to God. For except ye doo repent you, God will bridle you, and chaſtiſe you ſharpely: for death, and other humane miſeries, are the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the vngodly, and the Inne, lodging, or ſchoole place of the godly ones, which ought to admoniſh men, touching the wrath of God againſt ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Horrible plagues were diſperſed throughout all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, <hi>Sodom, Egipt, Ieruſalem, Babilon,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> are deſtroyed.

Furthermore, he teacheth that the holy ones, yea though they be together afflicted, yet they are preſerued, and at length deliuered from death and all euils. For both the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vngodly ones, are burdened with death, and vexed with horrible calamities. But the vngodly doo vtterly perriſh, and fall into eternall deſtruction, becauſe they will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto God, and receiue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, they which craue remiſſion of ſinnes, know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by reaſon of ſinne, to be ſubiect vnto death and other miſeries, (and yet they are not caſt away from God for all theſe puniſhments.)</p>
                  <p>Therefore they endure calamitie, and craue forgiueneſſe, and know that they are vnfainedly heard and helped of God, and at length haue theyr deliuerance appointed them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The third circumſtance is, that God fréely and willinglie, then when it pleaſed him, did make the world, and that he did thys worke moſt fréely, &amp; not of neceſſitie did erect this frame. Touching thys circumſtance, let the ſayings be retained of the <hi>114.</hi> Pſalme. <hi>The Lord hath doone all things as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him</hi> And of the <hi>135.</hi> Pſalme. <hi>What ſoeuer the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that did he in Heauen, in Earth, in the Sea, and in all the deepe places. <hi>verſe. 6.</hi>
                  </hi> The fourth circumſtance is, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from his worke, but was and is preſent with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature, and preſerueth the circumſtances of things, that he vpholdeth the Heauen, and heauenly motions: that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Land fruitefull, brings foorth the fruite on the earth, and gyueth life vnto all creatures liuing. Thys preſence of God doo theſe teſtimonies confirme. <hi>In him we liue, mooue, &amp; haue our being. <hi>Acts. 17.28,</hi> Bearing vp all things by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie word. <hi>Heb, 1, 2.</hi> By him all things were created. &amp;c. <hi>Col. 1, 16.</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1118:81"/>
He quickeneth all things. <hi>1. Tim. 6.13.</hi>
                  </hi> The fift circumſtance is, that he is not tyed vnto ſecond cauſes: touching thys cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunce the godly mindes are to be inſtructed, to knowe, that God is not a <hi>Stoicall</hi> God, but dooing freely that he dooth, and not tyed to ſecond cauſes: yea, that he for our ſighings or ſorrowes, dooth moderate ſecond cauſes, or hinder or change them: but I néede not to bring hether any more thinges tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe circumſtances, ſeeing they are at large explicated elſewhere.</p>

                  <p>For he ſpake, and it was doone, he commaunded and it ſtoode faſt.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I ſayde in the Argument, that thys Pſalme contained, not onely <hi>Thankſgiuing,</hi> but alſo doctrine touching <hi>The feare of God,</hi> and <hi>Fayth in him.</hi> He therfore exhorteth in this verſe, all mankinde, and ſpecially the Church, to feare the Lorde, whoſe power is ſo great, that all things are by him created at his onely word euen from the beginning: and that he thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth preſerueth and gouerneth the ſame. For as the name of Father, which is attributed vnto GOD, procureth vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: ſo the deſcription of Gods power and Maieſtie, ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp feare in vs.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1118:82"/>
&amp; conſolation: for he teacheth which is the true Church, namely, the Congregation hearing and embracing the worde deliuered from God, as touching the Creation, and other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and calling vpon <hi>Iehoua</hi> the Lord of Hoſtes, that is, the true and lyuing God, manifeſted vnto the people of Iſraell.</p>
               <p>And hee therewith alſo affirmeth, that the Church of God ſhall remaine for euer, and that the preaching of the Goſpell cannot be vtterly extinguiſhed: for if the Church be the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of God, (as oftentimes it is called elſewhere) no man ſhall be able to ſhake the ſame out of Gods hands, no though he bluſter out fire and lightnings. But, becauſe theſe conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are often repeated, and are not vnknowne to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones, I proceede vnto the verſes following.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſe. 13.</bibl>
                  <p>The Lord looked downe from heauen, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the children of men: from the habitation of his dwelling he conſidereth all them that dwell vppon Earth.</p>
                  <bibl>Verſe. 14.</bibl>
                  <p>He facioneth all the harts of them, &amp; vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all theyr works.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Like as he ſpake before of the Creation, ſo now hee diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of Gods prouidence: Mans infirmitie, although it doe thinke that God is the Creator, yet it afterwards imagineth thereof as if the Shipwright departeth from his ſhyppe newe builded, and leaueth the ſame to the gouernement of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: that ſo God departeth from hys worke, and that hys Creature is onely left to the gouernement of it ſelfe. Thys imagination ſeperateth God from his Creatures, and faineth him to be idle: againſt thys filthy errour, mens mindes muſt be taught, that God, highly diſcerneth of mankind, and what manner of perſon euery one is, what he doth, what he taketh vpon himſelfe, with what minde, with what godlines he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth Religion, thys God beholdeth, and hath regard of the godly and vngodly ones.</p>
               <p>But, although he ſupporteth the Creatures in theyr na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1118:82"/>
and ſubſtances, and for a great part preſerueth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the bodies which he hath ordained: yet in hys vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercy he moderateth many parts, and eyther helpeth or hindereth ſecond cauſes, and oftentimes changeth them, as the examples of the Miracles, recited in the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall hyſtorie declareth. But moſt often hee turneth mens wils and counſels whither it pleaſeth him, without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes: as when hee mooued King <hi>Alexanders</hi> minde to fight againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and after that gouerned the warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours right hande: or when hee made the enemies afrayde in theyr running away. As the <hi>76.</hi> Pſalme ſayth: <hi>Hee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine the Spirit of Princes, and is wonderfull amongſt the Kings of the earth. <hi>verſe 12.</hi>
                  </hi> So let vs know, that God moſt fréely in mens natures and wils, with his wiſedome &amp; mercie moderateth many things, yea and that beſides ſeconde cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>But many aſke the queſtion: why are euill things doone, ſéeing God is preſent at his workmanſhyp? Touching thys queſtion, let that moſt true and moſt ſimple aunſwere be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in our ſight: <hi>That God doth worke moſt freely, and freely is preſent at ſecond cauſes, &amp; moderateth many things in them, and worketh at once ſo farre, as according to his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable wiſedome he iudgeth is to be wrought at once.</hi>

                  <p>There is no King that can be ſaued by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of an hoſte: neyther is any mightie man deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by much ſtrength.</p>

               <p>Thys is a contrarietie betwéene Gods helpe and humane defences.

But thys proude King did <hi>Lucullus,</hi> with a ſmall power ouercome and put to flight before the battell was begun, hauing ſlaine in the Hoſt, <hi>150000.</hi> enemies, as ſayth <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the hiſtory of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus.</hi> Let vs therefore learne, that the facioned figure of this world, is a ſlender ſhadow and vanquiſhing dreame, and that in God alone all our hope of ſaluation ought to be repoſed.</p>

               <p>He ſayth theſe are taken out of a thouſand dangers, which threaten preſent death, and are nouriſhed with foode, euen in penury of victuals in vacation time.

                  </hi> So in like manner preſerueth he mercifully vs, miſerable and vnworthy perſons,

               <p>Thys is a concluſion which of greateſt conſequence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the whole Pſalme: ſéeing that God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and preſerued all things, and is able, (ſuch is his wiſedom and goodnes) to withſtand and hinder all the ſiniſter practiſes which are prepared for the deſtruction of hys Church, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hée is true in kéeping his promiſes, and tempereth his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice with a wonderfull clemencie, may we any thing doubt, but that our hope ought to be fixed and take roote in God, who is our helper and our ſhielde, both in other dangers, and euen then ſpecially in that clauſe when we are deſtitute of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?

For it comprehendeth moſt graue precepts, moſt ſweete promiſes, moſt ſeuere threatnings, and delectable exhortations: and amongſt all theſe, he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed his owne example, wherein he bids vs looke, leaſt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our vnworthineſſe, or by the vaine dreame of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie, we be driuen from God, and from calling vpon him.</p>
               <p>Our vnworthines murmureth againſt vs, ſo often as wee pray, and endeuoureth to take away all hope of his hearing vs. To the ſame ende tendeth the cogitation of his election, as if the benefits of God, pertained but to certaine perſons, as the benefits of Princes Courts, appertaine vnto ſome fewe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Dauid in thys Pſalme healeth both theſe doubts, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that God heareth him, yea wretched and vnwoorthy as he was, and bidding that others alſo confirmed by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be leſſe afraide to come vnto God, and that they doe not imagine, there is any acception or reſpect of perſons with God, ſeeing God is iuſt, according to one rule which he hath ſette downe, and dooth not admit of any prerogatiue beſides thys rule. Therefore we beeing encouraged with both conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which is deliuered in the Goſpell, that the promiſe of grace dependeth not of our worthines, and is vniuerſall, let vs more willingly and feruently call vpon God: and let vs not doubt, but that he wyll mercifully, and very fatherlie heare our prayers, yea though we be vnworthy &amp; deſerue puniſhments, ſo we doe turne in time vnto him, and ceaſe to offende againſt

our conſcience. What ſhall I ſay touching the lightſomnes of the words, which like notable precious ſtones do ſhyne in this Pſalme? He bids vs not onely to looke vp to the Lord, but is an exhorter vnto all that are afflicted, that they woulde make haſte vnto God, and without tarrying runne to him, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theyr vnworthines, and theyr filthineſſe.</p>
               <p>How greatly doth the Militarie metaphore delight mee, wherin he moſt pleaſantly deſcribeth the watches &amp; guardes of Gods Angels ouer vs. <hi>The Angell of the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth rounde about them that feare him: &amp; deliuereth them. ver. 7.</hi> Furthermore, where hee ſayth, <hi>O taſte and ſee howe gracious the Lord is. &amp;c. verſe. 8.</hi> dooth ſignifie, that the mercifull lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindneſſe of God is ſo euident, as it runneth not onely in to the eyes and eares, which are called the ſences of doctrine, but alſo is embraced with the handes, and may almoſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in taſte.

               <p>A concluſion celebrating the goodneſſe of God, and the confidence in hys vnſpeakeable goodneſſe: and although no ſpéech may ſuffiſe for the greatneſſe of ſuch a matter, yet I wil follow the principall poynts of things, and will briefely ſhew how gracious the Lord is, and how much a friend vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Firſt of all it is ſufficiently apparant, that all &amp; euery other thing, was made for the vſe of mankinde, and the ſame man ſo created and expreſſed to the Image of God, that God was delighted and full pleaſed in him, as in his laſt and moſt excellent worke: for that ſignifieth the Saboth which GOD ordained after the creation of the man and the woman. But afterwards when they had fallen &amp; deſerued euerlaſting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition amongſt the deuils, God of hys vnſpeakeable mercie, reſtored hys ruined Church, by ſetting forth his promiſe of the Sauiour to come: which beeing heard, wretched man &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then knewe, that they were receiued againe into Gods fauour, and thereby conceiued aſſured hope of life euerlaſting. Thys promiſe did he after that eftſoones repeate, and make knowne in ſpeaking with the Fathers or Patriarks &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: and at length, according to hys promiſe ſo often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, God ſent his onely begotten Sonne, taking vpon him our nature, and pacifying by his death, the moſt iuſt wrath of God againſt our ſinnes: he alſo poured out of hys owne and hys Sonnes boſome, hys holie Spirit vpon his Apoſtles, and other true beleeuers, which bare witneſſe that wee are the Sonnes of God, and healeth our infirmitie, and ſanctifieth vs vnto life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>Thys vnſpeakeable goodnes of God dooth S. <hi>Paule</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate or reuerence, in the thyrde Chapter to <hi>Tytus,</hi> ſaying: <hi>But when the bountifulneſſe and loue of God our Sauiour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man appeared; Not by the workes of righteouſneſſe which we had doone, but according to his mercy he ſaued vs,

by the waſhing of the newe birth, and the renuing of the holy Ghoſt. Which he ſhed on vs aboundantly through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour. That we being iuſtified by his grace, ſhoulde be made heyres according to the hope of eternall life. <hi>verſes. 4, 5.6.7.</hi>
                  </hi> But goe to, (that wee ſpeake not alwaies of ſpirituall gyfts) what haue wee that is not beſtowed vppon vs by the bountifull hand of God, towards the ſuſtentation of this our mortall lyfe?

As therfore in other Pſalmes, ſentences are ſette downe, touching the true acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and calling vpon God, beſides conſolations: ſo in thys Pſalme are rules touching life and manners, which ſhine as it were certaine precious ſtones, and the ſum of the precepts are theſe: <hi>So runne, that thou maiſt haue an eye to thy mark, &amp; take good choyſe of the meanes leading thee to the mark.</hi> Let the Marke of our ſtudies &amp; labours be the glory of God, and the flouriſhing and peaceable ſtate of the Church: the meanes or waies leading vnto this Make, let be the ſtudies of the heauenly doctrine, conioyned with the loue of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, chaſtitie, truth, and publique concorde: for the ſafe and ſure eſtate of the Church, touching which I haue ſayde, cannot without theſe and many other vertues, eyther be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered or retained in right courſe. The foundation of thys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and moſt beautiful eſtate, is the ſwéete agréement in the true doctrine, and a bitter hatred of Sophiſticall or cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling doctrine. Therfore the Sonne of God Chriſt Ieſus, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the Church. <hi>Father ſanctifie them with thy truth, thy word is truth. <hi>John, 17, verſe, 17.</hi>
