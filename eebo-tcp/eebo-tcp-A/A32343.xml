         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Whereas we
have lately received information by an Express from some persons in <hi>England,</hi> of the unfained desires of our loving Subjects to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
Us in the Royal Throne and Dignity of our Father, and although they acknowledge themselves but few in number, and not so
well resolved as to trust Us with their Names, yet undertake on the behalf of many thousands to make good their Proposals to Us,
conditionally, that we grant and assure unto them their (as they call them, reasonable and modest) requests; whether these mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
are just and upright as they pretend, we shall not be much desirous to enquire after: Only from hence we take occasion to
Proclaim to those persons and to all the world, that we are ready to grant to all Our Subjects (some very few excepted) more then
they can have the confidence to expect from us: Yet let not any rash judgment condemn Us for our large offers, as being in so low
and forlorn a condition as never any Christian Prince for many Ages hath been; That we are forward in promises, though intend lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
performance, We say, were our calamity more heavy upon us (which can hardly be) We shall not be drawn by the greatest allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and advantages to passe our engagement for any thing we are not fully resolved to perform, which being chiefly for the general
good and peace of all our Subjects, we cannot but hope for a happy success to ensue; and therefore to Proclaim that (if peaceably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd)
we shall forthwith grant, 1. A General and free Pardon to all (seven of those only excepted, which were the bloody Judges
and Murderers of the King our Father. 2. That all the Armies shall be within six moneths disbanded, if money for their satisfaction
can in a Parliamentary way be so soon raised, and that they shall have all Arrears fully paid them, and 3 months pay over and above to
every common Souldier, for their better removal and settlement, in their former or better way and place of liuing. 3. That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
being so satisfied and disbanded, no Souldier shall be continued, but in the ancient Garrisons, accustomed on the Sea Coasts, and
that no new Army shall be raised, or any Fleet, by Us set forth to Sea upon any occasion whatsoeeer, but by consent of Parliament.
4. That not any of our Sub<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ects shall be burdened with Taxes, Excise, Free-quartering, or other illegal payments, or pressures, or any
Oaths imposed, nor any debarred of their Liberties, questioned for their lives or Estates, for any cause or pretence whatsoever, but
by the ancient and known Laws of the Land, according to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi> 5. That the Purchasers of Crown
Lands, and Rents, being satisfied their purchase-mony, and interests by the profits thereof, and further payments to their full reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursements,
The said lands and Rents may return to the Crown again. We being resolved in the mean time to cast our Self on the
love of our Subjects for our fu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure support. And if the Parliament (that shall next be call'd) shall not think fit to give us a reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and such a competent Revenue as we might expect, we have learned, and shall submit (if there be occasion) to the condition of
the meanest of our Predecessors. 6. That the Purchasers of Bishops and Deans and Chapters Lands and Rents, being in like manner
satisfied their purchase-mony, and interest by the profits and further payment, till they be reimbursed, that then the said lands and
Rents shall be conferred on the Clergy and Ministry as the next Parliament shall ordain. 7. That as soon as Writs can be issued a free
and legal Parliament shall be summoned, and the Priviledges thereof maintained, without any exemption to any person whatsoever,
being legally coosen and returned, according to the ancient Laws and Customs of <hi>England</hi> in that case provided. 8. That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be desired by us to take care for the settling of the Protastant Religion, and the publick worship of God (with liberty for
tender Consciences) and for the providing for the Ministery in the first place, without which no blessing can be expected upon Our
Government. 9. That if the Parliament shall passe an Act of General Pardon and if they shall desire those seven persons by us inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be excluded, shall be included, and giving Us satisfactory reasons for the same, we shall concur with them therein. 10. That
the affairs of the Land and, our Government shall be constantly regulated and managed by Parliaments: and that the Act for Triennial
Parli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ments shall be by Us duly observed.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge it is very <unclear>difficult</unclear>, if not impossible to please all, especially where there are so many divisions, and every man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of a several mind and opinion: But as we have proposed to our Self, so shall we endeavour to give all reasonable Satisfaction to
all our Subjects. And if the Actings of the Representatives in a Free Parliament of their own choice can satisfie them, we shall not be
wanting in summoning and concurring with them: But if that will not please them, nothing will.</p>
            <p>Now, if these condescentions of ours shall have so much freedome of passage in England, as many a scurrilous and lying Pamphlet
fly abroad without our control, we are confident that all of understanding, that are not wilfully blinded, or not over-swayed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
self-interest, thereby knowing our large Offers, must needs be fully convinced of the amplitude thereof, extending to all their
grievances.</p>
            <p>However, if it shall be instanced wherein we are too short, for we are ready for the Good, and Peace of the Nation, to give large
satisfaction, and ample assurance to our most inveterate Enemies;) We having yeelded to all matters of most importance, shall not
stick at lesser things.</p>
            <p>And if any that have been adherers and assisting to our late royal Father and us, shall think we are herein too free, and indulgent
to such, and so many open and professed Enemies; and that we have made no provision for our Servants, and Friends; we desire
them all to consider our own, and also their Conditions, and how things now stand in England; that neither we, nor themselves, can
otherwise (in any probability) better our selves, unless by a bloody and hazzardous War; which though we cannot doubt of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness
on our part and consequently a prosperous success, if we shall be necessitated thereto for the recovery of our just right, yet
we are assured that the God of peace will rather prosper a peaceable than violent and forceable entrance: And therefore we hope all
those our friends, and loving Subjects, will rest fully satisfied with that we shall do pursuant to these propositions, we being desirous
hereafter to consider their sufferings (though not comparable to ours) as God shall enable, and in all just and lawfull ways. And now
we wish that all the people of England would remember how they have performed their Protestations, Oaths, Vowes, Solemn League
and Covenant: But to instance in no more than the Honour and Priviledges of Parliament, the foundation of all their laws, which they
have so often sworn and vowed to maintain with their lives and fortunes: what face of a Parliament they have now left, which should
consist of three Estates, King, House of Peers, and House of Commons: The two first wholly destroyed: And what of the last is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(not to mention at least 150 that at the beginning of the Wars left them and went to <hi>Oxford</hi>) when a considerable number of their
own party protested against their proceedings, and discerted the House; How many imprisoned, and what great numbers by force ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
by that late bloody and hypocritical Usurper, which actions of his (though they were a main step to his intended Throne and
Tyrannical Government) yet are so well relished, by that Tail of a Parliament remaining, that they are resolved neither to readmit
the persons so illegally and injuriously expelled, not to fill up the voyd places of any removed or dead: so that in a few years, what by
death and new expulsion, they may reduce themselves to the number of those infamous Tyrants of <hi>Athens,</hi> and if they can establish
themselves by their designed <hi>Militia,</hi> and that they may thereby be able to command their now Masters, the Sword-men, and Cashire
them, they will moddle such a new Army as shall be in subjection to them, and then Vote themselves, their Sons, and Nephews, a
Parliament for ever. Let those that have generous <hi>English</hi> Spirits seriously consider into what a Laborinth of woe and misery they
have run themselves and now lye under; what a confusion there is in Church and State; that what hath been gotten by blood and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
must be so upheld; The Govetnment these Usurpers would settle, not being to be maintained, but by continual Armies and
Navies, and the support of these must be Taxes, Excise, Free-quarterings, and chargeable <hi>Militia</hi>'s, and other unsupportable burdens
to perpetuity. Now let the whole Nation beg and implore a blessing from the Father of Mercies, and let them all be of one heart and
one mind, to free themselves of these Iron yokes and heavy pressures, and joyn and concurre with us, in establishing a peaceable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
to the great joy and happiness of the honest and true-hearted, and to the advancement of the true Protestant Religion and
Gods Glory.</p>
