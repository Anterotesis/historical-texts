            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have discourst a great deal of the Popish <hi>Plot,</hi> and the commonly acknowledg'd dangers of <hi>Popery:</hi> On <hi>that</hi> side we are justly sensible of our Perils, and have not much need of more Warnings to look about us. But all the danger of Popery doth not lie <hi>one</hi> way; it hath other Methods to advance its Interests besides <hi>Killing</hi> and <hi>Burning;</hi> and of some of <hi>those</hi> I doubt we are not sufficiently aware. Like the percht Phesant we look so intently at the danger that makes the loud Noise, that we little heed the Enemy behind the Bush, that is ready to shoot us off. I remember I said when I last waited on you, that there are ways in which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is <hi>silently</hi> promoted; I shall now represent some of them to you with Honest, and Impartial plainness, as becomes one, who is an hearty enemy to Popery in all the Steps, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of it. And</p>
            <p>THe <hi>First occasion</hi> of our <hi>farther</hi> Danger that I shall menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, the present <hi>Diminution,</hi> (not to say <hi>Extinction</hi>) <hi>of Reverence to the Authority of the Church of</hi> England, and the <hi>Protestant</hi> Reformation, by Law establish't. <hi>Popery</hi> was not thrown out here by <hi>Rebellion, Sedition,</hi> or popular <hi>Tumults;</hi> but <hi>this Church</hi> was in a regular way Reformed, by the deliberate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53237:3"/>
and grave Counsels of our <hi>Rulers; These</hi> our <hi>Reformers</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out the <hi>Roman</hi> Corruptions; and in their steads, settled the <hi>Ancient Primitive Christianity,</hi> which was establish'd by all the Authority of the Kingdom, both <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and <hi>Civil:</hi> and <hi>this Establishment</hi> in Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship, is that by which we know the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> our pious Reformers, <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> by the advice of Learned, Grave <hi>Divines,</hi> Bishops, and others, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and bound upon us by most solemn Sanctions; <hi>this</hi> they fixt as the <hi>National Profession,</hi> to stand so in <hi>all Times,</hi> and not to serve only for a <hi>present Expedient</hi> (as some talk in their Dream) for their <hi>Reformation</hi> they founded upon the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and upon the Doctrine, and Practice of the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Purest</hi> Times, of the Primitive <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils, Christ</hi> himself being the <hi>Corner-Stone:</hi> And the Grounds being <hi>unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable,</hi> the thing setled on them, ought (in the main) to be <hi>so,</hi> and must have been so intended by those Excellent men, who so well knew what they did, and the Reasons of their so doing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here</hi> was our Religion now purged from <hi>Popery;</hi> a Religion that in the whole Constitution of it, hath the greatest <hi>antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> to that corrupt Profession; this is our <hi>old Protestantism, that,</hi> which was persecuted by <hi>Papists</hi> with Fire, and Faggot; <hi>that,</hi> which divers of the <hi>Reformers</hi> themselves sealed with their <hi>Blood,</hi> in opposition to <hi>Popish Idolatries,</hi> and <hi>Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> This was the <hi>Way,</hi> the <hi>Religion</hi> of the happy <hi>Elizabeth-Days,</hi> which are yet so Celebrated, so glorious among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants; and <hi>that</hi> finally, which was stood to, contended for, to the Death, by the <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the First. Here then is the <hi>standing Bulwark</hi> against Popery, this is <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christianity</hi> restored, our <hi>Anti-papistry:</hi> The <hi>Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> we understand, and can defend: and the Establishment and Maintenance of <hi>this,</hi> is our security against the <hi>Popish</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations.</p>
            <p>When we would destroy <hi>this,</hi> some thing we must set up; the <hi>Church of England</hi> is that which our Protestant Law-givers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53237:3"/>
have erected, have by so many Laws confirmed; <hi>This</hi> now is twisted with our <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and the whole frame of our Civil Government: so that the overthrow of one, will be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of both. If <hi>this Church</hi> should be overturned (which God forbid) confusion in the State must follow, and then Anarchy, and cutting Throats; and 'tis most likely, <hi>Popery</hi> at last. For when this Constitution is ruined, we must to <hi>new Modelling;</hi> And <hi>where</hi> shall we <hi>rest?</hi> Every Pretence, every Way hath as much right, as any other of the Competitors; and then we fall into a Scufle, and endless Disorders; and who but the <hi>Roman Church</hi> will get by that? If <hi>this Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> should be dismantled, before we could get another in the place of it, <hi>Popery,</hi> in all likelihood, would be with us.</p>
            <p>Now this Bulwark we are (many of us) throwing down, and taking away the Ordinance, and Artillery: Or rather we <hi>have done</hi> it, in great part; and have made the Church <hi>weak,</hi> and <hi>defenceless.</hi> The <hi>Authority,</hi> the <hi>Coercive</hi> Power, in effect, is gone: And what doth Vice, or Humour, or Faction care for <hi>Words, Papers, Arguments? Excommunication</hi> is the penalty, and we know how little that is made to signifie: so that the Church is obeyed by as many as please, and as long as those please: Such as will not at all, or but in this, and that, take their own course, and there is but little remedy. This is the plain, sad truth. <hi>Laws</hi> we have still, but the multitude of Offenders (with other things) make all in a manner unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. The <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church, and the <hi>Reverence,</hi> is lost and gone; the People dissolv'd, and at loose: They fear not, they care not for <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws,</hi> or <hi>Penalties:</hi> They will follow their <hi>own</hi> Ways, and the <hi>Teachers</hi> they have <hi>heap'd up to themselves;</hi> and the few that are left with us, are (divers of them) ready to be gone too, as soon as they are punish'd, or take Pet, and the Governors, and Ministers of the Church do not humour them. So that the strength of the Church is broken; little of the <hi>Fortress</hi> is left standing, besides the <hi>dead Walls;</hi> and even <hi>these</hi> many would have down too: <hi>Down with it, down with it even to the ground,</hi> is the Cry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53237:4"/>
This is a <hi>sad</hi> part of the state of our <hi>Church,</hi> and this its weak, almost ruined Condition, hath no doubt been the great temptation to many to desert it. Every Constitution, every Government ought to have <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> or it is <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious,</hi> and will be in a little time <hi>Contemptible:</hi> And ours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been made <hi>so</hi> by the loss of its strength, and due force, no wonder if it falls into disesteem, even among divers that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly revered it: No wonder if these, being so <hi>prejudiced,</hi> betake themselves to a <hi>Church</hi> which <hi>hath Authority,</hi> hath <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> They have been brought up (perhaps) under a fense of the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Government and Authority; of the <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> that is due to the Church, and its Constitutions; and of the <hi>Mischiefs, Schisms,</hi> and <hi>Confusions</hi> that arise from the want of these: And then observing, that our Church is so weakned, so disabled, so despised and affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they bid adieu to it, and betake themselves to <hi>that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, Idolatrous Church,</hi> that yet hath <hi>Authority,</hi> hath <hi>Rule</hi> over its Members.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, I dare say, hath been one of the chief occasions of the late <hi>increase</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> and the revolt of so many from the Reformed Communion. For <hi>one,</hi> and the most immediate consequent of want of Power in any Church, is <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Carelessness,</hi> and <hi>Neglects,</hi> and the loss of all <hi>Solemnity</hi> in Worship: Congregations will be <hi>thin,</hi> and their Deportment; and publick Devotions <hi>negligent,</hi> and indecent, which greatly scandalize the regular and truly devout, who are therefore the more easily tempted to put themselves among those with whom there is more appearance of <hi>decence</hi> and <hi>solemnity,</hi> in the exercise of Religion.</p>
            <p>This hath been a <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>offence,</hi> and <hi>Stone</hi> of <hi>stumbling:</hi> The <hi>way</hi> to remove it, and to prevent the further Mischiefs, would be to <hi>Establish the Church of England,</hi> and to give it <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are at present very <hi>zealous</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> (thanks be to God for any true Zeal against false Worship) but methinks too much of our Zeal is only <hi>Negative;</hi> we are for <hi>throwing down</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53237:4"/>
               <hi>Popery,</hi> but we talk little of <hi>establishing any thing;</hi> and while 'tis so, our Zeal is lame, and imperfect, and will never effect any thing to purpose. If we will secure our selves against <hi>Papism</hi> effectually, we must fix, and establish some <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> that may be a <hi>constant Fence</hi> against it. <hi>Popery</hi> we will not have; so far we are <hi>right,</hi> but what are we for? Something we must: <hi>Popery</hi> will not be run down by <hi>Atheism;</hi> if we have no Religion, or none Establish'd (which will come to the same) the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion will prevail, at long run, in despight of us: <hi>Some</hi> Religion (the worst) will be too hard for <hi>none;</hi> at least 'twill have mens <hi>Hearts,</hi> and then above half the work is done. We must not think to keep out <hi>Popery</hi> by meer <hi>brutal force,</hi> as the Heathens attempted to extinguish <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity:</hi> If we would go the <hi>right,</hi> the <hi>effectual way,</hi> we should endeavour it by <hi>professing,</hi> by <hi>settling</hi> a <hi>better,</hi> a more <hi>Catholick,</hi> more <hi>ancient,</hi> more <hi>holy</hi> Religion than <hi>theirs.</hi> A <hi>bad</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is most effectually driven out by a <hi>good;</hi> not by <hi>none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, something must be establish'd; And what do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire? Would we have <hi>Presbytery?</hi> That is <hi>new;</hi> that is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the <hi>Primitive</hi> usage of the Christian Church, that is <hi>unformed</hi> yet by the very Nation of the Patrons, 'tis an <hi>Idea</hi> different as every mans phancy is, the men themselves have not yet agreed upon the <hi>Scheme;</hi> and God knows when they would agree, if the Matter were left to them; and when that is done, What may it cost us before it can be establish'd? How long may it be before the People are well reconciled to the Novelty? And if ever it be establish'd, the <hi>Ecclesiastical Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> is gone from the right place, and indeed the <hi>Royal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> every where is lost. The <hi>King</hi> is a <hi>Subject.</hi> He hath only changed his <hi>Lord, one</hi> for <hi>many,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> for the <hi>Synod</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi> The <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>People</hi> are, <hi>ipso facto, Slaves;</hi> and then we have talkt, and contrived well for <hi>Liberty.</hi> Let <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> be considered where it hath been, in <hi>Geneva, Scotland,</hi> little Essays of it in <hi>England,</hi> and then let any tell me if it be not <hi>so.</hi> He that owns not this, knows it not, We shall then neither <hi>Marry,</hi> nor take a <hi>Servant,</hi> nor dispose of a <hi>Child,</hi> nor
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53237:5"/>
order any of our <hi>Domestique Affairs,</hi> without the cognizance, and arbitrement of the <hi>Elders:</hi> Every word we speak, every thing we do, must come under their censure, and be exposed to their Chastisement. It will, in short, be a <hi>Yoke</hi> to our Necks, which neither <hi>We,</hi> nor <hi>our Children</hi> will ever be able to bear. And I doubt not but those that understand themselves and <hi>it,</hi> will be ready to say, We would not have this. Let those that know it not, read the late <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then speak if they would.</p>
            <p>But what then would we be at? Is it <hi>Independency</hi> we would have? This is a thing different from the practice of the whole Christian World, unknown to Ancient, or later Times, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept here in the days of Rebellion, and in <hi>New England</hi> now. <hi>Popery</hi> takes away <hi>one</hi> of the Elements from the <hi>Laity</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper, this</hi> takes away <hi>both Elements</hi> from <hi>all,</hi> but a very few; for they impropriate the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their <hi>separated</hi> Company. <hi>Popery</hi> takes away part of <hi>one</hi> Sacrament, <hi>these</hi> take away the <hi>whole</hi> of <hi>both</hi> Sacraments; for they allow not <hi>Baptism</hi> to be Administred, but to the Children of their own Sect. <hi>Popery</hi> keeps the <hi>Scriptures</hi> up in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue;</hi> and <hi>these</hi> make it a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> a nothing to <hi>all,</hi> but those that have <hi>their Spirit</hi> to understand, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret. <hi>Popery</hi> damns <hi>all</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> that is without the pale of their pretended <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, and these <hi>unchurch, unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian all,</hi> but a few <hi>Hypocrites, Phanatiques</hi> of their own sort. One of them, <hi>Lewis Du Moulin, Cromwel's</hi> Historian in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> hath writ a Pamphlet lately, to prove, <hi>That not one in an</hi> 100000 (<hi>nay, probably not one in a Million</hi>) <hi>since</hi> Adam, <hi>shall be saved;</hi> and that <hi>one</hi> is an <hi>Independent,</hi> no doubt. <hi>Popery</hi> requires <hi>auricular Confession</hi> to a Priest; and <hi>these</hi> require a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Story</hi> of every mans <hi>Conversion</hi> before their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the first necessary condition of Communion. <hi>Popery</hi> pretends that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is <hi>Infallible;</hi> and <hi>these</hi> reckon every one of their private Spirits to be little less. So that <hi>this</hi> in many things symbolizeth with, and is as intolerable as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery it self; and what the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of it is, may be read in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53237:5"/>
               <hi>Story</hi> of our late <hi>Confusions,</hi> particularly in the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency:</hi> And <hi>New England</hi> can let us know, how gentle they are, where they have Power, and how much for <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience;</hi> for they there Hang up their own Off-spring, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> for professing, and living to the <hi>Principles,</hi> that they themselves teach.</p>
            <p>And both <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> agree with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> in <hi>this</hi> also, <hi>viz. In binding the heavy burdens of their own disputable</hi> (and some of them impious, and absurd) <hi>Doctrines, upon the Minds and Consciences of men, under the penalty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vnchurch'd, and Ruined:</hi> They are both severe <hi>Inquisitors</hi> into mens Opinions, and will allow no <hi>latitude</hi> of <hi>thinking</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their <hi>dear Orthodoxy,</hi> contain'd in their <hi>large Confessions</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> which are <hi>Creeds</hi> they make, over and above the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick,</hi> and <hi>Primitive</hi> ones, as the <hi>Papists</hi> do, <hi>teaching for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> (necessary fundamental Doctrines) <hi>the Traditions of men,</hi> those of their own Party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These</hi> therefore I suppose, and hope, will not suit us; I am sure they will not suit either <hi>Monarchy</hi> in Government, nor the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject:</hi> No, they will comport with nothing but <hi>Democracy,</hi> or <hi>Anarehy,</hi> both which are Tyrannies, and the worst sort. And I believe few or none of the intelligent <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Gentlemen can think of them.</p>
            <p>But, what then can we desire? what can we propose to have? Is there some <hi>know not what,</hi> yet to be found out? Is there any <hi>new</hi> Models yet to be invented, unknown, unpractised in any Age, or Nation of the Christian World? Many there are in the Brains of conceited men; <hi>whose Wind-mill</hi> shall be set up? What shall give it Reverence and Authority? What shall secure it against the rest that equally pretend? How shall it get hold upon the Consciences of men? or will we have a Religion without having Conscience concern'd?</p>
            <p>What ever is set up as Religious Security against Popery, must stand on the grounds of <hi>Scripture, right Reason,</hi> and the best and purest <hi>Antiquity; Popish</hi> Corruptions do all consist in departure from <hi>these.</hi> If what we endeavour to establish be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53237:6"/>
impeachable by <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> or <hi>Antiquity;</hi> we destroy our own Grounds, and disable our own Arguments against Popish Depravations. Upon <hi>these</hi> then we must stand, by <hi>these</hi> we must establish; and if these things are <hi>so,</hi> what can we desire, what can we think to have but our <hi>Old, Protestant, Legal</hi> Constitution of the <hi>Church of England?</hi> What but <hi>this,</hi> which is agreeable to <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Primitive Christianity</hi> (as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by many learned men, to the shame both of <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Phanaticks</hi> of all sorts) accommodate to our Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; wrought into our <hi>Fundamental</hi> Laws; suited to, and sufficient for all our needs; <hi>sober</hi> in its <hi>Principles, moderate</hi> in its <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline:</hi> Its <hi>Articles</hi> are not imposed on the Conscience as all <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and of necessity to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as <hi>Popish,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principles are) but as <hi>pious wholsome</hi> Doctrines, Articles of <hi>Consent,</hi> for the avoidance of Controversies, and Disputes; its <hi>Prayers</hi> are <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> without <hi>affectation,</hi> or <hi>doubtful</hi> Tenents: Its <hi>Ceremonies few, ancient, decent,</hi> declared to be in themselves <hi>alterable</hi> and <hi>indifferent;</hi> its <hi>Power</hi> is owned to be only <hi>Spiritual;</hi> what <hi>other</hi> any <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> have, is acknowledg'd to be the favour of Kings; it invades no rights of <hi>Princes,</hi> it secures <hi>Obedience</hi> to Government, and the interests of Societies: Its <hi>Penalties</hi> are all for <hi>Correction,</hi> not <hi>Destruction;</hi> it punisheth none for <hi>bare</hi> Opinions; it readily receives Offenders into its Bosom on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; it is not forward to denounce Curses against Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: It is very Candid, Charitable, and Ingenuous to other Churches; it was reformed by just Authority, with great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and avoidance of Extreams. These particulars, and a great many more to the same general purpose, have been fully proved by the learned Asserters of our Church, and lately in a particular worthy Discourse of the <hi>Moderation</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which is so much opposed because so unhappy to be so little understood.</p>
            <p>It will much concern us (now especially) to study and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this Constitution, which is the only mean between dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Extreams; <hi>that,</hi> and that <hi>only</hi> which can be made to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53237:6"/>
stand: Other Models are <hi>Romantick, Vnpracticable,</hi> they may entertain the imagination of phantastical, busie, unquiet <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators;</hi> but will never be brought into a constant settlement of Practice; or be made any security to us against Popish Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions: <hi>This,</hi> by the Grace of God, and Wise, Sober Counsels, and Endeavours, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> may: And if any Mercy yet remain for so sinful a People, it will be made so. It is, I am sure, the duty of every Friend to his Country, of every hearty enemy to <hi>Popery,</hi> in his place to endeavout it.</p>
            <p>Especially Sir, such Gentlemen as you, <hi>Representatives</hi> of your Country in <hi>Parliament,</hi> I humbly think are concern'd to Consult, and Act your part, in order to it. We honour you, and thank God for your great <hi>Zeal</hi> against <hi>Popery;</hi> you will effectually express it to your future Glory, and your own, and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lasting Security and Happiness, by endeavouring to make <hi>firm,</hi> and to fasten our Foundations, by helping up the decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Banks, and Dams, which the Wisdom and Piety of our Kings, and Parliaments have made against the Inundation of that Ocean of Errors, and Superstitions; by labouring to build up our almost ruined Walls, and to fortifie our Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, <hi>viz.</hi> To strengthen the Religion of our <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> by Law Establish'd; that it may be yet more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and securely settled. This, Sir, I hope you in particular will endeavour, and not give occasion for that Reproach, that your Zeal is not for the safety of your <hi>Religion,</hi> but of your <hi>Lands.</hi> You cannot secure the latter, but by making the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer safe; nor do this (I humbly believe) any other way. Your Father, Sir, and other Relations, were zealous Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to this Excellent Church, and suffered much for their King, and It, being very sensible of these truths. You inherit their great Estate, and I hope you do these their Virtues, You had through God's Blessing, and their Care, a pious Education in this Protestant Way, this you still profess, and I hope will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to on all occasions.</p>
            <p>You see the Churches Enemies on the other side, those that so lately destroy'd it, the King, Government and all, are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53237:7"/>
now as bufie as ever, and seem to be confident to do their Work again; they are always stirring, and industrious in our Difficulties and Dangers; <hi>these</hi> are <hi>their opportunities: Their</hi> business also is to destroy us, which if they could effect, they would by that make way for <hi>Popery,</hi> which they seem so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest against. You cannot but observe how they out-rage, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, abuse, and flie at the poor distressed Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Fathers, and Sons of it. They think themselves so secure of succeeding, that they do in a manner <hi>declare</hi> already: They have been always seeking Pretences, and are now glad at heart of the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> because of the opportunity, and advantages it gives them: and 'tis as plain as Light, that they would use it to ruine us the <hi>other way;</hi> and if they succeed, we are as certainly undone. I hope you will not be so intent on one Danger, as to neglect, and oversee the other: Yea, we fall at last into the <hi>same</hi> which we most fear, if they once drive us into <hi>Confusions</hi> in Religion, which must unavoidably follow the destruction of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> So that with great reason I may affirm, that these Enemies of it, are <hi>promoters</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> notwithstanding the loud noise they make against it. I hope when it pleaseth God, and the King, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall meet, <hi>You,</hi> with the rest of our <hi>Patriots,</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider for the Confirmation, and I stablishment of our <hi>Legal, Protestant</hi> Constitution, against the dangers of <hi>Fanatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions,</hi> as well as those of <hi>Popish Superstitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the great <hi>Assembly</hi> of our <hi>Representatives</hi> shall think fit to desire some smaller Alterations, and Abatements for the gaining <hi>reasonable</hi> Dissenters (some will never be satisfied) or not; it is not for me to conjecture. All sober Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> will no doubt acquiesce, and be content with what the Wisdom of the Nation shall think fit: But when that Point is resolv'd whether one way, or the other, 'tis to be hoped <hi>Strengthening,</hi> and <hi>Settlement,</hi> with such Allowances, or without, will follow; that we may not be always floating. This is the longing expectation of all Wise, and Good men, and it must be Moderate, Grave, Religious Counsels that must
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53237:7"/>
contrive, and effect this Happiness for us: Many such no doubt will be offer'd at your Meeting, I hope you will go with the <hi>Healers</hi> of our <hi>Breaches,</hi> and not with the <hi>fierce</hi> men that would drive things to Extreams. I am sure you can get nothing by Confusions, and Dissettlements: Pray God disappoint those that would have Distractions, because they think they <hi>can</hi> get by them.</p>
            <p>I remember, walking with you last Summer in your Park, you were pleas'd to ask me, What way there was to fecure the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> under a <hi>Popish Successor,</hi> though he should be Mild, and Gentle, and not bent upon the enforcing of his Religion? One chief ground of the Question was, That the <hi>King</hi> bestows the Bishopricks, and many other Ecclesiastical Preferments, and it cannot well (as you reasonably offer'd) be supposed, but that <hi>He</hi> will, in that case, bestow them on such as either are <hi>Popishly</hi> affected, or not very averse to, or zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous against that Religion: Or if the King should do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and bestow them upon the most Worthy, Sincere, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Protestants, yet the People would entertain Jealousies of them, and never think them <hi>such:</hi> which would destroy their Authority, and Reverence, and occasion the dispersion of the People yet further, into Corners.</p>
            <p>To this I said, That I did not pretend to offer publick expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients in such great and weighty matters; but I thought, that if by any means of Justice and safety to the Rights of the Crown, (such as consent in that case would be) <hi>Canonical Elections</hi> should, during such time, be granted to each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Church,</hi> and the King should please not to determine them in their choice to a Person by his <hi>Conge de' stire,</hi> (as now) but leave them to their liberty of Choosing as they thought fit, (as in some former times they did) each <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to choose the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the Diocess, and their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; that this might be reasonable Security. And if the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> of each Diocess, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Deanry, or the <hi>Vniversities,</hi> should have the right gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them of presenting to the King's Livings (during
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53237:8"/>
such time of a <hi>Popish Successor</hi>) this way I humbly thought, might in all likelihood, secure us against those Dangers. For the Clergy of the <hi>Church of England</hi> are of all men most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in point of <hi>Interest,</hi> as well as <hi>Principles,</hi> and profession to oppose <hi>Popery;</hi> and as far as lawfully they may, all advances towards it. (This one would think should need no proof, but it seems it doth among some, and I shall clear that Matter by and by.) And they would no doubt, take care from time to time, to Elect <hi>such</hi> as were most fast to our <hi>Protestant</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, most eminent in their Lives, and Learning, and most able and ready to oppose <hi>Popish</hi> Corruptions; and so the Church of <hi>England</hi> might stand, if direct, and profest Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence were not offer'd to it: To this purpose I then said, I think on the occasion of his Majesty's gracious offers for <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Security under a Successor of the other Religion. I do not know what opportunities may be offer'd again, the next Session, but if any such be, and this particularly might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, I hope it will be accepted, and me-thinks some such thing should be desired. But, Sir, I am no <hi>Projector,</hi> I speak all this with all imaginable submission to the wiser Judgments of my Superiours.</p>

               <p n="2">II. ANother occasion I note of the <hi>increase</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> is our <hi>ill treatment of our own Protestant Clergie, those of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>Their</hi> Predecessors were <hi>they</hi> who first formed our Reformation upon the soberest, and best grounds of Opposition to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (as I have shewn) and by their Blood sealed our Protestant Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishments: And the Successors of those blessed men, Bishops, and other Episcopal Divines, have, ever since, been the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53237:8"/>
                  <hi>Scourges</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> who by their learned and excellent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, have confuted, exposed, triumph'd over the numerous Errors of that Church: These have been the grand Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Protestant Cause, that have fought our Battels against the stoutest, and most daring Enemies, with glorious success; such were Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Bishop <hi>Morton,</hi> Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi> Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Usher,</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> Bishop <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> Dean <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi> Dean <hi>Tillotson,</hi> Dean <hi>Lloyd,</hi> Dr. <hi>Henry More,</hi> Dr. <hi>Brevint;</hi> these and innumerable others, have strenuously, and plainly refuted, bafled, and disproved the Popish Deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And every where, men of the same sort, in all parts of <hi>England,</hi> are very busie both by Books, and Sermons to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those Corruptions odious, and detestable as they deserve: Particularly we have an eminent, aggregate Instance, in the Reverend <hi>Episcopal Clergie</hi> of the City of <hi>London:</hi> How many learned, substantial, convictive Sermons have they preach'd against the <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrines, and Practice, since our late Fears and Dangers? I believe there have not been <hi>such</hi> deliver'd in that City against those Superstitions, since the Foundation of it: More sound, accomplish'd, judicious Preachers, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly never had; never any that understood the <hi>Roman</hi> Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities better, never any that were more resolv'd, or more active Enemies to them. The Divines, the Ancient, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> principally, have by their Preaching, and their Writings, so inform'd, season'd, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the People against <hi>Popery,</hi> as we find at this Day; from <hi>them</hi> they have their chief Grounds, from <hi>them</hi> their courage of Opposition. 'Tis true, some few others have written some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> have labour'd worthily: Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath said somewhat to <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> and there are some Sermons of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> extant, <hi>Morning Lectures</hi> against <hi>Popery:</hi> These are the most, the chief of their Performances I ever heard of. Indeed the People of the Dissenting Party talk commonly, as if the Non-conformist Ministers had written the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53237:9"/>
most and best Books against Popery, and had this way shewn themselves more zealous Adversaries to it, than the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Clergy have done: But they do but shew their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in this, as they do in other Matters of the like nature. And the ground of their Mistake is this, That they take all the Books which their Ministers have written against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be written against <hi>Popery.</hi> They have indeed written more than a Horseload of Books of this sort; but what they have written against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Boy may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at his Back. I would not disparage any <hi>Protestant</hi> Writings against the <hi>Papists,</hi> nor appear <hi>partial</hi> to the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Divines; Let the World compare, and judg of which side have been the most, and most considerable Opposites to the Popish cause: Let any the most prejudiced against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> read both sorts, and then judg, who have been the <hi>Original</hi> Authors, and who have only used the <hi>others Reading, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Reasonings.</hi> I would leave the Matter with the most partial to Dissenters, to determine, when they have read, when they have consider'd. There is no man certainly of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, or experience of the World, but must grant that the <hi>chief,</hi> the most <hi>successful</hi> Antagonists of <hi>Popery</hi> have been the Clergy of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> These the <hi>Papists</hi> have always most apprehended, opposed most; the others they have taken little notice of; they have not shewn that they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned them considerable. This is plain, and clear to all the World. Others make loud Out-cries against the word <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Papist,</hi> but the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Divines do the Business.</p>
               <p>And now, since we are <hi>zealous</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> it might be expected that we should cherish, and encourage those that fight for us against it, and have come off laden with so many Trophies of Victory; that have so asserted our Cause, and given our Enemies so many Mortal Wounds; that are still ready for this Warfare, and always prepar'd for our Defence; one would think, I say, we should unanimously love, respect, and cherish such useful Friends, and Leaders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53237:9"/>
But alas! The Matter is quite otherwise: There are not any Ministers of any Religion in the World that are so disrespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and ill treated: I mean not by <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Sectarian</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <hi>only,</hi> from such they expect bad usage; but from many of those whom they instruct, whom they serve, and who pretend to be Children of that Church of which they are Ministers; at least they are such as do not openly disown it. The People of all other Religions in the World reverence, and respect their Priests, and Teachers; the very <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> do; this do <hi>Papists,</hi> and the Sects of all sorts, and 'tis a natural consequence from love, and respect to Religion: But <hi>we</hi> (many of us) vilifie, and depress ours; give them no respect for their <hi>Work,</hi> their <hi>Office sake;</hi> yea, they are so much the <hi>less</hi> for it with us: We love to vex, and reproach them: We chearfully hear any defamatory Lies their Enemies invent against them; we are ready to spread, and publish such Stories, and seem to delight in so doing: We call them by Nick-names of contempt, and scarce think any bad enough: We are apt to censure all their actions and their words, putting the worst, and most uncharitable Constructions on them: We pinch them in their Dues, detain, and arrest their Rights from them; think every thing too much that they have, though it be by the most Ancient and Fundamental Laws; and many, not content with the harvest of <hi>great Tythes,</hi> the <hi>Impropriations,</hi> snatch the Gleanings, the <hi>small things</hi> that are left also, from them: We allow all others to grow rich by any means, right or wrong, <hi>Lawyers, Physicians, Tradesmen;</hi> not induring almost that our Clergy should have any thing; denying them any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment (or regretting it) that hath any Power, Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Advantage; and forcing them upon a great deal of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Business that is <hi>troublesome,</hi> and <hi>odious,</hi> to recover their Dues, and Childrens Bread, that is with-held, and wrested from them; increasing their Work, lessening, taking away their just, legal, ancient Profits; envying the encouragements of Learning that are left, the Dignities of the Church, though spent in <hi>Hospitality</hi> upon our selves; clamouring at them,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53237:10"/>
ready for occasions to seize them, and desiring such, though <hi>Englishmen</hi> not <hi>Foreigners;</hi> our <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> our <hi>Children,</hi> our <hi>Brothers,</hi> our <hi>Nephews,</hi> possess them. These sad things, every one that observes may see, how much they are so, and a great part of the Conforming Clergy, perhaps the greatest, feel all these instances of ill Usage from some or others. I do not say that all of us treat them thus, (God forbid) Persons of Breeding, Piety, and Worth, usually are kind, civil, and respectful to this Order; but yet how common the other Treatment is, may be observ'd in most Conversations, and in the ordinary course of things among us.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, what could we do <hi>more</hi> for the advantage of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the promoting of it? What more than to pelt, vilifie, and dishearten their grand Enemies? What <hi>more</hi> to give colour to their Slander, that <hi>we Protestants</hi> are a People of <hi>no Faith, no Religion?</hi> What <hi>more,</hi> to render the Protestant Instructions we receive from them, contemptible among their Hearers; and their Oppositions of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant? What can we do <hi>more</hi> to expose them to all the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emissaries, than to loosen them from their proper Guides, and to destroy all Reverence, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect towards them? <hi>Smite the Shepheards and the Sheep will flie.</hi> What <hi>more</hi> to affix the <hi>Popish</hi> slander on our <hi>Reformation,</hi> that it was but <hi>hatred of the Clergie, and love to their Lands?</hi> What <hi>more</hi> towards the destroying our now flourishing <hi>Protestant Universities,</hi> the discouragement of all Learning, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the letting in of Ignorance, and <hi>Popery</hi> upon us? What can we do <hi>more</hi> to dishearten men of Parts from entring into the sacred Function, and filling the Church with men wholly ignorant, and unlearned, to the great Scandal, and certain Ruine of it? To all these Mischiefs doth the ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those of the sacred Function tend, (which will end in <hi>Popery</hi>) besides the disingenuity, unreasonableness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of it.</p>
               <p>Which way think you Sir, did the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> of old, endeavour to destroy <hi>Christianity?</hi> Was it not by vilifying,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53237:10"/>
and persecuting the <hi>Preachers</hi> of it? Which way doth every Sect endeavour to destroy another; is it not by opposing, and disgracing the <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>Leaders?</hi> What surer way is there to undermine, and ruine <hi>Popery,</hi> than the rendring their <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi> vile among the People; and the lessening their Authority, and Power over them? And what more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect course to destroy the Protestant Religion, than the vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the <hi>Protestant Clergie,</hi> and rendring them of no account or estimation? Is not this the way the <hi>Fanatick Whiggs</hi> take to Ruine us? Against whom do they spit their Venom, and bend their chief Force, but against the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of our Church? And will not the disgracing of them do the <hi>Papists</hi> as much service? On the other hand, what is the way that all <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Professions</hi> take to uphold, and promote their own Persuasion; is it not to incourage, and cherish their Teachers? Do they not honour, and respect them? Do they not vindicate their Reputations on all occasions, and are they not zealous for them? To trouble, to vilifie, or speak against their Preachers, is to touch them in the apple of their Eye; they are very tender, and concern'd here: And by this means they maintain the Reputation, and Interest of their respective Professions: And do not we by the contrary Practice, lay the Honour, and Strength of ours in the Dust, and make way for the wild Beasts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forrest to break in upon, and to destroy us? This certaintly is as direct a Course as we can take to promote <hi>Popery,</hi> the great Object of our present Fears.</p>
               <p>I know, Sir, all this will be extreamly ungrateful Discourse to some, and provoke them to pour out their usual Reproaches against the Clergy. <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Ill-living,</hi> will presently be objected, aggravated to the height: These will be pleaded to justifie the ill usage I have represented, and to invite worse? And it would be wonderful indeed, if in so great a Body of men as the Clergy are, <hi>viz.</hi> Nine or Ten Thousand, (it may be more) there should not be Instances found to give colour to such Reproaches; and if there should not be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53237:11"/>
some to deserve very bad Characters. But let it be consider'd, that the far greatest part of Livings, are poor Vicarages of 20, 30, or 40 Pounds a Year, into such Patrons must put whom they can get, and Bishops that admit, know not mens ill Lives, and the Laws are content with very slender qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Learning; nor are great Matters necessary for every Country Village; and this poor condition of so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Clergy sets them into mean Conversation, and by their low and bad Company, they are tempted (and often purposely so) to disorders; which then are triumphantly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd, the men are despised, and the whole Order for their sakes. Some are surprized; for some Traps are laid, and they are industriously drawn into Scandal on purpose to defame them, and the whole Clergy, and it cannot be denied but that too many are <hi>Clouds without Water, spots in our Feasts, Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes's, Demas's, Judas's,</hi> not only in the smaller Cures, but in the more considerable Preferments: Many, most of those, the <hi>Laity</hi> present to, and do not always prefer for worth, but for divers other, sometimes, very undue considerations; all which consider'd, it cannot be, but Scandals must arise among so great a Body of men, in such Circumstances; and then they having so many Enemies, of so many sorts (<hi>Atheists, Papists, Fanaticks, Worldlings, Debauchees,</hi>) who watch for their hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and rejoyce when they fall, who are ready to invent so many malicious evil things of them, and to publish, and spread what they hear, or what they make, (their interest being to have them and the Church vilified, and despised) it could not be, but that they must suffer under manifold Reproaches, though they were all wise, cautious, innocent; how much more when there are divers ill, unwise, unwary men among them? and in all great Bodies in the World, in all times even the best, such mixtures have been: And even the Good, the most Excellent have their Faults, and Imperfections, which when ill-will is to represent, and comment upon them, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so heightned, and improved as to blacken them all over, and to make them appear very vile to the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53237:11"/>
But after all this, it must be said, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (blessed be God for it) hath a great number of most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Divines, men of great Piety, Parts, and Learning; substantial powerful Preachers; Pious, Sober, Virtuous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; <hi>such,</hi> as for all kinds of Ability, this Nation never had <hi>greater, better, more.</hi> Let my former Instance of the Clergy of <hi>London</hi> be consider'd, as an evidence of this: Their worth is so great, and shines so bright, that the Adversaries of our Church cannot but acknowledg it. Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> in one of his late Books (the most sharp he hath written against us) owns that he meets with <hi>judicious, substantial Sermons,</hi> almost in every Church in <hi>London,</hi> where he happens to go: And up and down in the Country, every where, one may find very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Persons that lie hid, and make no publick noise in the World. I have said this by way of brief, but just <hi>Apology,</hi> in the behalf of our abused Clergy; and add, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the ill Character they lie under, among some, and the failings, and imperfections they are guilty of, yet this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never had (I believe) a wiser, learneder Clergy upon the whole, since the Beginnings of it: And the contempt, and ill treatment they meet withal, is one of the greatest Reasons why they are not better.</p>
               <p>General disrespect makes men careless, and incautious in their Lives: Whereas honour and esteem ingageth them to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect, and wary to maintain that veneration, and regard that is paid them. So that the men that most upbraid the Clergy with ill Lives, are the principal causes that many of their lives are so obnoxious; and they may consider (some of them) whether they do not themselves for sordid, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Reasons, bestow their Livings upon such as they complain of, and so <hi>make</hi> the reason of their own Complaints.</p>
               <p>I have been tedious upon this Head, which yet would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire larger Animadversions, and I shall here crave leave yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to note, That</p>
               <p>Among all the abuses fastned on our Clergy, there is none more unreasonable, and unjust than that of their <hi>inclination</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:53237:12"/>
                  <hi>to,</hi> or <hi>no great distance from the Roman Church.</hi> This reproach our Enemies now, every where, publish, or infinuate to carry on their design of destroying the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which shews that some will say any thing against them, any thing that may render them popularly odious, though it be never so contrary to all truth, and all appearance. And I challenge the whole <hi>Protestant</hi> World, to shew a publick Instance of more Zeal against <hi>Popery,</hi> than our <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England Divines</hi> have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest against the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, ever since, and before, the discovery of the late Plot. Every Pulpit can witness their frequent, earnest Sermons against those Superstitions; and every Stationers Shop can shew their numerous excellent Books against them. Or if these were not, we may consider that <hi>Interest will not lye;</hi> men, especially <hi>such,</hi> as they suppose our Clergy, will not act contrary to that. Can we think that all the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> that have <hi>Abby,</hi> and other <hi>Church Lands,</hi> will desire, and endeavour to promote <hi>Popery?</hi> Are they suppose we favourers, and friends of that Religion, that in likelihood would divest them of their Estates? Can we think that the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> are for blocking up, and hindring the Current of the <hi>Thames?</hi> Or that the Lord Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have a plot to translate the Trade to <hi>Lincoln</hi> or <hi>York?</hi> Have the Merchants any desires, or designs for the destroying of <hi>Shipping,</hi> and <hi>Navigation?</hi> Shop-keepers intrigues against <hi>Trade?</hi> or the Lawyers designs against the Business of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall?</hi> If no one is so foolish as to object such inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and endeavours against those, why should they then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>Popery,</hi> any degree of it, any the least inclination to it, against the <hi>Clergie</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whom of all men it would most throughly, most certainly undo? And that there is no Church-man so ignorant, but he must know. For all the <hi>Married</hi> Clergy lose their Livelihoods, without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if that be all: All the <hi>Prebendaries</hi> in the new Churches which were <hi>Monasteries</hi> of Monks, must turn out, unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: All that have been active in Preaching, or writing against <hi>Popery</hi> (which takes in the chief part of the Clergy) are in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53237:12"/>
imminent danger of being ruined further than the loss of their Livelihoods amounts too. If there should be any that think of saving themselves by <hi>Conformity;</hi> they can look on that only as better than being utterly undone, not as a thing otherwise desirable. For the <hi>uncouth</hi> work with which they are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, the <hi>servile</hi> subjection to their Superiours, to which they have not been used, and above all, the hatred, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, fury of the People, to which they will be exposed, and by which they will be still in danger of being out-raged; are worse Circumstances, and will be so to them, than any Poverty, any Condition whatsoever in the Service of this Church, can possibly be: So that could they, with the wreck of their Consciences, and future hopes, be safe under <hi>Popery,</hi> for <hi>this</hi> World; yet they must be very uneasie, very miserable in it. And though they could be secure of the utmost kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Papists</hi> (which there is no reason to expect) yet they would be in perpetual danger of being torn in pieces, or knock'd on the head by the People, if any Commotions (which we cannot think but such a state of things would be very lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to) should happen. And if the Tide should turn, and that Religion be again expell'd, any way, they must then be (if suffer'd to live) the most hated, detested Creatures alive. And are such Circumstances as <hi>these</hi> desirable? Can any men in their Wits covet, and endeavour to arrive at such a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Who ever really thinks that the Clergy of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> desire, or are inclined to <hi>Popery,</hi> thinks they are <hi>Ideots,</hi> or <hi>Madmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what is there so reasonable, so lovely, in <hi>Popery</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline so great a Body of men, that know it, and have shewn they know ill enough by it, to renounce all their Interests in favour of it? This would make some believe that <hi>Protestants</hi> have belied the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, and cheated the World with false Representations of it, if the Clergy of an opposite Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church do secretly desire it, contrary to all their Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Oaths, and Vows to God and Men, and contrary to all their dearest Interests in this World. If this be so, <hi>Popery</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53237:13"/>
hath strange Beauties, and Charms, which the Glergy see, but will not acquaint the People with: And what can be alledged more to the advantage of <hi>Popery?</hi> Or what can more express the Slanderers extream malice against the Conformable Clergy? Which, as I have shewn, hath a tendency to the advancement of the <hi>Popish</hi> cause and interest.</p>
               <p>Now to prevent it here also, we should countenance, and incourage these Adversaries of that Church, and Way, the Divines of our own. 'Tis their imployment, and hath been their study to discover the errors, dangers, and malignity of <hi>Romish</hi> Corruptions, and Innovations. Divers ingenious Gentlemen of the Court, and Country, are likewise well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in this Knowledg; but the <hi>Clergie</hi> have made it most their Business, and are most immediately concern'd: By such their Craft must be detected, their Pretences exposed, their Endeavours defeated. <hi>Popery</hi> will not be kept out by Railing, and Noise, it must be the light of contrary Conviction that must do it; it must be kept from taking hold of the Hearts, and Consciences of men, and not only be resisted by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Power; so that, if we are heartily disaffected to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and the increase of it, we should shew that inclination by our favour to those who so strenuously, so unanimously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it. We ought to respect our own Clergy for that Reason, and for many others, for their <hi>Character,</hi> and their <hi>Work,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>God hath dignified them with highest <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, his Ambassadors, Stewards of his Mysteries, Angels, Stars, Light;</hi> and shall we despise those whom he is pleased to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Are these titles marks of Infamy, and Reproach? Their <hi>Business</hi> also, and Imployment requires our respects to them; 'tis the greatest, most honourable, most useful; they serve us for our noblest part, our highest ends, these challenge our kindness, our countenance, and ingenuous and candid thoughts of them, which we should shew in dislike of vilifying Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and in reproving unjust Reproaches of them. <hi>Charity thinketh no evil;</hi> not of any, especially not of our <hi>Spiritual</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53237:13"/>
                  <hi>Guides,</hi> whom we ought to reckon worthy of <hi>double honour for their Work sake.</hi> We should consider what Enemies they have on all sides to invent, and spread Slanders of them, to make much of little, something of nothing: and where we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faults, we should reporve them <hi>privately,</hi> we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, what in us lies, to make their Lives comfortable, that fo with Courage, and Resolution, they may address them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their great Work. Those who are always opprest and kept down, will beable to do no great matter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apostles</hi> indeed, and Primitive Christians got vigour from Oppositions, and Persecutions, but their assistances were <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>immediate:</hi> And, thanks be to God, we have many resolv'd excellent Men, whom no ill treatment will discourage from their Duty; though others of lower Form, that might otherwise be very useful, in some degree may be disheartned. We would not have them intermeddle in <hi>Secular</hi> Matters; 'tis pity men should make it more necessary than they desire, by giving them trouble to get their small Dues (<hi>Small</hi> especially in <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Corporations</hi>) but pay justly, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not divert them from their other Business (which is enough) by vexations of this sort; this is cruel, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And 'twere greatly to be wish'd that the Government would take care to augment the Livings in <hi>Corporations,</hi> and <hi>great Towns,</hi> where the greatest imployment is and the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; and appoint some speedier, easier way for the gaining of <hi>small Dues,</hi> great part of which now is lost, or got with incredible Envy, Hatred, and Toil. This hath been aim'd at, and indeavour'd in a late Parliament, and 'twould be just, and for the interest and advantage of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, it should be effectually consider'd. The ways that are now, through the iniquity of the Times, are tedious, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious, odious, and scarce practicable at last: and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster must resolve to sit down either with the loss of his Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, or his Reputation, and his Peace. So that to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase quietness he must be a Beggar; and is under great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to lose the interest of his Family, and the rights of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53237:14"/>
his Church. These discouragements will easily be remov'd when any Parliament shall think fit to set about it.</p>
               <p>And since I am upon <hi>Desirables,</hi> I'le mention one or two more, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Patrons</hi> would take consciencious Care in presenting to their Livings; that they would consider the <hi>fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of Persons, and the <hi>Churches Service,</hi> and not be moved by other <hi>undue</hi> considerations; for want of <hi>this,</hi> many unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, incompetent men creep in, to the great dishonour and prejudice of our Church, and Religion. And if these things were rectified, it is to be suppos'd, and hop'd, that Care would be taken, that <hi>Degrees</hi> should not be given in the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi> but to men of suitable Learning; nor <hi>holy Orders,</hi> but to Persons known to be fitly Qualified. The rectifying these few things, would cure many of the greatest Evils that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, and disgrace the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> Reformation. They would then be animated to their Duty, be Ornaments to the Church, have power with the People, and so be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled more effectually to defend the <hi>Protestant</hi> Interest, and Religion; whereas our present Proceedings, lessen and expose both them, and it.</p>

of Religion, and Grounds of <hi>Sect-making</hi> among us. And <hi>all</hi> are zealous for their particular Conceits, <hi>all</hi> call their own imaginations by the most sacred names, <hi>Light, God's Truth, Gospel Ways, Holy Mysteries, Daunings, Illuminations, Refinings;</hi> and a world more of such fondness; by which they are infinitely puff'd up in their own Phancies, as the only <hi>Knowing,</hi> the only <hi>Spiritual</hi> Christians; and taught to scorn all other Doctrines, and Ways, as <hi>beggarly Rudiments, Elements of this World,</hi> and <hi>Carnal Reasonings</hi> at the best; yea, generally to rail bitterly at them, as <hi>Lyes, Popish, Babylonish, Antichristian trash, Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> and such like; and consequently, to hate, and bitterly to revile all different Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, especially those that are <hi>uppermost, Establish'd,</hi> or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd by the <hi>Government, now,</hi> chiefly the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but if any one of <hi>them</hi> were got into the place, it would be the same thing, all the rest would flie upon it, and tear it with their utmost Rancour, Vehemence, and Reproaches: Which state of things among us is infinitely <hi>Scandalous</hi> to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, to which they all pretend: And those that leave us, clamorously object that there is <hi>no end</hi> of our <hi>Factions</hi> and <hi>Divisions:</hi> That 'tis a sign our Church is not the <hi>true</hi> one, since it is so <hi>broken, shattered, divided:</hi> Which <hi>Divisions</hi> they think, and say are either the natural consequents of our <hi>departure</hi> from <hi>them,</hi> or the <hi>Judgment</hi> of God upon us for <hi>that Separation.</hi> See, say they, what <hi>you Protestants</hi> are, a medley of wild disagreeing Sects, as different from, and as fierce one against another, as against us; <hi>one</hi> in <hi>Name,</hi> but in <hi>Principles,</hi> in <hi>Affections,</hi> in your particular ways <hi>infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi> infinitely <hi>opposite.</hi> You have no Principles, are fastned to no Foundation; float up and down, like the Waves of the Sea, still rouling from one Sect to another: Whereas <hi>we Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> are <hi>one</hi> Body, an Edifice firmly built upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> having no such Fractions among us, but being as a <hi>City that is at unity in it self.</hi> By such suggestions, to which our <hi>Divisions</hi> give too much colour, they deceive the Hearts of the Simple, and draw multitudes into their Snares.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53237:15"/>
And as our Divisions promote <hi>Popery</hi> by way of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and the ill opinion they beget of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> so they do the same by giving the <hi>Papists</hi> positive, and direct opportunity to play their Game. They put themselves into all shapes, and disguises among our Sects, and under those Vizards drive us on towards more Confusion, and disseminate their own Doctrines under other Names, and Appearances, with great advantage to their Cause. So that while there are such <hi>Separations,</hi> and <hi>Conventicle Meetings</hi> among us, <hi>Popery</hi> is still carrying on: The <hi>Popish</hi> Agents will creep into Houses; they will hide, and shelter themselves under those pretences, and drive on their Business by them.</p>
               <p>So that there is no way for us to come to any assurance against <hi>Popery,</hi> but by <hi>Vnion,</hi> by which the Scandal will be removed, and the <hi>advantages</hi> that we give our Enemies by our <hi>Divisions.</hi> But this, considering how things are, may seem utterly unpracticable; <hi>union</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi> in <hi>Opinions,</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly unfeisable; it never was in the World, it never will be: But yet, some <hi>External Vnion, Subjection, Truce, fairness</hi> among the different minds <hi>may:</hi> And how is <hi>that</hi> to be attain'd? Must all Dissenters from the Church be <hi>supprest?</hi> Or, must they have a <hi>general Toleration?</hi> The ordering this Matter, must be left to the Wisdom of our Governours; only in <hi>general</hi> I say, something must be done for the removing the mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous effects of our Divisions. I will not pretend to <hi>direct,</hi> but I'le give you my opinion in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Toleration is not the way.</hi> Liberty of <hi>Conscience</hi> must be given; there is no help for <hi>that;</hi> no power on Earth can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it; for <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> is liberty of <hi>Practical Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and the freedom of <hi>that</hi> none can take away. <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Practice</hi> then, is the thing in dispute; that consists either in <hi>professing</hi> our private <hi>Opinions,</hi> or our <hi>walking</hi> in private <hi>Ways,</hi> contrary to Establishments; and as to these too, strictly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our <hi>Liberty</hi> cannot be taken away; For whatever the Laws or Penalties are, men will still retain <hi>natural</hi> power, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to profess what they believe, and to act according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53237:15"/>
The question then is of <hi>Political Liberty,</hi> whether they should not be determined by Laws, and bounded by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, and Penalties in <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters,</hi> as well as others? And so, it will come to this, whether there should be <hi>any Government in the Church or not?</hi> For if there be a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> there must be <hi>Laws,</hi> if there be <hi>Laws,</hi> there must be <hi>Penalties</hi> annext to the violation of those Laws; otherwise the Government is precarious, and at every ones mercy; that is, 'tis none at all; the very nature of Government requires Restraints, and the bounding the liberty of Practice: and to strive for <hi>Toleration,</hi> is to contend against all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Let it be tried in the Civil State, in <hi>Armies,</hi> in <hi>Schools,</hi> in any Societies, or publick Bodies; And see what work it would make with them? <hi>None</hi> certainly could stand under the practice of such a Principle: For if Penalties are forborn to <hi>any,</hi> why should not <hi>all</hi> expect it, when there is occasion? And all may have the same pretence when they need it. If no one is to be punish'd for doing that which is <hi>agreeable</hi> to his <hi>Conscience,</hi> or not doing that which is <hi>contrary</hi> to it, every one will quickly learn to say that the thing he <hi>would do</hi> is his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> and the thing he <hi>dislikes</hi> is <hi>against</hi> it: And 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for all the wisdom in the World to tell, but that it <hi>may;</hi> no one can judg <hi>that,</hi> but a man's self: So that here is an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual loose and out-let to all Government in the <hi>Church;</hi> yea, and in the <hi>State</hi> too.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Conscience</hi> is as much concern'd in the Duties of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table,</hi> as in those of the <hi>First.—Conscience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence towards God, and towards men,</hi> Acts 24. 16. And there is no Statute of the Realm that can be made, but men may find a pretence of <hi>Conscience</hi> against it: And if Conscience (every man's <hi>peevish, humoursome, erring</hi> Judgment, which he will call by that name) be so sacred, that no one must be punish'd that follows it, then every one may be excused, when he thinks fit to plead this, and so good-night to all Laws and Governments of all sorts. If a man <hi>steals</hi> anothers Goods,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53237:16"/>
the Law would punish him: But saith he, I did according to my Conscience; the possessor was a wicked man that had no right, for all <hi>property is founded in Grace,</hi> and I did but take what my Godliness gave me title to: I was bound in conscience to assert mine own, and the Godlies right. And then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution according to this Doctrine of Liberty of Conscience is at an end, and the Offender clear. If a man violently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains what is anothers by Law (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> actually do in the case of <hi>Tithes</hi>) he must not be punish'd, 'tis his Conscience he'll tell you. If one that is Prest for the necessary Service, and defence of his Country against a foreign Enemy, alledg 'tis against his Conscience to <hi>fight,</hi> he must be excused: If he say his Conscience forbids him to pay <hi>Taxes,</hi> that he is subject to none but <hi>King Jesus,</hi> and that all other Government is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian,</hi> his Purse must be free, and the King must lose <hi>his</hi> share; and then in a short time you may judg what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his Majesty's Revenue. If he pleads 'tis against his Conscience to <hi>bear Office</hi> in Church, or State, he must not by any means be troubled, his Neighbours must take the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and share the trouble among them. All these are just, and due Inferences, and we see by them whither this <hi>Liberty</hi> leads; nothing can be safe under it, no not our Lives. Men may think it a duty to murder us; <hi>Those that kill you, shall think they do God good service:</hi> And the <hi>Scotch</hi> Field-meeters actually hold, and teach in their Sermons, and their Books, that 'tis <hi>lawful,</hi> yea, <hi>heroical,</hi> to <hi>kill Bishops,</hi> or any <hi>ordained by them;</hi> and in consequence of that Doctrine, Ten of those Zealots barbarously murdered the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> Yea their Doctrine is, that 'tis <hi>lawful to kill any one that hath forsaken their Covenant,</hi> consequently the <hi>King</hi> himself, upon whom they forceably imposed it: And some that have the heroical Impulse, that is, a strong inclination to murder any of the sorts so sentenced by them, will think himself bound in Conscience to do it. And when he hath so done, must he be indemnified, and exempt from Punishment, because it was his Conscience; So it ought to be according to this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53237:16"/>
If it be said, that these are <hi>plain</hi> Cases, and men cannot plead Conscience for disobedience in such Instances. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that nothing is so plain, but men that have an humour, an interest, or will against it, may dispute, and doubt, and deny when they please; and the Instances alledg'd <hi>actually are</hi> among the <hi>Quakers, Fifth Monarchists, Scotch Presbyterians,</hi> and such like; and if this Principle be allowed, their number, and their pretences would quickly increase to the destruction of all Right, Property, and Government.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Liberty,</hi> some will say, is desired only in the <hi>Worship</hi> of God: And if <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> be the reason it should be had there, the same right of Conscience extends to all things of <hi>Morality,</hi> where Conscience binds as much, and is as sacred; and the bounding it in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> is <hi>Arbitratious,</hi> and without Reason; which men would quickly find, if they had once gain'd the first Point. And this Liberty is so destructive to all rights of Government, and Society, that none of those that now contend for it, will allow it when they have power. Ask the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>Spain, Germany,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> if they are for <hi>Toleration?</hi> Ask the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whether they would <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate?</hi> In <hi>their</hi> times nothing was so abominable, so <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,</hi> as <hi>accursed Toleration,</hi> (as they then call'd it) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so vehemently thundred against in their Pulpits every where. We may remember how they Persecuted, Sequestred, Imprison'd, ruined the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Divines for reading the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Liturgie,</hi> according to the <hi>Laws,</hi> their <hi>Oaths,</hi> their <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: Their</hi> plea of Conscience was nothing then; we know who denied the liberty of this Worship even to the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his own Chappel: They would not suffer in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities any of his own Chaplains to come to him, when he earnestly desired it. And what Liberty was given to all <hi>other.</hi> Sects by the <hi>Independents,</hi> in their day, because they <hi>could not help it,</hi> was denied to <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Prelacy</hi> (as they joyn'd them) because they <hi>could.</hi> And there is no Sect, were it in full power, that would give liberty to <hi>any other.</hi> Even <hi>now</hi> they <hi>deny</hi> it, and violate their own pretences of Liberty of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53237:17"/>
Conscience; they <hi>persecute Conformists</hi> with bitter hatred, and with railing, malicious accusations; they <hi>shoot</hi> the <hi>arrows of bitter Words,</hi> and endeavour to destroy their Reputations with <hi>Tongues set on fire of Hell:</hi> They give no quarter to <hi>their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> but persecute them, as far as they can: and persecution in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and in the <hi>Tongue,</hi> would be <hi>so</hi> in the <hi>Hands</hi> quickly, if they had power.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Toleration,</hi> are things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be talkt of, and pretended to by those that are <hi>under;</hi> but none like, or think it reasonable that are in <hi>Authority.</hi> 'Tis an instrument of mischief and dissettlement, to be court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those who would have Change; but no way desirable by such as would be quiet, and have the Government undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed. For it is not consistent with Publick peace and safety, without a <hi>standing Army: Conventicles</hi> being eternal <hi>Nurseries</hi> of <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi> If these Dissenters would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with <hi>Liberty,</hi> 'twere pretty well, and tolerable; but <hi>that</hi> will not do: whatever is the modesty and meekness of the pretence, they must have the Rule and Sway of all or they will never be satisfied.</p>
               <p>We see this actually in <hi>Scotland;</hi> there is no manner of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in worship there either of <hi>Liturgie,</hi> or <hi>Ceremony,</hi> but the worship in Churches is in the <hi>same</hi> way with that in their Conventicles; and yet they tumult, and rebel on pretence of Religion and Conscience. They would have their <hi>Covenant, Christs Government,</hi> as they call it, that is, the Dominion and supreme Rule themselves. Meer Indulgence they scorn, many of them think it unlawful to accept any from the King, and have upon that account made a separation from those of their own, that think they may: and thus in likelihood it would be in a little time here also, if Toleration under Limitations, were granted.</p>
               <p>So that whatever it may do else-where, where People are <hi>less concern'd</hi> for their <hi>Opinions; we</hi> certainly can never be safe with it, without an <hi>Army</hi> to secure the Publick from the <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous</hi> effects of it. And if ever <hi>this</hi> should obtain, <hi>Popery</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53237:17"/>
would get such an advantage by it, as God forbid it should ever have again in this Kingdom: And we know, <hi>Toleration</hi> was a principal thing aimed at, and endeavour'd (as appears by <hi>Coleman's</hi> Letters) in order to the introducing of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. So that upon the whole we see, that this is not our way. Let us then consider,</p>
               <p n="2">2. An <hi>Accommodation</hi> with Dissenters of less malignant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; What will that do? 'Tis certain, that with some of them no terms can be made; they will never <hi>unite,</hi> never be satisfied; to such 'tis in vain to yield, in order to a <hi>Consolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that is <hi>unpracticable.</hi> On the other hand, there are who make other professions, and are not so vastly distant from us, those declare for an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government, and a <hi>Publick Liturgie;</hi> with them one would think it should not be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to Unite. They pretend that some small Abatements, and Condescensions on our part, would do: And we grant that our <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are <hi>alterable;</hi> some actual alterations have been made since the return of the Government: If rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Alterations and Compliances would gain them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it might be worth while to endeavour it, this way. I speak doubtfully, because it is a thing of great and various Consideration; if sober men could be gain'd, and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble numbers of People with them, upon tolerable Terms, it would be a strengthening to our Church, and very desirable. But it should be weigh'd too, whether any considerable men, and numbers would in likelihood come in? Whether the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be reconciled to the Church with them? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would not flie from them, when they are <hi>ours,</hi> as they do from our own men, and betake themselves to those that still stand out in defiance? And whether the Persons we admit would not with more authority and advantage, propagate <hi>ill Principles</hi> among our People whom they they are allow'd to teach? Some of those that by straining, have got in, have done so; Conform'd by halves, and in a way that shews their dislike of what they do; that 'tis Force, and not Choice; and have made it their business, if not directly to oppose the Church,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53237:18"/>
yet cunningly by way of Insinuation, they have fomented and kept alive corrupt Doctrines. These things may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd on both sides, by those that are concern'd to open the Gate wider, or to keep it as it is.</p>
               <p>If our Governors should think fit to <hi>widen,</hi> and to yield in some things, it would be a Christian compliance on their part, and perhaps a kindness to our <hi>Episcopal</hi> Clergy, whose Obligation to some Innocent, but <hi>offensive</hi> usages disaffects many mistaken, well-meaning People to them, robs their Churches of their Company, and <hi>them</hi> of their Kindnesses, and Incouragements; renders their Lives full of difficulties, and disputes, enforceth them to eternal Contests for their Dues, and renders their Ministry, and profitable Pains, in many places, ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. The Cure of these Evils, and the settling the Church upon <hi>larger,</hi> and so a <hi>safer</hi> Foundation (as to Interest I mean) are possibly good Reasons, why the Matter should be now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into serious and deliberate Consideration. And the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> which the <hi>Dissenters</hi> also so much apprehend, should methinks render them more apt to comply, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept of moderate terms in order to our <hi>Conjunction</hi> against the common Danger. This I believe <hi>some</hi> are, and with <hi>them</hi> there is possibility of <hi>Vniting,</hi> and likely there may be good effects of it: But <hi>others</hi> of them, are strangely height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Dangers, and stand now upon more distant terms than ever, they expect that the World will shortly be their own, and therefore shew themselves more inveterate against the Church and us, than ever. Certainly these do not <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> nor fear <hi>Popery</hi> as they pretend; they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amuse, and affright the People with them, thereby to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their own designs: otherwise, they would, <hi>now</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, supplicate the Government for <hi>Vnion,</hi> and sacrifice <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, Interest</hi> of a Party, and the <hi>Pride</hi> of Separation, to the <hi>Protestant</hi> advantage, and safety: They would be more yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and compliant, and desirous to cement, and joyn with us for the common Benefit, and Security. If the Government should think fit to consider those that are so, and to make any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53237:18"/>
                  <hi>small, alterations</hi> in their favour, it would be <hi>Charitable,</hi> and <hi>Candid,</hi> and possibly for the Publick Interest. But whether <hi>fit,</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> 'tis not for private Persons to determine, nor very decent uncall'd, to offer their opinion, when that Point is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, I think.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Constitution</hi> should be made <hi>firm</hi> (whether with any alterations, or without them) and Laws put in <hi>punctual, vigorous Execution.</hi> Till that is done, all will signifie nothing. The <hi>Church</hi> hath lost all through <hi>Remissness,</hi> and <hi>Non-execution</hi> of <hi>Laws:</hi> and by the contrary course things must be reduced, or they never will. To what purpose are <hi>Parliaments</hi> so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to prepare good Laws, if the Officers who are intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Execution,</hi> neglect that Duty, and let them lie <hi>Dead.</hi> This brings Laws and Government into Contempt, and 'twere much better the Laws were never <hi>made:</hi> By <hi>them</hi> the Dissenters are <hi>provoked,</hi> and being not <hi>restrain'd</hi> by the exacting of the <hi>Penalties,</hi> they are fiercer, and more bent upon their own ways, than they would be otherwise.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, the <hi>execution of Laws</hi> of <hi>Conformity,</hi> raiseth the cry of <hi>Persecution:</hi> and will not that be Scandalous? Not so <hi>scandalous</hi> as <hi>Anarchy, Schism,</hi> and eternal <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Confusions,</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> Better that the unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly should clamour, than that the regular should groan, and all should be undone: Better the <hi>Schismatical</hi> should be justly punish'd by the Government (let them call that Punishment what they will) than that the Government should really, and for ever be <hi>Persecuted</hi> by <hi>them.</hi> If Penalties must be suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when ever the guilty clamour, and call things by wrong names, then farewel all Government. Our <hi>Governours</hi> have <hi>Consciences</hi> too as well as private Persons, and they ought to act according to <hi>theirs,</hi> for the publick Benefit, and Safety, let it be never so much against the grain of those that will for ever be discontented.</p>
               <p>But it may yet be Objected, that <hi>punishment</hi> in such Cases, <hi>will do no good:</hi> Men will not be <hi>beaten into Religion, nor out of any.</hi> And it is true, that <hi>some</hi> will never be reduced, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53237:19"/>
reclaim'd; but then, their just Sufferings will be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to others. The greatest part of those that now scatter, and run about, do it out of <hi>Humour,</hi> or <hi>Phancy,</hi> or <hi>Faction,</hi> or <hi>Interest,</hi> or <hi>Animosity,</hi> or desire of being accounted Godly, not really out of Conscience, and conviction of Duty; and <hi>these,</hi> the Penalties duly exacted would bring back into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and when they have been used to <hi>that,</hi> and strict Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they may really grow wiser, and be reconciled through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the Church, and its Constitutions, against which they were before so prejudiced; for hereby they will be forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to soberer Company, and under more <hi>sound,</hi> and <hi>sober</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Our Ministers then will have the opportunity of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their abused, and misguided understandings, of disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Fallacies, and Mistakes they have been abused by, and of setting their Consciences right in those Matters. While People run on without controul in their own ways, they will not <hi>hearken,</hi> they will not <hi>consider</hi> any thing that is offer'd to them: Like the <hi>wild Ass, they snuff up the Wind, who can turn them away?</hi> But when their Opinions, and Ways bring them trouble, when they are chastised for them, they are then more disposed to attend, and weigh the Reasons offer'd without the usual <hi>Partiality,</hi> and <hi>Prejudice.</hi> And thus <hi>punishments</hi> are <hi>instruments</hi> of real <hi>Reformation,</hi> and amendment. The truth of this we have in part seen: For while the Act made by the late <hi>Parliament</hi> against <hi>Conventicles</hi> was pretty briskly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, our Churches began to be fill'd, and the People were from all quarters coming in; and had that course been follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it was begun, it would have done the business, in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood we had been settled, and not exposed to such <hi>dangers</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> as we always shall be, while the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>unfixt:</hi> and so by the Grace of God we might yet be, if this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod were retriev'd. But then, the work must be done with a <hi>steady</hi> hand, and <hi>firm</hi> resolution, <hi>constantly, universally;</hi> that all may see we are in earnest for Establishment. Such a course I am persuaded would yet bring us into <hi>Regularity,</hi> and <hi>External Vnion,</hi> which would give Beauty, and Strength
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53237:19"/>
to our Church, gratifie all good Men, and disappoint the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of our <hi>Popish,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Enemies.</p>

Religion</hi> requires, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves our highest Affections, and most diligent Endeavours. It is <hi>Zeal; so</hi> in the <hi>truth</hi> of things, and in the general <hi>sense</hi> of Mankind: So that <hi>where</hi> Zeal is <hi>not,</hi> People will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Religion is <hi>there:</hi> The Zealous still lead them, and have their company; and when ever it happens, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of a Church, or Way, are cold, dead, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd either to Religion in general, or to their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Profession; <hi>that</hi> Church, and Profession is like to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by those of warm affections, who will betake them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where they may have company in their Zeal, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for it.</p>
               <p>Here now hath been a principal occasion that many have fall'n off from <hi>our Church,</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Superstition. Blessed be God, we have an excellent constitution of Religion refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to <hi>Primitive, Apostolick</hi> Doctrine, and Usage: But the misery is, <hi>We,</hi> the Members, have by our <hi>Carelessness, Indifferency, Irreligion,</hi> brought disgrace upon it, and laid it low in the opinion of many zealous, and devout People; for the most will judg of <hi>Religions</hi> by the <hi>Professors</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>difsenting</hi> Adversaries were, and are very <hi>zealous,</hi> they have a <hi>Zeal for God, though not according to Knowledg;</hi> that heat hath been very wild, and very mischievous; and by the ill conduct, and bad effects of it, we are prejudiced (many of us) against the very <hi>Word,</hi> and against the <hi>Thing:</hi> So
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53237:20"/>
that we run (as 'tis usual) into a quite contrary <hi>extream,</hi> and are afraid of any thing that looks like warm Concernment, in, or for Religion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sects</hi> are earnest in their <hi>Prayers, so</hi> to Folly, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance: On the contrary how <hi>indifferent</hi> are many of us to the <hi>Service</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> those <hi>sober, grave Devotions,</hi> which formerly, when they were supprest, we disputed so earnestly for: How little have they of our Company? How <hi>undevoutly</hi> do we demean our selves at them? How <hi>slightly</hi> do many talk of <hi>saying Prayers,</hi> and being <hi>Devout;</hi> as if they were things to be jested with? How <hi>little Reputation</hi> doth Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on give any one among us? How <hi>little Shame</hi> or Disrepute the contrary?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dissenters</hi> are <hi>Superstitious,</hi> as to hearing <hi>Sermons;</hi> are <hi>swift</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> place almost all Religion in it: Whereas too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us, <hi>reckon little</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> perform it as an <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,</hi> hear it as an <hi>Entertainment,</hi> (at the best) divers make nothing of it; at least, are without any <hi>affectionate</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>holy Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which the <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> impale within their <hi>select</hi> numbers, but is freely permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, how <hi>many slight?</hi> how <hi>few</hi> attend? The greatest part neglect it quite, and will not by the most constant, and earnest importunities of their <hi>Ministers,</hi> be persuaded to do <hi>thus much,</hi> to testifie their being Christians.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sects</hi> are zealous contenders for their dear <hi>Models</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Discipline:</hi> But how little do we (most of us) heed the <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church? We care not how it is affronted, or trampled on, yea, we are ready upon every occasion, and without any sometimes, to flie in the Face of the Governours of it, and to tear them, our selves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Separatists</hi> are zealous to Superstition, in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the <hi>Lords Day:</hi> Some of us in opposition, reckon not much of it: most I doubt are too negligent, and remiss here. In nothing doth the humour of Opposition appear more
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53237:20"/>
among us than in <hi>this.</hi> We hold <hi>sacredness</hi> of places on the account of <hi>dedication</hi> to religious uses, and respect due to them; for this the <hi>Sects</hi> despise us as <hi>Superstitious: They</hi> on the other side hold <hi>Sacredness,</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Separation of <hi>some</hi> time, the <hi>Lords Day</hi> (at least;) this Doctrine and the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Practice, some among us, impeach as Superstitious, and heed not that Day as they ought. Frequent Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are made to inforce its <hi>Religious</hi> observation, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain abuses, and prophanations of it, which yet are the same as before, and Magistrates that should execute Laws, in many places, take little or no notice of them.</p>
               <p>Now the consequence of this unhappy <hi>Coldness,</hi> and <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,</hi> must be, that many People that are affectionate to Religion must needs turn away, and joyn themselves either to the <hi>Conventicles</hi> on the one hand, or the <hi>Papists</hi> on the other, both which have great appearance of Zeal and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and many, no doubt, have gone off to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church upon this only score, being scandaliz'd by our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and indevotion. This was the temper of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and the <hi>Remedy</hi> prescribed, to prevent Ruine, was <hi>Zeal,</hi> Rev. 3. 19. And except we learn, and practise <hi>this,</hi> our Church in he necessary consequence, must fall to nothing.</p>
               <p>Our Enemies on both sides are diligent, studious, zealous, and if we continue negligent, and careless, their designs to destroy us at length, must of necessity succeed; and here is one of the most considerable Causes they have succeeded so far already. The way of Cure and Prevention, is <hi>sober, active Zeal,</hi> both in Clergy, and People.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Church; the <hi>Ministers'</hi> ought to read them with more <hi>affection,</hi> and <hi>external</hi> Devotion; the People to attend them with more diligence, and constancy; and their attendance ought to be more humble and devout. There was never more reason for our constancy, and zeal in this Duty than now: Prayers are always seasonable, but most necessary in times of publick Difficulties, and Dangers. The rude <hi>Mariners</hi> betook them to their <hi>Prayers</hi> in the <hi>Storm,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53237:21"/>JOB. 1. <hi>In their affliction they will seek me early,</hi> Hos. 5. 15. If we do not <hi>so</hi> in <hi>ours,</hi> it will be a sad symptom.</p>
               <p>We should further express our <hi>Zeal</hi> in being constant, and unanimous in attending on the <hi>holy Sacrament;</hi> our neglect of this is shameful, and intolerable: Nothing hath given so great a blow to our Religion, it hath made some believe, and say we have <hi>none.</hi> We are earnestly invited by our Lord, and his Messengers; How many earnest Sermons, how many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Books, press this Duty upon us, and give us direction in it? And yet we are little moved. We come for fear of the <hi>Temporal</hi> Penalties, when we have entred into <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>Trusts,</hi> but the Authority of our Supreme Legislator, and the eternal Penalties he threatens, prevail little. This is scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Neglect: And we declare to all the World, that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath no power upon us, when it cannot obtain thus much from us. Of this carelesness we ought to repent deeply, to reform speedily, <hi>Solemn</hi> appearance at the Lord's Table would give us the face of a Church, and make our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on look like something; the contrary exposeth it to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Zeal</hi> also should ingage us to study the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> more, to search into the grounds of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Discipline, that we may be acquainted with their Antiquity, Reasonableness, and Piety, and thereby inabled to stop the mouths of Gain-sayers, and to contend <hi>intelligently</hi> for our Profession, and Practice.</p>
               <p>The Lord's Day should be more diligently, and religiously observed by us. This is the publick, solemn time for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Devotion; so it is acknowledg'd, whether it be of <hi>Divine,</hi> or only of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Institution, and therefore should be reverenc'd by those of each Opinion, and kept as a Day separate from other days, and other uses: Places we think and say ought to be so, <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>Altars;</hi> and with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we believe this: There is at least the same reason for Times, some <hi>others</hi> we allow; and <hi>this</hi> also in <hi>Doctrine;</hi> let not the zeal of our Adversaries in this instance abate, and quench
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53237:21"/>
ours. The reverence and all the great interests of Religion are in great part maintain'd, and kept alive by the due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this Day. Let us express our Zeal, and Devotion here also: To devote one day of seven to God, and his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Service, should not, methinks, be grievous to us: In this there is no <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> nothing but what is very agreeable to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which we should streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and do honour to by such practice: This Zeal is honest, laudable, necessary, and 'tis <hi>popular:</hi> And in Christian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we should do, and study all lawful things that tend to the inlargement of the Church, and the edification of its Members.</p>
               <p>There is yet another Instance, in which <hi>Zeal</hi> should be more exprest; which I have reserv'd for the last, because I shall take the liberty to inlarge on it: It is concerning <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>hearing Sermons.</hi> I pretend not to teach, but shall with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to better Judgments deliver my opinion, which is, That in <hi>Preaching,</hi> Ministers should chiefly, mostly, treat on <hi>plain, practical, awakening</hi> Subjects, speaking of them gravely, and affectionately, without Vanity, or Affectation, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign still to do good, and to make themselves, and their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers better. Such I think should be the matter, and such the measure of Preaching: And 'twould do no hurt if our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers generally took more Zeal into their Pulpits than is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with us, Zeal without Folly: Methinks our Divines should not suffer others to out-do them here; much-less should they quit this to them: The too usual want of this Zeal here, is a principal cause of our Mischiefs: Some are almost ashamed, or affraid to be zealous in their Pulpits. The preaching of too many is <hi>Declamatory,</hi> they deliver not <hi>Theological</hi> Sermons, not such as are apt to instruct, or edifie, but seem to design the gratifying vain Phancies, and the pleasing of wanton Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: They aim at <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>fine Sayings</hi> to gain applause among the injudicious by silly Affectations, and when they are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi> they have their end, and the work is done: They move no devout Affections, seem not to design it: Their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53237:22"/>
are lifeless, dull Harangues, full of studied Vanity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Piety, or as much as good Sense. Hence many Religious are scandaliz'd, and they nauseate such Preaching, and are tempted by it to run away into Corners and Sects; and here is one great ground of Separation, and loss of our People.</p>
               <p>Now one, and a chief occasion that this Humour hath so much obtain'd, is, that many of the <hi>Laity,</hi> and such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend much to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are for the <hi>formal, unedifying, wittilizing</hi> Way; they have not the patience to hear a Grave, Serious, Affectionate Sermon that plays no Tricks: But will be ready (some of them) to Stigmatize, and rail against such a Preacher as a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> though he be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously opposite to their <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Ways,</hi> and most hearty and affectionate to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> These would have none (it seems) but <hi>affected, insipid, sensless Fops</hi> of it: They are willing to give away all, or most of the men of Reason, and Religious Zeal to the Sects; take them who will, they will not own them: These men have done the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the great Mischief, and have raised most of the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and Opposition against it.</p>
               <p>No Church in the World hath <hi>better</hi> Preachers than <hi>this,</hi> and there are not upon Earth <hi>worse</hi> than those I have last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd; or rather they are <hi>none</hi> at all; what they do is <hi>not Preaching;</hi> it is throughout doing another thing, <hi>Declaiming, silly, childish speech-making; what you will;</hi> there is scarce any other abuse of Speech bad enough to resemble it to. I cannot speak of it with too much Contempt. Such Preachers are <hi>Prophaners</hi> of sacred things, contemptible even in the things they aim at; their <hi>Oratory,</hi> their <hi>Wit</hi> is <hi>so;</hi> neither true; both <hi>boyish, ridiculous, despicable</hi> to men of Sense. And yet (as I intimated) some that pretend Zeal for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> that is, the <hi>Name,</hi> the <hi>Shadow,</hi> applaud those <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers, Players;</hi> and thereby tempt young men to take up after their Way; and the affecting such stuff hath spread far to the Scandal of the Church, and the discountenancing the <hi>serious, earnest, effectionate</hi> Method, which is so much out of fashion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53237:22"/>
among this sort, that they cannot endure that the Preacher should as much as seem to be in earnest: They will not allow him to <hi>speak warmly,</hi> to <hi>move</hi> in the Pulpit, or to preach <hi>off his Notes.</hi> All must be <hi>dead, cold</hi> Form to please them. If this humour be not supprest, and Preachers, generally as all the Wise already do) don't take another course, the Church will never recover its just Interest, and Esteem. Preaching must be more <hi>Serious, Affectionate, Zealous,</hi> this is in the power of every Preacher; to be <hi>Profound,</hi> and <hi>Learned,</hi> is <hi>not so.</hi> In the many poor insufficient Livings we may not expect men of great, and deep Knowledg, and where such are, <hi>this Qualification</hi> doth not recommend them to the generality of the People, their <hi>Zeal</hi> doth much more: In this the meanest Preachers may abound, and by this they will <hi>affect</hi> their Hearers, though <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>shews</hi> of <hi>Learning</hi> are wanting. <hi>These,</hi> as things are, the <hi>least able</hi> endeavour to ostentate, and such <hi>most;</hi> but the highest they can attain to, in it, is but <hi>Pedantism,</hi> and <hi>Childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which are despised by the Judicious, and not understood by the rest; so that they lose their end, and the end of Preaching more; they do no good, get no hold on the People; whereas did even <hi>these</hi> but aim at instructing the Ignorant seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and the exciting all to their Duty earnestly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly, it would atone for their imperfections with the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and have good effect upon the rest.</p>
               <p>I have spoken freely in this Matter, under a great sense of this Evil, and I hope I shall not be understood to reflect upon any worthy men of our Church, I design'd only to express my just indignation against <hi>wanton Witlings</hi> (Preachers, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) whose number, thanks be to God, lessens daily, and among all Intelligent Church-men this way is exploded, and every where despised.</p>
               <p>There is another Error in defect, in reference to Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is of those that reckon it an <hi>indifferent,</hi> a meerly <hi>humane</hi> thing; when as it is certainly of <hi>Divine</hi> appointment, to continue to the end of the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. We ought in the sense of this, to be more frequent, and heedful, in our
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53237:23"/>
attendance on Sermons than many are; and not shut out <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Hearing,</hi> under pretence of Zeal for the <hi>Church-Prayers.</hi> Those that pretend one Duty to the prejudice of another, do really care for neither. Our Zeal should be <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</hi> and respect every duty proportionably to the Dignity, and necessity of it. And if generally we had been <hi>so disposed,</hi> thus <hi>Zealous</hi> as we ought, many of the People that now run away from our Communion, had still been <hi>ours.</hi> They like <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and other Sects, because the Preachers are <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi> and make shew of much Zeal (as the People also do) not because they are for such, or such a <hi>Church-Government,</hi> for this, or that Opinion: The <hi>multitude</hi> understand not these things, follow them not for <hi>that</hi> Cause, but for the opinion they have of their being <hi>Godly,</hi> and <hi>Zealous.</hi> And we may be, we should be as zealous for Religion, in the <hi>true</hi> Way, as they seem to be in the <hi>wrong:</hi> Our <hi>Church</hi> permits, requires this from us. We ought not to distinguish our selves from them by slighting, and avoiding the lawful expressions of Christian Zeal; the Interest of our Church doth not require that, but the contrary. If our <hi>Zeal</hi> were more proportion'd to the <hi>goodness</hi> of our Cause, that goodness of our Cause would be more known, and acknowledg'd, and our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would more easily be reconcil'd unto it.</p>

Where there were Atheists in <hi>former</hi> days, they hid their Heads, and were afraid, ashamed, to appear, but in <hi>these</hi> they glory, they triumph: In no Age did they ever dare so openly, in no <hi>Christian,</hi> in no <hi>Heathen</hi> Country. How common is it for lewd men, yea, for <hi>green, untaught Youth,</hi> to question, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, cavil at the most sacred Articles of Religion: To do this in <hi>Taverns, Coffee-Houses,</hi> in all Companies, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Ministers of Religion, before <hi>them</hi> to choose? How will the young <hi>Witlings</hi> pride, and plume themselves? How will they brisle, and perk up, when they talk with those of the sacred function against Religion? How do they <hi>despise</hi> their <hi>Reasons,</hi> because (forsooth) the thing they defend is their <hi>Interest;</hi> and vaunt their own arguments as <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> when they are scarce <hi>Sense?</hi> It would turn a man's Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to see the insolence and folly of these bold Youngsters, which are a scandal to the Reformation, and give occasion to our <hi>Roman</hi> Enemies to brand us all as <hi>Atheists,</hi> or not far from being <hi>such;</hi> whereby they are hardned in their Way, and have great advantage to win more to them.</p>
               <p>Particularly at this time these <hi>Infidels</hi> do <hi>Popery</hi> great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. They are <hi>violent</hi> in their Out-crys against it, violent to Fury; none so fierce as they; of which there can be no Reason, but either the consideration of their <hi>Lands,</hi> or <hi>this,</hi> that <hi>Popery</hi> is a <hi>Religion,</hi> (at least it pretends unto it.) Now by this their clamour and fierceness, by their appearing so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, so in the Front as it were, against <hi>Popery,</hi> they give occasion to the <hi>Papists</hi> to think, and say that our Zeal is an <hi>Heathen Persecution</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that they are so malign'd, so opposed by us, because they profess Religion, and are not Infidels: And it may suggest to others that are yet indifferent, that certainly there is some <hi>great good</hi> in Popery, that <hi>such</hi> run upon it with such violence; and 'tis natural to men to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that, which the Wicked, and those whose ways they have cause to abhor, dislike, abominate, and flie out against.</p>
               <p>So that, <hi>these</hi> harden <hi>Papists,</hi> and recommend their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they render it less odious to <hi>some,</hi> because 'tis <hi>so</hi> to them.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53237:24"/>
                  <hi>What evil have I done?</hi> said the surprized Philosopher, that <hi>these</hi> (the <hi>Multitude</hi>) applaud me. On the contrary, what good hath Popery done, that vile Atheists rage so against it? 'Tis a shame to be commended by some, and a praise to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and persecuted by others. See, saith the <hi>Papist,</hi> who are furious against our Religion! They are the same that bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheme against God, dispute his Being, burlesque his Word, deride his Son, despise, revile, trample on his Ministers, of all sorts; <hi>these</hi> Protestants lead you; <hi>these</hi> you <hi>triumphantly</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; <hi>these</hi> you voice up to be <hi>Patriots; these</hi> are they that shew most violent hate, and rage against us. Whoever gives occasion to such upbraidings as these, doth without doubt, credit and promote Popery; and this the forwardness of many Atheists hath done, and doth daily.</p>
               <p>Now for Cure of these Mischiefs, we should every where disown, declare against the <hi>wildness</hi> of these <hi>Furies;</hi> despise their pretended Zeal; and help, shame, and reprove their <hi>Hypocrisie;</hi> suffer them not to <hi>name</hi> Protestant Religion; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their company; discountenance all they say, and all they do: Brand, hoot at them, let the World <hi>see,</hi> let our <hi>Enemies see,</hi> they are <hi>not of us,</hi> that we have nothing to do with them. Thus we should do in <hi>Charity</hi> to them, (publick shame and reproach may do them more good than any other Method) this we owe to our selves, and to the honour of Religion, to vindicate it from the Scandal, and Reproach these vile men bring upon it. If ever there was a time for Zeal against <hi>Atheists, Debauchees, Buffoons,</hi> it is now. It is always season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, now most so: <hi>These</hi> are our principal Enemies, who whenever time serves will be as fierce against <hi>us</hi> (all sorts and professions of Religion) as they are now against the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</hi> These are the common Foes, enemies not only to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but to all <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Societies;</hi> to <hi>Mankind:</hi> and should be used as such. <hi>These</hi> permitted, cherish'd, will bring God's Judgments upon us, and possibly <hi>Popery</hi> as one. Let us then have no fellowship with those men: And if any such should have crept into the <hi>Parliament,</hi> it were infinitly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53237:24"/>
to be wish'd that the Zeal of that Assembly would purge them out, like dross, fit for no use, or rather, as what is most <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> and <hi>destructive.</hi> They have done so by the <hi>Papists;</hi> all good men desire, and pray they may do the same by <hi>these.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any thing <hi>unqualifies</hi> for that service, one would think <hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> should. What blessing can be expected on publick Councils, when <hi>these</hi> are mingled. Where <hi>they</hi> are they will disturb all, break all, make all ineffectual. We are not to look on the Dangers we apprehend as proceeding only from common, natural Causes; no, <hi>The Hand of God is in them;</hi> they are <hi>His</hi> Judgments, as for our other Crying Sins, so particularly for reigning <hi>Atheism,</hi> and contempt of Religion: And if we expect help, and safety from the objects of our Fears, we must endeavour to make our peace with Him, by repenting of all our Sins, and particularly by expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our Zeal against these <hi>greatest, worst,</hi> the root of all the rest. And it is vehemently to be desired, that our <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> would begin here, lay the <hi>Ax</hi> at the <hi>root,</hi> by effectual Laws crush this <hi>daring, comprehensive</hi> Impiety, and make it <hi>Capital;</hi> as of all Crimes it chiefly deserves. Let us first settle <hi>this Point,</hi> that we are to have <hi>some Religion,</hi> and then make what further provision we can against a <hi>corrupt,</hi> a <hi>bad one.</hi> Let us vindicate, and assert the Honour of God, and our Common Saviour, and then we may expect the Divine Blessing and Assistance in the rest.</p>
               <p>But besides the <hi>fierceness</hi> of the <hi>Atheists,</hi> there is an <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, mistaken Zeal of others, that is a great occasion of our Dangers. Honest, intelligent</hi> Zeal is necessary for our Security and Settlement, but the excesses of <hi>blind, ungovern'd</hi> Rage are most mischievous, and destructive; I shall note some unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Instances of it that belong to our <hi>present state,</hi> and render it very dangerous, <hi>viz. Such</hi> as have relation to our <hi>oppositions</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi> That the Nation is so awakened, so unanimous in detesting the false worship and ways of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is matter of rejoycing, and acknowledgment: But we ought to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53237:25"/>
have care, that our Zeal do not transport us to <hi>Extreams.</hi> I shall consider one great Instance, which is, <hi>Mens multiplying the numbers of Papists beyond all bounds of truth.</hi> I would by no means lessen any just apprehensions of our Dangers, or say any thing that might tend to the remitting of due Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Diligence: I know the greatest Prudence, and Care is needful: But our Fears may be extream, and unreasonable, and great dangers may arise from those, as <hi>great</hi> from our <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnifying</hi> our Perils, as from <hi>not duly apprehending</hi> them: And this way the things we fear have been incouraged, and promoted. People are apt to talk of the numbers, and strength of <hi>Papists,</hi> and no doubt design them not any service by it; but really, <hi>they</hi> are thereby incouraged, they thence flatter their vain hopes, thence they are animated to Plot, to Attempt, being acknowledg'd so numerous, so powerful; hearing that they have so many open Friends, and so many others that will be ready to joyn with them when there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and being apt to believe what they have so much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to desire, they are pufft with vain confidence, and are full of restless contrivances to effect that, which they are made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is so feisable. Whereas did they know how <hi>inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> their real numbers are, they must certainly sit down, and be quiet. They would then understand that their business is unpracticable; private Persons would be discouraged, and if there should succeed a Prince of their Religion, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, he also would despond, and never think of attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a thing, humanely speaking, so impossible; a thing, the endeavouring which would certainly tear all in pieces, <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Government,</hi> and all: And what the late Designs have done towards it we all sadly see. Therefore, that they may see their designs are <hi>Madness,</hi> and that they ought to despair of ever succeeding by their strength, we should let them know that they have abused themselves, and others have abused them, by false Musters.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1676/7. Orders came from the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> to the several <hi>Bishops,</hi> and from them to the respective <hi>Ministers,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:53237:25"/>
and Church-wardens in the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to inquire carefully, and to return an account of the distinct numbers of <hi>Conformists, Protestant Non-conformists,</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parishes, <hi>viz.</hi> Of all such men, and women that were of age to Communicate. I have by me the return from the whole Province, which contains all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> excepting only what belongs to four of the twenty five Bishopricks. The number of <hi>Papists</hi> there returned, was but Eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, eight hundred, and seventy, men and women, old and young. Now though in this account, <hi>Conformists,</hi> and other <hi>Non-conformists</hi> were not so distinctly, could not so justly be reckon'd, yet for the <hi>Papists,</hi> they being so few in each Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and so notoriously distinguish'd as generally they are, the <hi>Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Church-wardens</hi> could easily give account of <hi>them;</hi> and there is no reason to suspect their <hi>partiality,</hi> We hear, I know, that in <hi>London</hi> alone, and in some particular Parishes, of that, and the neighbour City, there are vastly greater numbers. But <hi>within the Walls,</hi> they are known to be very few, <hi>comparatively</hi> scarce any such. In the <hi>Suburbs</hi> they are said to be <hi>numerous,</hi> (still the <hi>great</hi> numbers are in places <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,</hi> or where inquiry <hi>cannot be well made.</hi>) In St. <hi>Martins</hi> alone, I have heard of <hi>twenty,</hi> or <hi>thirty</hi> thousand; but the Account was taken there, and as exact a one as could be; and I am assured by some that <hi>should</hi> know, and had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to misinform me, that the number returned upon the most careful scrutiny, was about six hundred: Of <hi>Lodgers</hi> there might be more, but <hi>they</hi> are supposed to be accounted else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in the several Parishes to what they belong. I have found the like fallings short of the reputed number in divers other noted places. In one City talkt of for <hi>Papists,</hi> as if half the Inhabitants were such, I am assured there are not twenty, men and women: In another large and populous one, a person of Quality living in it, told me, there were at least six hundred; but when the inquiry was made by the Ministers, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens of each Parish, the number was not found to be six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And 'tis very probable such a disproportion would be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53237:26"/>
met between the <hi>reputed,</hi> and <hi>real</hi> numbers in all other places, if scrutiny were made. In all the West, and most populous part of <hi>England</hi> they are very inconsiderable: I hear frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Inhabitants of those Places, that in <hi>Bristol</hi> (the second or third City of <hi>England</hi>) there is but <hi>one;</hi> and in the City of <hi>Glocester one,</hi> more, or two at most; in the other great Towns, and Cities Westward, scarce any; and those that are in the Counties at large, are extremely <hi>few,</hi> thinly scattered, here <hi>one,</hi> and at the distance of many Miles, it may be, <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Some few decaied Gentry, and here and there an inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Country-man, or Tradesman, very few of Note, or Riches, of either sort. And if an exact account were taken of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and condition, from <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Mount</hi> in <hi>Cornwal, Westward,</hi> the inconsiderableness of both would exceedingly surprise us: And I am very confident, that of all sorts of men, differing from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in the Kingdom, the <hi>Papists</hi> are the fewest; and those that are, are so scattered, and live so distantly from each other, that 'tis really very little they are capable of doing, in opposition to the rest of the Nation; and the less, because of the great jealousie and hatred, that all universally have conceiv'd of, and against them.</p>
               <p>We hear of vast numbers in the <hi>North;</hi> and there are more, no doubt, in <hi>those</hi> parts, than in the <hi>Western,</hi> but I believe they are much fewer than we hear, and no way able by their numbers, to make any kind of Ballance for the exceeding <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion</hi> in the <hi>West.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, People are mightily given, and generally so, to <hi>multiply</hi> the number of <hi>Papists,</hi> and they do it in common talk, at least ten-fold. Designs have been, and I doubt, are still carrying on, which this pretence serves: A chief thing to be done in order to publick Mischief, is to affright the People with the number and strength of <hi>Papists:</hi> And I believe if there were but ten of that sort in the Nation, it would be the same thing. God forbid I should diminish the real force of our Enemies, or endeavour to render us secure in Dangers; The <hi>malignity</hi> and principles of <hi>Papists,</hi> their unwearied Zeal,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53237:26"/>
and diligence to overthrow our Religion, I very well know, and thank God that the whole Kingdom is awakned to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend these; but I think, we shall incourage <hi>them,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten <hi>our selves,</hi> if we <hi>over magnifie</hi> their strength, and thereby give occasion to <hi>other Plots</hi> of as <hi>dangerous</hi> a nature as <hi>theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to all this, I know some will say, that though their numbers here are not considerable, yet they are very formidable upon the account of <hi>foreign Friends and Correspondents:</hi> And our danger from <hi>Abroad</hi> is really great; but not much the <hi>more</hi> on the account of Domestick Papists, whatever they vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persuaded themselves: If our Neighbours should invade us, <hi>They,</hi> if they should be so disposed, could do them but little service; we know their assistance in the late Wars where they joyn'd, was not very considerable; And now, their numbers being so <hi>small,</hi> and they being so <hi>disperst,</hi> and <hi>mingled;</hi> they being so <hi>hated,</hi> and every Neighbour having so watchful, and concern'd an Eye upon every one of them, they could scarce signifie any thing; yea, it may be thought, considering how things are, that in such a Case, the fury of the People would offer them immediate Violence, and prevent their doing that little they otherwise might.</p>
               <p>All this, Sir, I say to shew, how little sense, and reason there is in the <hi>Popish Plots,</hi> and how much better it would be for them for ever to desist, and to sit down in desperation of success. And if a <hi>Popish Prince</hi> should come to rule over us, if he knew the real state of things, and the weakness of that party, he would never think of reducing the Nation to that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which cannot be effected but by Miracle. The very <hi>attempt</hi> would hazard the ruining <hi>him,</hi> and the <hi>Monarchy</hi> for ever. The meer jealousie (though most groundless) ruined one <hi>Protestant King,</hi> and we see in what danger it hath put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And if things are thus (as I am confident upon examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and trial you will find) let us take care that we <hi>promote</hi> not <hi>Popery</hi> by strengthening the hopes of <hi>Papists;</hi> let us not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53237:27"/>
them by false accounts of their numbers, and their strength, and thereby inspire them with courage to Plot against us. The better way I think would be, to let them see we <hi>despise</hi> them; and to know how <hi>phantastical</hi> and <hi>sensless</hi> their hopes are: This would really disable them, break their Courage, and in likelihood put an end to their audacious Projects, from which we have such frequent disturbance.</p>
               <p>But we <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are told, they have many <hi>secret</hi> friends, <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>their hearts,</hi> who will be ready to help them, when time shall serve: By this way the number of <hi>Papists</hi> is supplied, and those that have ends to serve by it, may make it what they please. I shall not deny, but that they may have some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand secret favourers, or that there may be divers such in <hi>Masquerade</hi> among the Sects: But is it likely, that those, whose caution and interest, hath kept them all this while from appearing, or declaring in times when they safely might have done it, should venture all against the excited rage of the whole Nation, in so desperate a Cause? Or, if the number of these were added, would it make any proportion to the open declared Enemies of that Religion? If they should lean upon such hopes, I doubt not but they would prove broken Reeds that would fail, and suffer them to sink to the Ground.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but take notice of an intolerable Practice, extremely prejudicial to the Protestant Interest, and Religion, every where now prevailing, it is, the <hi>Stigmatizing</hi> every one that we dislike, or hate, or design against, with the brand of Popery. If a Gentleman stands to be a Member of Parliament, that is not a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> he is in <hi>their</hi> Mouths presently a <hi>Papist.</hi> If one speak but an earnest word for the Government, and establishments either in Church, or State that crosseth, and stops some mens contrary violence, he is a <hi>Papist.</hi> If a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster preach up the Peaceable, healing Christian Spirit, and Principles in opposition to Madness, and wild Rage, he is a <hi>Papist.</hi> If a man doth not believe every seditious lye that is publish'd in the <hi>Domestick Intelligence,</hi> and Coffee-house Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he is a <hi>Papist.</hi> So that I am afraid the time is near (if
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53237:27"/>
seasonable stop be not put to this Rage) when every Friend to the King, and Church, shall be a <hi>Papist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there are not <hi>real</hi> Papists in the Nation enough to keep us in eternal frights, till these Plotters have done with us what they please, they will make <hi>more,</hi> and we shall have enough ere they have done. First, They make the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and all the <hi>Conformable Clergie such:</hi> We know they had concluded all the former but three, a pretty while ago; and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually labouring by scandalous Reflections, and downright Reproaches, in their common Discourses, and their more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick lying News, to blast the whole <hi>Regular</hi> Clergy, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> in <hi>Masquerade,</hi> (as they phrase it) or <hi>favourers</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> at least. And though these have been always, and still are (as I have shewn) the stout, zealous defenders of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Cause, though they are the only significant opposers (in their way) of Popish Errors, and Superstitions; though they expose them daily by their learned Books, and Sermons, and no sort, no order of men in the World ever did it <hi>more,</hi> nor <hi>so much;</hi> yet all this is nothing, it shall notwithstanding be in the power of every contemptible <hi>Pamphleteer,</hi> of every <hi>Atheist,</hi> of every <hi>Fanatick,</hi> to blast any one, yea, the whole Body of these men, with the reproach of being <hi>Papists;</hi> an Out-rage, and Barbarism scarce ever heard of in other Places, and Times: And a sort of men there are that have no manner of pretence to any Religion, but <hi>this</hi> of calling every one that is not as Sensless, or as Atheistical as themselves, <hi>Papists:</hi> Those that know not their <hi>Catechisms,</hi> that understand no more what <hi>Popery</hi> is than what is the Religion of <hi>China,</hi> or the most remote parts of <hi>America;</hi> that never did, and never will speak one reasonable word against <hi>that</hi> Way, nor <hi>for any;</hi> yet <hi>these</hi> shall impudently cast the scandal of <hi>Popery</hi> upon the most learned, most active, and most substantial Enemies <hi>that</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath in the World: Just as if a man should say, the <hi>Pope, Cardinals, and all the Jesuits, are Protestants in Masque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade.</hi> This is intolerable insolence, and injustice, most scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and destructive to our Protestant Profession, and to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53237:28"/>
Christianity it self; contrary to all Charity, Modesty, Truth, and common Honesty; and nothing could more incourage, and promote the ends, and designs of <hi>Papists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if this be so, if those that have studied the Points so throughly, have been so conversant in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Antiquity,</hi> who have read the Books of all sides, and have learning to judg, if <hi>they</hi> are <hi>Papists,</hi> or inclined to them; If they are <hi>so</hi> in spight of all their Interests, the zeal of their contrary Profession, and all their sharp Books, and Sermons against it, then certainly, may men think, this <hi>Popery</hi> hath somewhat in it more <hi>Christian,</hi> more <hi>reasonable</hi> than we have been aware, and it is not the Bugbear we have been made believe: Thus may People be tempted to favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of <hi>Popery</hi> by this unchristian practice; and this puts the chief Fort we have against them, the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> into their hands; it begets infinite animosities, hatreds, and jealousies among our selves, so that at last we shall not be able to tell whom to trust, who is a Friend, or who an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and hereby shall be rendred weak, and easie to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed: This <hi>recommends Popery</hi> as a Religion that hath the <hi>Hearts of all men,</hi> and supposeth that <hi>every one</hi> would be a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi> if he <hi>durst;</hi> which is so far from being true, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how contrary that Religion is to <hi>Sense, Reason, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> 'tis almost a wonder any one should be of it, whom <hi>Interest,</hi> or <hi>Education</hi> hath not irresistibly ingaged.</p>
               <p>And 'tis strange to see how slippery, and uncertain mens fayings are, for I have heard the same sort affirm often, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the non-sense of that Religion) that they think the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and other learned men among them do not in their Hearts believe it themselves: and yet <hi>now,</hi> when the contrary talk will serve a mischievous turn, every <hi>Protestant,</hi> every <hi>Learned</hi> man, every <hi>other man,</hi> that is not of their way, or mind, shall, when they please, be a <hi>Papist in his heart.</hi> The Jesuits are not <hi>Papists</hi> in their Hearts, but <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> whose <hi>Education, Interest, Studies, Profession, Labours</hi> have been still against them, are <hi>so</hi> in <hi>theirs:</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53237:28"/>
the other extravagances of it, is impious usurping the Prerogative of God of <hi>Searching Hearts:</hi> and at this rate even our <hi>Thoughts</hi> are not <hi>free;</hi> we shall not <hi>think</hi> what we <hi>can,</hi> but what these strange censurers please: And here is taking away <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> with a witness. 'Tis in vain to urge to them that we <hi>profess</hi> our selves Protestants, that we always did so, that we <hi>practise</hi> according to that profession, frequent the <hi>Protestant Worship, Prayers, Sermons, Sacraments,</hi> have taken the <hi>Oathes</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and are ready to take any <hi>Test</hi> against <hi>Popery;</hi> this will not do, all is nothing, <hi>we may have Dispensations for all this,</hi> and be <hi>Papists</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: According to which rule of judging, 'tis impossible to distinguish a <hi>Protestant</hi> from a <hi>Papist:</hi> And then the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers are <hi>Papists,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists, Quakers,</hi> the most eminent, the most zealous of them, every Mothers son, are all <hi>Papists,</hi> when any one hath a mind to call them so, and there is no possible way for them to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; nor is there any possible way for any sort of men to be <hi>Protestants</hi> but by being <hi>loudest</hi> and <hi>strongest,</hi> and able to <hi>knock the rest on the head.</hi> If any call us <hi>Papists,</hi> there is no way to <hi>stop their mouths</hi> but by <hi>cutting their Throats:</hi> Lo! here is foundation laid for our <hi>Massacring</hi> one another, and doing the <hi>Papists</hi> business to their hands: 'Tis but for the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Party to call the rest <hi>Papists,</hi> and they can never answer it, they must be <hi>so,</hi> and there is no help; and so they unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fall under all the Rage, and Fury that is, or may further be raised against those our common Enemies.</p>
               <p>Now according to <hi>this</hi> proceeding, <hi>Papists</hi> are indeed very <hi>numerous,</hi> and there are <hi>scarce any</hi> Protestants; yea, there are <hi>none</hi> at all; there are none but one side or other hath call'd <hi>Papists,</hi> and do; and none (not one of them) by this rule, can clear themselves, and prove they are not so: so that as soon as they are <hi>accused</hi> they are <hi>mute,</hi> and the matter must be taken <hi>Pro confesso.</hi> No man is clear from being a <hi>Papist,</hi> but he that is not accused; and so his clearness is only his good luck, that he hath not Enemies, or that charge hath not yet
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53237:29"/>
come into his enemies Heads, or into their Tongues; as soon as it doth, he is gone too.</p>
               <p>You see what Confusion this involves us in, it dashes us one against another, and blows up all <hi>Protestants</hi> at once; more generally, more effectually, than any <hi>Powder Plot</hi> can, or ever could do. So that we may justly say, that such Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers as these are <hi>promoters</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> designs in an high degree. And who-ever invented this piece of Mischief, whether <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>Jesuits,</hi> or our <hi>own Malice,</hi> and <hi>Rage,</hi> 'tis one of the most destructive Engines that ever was formed against us. For it throws us all into the <hi>Dark,</hi> full of Rage, and Fury, where we are provoked to fight and lay about us, but have not one glimps of light to see a <hi>Friend</hi> from a <hi>Foe.</hi> And when things are come to this pass, <hi>Papists</hi> may forbear <hi>Plotting,</hi> we shall do their work our selves.</p>
               <p>Now to Cure these evils, and to prevent the Dangers they threaten, it is greatly to be desired, if the present ways of <hi>discovering Papists</hi> are not sufficient, that some other <hi>Test,</hi> the best that can, were made; and when that is done, it should be made highly <hi>Actionable,</hi> by a particular, strict, severe Law, to call any one <hi>Papist,</hi> that hath taken the <hi>legal Test.</hi> For 'tis intolerable that the greatest, and most dangerous reproach possible (as that now is) should be fastned upon a man by whoever pleaseth, and that there should be no remedy, nor as much as any way of clearing. In other Cases, the Law takes care of mens <hi>Names,</hi> as well as of their <hi>Estates,</hi> and there is no reason but it should, they are, and ought to be as dear to us, and our greatest Interests depend on their security: And if it be not done in <hi>this</hi> Case, here wants one great provision for the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> and our common safety from <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi> There is nothing in the world more <hi>Arbitrary</hi> than mens <hi>Tongues</hi> let loose, and if they are not restrain'd, and tied up <hi>here,</hi> as in other Cases, we are <hi>all Slaves,</hi> and all exposed to suffer the greatest Evils from one another without any way of Redress; and so fall into state of War. This is a <hi>real,</hi> and mighty <hi>Grievance,</hi> and 'tis to be desired,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53237:29"/>
and hoped, that suitable Provision will be made against it.</p>
               <p>There is yet another branch of this Folly, and Injustice, which is, <hi>uncharitable Censure,</hi> and <hi>suspicion</hi> of all that turn from Popery, as if they were <hi>really,</hi> and at the bottom the <hi>same</hi> still. Some men are for keeping up their numbers full, and will not allow of their Conversion, except they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted over to their Sect, or some way, or other serve their Interest; except they run with them in the ways of Schism, and are factious against the Government; if they do thus, they are dear applauded Converts; but otherwise, if they are only come into the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and stick there, if they are friends to the King, and assert <hi>Him,</hi> and the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd Order in Church and State; they shall be <hi>Papists still,</hi> in spight of them.</p>
               <p>There are many Instances of this unworthiness, but among them all there is not a greater, than in the case of an eminent Nobleman, which you and I have had discourse of. His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, <hi>most</hi> of them (perhaps) were <hi>Papists; all</hi> were not so, for the great Grand-father was Lord Privy Seal to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Lord that now is, hath profest the Protestant Religion these thirty Years, that is, as long as he hath been capable of making a judgment for himself: He married a great Lady, an eminent <hi>Protestant,</hi> of a famous, zealous <hi>Protestant</hi> Family; hath for many Years, (fifteen, or sixteen to my knowledg) kept a <hi>Protestant</hi> Chaplain, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in his House, who hath read the Publick Liturgy twice every day there; his Lordship hath always accustomed to be present at them, and useth to be as regular in those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions as any Member of our Church can be: And not only <hi>so,</hi> but he frequents the <hi>Communions</hi> also, which at the appointed times are there duly Administred: His <hi>Children</hi> likewise are carefully bred in the <hi>Protestant</hi> Way of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Some two or three old Servants his Lordship hath, who have lived all their days in the Family (of the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion) they being ancient, and having no other dependance, my Lord still keeps them there (and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53237:30"/>
'twould be very unbecoming his Nobleness to do otherwise) but all the Servants <hi>else</hi> are <hi>Protestants:</hi> And I know that both this Lord and his Lady take great care to have them all receive the holy Communion according to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And it was not long since that his Lordship himself spoke to a Divine of our Church, whom he sent for on purpose, to instruct his eldest Daughter, (then newly of Years for it) in order to the receiving the Sacrament, which the young Lady piously did, as the course of the Family is. This Lord you know is in great Command, and by the Laws is obliged to give all other proofs, which I dare say he sincerely doth: He is a Member of his Majesty's Council, of <hi>this,</hi> as well as of the <hi>former,</hi> and to all <hi>Acts</hi> of Council against the <hi>Papists,</hi> his Name is still one: And yet notwithstanding <hi>all this,</hi> such is the perversness, and malice of some men, that they voice him up for a <hi>Papist,</hi> though all things he doth, and all things he saith declare the contrary; and they seem resolved that so it shall be, let his Lordship say, or do what he will. This is strange Treatment, and looks as if we wanted <hi>Papists,</hi> and were resolv'd to make as many as we can possibly find any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for: It shews that those men really do not fear them, but rather fear the want of them, to furnish out pretence for their Designs, and Projects. Otherwise, 'twere very strange that so great a Person, and his Family, should not be welcomed, and joyfully received into our <hi>Protestant</hi> Communion; and other Noblemen of the Popish Religion incouraged by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and kind reception, to do the like: But it being so much otherwise in <hi>this,</hi> and many other Cases, it is plain, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all their clamour, and talk, some men desire there should be more <hi>Papists,</hi> than really are, for colour, and shew, to assist and countenance their Stratagems, and perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances against the Government, both in <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> Whatever they have a mind to overthrow, and destroy, they mark with the brand of <hi>Popish,</hi> or <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> whether with Reason, or without any, matters not. <hi>Popery</hi> is, (and justly so) the object of the greatest hatred and the most
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53237:30"/>
general, so that 'tis but spending this Imputation on those we would ruine, and their business is near done.</p>
               <p>Whether this be not the reason of the present injustice, (of this kind) offered, to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and especially to her Clergy, let those that know some men, and their manner, judge. They are sure the Church-men (Divines, and others) will adhere to the Government, and are not to be drawn into their ways; and the grand Business of some is to overthrow the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>them;</hi> so that they must be branded, blackned, and rendred popularly odious; and what so effectually doth that, as putting the <hi>Comprehensive mark</hi> of <hi>all mischief,</hi> that of <hi>Popery,</hi> upon them. But on the Contrary, all those they shall have occasion to use in order to their destructive designs, shall be united in the dear name of <hi>Protestants.</hi> 'Tis no matter though many are <hi>Atheists,</hi> many <hi>Debauches,</hi> meer <hi>Worldlings,</hi> and <hi>Politicians,</hi> some acting from malice, and revenge, some from ambition, some to repair their broken fortunes by a shuffle, some out of greedy desire to be fingring Church-Lands again; yet all declaring against Popery, are <hi>Protestants,</hi> though they never heard themselves reckoned of any Religion before. So the <hi>Sects,</hi> of all denominations, that agree scarce in any thing <hi>positive,</hi> that hate, and vilify each other, and will scarce allow that any but themselves are Christians; yet <hi>these</hi> also are all <hi>tack't</hi> together by the kind denomination of being <hi>Protestants.</hi> All but <hi>we</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are <hi>so,</hi> that is, Those that are of no Religion, and never pretended to be of any; those that were bred of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and taught their Principles by the <hi>Papists;</hi> those that never took <hi>Oaths,</hi> or <hi>Tests</hi> against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and that (many of them) refuse to take any: Or to give any legal security to the publick that they are not Papists; these are <hi>Protestants, the Protestants:</hi> But those that profess the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christianity</hi> reform'd by our <hi>Martyrs</hi> from Roman errors, and corruptions, and establish't by our Laws; Those that have publickly bound themselves to this <hi>truely Protestant</hi> Religion, by <hi>Subscriptions, Oaths, Sacraments, Tests,</hi> (all the ways that the wisdom of the nation can find out for security) these are <hi>Papists, Popishly affected, Papists in Masquerade!</hi>

Sir, I speak nothing of this to expose, vilify, or affront any; but out of tender regard to the honour of the Protestant name, which must needs needs by such courses, I pray God preserve us from the ill consequences of proceedings that are so partial, and unjust, and that Popery in the event have not the advantages by them that they so fairly offer it.</p>
               <p>I hope you do not understand me, as if I intended that all were Atheists, Debauches, &amp;c. that <hi>seem</hi> now to be over-run with an extravagant zeal and violence, and that wrongfully charge the Church of <hi>England.</hi> No; I know what allowances are to be made for mens mistakes, who are abused by the cunning deceits of craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty designs. Many honest, and Religious persons are so mislead at this time: and those I pity, and pray for. But that there are many wicked men of the sorts I have described, studying, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the ruine both of Church, and State, you cannot but apprehend; and those it is that I humbly caution you against. And if ever Popery have any considerable advantage in this Nation, it will be by their means. The <hi>mistakes</hi> of furious Zeal <hi>against</hi> Popery may effect that, which all the <hi>direct</hi> Zeal in the world <hi>for</hi> it, would never be able to bring about. 'Tis <hi>sobriety</hi> that must settle, and secure us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SIR,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Have thus written to you with honest plainness, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, such as becomes an English-man, and a sincere Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To the same purpose I have spoken to others, as I have had occasion, with no other design but of serving the <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> by Law Establish'd, to which by the Grace of God, while I live, I will adhere. But for this innocent sort of discourse I have suffer'd severely from the fierce Zeal I have described, and have been Stigmatized by it as a <hi>Papist,</hi> a <hi>denier</hi> of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>Parliaments.</hi> I have reason to think that you have heard these injurious things of me, and because you have not seen me of late, and do not know how I may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53237:31"/>
be changed, I shall trouble you with a short account of my self, in reference to these Charges.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Popery,</hi> I always was as hearty an Enemy to it as any man that lives, and have declared that Emnity by such zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, frequent and publick oppositions as would expose me to the greatest rigours and persecutions of that Church, should it (which God forbid) ever regain Authority, and power in this Nation; Besides that I must certainly, unavoidably suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the loss of all under it. I say, I have publickly, solemnly, earnestly declared against Popery, ever since I was capable of examining and knowing it; I have represented the <hi>Idolatries, Superstitions, Heresies, Immoralities, Novelties, Absurdities, Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,</hi> and all the <hi>Antichristianism</hi> of that Church, with as much earnestness and plainness, as any man in my station hath or can do. I have done it always, on all occasions, and particularly since the late Plot, and <hi>often since,</hi> (and our dangers require this Zeal from us.) <hi>Such</hi> a <hi>Papist,</hi> Sir, I am: One that never thought of that Religion, but to detest it: And this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and resolution, by the help of God, I shall carry to my Grave.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Plot,</hi> I have reason'd about Circumstances, and spoken of the folly, and infatuation of the Contrivance, and management by the <hi>Papists;</hi> I have laught at many Coffee-house Stories, and Terrors, for which there was no evidence; I have been sensible of other Plots, and Designs built on the occasion of the Popish one, and have spoken of those, with concernment, as in these Papers I have done: But as here (all along) I <hi>suppose</hi> the grand Popish Plot, and own there was such a one; so in all Conversations, I have acknowledg'd the Plot, and see too much cause to believe the late Designs, and endeavours of <hi>Papists</hi> to work our Ruine. I know enough of the malignity of their Principles, and the vileness of their Practices (of this sort) to dispose me to receive the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>As to the last charge, I heartily reverence the <hi>Constitution,</hi> and respect Parliaments as much as any Friend to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53237:32"/>
can do. I know their <hi>usefulness,</hi> their <hi>necessity,</hi> and the veneration that is due to the <hi>Representatives</hi> of a great Nation, and of our <hi>own.</hi> But after all, this Body how great, how vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable soever, owns it self to be <hi>Fallible;</hi> and as all men take the liberty to blame what they dislike in publick proceedings, and even in theirs; so have I sometimes taken notice of such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, and Miscarriages as the violence and designs of ill men have led that Assembly into. Notwithstanding which, I can truly say, I honour <hi>Sober, Religious,</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> Parliaments, as much as any man. And I hope <hi>this,</hi> when it meets, will prove it self to be <hi>such,</hi> to the confusion of all <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical</hi> Designs, and the establishment of our <hi>Religion, Peace,</hi> and a <hi>lasting Happiness.</hi> This is my constant Prayer to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for Them; and to this every true English-man will say <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been a little tedious, and perhaps impertinent in this Apology; but I hope you will pardon it, as an effect of the great desire I have to preserve my self in your good opinion, which I hope I shall never forfeit by deserving such Characters as the fierceness of some would fasten on me: But always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as I am, a sincere lover of the true Protestant Religion, an affectionate Friend, and Subject to the Government, in Church, and State, as now establish'd: And particularly to your self,</p>

               <p>THE First occasion of our <hi>further</hi> danger of <hi>Popery,</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, viz. <hi>the weakning of the Church of</hi> England. The Constitutions of this Church are our <hi>old Protestantism:</hi> This Church our <hi>Bulwork</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> which unavoidably will follow the destruction of it.

               <p>The Second occasion of our danger, viz. <hi>our ill treatment of our Protestant Clergy, those of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>They</hi> formed our Reformation, and divers of them sealed it with their bloud: <hi>They</hi> still are the great Champions of the Protestant Cause: <hi>They</hi> have writ all that is considerable against Popery: <hi>They</hi> by their Writings and Sermons have, and do still with great zeal,

Their ill usage briefly described: By it Popery is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. The most common Objections against the Clergy of our Church considered.

               <p>The Fourth occasion, <hi>our carelesness and and indifferency in Religion.</hi> The necessity of sober Zeal, Religion is recommended, and secured by it, ours much prejudiced by the want of it. All Sects advance and grow by zeal, though ignorant, and mistaken; Instances of their zeal; we ought to be as zealous in a <hi>good</hi> cause, as they are in a <hi>bad;</hi> in what particulars we should be more zealous,
