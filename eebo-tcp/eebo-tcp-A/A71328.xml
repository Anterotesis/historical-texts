            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The other yongeſt Daughter to this King <hi>Garinter,</hi> was named <hi>Eliſena,</hi> very much excelling the eldeſt in beauty, &amp; though ſhe had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times deſired in mariage, by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Princes and great Lords: yet as then ſhe had no wil thereto, but for her ſolitary and holy life, was commonly called of euery one, <hi>The loſt Virgin in deuotion,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that in a perſon of ſuch eſtate, endued with ſuch excellent beauty, and ſolicited by ſo many great Princes, this ſtrickt religion was not conuenient.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7181:4"/>
he had loſt both his people and game, commending himſelfe to God, he began to make ſumwhat the more haſt, til hauing trauerſed firſt one way and then another, at the very entrance into a Wood, he ſaw two Knights fighting againſt one. Soone had he knowledge of the twaine, in that they were his owne Subiects, of whome he had heard ſundry complaintes: but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der order was taken in the cauſe, by reaſon of the great alliance they had in the Country, as alſo for that they kept themſelues ſtill in this greatforreſt. Who the third ſhould be, he meruailed, and for that time he ſo well liked the valour of the one Knight, as he feared not what might happen to the other twaine: wherefore he withdrew himſelfe a little further into the Forreſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he might the better beholde the iſſue of the fight, which ſorted to ſuch effect, as by the ſtrength of the one Knight, both the other were vanquiſhed and ſlaine. The King beholding what had happened, came forth of the Wood, when the Knight ſeeing one ſo neere him alone, thus demaunded. Gentle Sir, what Country is this, where Knightes errant arc thus aſſayled by robbers and theeues; Let this be no wonder to you Sir, anſwered the King, for this Country yeelds as others doe, both good and bad: as for them that thus aſſaulted you, they haue done diuers &amp; villainous outrages, not only in this Wood, which hath been their accuſtomed receptacle: but likewiſe in many other places, and cheefely againſt their Lord &amp; King, who could not execute iuſtice on them, in that they were allyed to the beſt houſes in this Realme. And where may I find the King you ſpeake of; ſaid the Knight, for I am come to ſeeke him, to bring him newes from a great friend of his. Happen what ſhall, anſwered <hi>Garinter,</hi> I will tell ye ſo much as I know: vnderſtand then for a truth, that I am the man you aske for. At theſe words the Knight tooke off his Helmet, and throwing downe his Sheeld, ran to embrace him: ſaying that he was King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who of long time had been deſirous to know him. Greatly were theſe Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that their meeting was in ſuch fortunate manner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring together on many matters, they tooke the waye through the Wood toward the Citie, where they thought to find the Hunters: but ſuddenly a Hart ranne before them, which with ſome danger had eſcaped the toyles: wherefore the Princes gallopped after the Deere, hoping to kil it ere they gaue ouer. But it fell out otherwiſe, for in the purſuite, as they came into the thickeſt of the Wood, a chafed Lyon ran before them: which in their ſight ſeazed on the Hart, and hauing with his ſtrong pawes torne it in peeces, turned againe, when running furiouſly againſt the two Princes, he watched his aduantage, as if they had angred him, which the King <hi>Perion</hi> perceiuing, in laughter ſaide. You ſhall not be ſuch a glutton, maiſter Lyon, but you ſhall leaue vs parte of the game. And herewith preſently he alighted, becauſe his Horſe would not come nere the beaſt, ſo draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Swoord, and claſping his ſheeld on his arme, not regarding the cryes of King <hi>Garinter,</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to diſſwade him from the attempt, he marched to the Lyon, who for defence of his pray, ran eagerly againſt the King, and ſo betweene them began a new warre. But the Lyon being quicke and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7181:4"/>
nimble, did ſo much as he got his enemy vnder him, yet was the Kinges heart ſo good, that albeit he was in very great perill of his perſon, he was not abaſhed one iotte: but turned himſelfe in ſuch ſorte, as he thruſt his Swoord into the belly of the beaſt, which at that inſtant fel downe dead before him. The King ſeeing what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, was ſo ouercome with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing at this deed as he ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him ſelfe. In ſooth it is no ſhame to renowne one of the beſt Knights in the worlde. In this meane while, the reſt of the traine came thether, who for to finde their king, had ſearched long time vp and downe the Forreſt. Then was their pray and Veniſon laid on two horſes, and caryed to the Citie, where the Queene was immediatly aduertiſed of king <hi>Perions</hi> arriuall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made ſpeedy prouiſion of all things neceſſarye, to welcome and feaſte ſo great a Prince. At their coming they found Dinner ready, and the tables couered: wherfore (after the welcomes and reuerences done on all ſides) the two kinges ſat downe, ſo did the Queene, and faire <hi>Eliſena</hi> her Daughter. Now had loue ſecretly ambuſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, becauſe he had long time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled this yong Princeſſe, without any power to ouercome her: but now he ſaw her ſo vnprouided, as at this inſtant hower he might touch her to the quick, and thence forwarde hold a ſure conqueſt of her. The like in king <hi>Perion,</hi> who thought of nothing but a friendly entertainment, yet when he caſt his eye on the Lady <hi>Eliſena,</hi> &amp; ſhe in like ſorte vpon him: by vertue of this pearcing regarde, her wonted chaſte and holye life had no longer power to priuiledge this Princeſſe, but ſhe was wonderfully thralled in extreame loue to this yong king, and he in ſelfe ſame manner to her, albeit till that hower, he had his hart francke and free, without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection in any other place. In this ſorte during dinner tyme, they found themſelues (for each other) in a ſtrange opinion, till the tables were with drawen, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Queene would departe to her Chamber, wherefore <hi>Eliſena</hi> aroſe to follow her: but as ſhe ſtepped forward, ſhe let fall a Ring which ſhe had put in her boſome when ſhe waſht her handes, and ſo had forgot it, by reaſon of this new loue, that made her thinke on other matters. Now was king <hi>Perion</hi> ſomewhat neer her, and deſirous to let her know how willingly he would be hers, ſtooped downe as ſoone as ſhe to take it vp, and ſo right did their handes meete together, as the king had the meane to cloſe her fingers, yet feigning to take vp her Ring. Wherevpon this amourous Lady began to change collour, and (notwithſtanding) by a ſweete regard humbly thanked him. Ah Madame, quoth he, this ſhall not be the laſt ſeruice I hope to doe you, for my whole life time ſhalbe imployed to obey you. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained was <hi>Eliſena</hi> (without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering him) to follow the Queen her mother, ſo ſurprized &amp; altered, as very neere ſhe had forgoten her ſelfe: ſo that not able to endure this new fire of loue (which ſo ſudden &amp; vehemently had conquered her wonted chaſte and choice determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:) with the teares in her eyes, and her hart full of anguiſh, ſhee went and diſcouered the ſame to a faithful Damoſelof hers, named <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioletta,</hi> praying her moſt inſtantly to councel her, how ſhe might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, if King <hi>Perion</hi> had not elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where placed his loue, and whether the affectionate ſemblaunce he had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7181:5"/>
ſhowne her, might proceed from force of that impreſſion, which had ſo lately ſeazed on her hart. The Damoſell meruailing at this ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in a perſon thought ſo farre from any ſuch matter: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (neuertheleſſe) compaſſion on her piteous teares, thus anſwered. I ſee well Madame, that according to the extreame paſſion, wherewith the tirant Loue hath tormented ye, he hath leſt no place in your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where counſell or reaſon may be entertained: and therefore following not what I ought for your ſeruice, but the will I haue to obey you, I ſhall do what you haue commaunded me, by the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meanes that my little diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and great deſire I haue to pleaſe ye, will permit me. So without any more woords, <hi>Darioletta</hi> went to the Chamber where King <hi>Perion</hi> was, and at the doore ſhe found his Squire, who brought other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his Lord to weare, which the Damoſell tooke of him. For (quoth ſhe) it is neceſſary that I performe this ſeruice, and you (gentle Squire) may goe if you pleaſe about your other affaires. The Squire thinking it was the cuſtome of the Country, made no deniall, but willingly ſuffered her to take the Garments, whereupon ſhe entred the Chamber, where ſhe found the King laid on his bed: who ſeeing her enter, and knowing well it was ſhe, whom he had ſeene to conferre with <hi>Eliſena</hi> moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly, &amp; in whom (aboue al other) ſhe put chiefeſt truſt, he thought that ſhe wold not come in that ſort to him, without bringing him ſome remedy for his mortall paſſions, for which cauſe, all in trembling, he ſaid. Faire friend, what demand ye; If it may ſo like you my Lord, quoth ſhe, I haue brought other garments for ye. Much rather would I, ſaid the King, that you had brought ſome comfort to my hart, which at this preſent is left &amp; deſpoyled of all pleaſure. As how my good Lord; anſwered the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell. Thus quoth he. When firſt I arriued in this country, I was free from all paſſions, and doubted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but of aduentures that might happen to Knights errand: but now (I know not in what ſort) entring this Court, by ſome one of your Ladyes, haue I receiued a deadly wound, for which if you (faire Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell) know how to giue me any remedy, your recompence ſhall be ſo good, as you ſhall repute your ſelfe beholding to me. Certes, quoth ſhe, I ſhould imagine my ſelfe happy, by doing ſeruice to ſo high a perſonage, and ſo good a Knight as you are, if I could tell wherein. If you wil promiſe me ſaid the King, as you are a loyall Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, not to diſcouer me but where it is requiſite, I ſhall tell ye. Say boldly your pleaſure, anſwered <hi>Darioletta,</hi> for by me (without your liking) it ſhall not be knowen to any. Damoſell and my friend, quoth he, I giue you to vnderſtand, that at what time I beheld the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beauty of <hi>Eliſena</hi> your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, I became extreamely tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with her loue, and in ſuch ſorte, as I cannot excuſe my ſelfe from death, if I find not remedy for my greefe the ſooner. <hi>Darioletta</hi> (who knew thorowly the mind of the Princeſſe) hearing what the King had ſaide, returned him this anſwer. My Lord, if you will aſſure me by the faith of a King, which before all other things ought to be kept, as a perſon moſt bounden to vertue, and as a loyall Knight, who ought (as is ſaide) to ſuffer much, for maintenance of right
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7181:5"/>
and equitie, that you will take to wife my Lady <hi>Eliſena</hi> when time ſhall ſerue: right ſoone will I bring ye to the place, where not only your hart ſhalbe ſatisfied but hers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who (it may be) is in as much or more thought and dolour, then you are, by reaſon of the new an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that toucheth her thorow the ſelfe ſame meanes. But if you do not (my Lord) what I haue ſaid, you ſhall not there recouer her, nor ſhall I haue other cauſe then to thinke, that your words proceeded from no loyall hart, nor to credit any thing you ſay hereafter. The King whome loue had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of liberty, to vnite him ſelfe with <hi>Eliſena,</hi> (to the end that hee might be adorned with the great &amp; gratious fruite, which afterwarde happened, as ſhalbe recited vnto ye,) tooke his Swoord, and ſetting his right hand on the Croſſe there-of, ſaide theſe wordes. I ſweare by this Croſſe, and on this Sword, wherewith I receiued the order of Knighthood, to do what you (faire Damoſell) ſhall commaund mee, at all times, and when ſoeuer your miſtreſſe <hi>Eliſena</hi> ſhalbe thereto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed. Be you then frollicke &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, anſwered <hi>Darioletta,</hi> for I ſhall likewiſe accompliſh what I haue promiſed. And at that inſtant ſhee returned to the Princeſſe, declaring to her what ſhee had concluded with king <hi>Perion,</hi> wherewith the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Lady was ſo pleaſed, as ſhe had vtterly loſt her former coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and inceſſantly embracing <hi>Darioletta,</hi> thus demaunded. My deere friend, when will the hower come, that I ſhall holde betweene mine armes, my Lord whom thou haſt giuen me? I ſhall tel ye anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Damoſell, you know that in the Chamber where King <hi>Perion</hi> lodgeth, there is a doore on the Garden ſide, which your father ſundry times vſed for his recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; which at this preſent is couered with the cloth of Arras, but I haue the key thereof: wherfore at night when euery one is at reſt, we may eaſily there enter vnſeene of any, and when needfull time of returne cometh, my ſelfe will call ye. When <hi>Eliſena</hi> heard this deuice, ſhe was highly contented therewith, yet breathing forth a ſighe, ſhe ſaid. Alas my faithfull friend: how ſhall we bring this to paſſe? ſeeing my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is determined to lodge with King <hi>Perion:</hi> &amp; if he perceiue vs, we ſhalbe both in very great danger. Refer that doubt to me, anſwered <hi>Darioletta,</hi> &amp; I ſhal eaſily prouide for this matter: wherupon for this time they brake off conference, becauſe the tabels were couered for Supper. And in like manner as the feaſting began in the morning, ſo now it continued, till the tables beeing voyded, each one prepared himſelf to reſt. Now a little before, <hi>Dariolet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> went to King <hi>Perions</hi> Squire, &amp; thus ſaide to him. Gentle Squire, &amp; my friend I pray ye tel me in good faith, whether you be a Gentleman or no, why aske ye? anſwered the Squire. For the deſire I haue, ſaid the Damoſell, to know one thing of you which I entreat ye (by the faith you owe to God and to the King your Maiſter) not to hide from me. By Saint Mary, quoth he, I will tell you what you pleaſe to aske, prouided, that it be not to the domage of my Lord. Herein, ſaide the Damoſell will I conſent with ye, for I would not demaund any thing of you that ſhould giue him diſpleaſure, nor were it reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that you ſhould acquaint me with any ſuch matter: but I deſire to know, who is the Lady he loueth moſt perfectly. The king my Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7181:6"/>
quoth the Squire, loueth all ingenerall, and I aſſure ye, that I know no one, to whom he beareth ſuch affection as you ſpeake of.</p>
                  <p>While they were thus talking, the King <hi>Garinter</hi> came, who ſeeing <hi>Darioletta</hi> conferring with King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions</hi> Squire, demanded what ſhee had to do with the Gentleman? In ſooth my Lord quoth ſhe, he telles me that the King his Maiſter is wont to lye alone, and therefore I thinke he loueth not to haue any company. When <hi>Garinter</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that, he went preſently to King <hi>Perion,</hi> ſaying, My noble Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there are certaine affaires ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly befallen me, and likewiſe I muſt riſe ſomewhat early in the morning, which hath made me thinke, that (not to trouble you) the beſt way is, that I breake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany from lodging with ye. My Lord, anſwered king <hi>Perion,</hi> do as ſhall ſeeme beſt to your liking, this anſwer appeared to king <hi>Garin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> conformable with that the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell had ſaid, wherefore right ſoone he commaunded his bed to be fetcht from king <hi>Perions</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. When <hi>Darioletta</hi> heard there-of, ſhee imagined their affaires would fall out the better, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returned to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her with all that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two kinges. In good faith quoth ſhe, I now beleeue, that ſeeing God hath granted ſo good a beginning, our enterpriſe, which at this preſent ſeemeth a great ſin, wil hereafter redound to his ſeruice: but tell me what wee ſhall do? for the great ioy which I haue, hath taken from me the moſt healthfull parte of my iudgement. Madam, ſaid <hi>Darioletta,</hi> this night will wee execute what we haue determined, ſeeing the doore (whereof you knowe) is certainly open. To my ſelfe I keep it, anſwered <hi>Eliſena,</hi> &amp; to you only I commit the charge, to prouide when the hower ſhall permit: and ſo they remained atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the fauourable time.</p>

                     <p>How the Princeſſe <hi>Eliſena</hi> and her Damoſell <hi>Darioletta,</hi> went to the Chamber where King <hi>Perion</hi> was lodged.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He time being com, when each one moſt commonly betake themſelues to reſt: <hi>Darioletta</hi> (who for the contentment of her Miſtreſſe, had vſed extreame diligence) came and tolde her. Madame, now is the time to finiſh our enterpriſe, then let vs go if you pleaſe. When <hi>Eliſena</hi> heard what ſhe ſaide, you muſt thinke ſhe gaue no occaſion to be reproued with ſlothfulnes: but haſtily aroſe, &amp; without tarrying, caſting only a mantle about her ſhoulders, went forward, and afterward they both entred the Garden. The time was then calme &amp; gratious, the Moone faire and ſplendant, giuing cleere light to the two Ladyes: but ſurely the one had more cauſe of content then the other, who gladly would haue taſted this good hap, or ſuch an other for her ſelfe, if ſhe could any way haue compaſt the meane, &amp; ſo much ſhe gaue in outward apea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as <hi>Eliſena</hi> perceiued well, that ſhe wanted but the executor to performe the ſame: for <hi>Dariolet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:7181:6"/>
feeling in her ſpirit, the caſe at hand which ſhee ſhould receiue whom ſhee conducted, could not but very pleſantly ieſt &amp; dally with her Miſtreſſe, breaking many a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſigh among, as though ſhe were to participate in <hi>Eliſenaes</hi> future good fortune, to whom ſhe ſaide. Alas Madame, how happy is the Prince, by whom this night you ſhall receiue ſuch pleaſure? You ſay true anſwered <hi>Eliſena,</hi> but what? thinke you not that fortune is as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable to me, as to him? for if I be faire, is not he one of the moſt perfect men that hath beene heard of, either in perſonage, good grace or hardines? aſſure thy ſelfe, <hi>Dario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> my friend, that I imagine my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo happy, as I thinke it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to be more, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs make haſt I praye thee. Theſe words ſhe vttered with ſuch affection, that ſhe trembled like the little leafe on the high tree, and as ſhe ended thoſe ſpeeches, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at the Chamber doore where King <hi>Perion</hi> was lodged: who (for the ſtrangnes of this new amorous flame, as alſo the hope he had in <hi>Darioletta)</hi> had not as yet taken any reſt. Neuertheleſſe, beeing as then wearye with trauaile, &amp; ouercome with ſleepe: began (euen as they opened the doore) to ſlumber, and dreamed that one entred his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at a falſe dore, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge who it ſhould be: but he thought that he thruſt his hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſides, and rent forth his hart, afterward he ſaw him throw it into the Riuer, when the king ſaide. Wherfore commit ye ſuch cruelty? This is nothing at all anſwered hee that did this outrage, for with you ſhall remaine another hart, which I muſt take from ye againſt my wil. In great feare he ſuddenly awaked, &amp; making the ſigne of the Croſſe, commended himſelfe to God. Now had the Ladyes opened the dore &amp; entred the Chamber, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hering the noyſe, ſuſpected ſome treaſon, eſpecially by reaſon of his feareful dreame, &amp; lifting vp his head beheld thorow the curtans the dore open, wherof he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and afterward by the light of the Moone, he ſaw the ſhadowe of the Ladyes that were entred. For this cauſe in feare he ſtarted out of bed, tooke his Sword, and went to the place where he had ſeene them: but when <hi>Darioletta</hi> ſaw him ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, ſhe ſpake to him in this manner, What ſhalbe done here? Do you draw armes againſt vs, that come to you with ſo ſlender defence? the king who quickly knew them, eſpecially <hi>Eliſena</hi> whom hee ſo much deſired, threw his Sword to the ground, and caſting a mantle about him which lay neere at hand: in great affection hee came to her, whom he loued better then him-ſelfe, kiſſing, embracing &amp; ſhewing the beſt countenance could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, which <hi>Darioletta</hi> ſeeing, as one iealous and enuious of ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, ſaid to <hi>Eliſena.</hi> Now are you ſomewhat better contented, for in my iudgement, although till this time you defended your ſelfe from many. And he likewiſe hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſundry aſſaultes: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at this preſent, neither the one or orher of you hath force or meane, which way any longer to warrant or defend your ſelues. As thus ſhe ſpake, ſhe looked where the king had throwen his Sword, which ſhe took vp, as a witneſſe of the oath and promiſe he made her, concerning the future mariage of <hi>Eliſena</hi> and himſelfe: then ſhutting the dore after her, ſhe went into the Garden, and ſo the king remained alone with his faire freind, whom
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7181:7"/>
(after many amourous embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, infinite kiſſings, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of delights) he behelde, verily perſwading himſelfe, that all the beauty of the world was in her, reputing himſelfe much more then happy, that the heauens had allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo good an aduenture. See now how it chaunced to this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, that for ſo long time, in the cheefeſt flower of her youth, beeing requeſted by ſo many mighty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lordes, ſhe had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all, to remaine in the liberty of a Maiden: now won in leſſe ſpace then one day, and at ſuch time as her fancie (in her one thinking) was fartheſt off from ſuch matters.</p>
                  <p>Thus Loue breaking the ſtrong bandes of her holye and chaſt life, cauſed a ſudden alteration of her purpoſe, making her ſoone after, of a faire virgen, a faire woman: ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for example to many other, who aſſaying to withdraw their thoughtes from worldly things, &amp; deſpiſing the great beauty wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with nature hath endowed them, &amp; tender youth, which maketh them ignorant of the pleſures &amp; delights in their Fathers Courts, whereof ſometime they might haue taſted: yeelde themſelues (for ſaluation of their ſoules) in poore and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſes, thereto in offering their free will, vowing themſelues to the ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others, hoping to paſſe their time without any renowne or glory of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> world. Certes ſuch Ladyes, ought with great ſollicitude to ſtop their eares, cloſe their eyes, and giue themſelues to continuall deuoute contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; prayers, accepting them as their true and ſingular paſtimes, as to ſuch they are: and aboue all, they ſhould exempt themſelues from ſight of Parents neighbours and freinds, becauſe oftentimes the talk and frequenting of ſuch, procureth achange of their holy &amp; chaſt will. and not without cauſe haue I made this little diſcourſe, for it is to the end that it happen not to them, as it did vnto the faire Princeſſe <hi>Eliſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who ſo long labored in thought to preſerue her ſelfe: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in one only moment, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beauty and good grace of King <hi>Perion,</hi> changed her will in ſuch ſorte, as without the aduiſe &amp; diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Darioletta,</hi> who would couer the honor of hir Miſtreſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mantle of mariage: you may ſee ſhe was at the poynt to fal, into the very loweſt parte of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor. As it hath happened to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, of whom hath commonly beene heard ſpeech: who not kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them ſelues from what I haue ſaide before, haue beene taken bad enough, and taken will be, if they admit no better foreſight.</p>
                  <p>Now then are theſe two louers in their ſolace, <hi>Eliſena</hi> demanding of the king, if his departure ſhould be ſhortly or no. Wherfore Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame do you aske? ſaid king <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Becauſe, quoth ſhe, this happy fortune that with ſo great delight hath giuen eaſe to our affectionate deſires: doth threaten me already with extreame anguiſh &amp; ſorrow, which by your abſence I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and feare it will rather cauſe my ſudden death, then long life. Haue no doubt thereof ſaide the king, for although my body is ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from your preſence, my hart for euer ſhal remain with ye, which ſhall giue ſtrength to vs both, to you to ſuffer, and to me by my ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye returne. Theſe two contented louers are thus deuiſing, when ſhe that had bin the cauſe of their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (ſeeing it was time to call her miſtreſſe, who by this pleaſure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got her ſelfe in her louers armes)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7181:7"/>
entred the Chamber, &amp; ſpeaking ſomewhat loude ſaide. Madme, I know that heretofore you thought my company more agreeable, then you doe at this preſent: but it is needfull that you ariſe, and let vs goe, for the time calleth vs. When the King heard her, knowing that perforce it muſt be ſo, he played <hi>Darioletta</hi> to walke into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and to bring him word in what corner the winde ſat: in meane while he tooke his amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conge, with ſuch reciprocall pleaſure, as you that loue may eaſily iudge, then ſweetly kiſſing her, he ſaide, I aſſure you Madame, that for your ſake I will ſtay longer in this Country then you imagine, therefore I pray ye be not vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of this place. So aroſe <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and went to her Chamber with <hi>Darioletta,</hi> leauing the king alone, not a little contented with his new acquaintance: but dreading his dreame, as you haue heard, and willing to know what it might ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, he became deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his owne Country, where as then were good ſtore of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that were well ſeene in thoſe Sciences: himſelfe likewiſe in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times tooke great pleaſure therein, and vnderſtood ſundry rules thereof. Neuertheleſſe, he ſoiourned ten dayes with king <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinter,</hi> after his ſporting with <hi>Eliſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who neuer a night failed to viſit her louely haunt. The ten dayes being ſpent, king <hi>Perion</hi> (forcing his will, and notwithſtanding the teares and intreaties of <hi>Eliſena</hi> which were exceſſiue) reſolued to depart, and therefore tooke his leaue of the Court: but as he wold haue mounted on horſebacke, he perceiued that he wanted his good Sword, whereat he became ſomewhat offended, becauſe it was one of the beſt, and faireſt in the world, yet durſt he not demand it, fearing leaſt the loue of him and <hi>Eliſena</hi> ſhould thereby be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or King <hi>Garinter</hi> angry with them that viſited his Chamber. In theſe thoughts, accompanied with infinite regrets, without lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtay, he tooke his way toward <hi>Gaule:</hi> albeit before his departure, <hi>Darioletta</hi> came &amp; intreated him, to be mindfull of the great griefe wherein he left his <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and of the ſolemne promiſe he had made her. Alas my deere friend, ſaide the King, I pray ye to aſſure her on my parte, that ſhe ſhall haue no cauſe of offence, and that right ſoone I meane to ſee her, in meane while, I commend her to you as mine owne proper hart. Then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from his finger a Ring, ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to an other that he had, he ſent it to the deſolate louer, intreating her earneſtly (for his ſake) to giue it her. This preſent did no whit leſſen her great greefe, but encreaſe it, ſo that if ſhe had not beene comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Darioletta,</hi> without doubt, ſhe had then finiſhed her dayes: but ſo well ſhe perſwaded her to take good hope, that by the alliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe laid before her of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous occurrences, ſhe came ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better to her ſelfe, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thence forward more ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſſemble her ſorrowe, till ſhe felte her ſelfe great with Childe, by meanes whereof, ſhe not onely loſt the taſte of her food, but alſo the pleaſure of reſt, and the faire cullour of her countenance.</p>
                  <p>Now on the higheſt ſtep of miſ-hap was her ſorrow ſet, and not without cauſe, for in that time was there an inuiolable lawe, that any woman or maiden, of what quality or eſtate ſoeuer, offending in ſuch ſorte, could no way excuſe her ſelfe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7181:8"/>
from death. This ſharpe and cruell cuſtome, endured til the comming of the vertuous King <hi>Arthur,</hi> the beſt Prince that euer raigned in that Country: which he reuoked at the time, as be killed <hi>Floian</hi> in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile before the Gates of <hi>Paris.</hi> But many other Kinges were betweene him and <hi>Garinter,</hi> who maintained that lawe, and for this cauſe the ſorrowfull Lady could not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued by ignoraunce thereof: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that by the oathes and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of King <hi>Perion</hi> on his Sword, God would remit the offence, yet knew ſhe not how to excuſe her faulte to the worlde, becauſe it was done ſo ſecretly as you haue heard. See here the diſtreſſe wherein King <hi>Perion</hi> left his <hi>Eliſena,</hi> which gladly ſhe wold giue him to vnderſtand, if poſſible ſhe could: but it might not be for ſhe knew the prompritude of this yong Knng, that tooke no reſt in any place where he came, nor was his hart ſatiſfied, except in this, with following armes, as alſo ſeeking ſtrange and hazardous aduentures, and therefore he was the harder to be found. Thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of this ſuccour, ſhe thought there was no remedy for her life, for which ſhe made not ſo much mone, as the loſſe of the ſight of her true friend and onely Lord. But at that inſtant the great and puiſſant maker of all thinges, by whoſe permſſion this act was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to his ſeruice, inſpired <hi>Darioletta</hi> with ſuch councell, as ſhe onely ſhould remedie theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currances, in ſuch ſort as you ſhall preſently vnderſtand.</p>
                  <p>In the pallace of King <hi>Garinter,</hi> there was a Chamber-vault ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the reſt, neere to which was a riuer, whereto one might eaſily diſcend by a little Iron dore, this Chamber (by the aduice of <hi>Darioletta)</hi> did <hi>Eliſena</hi> requeſt of her father, as well for her eaſe, as to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue her accuſtomed ſolitary life, and would haue none other companion then <hi>Darioletta,</hi> who (as you haue heard) knew the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her dollorous greefes. This requeſt ſhe lightly obtained, the King thinking his daughters intent to be as ſhe feigned, and heereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the keye of the Iron dore giuen to <hi>Darioletta,</hi> to open when it pleaſed <hi>Eliſena</hi> to recreate her ſelfe on the water. By this meane had ſhe a place proper to her affaires, and ſo was in better reſt &amp; aſſurance then before: for well was ſhe aduiſed, that in this place more commodiouſly then any other, might ſhe prouide to eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger. Wherefore beeing there one day alone with her Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, they fell in conference, &amp; ſhe requited councell, what ſhould be done with the fruit: that ſhe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed withall. What? anſwered <hi>Darioletta:</hi> Mary, it muſt ſuffer to redeeme you. Oh poore maidenly mother, ſaide <hi>Eliſena,</hi> how can I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to the death of the creature, begoten by the only man of the worlde, whome moſt I loue? offend not your ſelfe, quoth <hi>Darioletta,</hi> for if you ſhould dye, hardly would it be permitted after you to liue. In ſooth, ſaide <hi>Eliſena,</hi> although I dye beeing culpable, it were no reaſon the little innocent ſhould ſuffer. Leaue we this talke, anſwered <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioletta,</hi> ſeeing it were great folly to hazard the ſafety of that, which hereafter may be the onely cauſe of your loſſe, and your friend likewiſe: for well you knowe, that if you be diſcouered, you ſhall dye, and the infant ſhall not liue, &amp; you dying, no longer can he liue that ſo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

contrarywiſe, if you eſcape the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, the time will come, when you may haue together children enow, which will make you forget the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection you bare to this firſt. And as this Damoſell was thus inſpired, ſo would ſhe before hand ſeeke to preuent the inconuenience, in this manner. She got foure little boards, of ſuch largenes as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make a Cheſt wherein to put the infant, with the clothes &amp; the Sword which ſhe kept, then did ſhe giue them together in ſuch ſorte, as the water ſhould haue no place to enter. This beeing done &amp; made fit, ſhe put it vnder the bed, without declaring any thing there-of to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> vntil the time of child-birth approched, and then <hi>Dario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> ſaide. What thinke ye Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame this little Cofer is made for? In good faith I know not, quoth ſhe. This ſhalbe to ſerue vs, ſaide the Damoſell, when we haue need. Beleeue me anſwerd <hi>Eliſena</hi> wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping but little doe I care for any thing that may happen, for I feele my ſelfe too neere the loſſe of my good, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Very ſoone after, the Princeſſe felt the anguiſh of trauaile, which was to her very ſtrange &amp; troubleſome, oppreſſing her hart with ſundry bitter paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: yet notwithſtanding al her yrkſome plunges, poore ſoule ſhe durſt not but be ſilent, greatly fearing leaſt ſhe ſhould be heard. Her agonies thus redoubling, the moſt mighty (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of her perſon) gaue her in deliuerance a faire Son, which the Damoſell receiued, and as ſhe held it, it ſeemed to hero wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feature, and happy would ſhe haue reputed him, had he not bene borne to hard fortune, where-to <hi>Darioletta</hi> was conſtrained to ſend him for the redemption of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull mother, and therefore ſhe deferred it not. But euen as before was concluded, ſhe wrapped the infant in riche clothes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward brought it with the Cofer to <hi>Eliſena:</hi> which when the good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſawe, ſhe demanded what ſhe would do therewith. Madame quoth ſhe, herein ſhall your little Sonne be put, then will I ſend it forth on the water, and if it pleaſe God, he may eſcape and liue. Alas my ſweete infant, ſaide <hi>Eliſena,</hi> how full of danger is thy deſtiny? In meane while, <hi>Darioletta</hi> tooke inke and parchment, and writ therein theſe words, <hi>This is</hi> Amadis <hi>without time, Sonne to a King:</hi> by theſe words without time, ſhe meant, that ſhe thought his death to be neere at hand, and the name of <hi>Amadis</hi> was of great reuerence in that Country, becauſe of a Saint there ſo called, to whom this little infant was reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. The letter beeing written and ſealed, was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and wrapped in ſilke, &amp; then with a little golden Chaine, faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the Childes necke, with the Ring that King <hi>Perion</hi> ſent <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſena</hi> at his departure. Each thing thus appointed, <hi>Darioletta</hi> came to the wofull mother, and in her ſight put the Childe into the Cheſt, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him the King his Fathers Sword, which he threw on the ground the firſt night he came to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and this is the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Damoſell had ſo well kept it: then after the Mother had kiſt her Sonne, as her laſt farewell, the Cofer was made faſt very arteficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>Darioletta</hi> opening the iron dore, commending the babe to the heauenly protection, ſhe ſet it on the water, the courſe whereof bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſpeedy, full ſoone caried the Cofer into the Sea, which was leſſe then halfe a mile from the place.</p>

Now began the breake of day to appeare, and the little infant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his fortune, now throwne heere, then there, according as the boyſtrous waues pleaſed: but by the will of the higheſt, who (when he pleaſeth) makes impoſſibilities eaſie, cauſed it ſo to fall out, that at the ſame time as this was done, a Scottiſhe Ship ſayled on the Sea, wherein was a Gentleman named <hi>Gandales,</hi> who from little <hi>Brittaine</hi> ſailed with his wife into <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhe hauing beene lately deliuered of a ſonne called <hi>Gandalin.</hi> The morning was both calme &amp; cleere, wherefore <hi>Gandales</hi> might eaſilye perceiue the Cheſt floting on the waues, which he preſently ſent out for, thinking it to be ſome matter of great value: then the Mariners caſting forth a Skiffe, made toward the Cofer and tooke it vp: when they had brought it to <hi>Gandales,</hi> he got open the couer; and beholding the goodly infant within, as alſo the rich clothes wherein it was wrapped, he ſuſpected that it came from no meane place, as he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ring &amp; the good Sword. So taking it in his armes, he was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſuch compaſſion, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to curſſe the mother thereof, who through feare had forſaken ſo cruelly ſuch a beautifull creature: and carefully did he cauſe al things to be kept which he found in the Cofer, deſiring his wife, that this infant might be nouriſhed as his owne Sonne. She was heerewith very wel contented, and ſo the two children were equally foſtered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for neuer had yong <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſuckt the teat, but ſo ſoone as it was giuen him by his new nurſſe, he made no refuſall thereof, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very thirſtie ſucked very harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereat <hi>Gandales</hi> and his wife were exceeding glad.

not only thoſe he ſent for, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other came to the court, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſire they had to ſee him, &amp; their readines to obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: for they did ſo loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence him, as oftentimes (being fearefull to looſe him) they were for him in very great greefe and ſorrow, thinking on the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perils, that in chiualry (to win honor) he hazarded himſelfe, ſo that they would more gladly haue had him dayly with them, which could not be, becauſe his hart was diſcontented, til by armes he had brought the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures to end.</p>
                  <p>The Lordes and Princes thus aſſembled, the King conferred with them on the eſtate and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Realme, but it was with ſo ſad countenance as could be: for the occaſion of his dreame made him ſo penſiue, as his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes (being abaſhed thereat) were in meruailous doubtes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, after he had giuen them to vnderſtand his will, and appointed all requiſite matters in order, he gaue them leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte, ſending each one home to his houſe, only ſtaying with him three Aſtrologers, reputed the moſt skilfull in thoſe actions, and therefore he made choiſe of them.

My Lord, dreames are vaine thinges, and for ſuch ought to be eſteemed: notwithſtanding, ſeeing it is your pleaſure that ſome account ſhould be made of yours, giue vs ſome time to conſider thereon.

Thou knoweſt how thou haſt ſworne and promiſed, to tell me what thou haſt found by thy ſkill. Sir anſwered <hi>Albert,</hi> let then the reſt be called into your preſence, for before them will I tel ye. Well haſt thou aduiſed, ſaid the King: whereupon they were ſent for, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>Albert</hi> thus began. My opinion is, my Lord, that the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chamber, and him whom you ſaw enter by the ſecret dore, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth this Realme which is cloſe &amp; well guarded: notwithſtanding by ſome right thereto, ſome one ſhall come to take it from you. And like as he thruſt his handes into your ſides, renting forth thence your hart, and afterward threw it into the Riuer: euen ſo ſhall your Townes and Caſtles both more &amp; leſſe, be priuily ſtolen from you, and put into his hand from whom you ſhall not eaſily recouer them. And what meaneth the other hart, ſaid the King, which I dreamed ſhould remain with me, and yet he ſaid, that ſoone after I ſhould loſe it, againſt the will of him that took the firſt from me? It ſeemeth by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7181:10"/>
this, anſwered <hi>Albert,</hi> that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall inuade your Country as the firſt did, yet conſtrained more by force of another that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to do ſo, then by any will thereto in himſelfe: thus ſee ye (my Lord) all that I can tell ye. Now ſaid the king to the ſecond named <hi>Antalles,</hi> tel vs your aduiſe. Me thinkes Sir, quoth he, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> hath very well ſaide, and I am of his opinion, except in this, (for ought I can learne, &amp; as the cauſe ſheweth me) that what he ſaith ſhall happen, is already effected, &amp; by the perſon that moſt loueth ye: notwithſtanding I am greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat, ſeeing there is not as yet any part of your Realme loſt, &amp; if you do looſe any thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, it muſt be by ſuch a one as loueth you decrely. When the king heard this, he nodded his head, for it ſeemed to him, that he came neere the marke: but <hi>Vngan</hi> the <hi>Piccard,</hi> who knew much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, fel into a laughter, which he was ſildome wont to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a man very ſad and melancholly, yet (by chance) the King perceiued it, wherefore he ſaid. Maiſter <hi>Vngan</hi> my friend, now remaineth none but you, ſay bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what you haue gathered. My Lord, quoth he, peraduenture I haue ſeene into things, which is not neceſſary to be knowne to any other then your ſelfe, &amp; therefore let theſe giue place a while, if you pleaſe. At theſe words they with-drew themſelues, leauing the King and <hi>Vngan</hi> alone, who thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>If your Maieſty ſaw me ere while to laugh, it was at one word which little you thinke on, yet it is true, and will you know what? It was that which <hi>Antalles</hi> ſaid, that what he found by your dreame was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy happened, &amp; by the perſon that beſt loueth ye: Now ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale what you keepe in ſecret and thinke that none knowes but your ſelfe. You loue (my Lord) in ſuch a place, where you haue already accompliſhed your will, and ſhe whom you loue is ſurpaſſing faire, then tolde he all the geſts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of her, as if ſhe had bene there preſent. But as for the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you found ſhut, you know Sir, full well what it meaneth, and how ſhe whome you loue, deſirous to deliuer her heart and yours from griefe and ſadneſſe: came to ye, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring your cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber by the falſe dore that was hid from you. The hands that opened your ſides, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinction of you twaine: then the heart taken from ye, ſheweth that ſhe hath by you a Son or a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now tell me ſaid the King, what meaneth the caſting thereof into the Riuer? My Lord, quoth he, that nothing concerneth you, therefore neuer labour for further knowledge thereof. Yet would I, ſaid the King, faine vnderſtand it, and therefore feare not to tell me for any harme that may happen. Seeing you will needes haue it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Vngan,</hi> I beſeech ye Sir aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me while you liue, for any thing that I ſhal reueal, you wilnot be diſpleaſed with her who loueth you ſo loyally. That promiſe do I faithfully make thee, ſaid the King. In good ſooth Sir, quoth <hi>Vngan,</hi> that heart that you ſaw throwen into the water, is the firſt infant ſhe ſhall haue by you, who muſt of neceſſity be forſaken. And the other, ſaid the King, that ſhall remaine with me, what meaneth that? You may, anſwered <hi>Vngan,</hi> vnderſtand by the one, deſſeigne of the other, which is, that ſhe ſhall conceiue another childe, who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7181:10"/>
ſhall be caryed away againſt the will of her, that cauſed the loſſe of the firſt. Thou haſt told me ſtrange things, ſaid the King, and would God the miſ-fortune of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were not ſo true, as what thou haſt told me concerning the Lady I loue. For things ordeined and appoynted by the higheſt, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Vngan,</hi> none knoweth how to gaine-ſay or remedy, and therefore men of wiſdome ſhould neuer be ſad or reioyce at them, becauſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the Lord diſpoſeth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters beyond the capacity of men &amp; farre otherwiſe then they expect. For this cauſe my Lord, forgetting all that I haue ſaid, and which you haue bin ſo curious to vnderſtand: referre all things to God, deſiring him in theſe your affaires and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to limit the end of them to his honor and glory, and thus (in mine opinion) you ought to ſet downe your reſt. The King was highly contented with <hi>Vngan,</hi> and ſo eſteemed of him, that from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce forward he had him neere his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by meanes whereof he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many great fauours. Now it happened, that at that inſtant as the king parted from the Philoſophers, a Damoſell preſented her ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, right coſtly in garments and faire in beauty, thus ſpeaking. <hi>Vnderſtand King</hi> Perion, <hi>that when thou recouereſt thy loſſe, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Ireland ſhall looſe her flower.</hi> So giuing her Palfrey the bridle, and the King not able to ſtay her, ſhe rode away: theſe wordes made the good Prince more ſad &amp; pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue then he was before.</p>
                  <p>For this time the Auther lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this purpoſe, &amp; returneth to ſpeake of the infant, that <hi>Gandales</hi> cauſed to be nouriſhed, whom he made to be called <hi>the Gentleman of the Sea.</hi> Now was he curiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, wherefore in ſhort time he grew and became ſo faire, that all which beheld him meruailed thereat, but one day among other it happened, that <hi>Gandales</hi> rode to ſport himſelfe in the fields, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himſelfe as became a good Knight: for he had dayly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the king <hi>Languines,</hi> at ſuch time as he ſearched after aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and albeit the king diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Armes, yet <hi>Gandales</hi> would oftentimes exerciſe himſelfe, and as he rode, he met with a Damoſell that thus ſpeake to him. Ah <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> if many great perſonages were aduertiſed of what I know certainly, I aſſure thee they would cauſe thee to looſe thy head. Wherefore? quoth he. Becauſe, ſaid the Damoſell, thou nouriſheſt their death in thy houſe. The knight knew not the woman that thus talked with him, but you muſt vnderſtand, how ſhe was the ſame that ſaid to king Perion, <hi>that when he recouered his loſſe, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Ireland ſhould loſe her flower,</hi> yet notwithſtanding he was farre from the matter, becauſe he knew not whereof ſhe ſpake, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus replyed. For Gods ſake (Damoſell) I pray ye tell me, on what occaſion you vſe theſe ſpeeches. Beleeue me <hi>Gandales,</hi> qooth ſhe, I haue tolde thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth. At theſe wordes ſhe departed from him, leauing him very ſad and penſiue: yet long he did not continue in theſe thoughts, but he ſaw her returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in great haſt, thus crying &amp; calling. Ah <hi>Gandales,</hi> for Gods ſake ſuccor me: then <hi>Gandales</hi> turning about, beheld a knight follow her with his Sword drawne, wherefore he gaue his horſe the ſpurres to meete him, and placed himſelfe for the defence of the Damoſell,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7181:11"/>
then comming to him that purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, he ſaid. Stay thou bad ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed knight, what moueth thee thus trecherouſly to outrage Ladyes? What now? anſwered the other, doeſt thou hope to ſaue her, who by trumpery hath made me looſe both body and ſoule? That meddle not I withall, ſaid <hi>Gandales,</hi> but I will defend her to my power, well knowing that Ladyes ought not to be corrected in this manner, albeit they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it. We ſhal preſently ſee that, anſwered the knight, and ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopped to the place from whence he came, which was a little thicket of trees, where ſtayed a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyfull Lady, who when ſhe ſaw him returne, came forth, bringing him a Sheeld and a ſtrong Launce, which he tooke, and without lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tariance, returned to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Gandales</hi> being a ſterne knight, would not refuſe him: whereupon they met together in ſuch ſorte, as their launces were broken no their Sheelds, and they with their horſes caſt to the ground, yet quickly did they recouer footing, when began betweene them a meruailous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which worſe would haue bin, but that ſhe which deſired ſuccor of <hi>Gandales,</hi> ſtepped betweene them, ſaying. Stay Gentlemen, fight no more. At theſe wordes, the Knight who before purſued her went back, then ſaid the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to him. Come now and aske pardon of me. Moſt willingly, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Knight, then throwing his Sword and Sheeld down, came and humbled himſelfe on both his knees before her, whereat <hi>Gandales</hi> was greatly amazed, afterward the Damoſell ſaid to the Knight. Goe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the Lady vnder the trees, that ſhe get her away immediatly, vnleſſe thou ſhalt take her head from her ſhoulders. To this charge the Knight yeelded himſelfe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and to her whom he loued more then himſelfe (by ſudden change from loue to hatred) he came and angerly ſaid. Trayterous woman, I know not how I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelfe from killing thee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. Well perceiued the poore Lady, that her friend was enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that conteſtation would nothing at all profit her: wherefore incontinent ſhe mounted on her palfray, and rode away, making the moſt grieuous ſorrow that euer was heard, and there remained ſhe whom <hi>Gandales</hi> had defended, ſpeaking to him in this manner. You haue (Sir) done ſo much for me, as I ſhall be beholding to you while I liue, and now you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part at your pleaſures for if the knight offended me. I haue pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with all my heart. As touching your pardon, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> I haue nothing to doe therewith: for my ſelfe, I will end the Combate, or he ſhall hold him-ſelfe vanquiſhed. It behoueth that you acquite him, ſaid the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſeeing that if you were the beſt Knight in the world, eaſily can I make him ouercome yee. Do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what you can, replyed <hi>Gandales,</hi> but I will not acquite him, except you firſt declare to me, wherefore (euen now) you ſaid, that I kept the death of many people in my houſe. Then will I rather tell ye, quoth ſhe, becauſe I loue you both: He as mine owne Soule, &amp; you as my defender, albeit conſtraint can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make me doe it: ſo taking him aſide, ſhe ſaid. You ſhall ſweare to me as a loyall Knight, that no other ſhall know it by you, vntill ſuch time as I command it: hereof he made her faithfull promiſe. Know then, ſaid the Damoſell, that he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7181:11"/>
whom you found in the Sea, ſhall one day be the flower of chiualdry, and ſhall cauſe the very ſtrongeſt to ſtoope, he ſhall enterpriſe, and with honor finiſh what other ſhall faile off: and ſuch deedes of armes ſhall he doe, as no one thinkes can be begun or ended by the ſtrength of one man. The proud ſhall he make humble and gracious, being cruell and pittileſſe, as alſo benigne and amiable to the debonaire: this Knight moſt loyally will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine loue, and ſhall effect in place anſwerable to his magnanimitie. Moreouer, I aſſure thee <hi>Gandales,</hi> that he is the Sonne of a King, and (without doubt) all this will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen which I haue told thee: but if thou keepe it not ſecret, it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thee more harme then good. Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> I pray ye tell me where I may meete with you hereafter, to conferre with you on the affaires of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. That muſt you not know by me, ſaid the Damoſell, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet tell me your name, quoth <hi>Gandales,</hi> if ſo it be your pleaſure.

                     </gap>ure me ſo, as you ſhall know it: albeit the thing that moſt I loue, is he that wiſheth me leaſt good, and would you know what he is? it is the Knight againſt whom ere while you combated: notwithſtanding, I will not leaue to intreat him at my pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he being able to remedy him-ſelfe. My name is <hi>Vrganda the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne:</hi> and to the end you may remember me an other time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde me well at this preſent. At that inſtant, ſhe who ſhewed her ſelfe to <hi>Gandales</hi> faire, yong and freſh, as one of eighteene yeeres, became ſo olde and ouer ſpent, as he meruailed how ſhe could ſit on her horſe, if then he was ſtricken into admiration, you may iudge. But when ſhe had beene a prittie while in that ſtate, ſhe tooke out of a little bottell (which ſhe cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) a certaine vnguent, wherewith ſhe rubbed her face, &amp; right ſoone recouered her former counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, ſaying to <hi>Gandales.</hi> What iudge ye now Sir? thinke you to finde me hereafter againſt my will, vſing all the dilligence you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe? neuer therefore put your ſelfe to ſuch paine: for when all liuing creatures goe about it, if I liſt, they ſhall looſe their labour. In good faith Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> I now make no doubt thereof, yet I beſeech ye to be mindefull of the Gentleman, who is forſaken of all but my ſelfe. Doe not you trouble your ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſaid <hi>Vrganda,</hi> this forſaking wil be a recouering of much more. My loue to him in greater then you can imagine, being ſhe that ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intendes to receiue by him two aydes, which no other can giue me. In recompence whereof, I will giue him two likewiſe, wherewith he ſhall thinke himſelfe highly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied. Let this ſuffiſe ye for this time, becauſe of neceſſitie I muſt be gone: aduiſing ye, that you ſhal ſee me againe ſooner then you thinke for. At theſe wordes the Damoſell departed, and <hi>Gandales,</hi> who had not all this while regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Knight againſt whom he fought, ſeeing him now bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, reputed him one of the goodlyeſt Gentlemen that euer he had ſeene: who after he had taken vp his Sheeld, and laced on his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, followed the Damoſel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this time we will let them goe, continuing what happened to <hi>Gandales.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vrganda</hi> being departed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7181:12"/>
toward his Caſtel, meeting by the way with the Lady, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> had cauſed to be chaſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her friend, and this ſorrowfull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was heard by a Fountaine, where ſhe wept &amp; lamented very bitterly: when ſhe eſpyed him that came toward her, ſhe eaſily knew him, wherefore ſhe thus ſpake. Is it poſſible, Sir Knight, that the wicked creature whom you ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, hath done ſo much as to let you liue? wicked ſhe is not, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> but wiſe and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: and if you be otherwiſe, I will make you deny theſe fooliſh wordes. Ah God, ſaid the Lady: how can the villaine deceiue euery one? How hath ſhe deceiued you; replied <hi>Gandales.</hi> Alas, quoth the Lady, ſhe hath taken from me the faire Knight that ſhould be mine: and ſo may I well ſay, ſeeing he would be more content to be with me, then with her. This is meere folly, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> for in mine opinion, both you &amp; ſhe doe loue without reaſon. How euer it be, ſaid the Lady, if I can I will be auenged. You trauile in vaine, quoth he, thinking to iniurie her that knowes it, not onely before you execute it, but when you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it. In ſooth anſwered the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this afternoone ye may be gone when you pleaſe: and neuertheles it often happeneth, that thoſe which thinke they know moſt by preſumption, fall into the greateſt dangers. <hi>Gandales</hi> ſeeing her ſo impatient, commending her to God, followed his way, thinking more of the yong Gentlemans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, then what the Lady had ſpoken to him. Being come to his Caſtell, and ſeeing the little boy come running towards him, he tooke him vp in his armes, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly embracing him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred what <hi>Vrganda</hi> had ſaide to him, which made the teares ſtand in his eyes with ioy, ſaying within himſelfe. Faire Childe, I pray God I may liue ſo long, as to ſee thee ſuch a one as I hope for. At this time the yong Prince was about three yeeres olde, who ſeeing his Lord weepe, (as one moued with compaſſion) he wiped his eyes, which made <hi>Gandales</hi> imagine great humanity in him: and that as the childe grew in age &amp; ſtrength, ſo waxed he in will, the better to helpe him if he had occaſion. Wherefore thence forward, he was very carefull of him, deuiſing all meanes for his beſt education, and compayning continually with his play fellowe <hi>Gandalin,</hi> he took very great delight in ſhooting.</p>
                  <p>He being come to the age of ſixe yeeres, King <hi>Languines</hi> and his Queene riding through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, came to <hi>Gandales</hi> Caſtell, where they were royally feaſted: but before they there ariued, <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> being aduertiſed of their comming, cauſed the yong Prince and his companions to be hid in a backe Chamber, fearing that in reſpect of his beauty and good grace, the King would be deſirous to take him away with him, or elſe that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the houſe. But it fortuned, that the Queene being lodged in one of the higheſt roomes in the Caſtell, as ſhe looked forth at a windowe, which was on that ſide where the Children were, ſhe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the yong Prince and his play-fellowes drawing their bowes, and marking him very well, ſhe liked him aboue all the other, taking great pleaſure to behold his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, thinking he was Sonne to the Lord of the houſe: yet being doubtfull, and not ſeeing any of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7181:12"/>
whom ſhe might aske the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe thus called to her Ladyes. Come and behold the faireſt yong creature that euer was ſeene. At theſe words they al came running, and ſoone after, the Childe being drye, left his bowe by his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, going to drinke at a conduit pipe, which was hard by: in meane while, one of them that was bigger then the Prince, tooke vp his bow to draw it, but <hi>Gandalin</hi> would not ſuffer him, whereupon a great ſtrife full betweene them, and <hi>Gandalin</hi> being the weakeſt, cryed out: <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the ſea,</hi> come helpe me. When the Prince heard him, he left his draught, and ran to him that miſuſed his brother, taking his bowe from him, giuing him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a great ſtroke ouer the head, ſaying: In an euill hower (varlet) doſt thou outrage my brother. The other not content therewith, came to the Prince, &amp; they fought together: yet he that began the noyſe was glad to run thence, and by the way met their Gouernour, who ſaid: Whether runneſt thou; Maiſter, quoth he, the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> will beate me: then the Gouernour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the Prince, rigorouſly threatned him, ſaying. What; are you already ſo bolde to beate your companions; you ſhall be talked withall by and by for it. When the Prince heard his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he fell downe on his knees, ſaying. If you will appoynt that I ſhall be beaten, more gladly will I take it, then ſuffer my brother to be wronged in my preſence. With theſe words the teares trickled downe his cheekes, which moued pity in the Gouernour, wherefore he thus anſwered. If euer you doe ſo againe I will make ye weepe in an other ſorte. The Queene who had heard and ſeene all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, was greatly abaſhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they called the little boy, the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea.</hi>

Yea Madame anſwered <hi>Gandales.</hi> And (quoth ſhe) why ſuffer you him to be called the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the ſea?</hi> Becauſe Madame, ſaid he, that at returne of my laſt voyage into little <hi>Brittayne,</hi> he was borne vpon the ſea. Truely quoth ſhe, he reſembles you but little: &amp; this was her opinion, becauſe the Prince was exellent faire, and <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> ſomewhat heard fauoured, yet a moſt gentle companion. It chanced during theſe ſpeeches, that the King caſt his eye on the little Prince, to whom he ſeemed no leſſe beautyfull then he did to the Queene, wherefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Gandales</hi> to fetch him: for when I goe hence (quoth he) I will take him with me, and haue him brought vp with mine one Son. In ſooth my Lord, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> he is yet to yong to leaue his Mother: but hauing brought him, preſented him to the King,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7181:13"/>
who ſaid. Faire Child will ye go with me to the Court; My Lord, anſwered the Childe, I will goe whether you pleaſe, if my brother ſhall goe with me. And I quoth <hi>Gandalin,</hi> will not tarry here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. I perceiue my Lord, ſaid <hi>Gandales,</hi> that if you take the one, you muſt needes haue the other, for they will not be ſeperated. I am the better pleaſed, anſwered the King: then calling <hi>Agraies</hi> to him, ſaid. My Son, I will that you loue theſe two Gentlemen, as I do their Father. When <hi>Gandales</hi> ſaw, that the King would haue them away in good earneſt, with the teares in his eyes, he thus ſpake in his hart. My childe, that ſo ſoone beginneſt to proue fortunate, now I ſee thee in the ſeruice of them, who one day may (happily) ſerue thee, if it pleaſe God to guide and protect thee, as I ſhall humbly pray for, &amp; ſuffer that the words of <hi>Vrganda the vnknowne</hi> ſpoken to me, may proue true: making me ſo happy, as to liue to ſee the time, of thoſe great meruailes, promiſed thee in Armes. The King who noted <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> ſeeing that his eyes were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with teares, came to comfort him, ſaying. Beleeue me, I neuer thought you had bene ſuch a foole, as to weepe for a Childe. Ah my Lord anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> it may be vpon greater occaſion then you thinke for, and if it pleaſe you to know the truth, I will preſently tell ye heere before your Queene. So he tolde the whole diſcourſe, how he found the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> and in what equipage: and he had proceeded with that which <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> foretold him, but that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the oath he tooke. Now my Lord ſaid <hi>Gandales,</hi> deale for him as you ſhall pleaſe, for (ſo God helpe me) according to his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I thinke him to be iſſued of great linage. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King heard this, he eſteemed much the better of him, that he had ſo carefully nouriſhed the child he found, and thus anſwered. It is great reaſon (ſeeing god hath done ſo much for him, as to preſerue him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo great a danger) that now we be diligent in his education, and endowe him with habilities when time ſhall ſerue. In good faith my Lord, ſaid the Queene, ſo pleaſe you, he ſhalbe mine during his young yeeres, and when he comes to mans eſtate, I will deliuer him to ſerue you. Well Madame, quoth the King, I giue him you. Now early on the next morning, the King would ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, wherefore the Queene, not hauing forgot the gift of her Lord, tooke with her <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the yong <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> whom ſhe commanded to be ſo carefully attended as her owne Sonne, for ſhe tooke ſuch pleaſure in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, that dayly ſhe would haue him neere her owne perſon, becauſe he had ſuch a cheerefull ſpirit, and ſo well gouerned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as he was well liked of euery ore, ſo that whatſoeuer he did, paſſed with generall allowance, &amp; no other paſtime had he, but in ſhooting and cheriſhing dogges for the chaſe.</p>
                  <p>Now doth the Authour leaue this matter, returning to that which happened to King <hi>Perion,</hi> &amp; his new freind <hi>Eliſena.</hi> King <hi>Perion</hi> (as you haue already heard) being in <hi>Gaule,</hi> where he vnderſtood by his Philoſphers the expoſition of his dreame, as alſo what the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell had told him: <hi>That when he recouered his loſſe, the Kingdome of Ireland ſhould looſe her flower:</hi> he became more penſiue then before, yet could he vnderſtand nothing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7181:13"/>
thereof. As he thus ſadly ſpent his dayes, it chanced that another Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell entred his Pallace, who brought him a letter from <hi>Eliſena,</hi> whereby ſhe gaue him to know, that King <hi>Garinter</hi> her Father was dead, and ſhe remained alone, and for this cauſe he ſhould pitty her, in that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> would take her Kingdome from her. For the death of King <hi>Garinter</hi> was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> ſomewhat ſorrowfull, but yet he comforted himſelfe, by thinking he ſhould goe to ſee his friend, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom he had not dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed one iot of his affection, wherefore he quickly diſpatched the Damoſell, ſaying to her. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and ſay to your Miſtreſſe, that without ſtaying one whole day, I ſhall be in ſhort time with her. The Damoſell well pleaſed with this anſwere, returned, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King had ſet his affaires in order, he parted in good equipage to ſee his <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and iournied ſo ſpeedily, as he ariued in little <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:</hi> where he heard newes that king <hi>Languines</hi> had already gotten all the cheefe of the Country, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe Cities which <hi>Garinter</hi> gaue to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> who now abode (as he vnderſtood) at a place na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Arcate,</hi> whether he addreſſed himſelfe. If he were there well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, I leaue to your iudgments, and ſhe likewiſe of him whom ſhe loued ſo much. After the welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming &amp; feaſting of one another, the King told her that he would now marry her, and for that cauſe ſhe aduertiſed her kindred and Subiects: which ſhe did with all diligence could be deuiſed, as alſo with ſo great contentation as her heart might deſire, for herein on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſted the ſumme of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Which being heard by the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this, King <hi>Perion</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready arriued with his Siſter: he ſent immediatly for all the noble men of his Realme, to beare him company in doing honor and wel-come to the King his brother. At his comming, he was gratiouſly receiued by King <hi>Perion,</hi> and after by embracings they had ſaluted each other, and the nuptials like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thorowly ended: the kings determined to returne home into their owne Countryes.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Perion</hi> trauailing toward <hi>Gaule</hi> with his Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> &amp; ſomewhat weary with tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the way, he would refreſh himſelfe along by a Riuer ſide: &amp; while the tentes were erecting, he rode ſoftly alone by the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancke, imagining how he might know the truth, whether <hi>Eliſena</hi> had a child, aaccording as his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophertold him in expounding his dreame. But ſo long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he in this thought, that riding on without any regarde, he came to an Hermitage which was neere at hand: wherefore finding him-ſelfe at a place of deuotion, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, tying his Horſe to a tree, that he might goe in to ſay his prayers. And entring the Church, he found there a very antient reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, who comming to meete him, ſaid, Knight, is it true, that king <hi>Perion</hi> is marryed to our kings daughter? yea verily, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the king, Praiſed be God, ſaid the good Hermit, for I know certainly, that ſhe loueth him with all her hart. How can you tell that; replied the king. Euen from her owne mouth, ſaid the good olde man. The king then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping he ſhoud heare of him the thing which he moſt deſired to know, ſaid. I pray ye Father tell me, what you haue vnderſtood of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7181:14"/>
her and me, for I am King <hi>Perion.</hi> Truely Sir, anſwered the wiſe man, herein ſhall I greatly fault, and iuſtly might ſhe repute me an heretique, if I ſhould manifeſt what ſhe hath told me vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: ſuffiſe your ſelfe with that I haue declared, namely, the true and ſincere loue ſhe beareth you. But ſeeing I haue met ye in a place ſo conuenient, I will that ye know, what a Damoſell (in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very wiſe) ſaid to me at the time you came firſt into this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: yet ſpake ſhe to me ſo darkely, as I neuer knew well how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend her words, for ſhe ſaid. <hi>That from little</hi> Brittaine <hi>ſhould come two great Dragons, that ſhould hold their gouernment in</hi> Gaule, <hi>and their hearts in great</hi> Brittaine, <hi>and from thence they ſhould go to deuoure the beaſtes of other Countryes: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome they ſhould be braue and cruell, and againſt other ſome hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and gracious, as though they had neither nayles or hart.</hi> At theſe words I became very penſiue, nor could I euer ſince learne the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification hereof. Nor did the King at this inſtant vnderſtand them, but was in no leſſe meruaile then the Hermite: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, no long time after he found this propheſie to be true. Now the king hauing commended the holy man to God, returned to his tents, where he ſaluted his Queene, yet would he not tell her (as then) any thing of that wherewith his mind was troubled: but diſſembled the ſame till they were in bed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their accuſtomed embracings, the king by an apt meane recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to her, what his Aſtrologers had ſaid on his dreame, earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to tel him, whether ſhe had any Child by him or no. When the good Lady heard this, ſhe was ſurpriſed with ſhame in ſuch ſorte, as willingly ſhe could haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed her ſelfe dead: and therefore altogether denied the truth, ſo that at this time the king might not know what he deſired. On the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row they departed thence and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in <hi>Gaule,</hi> where this noble Queen was generally receiued with great ioy. And becauſe that (as it hath bene heretofore rehearſed) the king bare her ſinguler affection, he did for her ſake ſtay more in his Realme, then he was wont to doe: ſo that not long after, the Queene brought him a Sonne, who was named <hi>Galaor,</hi> and next a daughter called <hi>Melicia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the little <hi>Galaor</hi> being two yeeres and a halfe olde, it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that one day the king his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſoiourning not farre from the ſea ſide, in one of his Cities named <hi>Orangill,</hi> ſtanding at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow toward the Garden, where was then the Queene with her ſon &amp; Ladies ſporting: there entred at a poſtern dore ſuch a horrible Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, as no man that euer ſaw him but was exceedingly affraide, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on his neck a huge &amp; mighty Mace. When the company of women eſpied him, ſome fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the trees, and other (not to ſee him) fell on the ground: but the Giant made no reckoning of them, only he came to little <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> whom he tooke in his armes, and in a laughter ſaid. <hi>By my faith, the Damoſell ſaid true.</hi> So without any thing elſe, taking away the Child, returned the ſame way he came: and entring a Brigandine that there ſtayed for him, departed vnder ſaile. In meane while the ſorrowfull Queene, who ſaw her ſon caryed away. (Forgetting through motherly loue the feare of the Giant) followed him very
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7181:14"/>
neere, hoping to recouer her little <hi>Galaor:</hi> but when ſhe ſaw him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Brigandine, God knowes in what anguiſh ſhe was, for her Sonne in crying ſaid: Ah helpe me mother. Alas ſhe could not, and more ſtrange then death ſhe tooke it, to ſee him caried away, whom ſhe loued as her owne life: and in this extreame dollour, ſhe remembred her other Sonne throwne into the ſea, wherefore the wofull mother fell downe in a ſwoune. King <hi>Perion</hi> her husband, who ſaw all this in the place where he ſtood, from whence he could not quickly come to aide the Queene or her Son: at laſt came to the Queene, finding her in that caſe, and did ſo much as he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her againe. Then began ſhe to make the moſt grieuous mone in the world, regreeting this new loſſe, by whom the before hoped to vnderſtand of the firſt: and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayring euer to heare any newes of comfort, moued great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in all that beheld her. All this while the king laboured to perſwade her, whereby at laſt ſhe reobtained the reaſon that before was abſent, whereupon the king ſaid. Madame, we muſt thank God for all, and cheefely in this caſe, for now I euidently ſee hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the effect of my dreame, whereof ſometime I tolde ye: thus is little <hi>Galaor</hi> the laſt hart, that muſt be taken from vs againſt our will. Henceforth therefore feare not to declare, what is become of the firſt, for conſidering the eſtate you then were in, you ought not in reaſon to be blamed. At theſe words the mournefull mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting none of the fault commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, told him the miſ-fortune of her firſt borne Sonne, entreating him to pardon her, ſeeing ſhe did it throw feare of death, according as was the law of the Country. In good faith Madame, anſwered the king, well may ye aſſure your ſelfe, that while I liue I will not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ye on your behalfe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray ye, take their deſteny ſo ſecretly as you may: for I truſt in God, that ſeeing it hath pleaſed him at our beginning, to afforde vs ſo little ioy and comforte by our children, in time to come he will recompence vs with better ſucceſſe, and it may be yet one day, that we ſhall heare good tidings of them.</p>
                  <p>Now leauing this, ye muſt note, that the Giant who bare away the yong Prince, was of the Country of <hi>Leonois,</hi> Lord of an Iſle named <hi>Gandalan,</hi> wherein he had two ſtrong places. He was not a bloudy man, as many other were, but of a gentle and peaceable conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except when he was offended, for in his fury he would doe great cruelties. At one inſtant was the little barque ſo caried by the wind, as he arriued in his country, which he had cauſed to be peopled with Chriſtians, &amp; there he kepta Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite of moſt holy life, to whom he went ſaying. Father take this child, and nouriſh him for me, teaching him all that is conuenient in a knight, for I aſſure ye, he is the ſon of a king and a Queene. Ah, ſaid the Hermet, why haue you doone ſuch a cruell deede? I will tell ye, anſwered the Giant. Being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to go combate with the Giant <hi>Albadan,</hi> who moſt vnhappily killed my father, as you know, and at this preſent forcibly holds from me the Rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> which by right appertaineth to me: being thus embarqued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute mine intent, there came a Damoſell to me, who ſaid.

By theſe meanes remained little <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> in the holy mans charge, and there he ſtaied ſo long, till he was of yeeres to receiue the order of Knight-hood, as hereafter ſhalbe recited to you.</p>
                  <p>At this time reigned in great <hi>Brittaine</hi> a king named <hi>Falangris,</hi> who dying without children, left one of his bretheren his heire: no leſſe prudent in all affaires, then prompt at armes, and Knightly chiualry, being called <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who maried (not long before) with <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſana,</hi> daughter to the king of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> the faireſt Lady that then was to be found in all the North parts.</p>

Now according as hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, the yong Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> daughter to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> was left with the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> to refreſh her ſelfe, till the King her father ſhould ſend for her, and to her did the Queene vſe all the gracious curteſies could be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſaying to her withall: Faire Madame, henceforth (ſo pleaſe you) ſhall the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> ſerue you, and be yours.

Notwithſtanding, the Prince for a while hauing no knowledge thereof, thought him-ſelfe vnworthy ſo great good: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting it a very bold enterpriſe to thinke thereon, which was the cauſe he durſt not ſpeake, but ſhew his good will in outward ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. The yong Princeſſe who was of the fame minde, and alſo in like paine, forbare to talke more with him then any other, thereby to auoyde all ſuſpition: but the eyes of the two louers doing their deuoire and office, entercourſed the thing which moſt they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and thus couertly they liued, without acquainting each other with this amorous affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Soone after, this yong vnknowne Prince, ſeeing that to attaine the good grace of the Lady he loued, it was neceſſary he ſhould take Armes, &amp; receiue the order of Knighthood, he ſaid to himſelfe.

How now <hi>Gentleman of the ſea?</hi> Do you thinke your ſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſtrong enough for ſuch a weightie charge?

                  <p>Now did the king aduertiſe <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> heereof, who was ſo conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, as he ſoone diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a Damoſell toward the yong Prince: by whome he ſent the Sword, the Ring, and the letter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with waxe, which he found in the cheſt he tooke out of the ſea. Such ſpeede made the Damoſell, as ſhe came to the Prince, at what time he was ſporting with <hi>Oriana</hi> and the other Ladies, while the Queene ſlept. At that inſtant was he in ſuch a ſollemne thought of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> as not daring to lift vp His eyes to behold her, ſaid within himſelfe. Ah God, why haſt thou endued this Lady with ſuch exel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty, that vnhappy I ſhould ſuffer ſo extreame paſſions by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her? Ah mine eyes, too high did ye looke when ye beheld her, of whome you are not worthy: but if the worſt happen, death ſhall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie this timeritie, whereto my hart (for her) is humbled. In this thought he was like to fall downe, ſo had he forgotten and ouergone himſelfe: when a page came to him, ſaying. Gentleman, there is a ſtrange Damoſell attending with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, who hath brought you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine preſents, and would ſpeake with ye. When ſhe (who loued him) heard this meſſage, her hart began to tremble in ſuch ſorte, as being not able to endure this new flame, ſhe called to the Prince, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I pray ye ſtay heere, and let the Damoſel come in, that we may haue the ſight of what ſhee hath brought: which he did, &amp; the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell being entred, thus ſpake to him. My Lord, your good friend <hi>Gandales</hi> ſaluteth you, as the man whom he onely loueth, and hath ſent ye this Ring, this waxe, &amp; this Sword, which he deſireth ye (for his ſake) to keepe while you liue. The Prince hauing receiued the preſents, laid the Ring and waxe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to behold the Sword, which being without a ſheath, was wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in a fine linnen cloth, whereat he greatly meruailed: and while he was muſing thereon, <hi>Oriana</hi> tooke the waxe, thinking it to be ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, and ſaid. Beleeue me Gentleman, for my part I would haue this waxe. You may haue it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7181:16"/>
if you pleaſe Madame, quoth he, but me thinkes this faire Ring were better for ye. I will haue nothing but this waxe, ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> and ſo tooke it. During theſe diſcourſes, the King came, who ſaid to the Prince: What thinke ye of that Sword? My Lord, quoth he, I find it a very faire one, but I maruaile wherefore it hath no ſcabbard. It is ſaid the King, very neer fifteene yeeres ſince it had one: &amp; hauing ſo ſaid, he laid it aſide, proceeding thus. You would be a Knight, and know not whether you ought to be one or no: therefore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that you vnderſtand what you are, and I to tell you ſo much as I know. Heereupon he declared, how he was found in a cheſt on the ſea, with the Sword &amp; the Ring, as you haue already heard. I beleeue my Lord, quoth the Prince, that for your pleaſure you vſe this inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the Damoſell when ſhe entred ſaid: that my good friend <hi>Gandales</hi> ſent me theſe preſents, but I think ſhe fayled in her words, and would haue ſaid my father <hi>Gandales.</hi> Notwithſtanding (my Lord) if it be ſo as you haue reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I am not diſpleaſed thereat: except in not knowing of whence I am, nor they me, yet do I thinke my ſelfe a Gentleman, for my hart perſwades me of no leſſe. Now therefore it is more neceſſary that I be Knighted then before, to the end I may labour to become ſuch a one as may acquire honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ſeeing I haue no parents by whom I may be named, not knowing what I am. When the King heard him ſpeake ſo vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, he eſteemed much better of him then before, thinking him-ſelfe, that he could not but be a man of calling and hardy.</p>
                  <p>As thus they were deuiſing, a Gentleman came to the King, and ſaid. My Lord, King <hi>Perion</hi> your brother is come to the Court. The King very glad thereof, departed to receiue his brother, &amp; embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him, thus ſpake. I ſee my good brother, you meant to take me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided, for little did I thinke of your ſo ſudden arriual in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

And to attaine his purpoſe, he thought beſt to entreat the Queene, hoping that if ſhe would doe ſo much for him, as to moue the King her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therein ſhe ſhold not be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid: and for he ſaw her ſo ſad, that he durſt not ſpeake to her, he bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to <hi>Ortana,</hi> and ſetting his knee to the ground, ſaid. I pray ye Madame tell me what cauſeth the Queene to be ſo penſiue? <hi>Oriana</hi> beholding the man before her, whom ſhe loued in her very Soule, albeit neither he or any other knew it: was ſurprized whith ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of loue, as ſhe could hardly tell how to diſſemble it, yet thus ſhe anſwered. <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> and my friend, I will take paine to know, then ſhall I tell ye with all my hart, ſeeing it is the firſt requeſt that euer ye made to me. Madame, quoth he, I know in my ſelfe ſo ſmall deſeruing toward you, that I account my ſelfe vnworthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt any thing of you: but I ſhould thinke I were happy if I had the meane to obey you, or that it would pleaſe you to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand me. What? ſaid ſhee, haue you ſo baſe a mind, &amp; ſuch ſmal eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your ſelfe? Madame, anſwered he, in what ſort ſoeuer it be, I haue no forces at all, but ſuch as haue left me in great deſire to ſerue you: for my hart is altogether yours, and can receiue nothing but from you. Mine? quoth <hi>Oriana,</hi> and ſince when? Since the time it pleaſed you Madame, replied the Prince. And when was it, quoth ſhe, that it pleaſed me; At that time, anſwered the Prince, when the king your father left you in this Country, if you remember, and when the Queene preſented me to you, ſaying: I giue you this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to ſerue you, and at that time you accepted me as yours, when you anſwered, that you were well contented. Then was I giuen to you, and yours onely I reputed my ſelfe, ſo that I haue no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer my ſelfe. Certes, ſaid <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> you tooke her words to better end, then at that time ſhe meant them: which I take in good part, and am content it ſhall be ſo. No ſooner had ſhe thus ſaid, but the Prince was ouercome with ſuch ioy, as he had no power to anſwer. <hi>Oriana</hi> perceiuing it, made no ſhew thereof, but ſaid ſhe would goe to the Queene, to doe what he had deſired: and returned ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, telling him, that her griefe was for the Queene of <hi>Gaule</hi> her ſiſter, becauſe the King of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her country. So pleaſe you Madame, anſwered the Prince, if I were Knighted, I gladly would go ſuccor her, with your leaue. And without my leaue, quoth <hi>Oriana,</hi> will ye not goe? Not for death, ſaid he, for without your gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, my conquered hart can haue no force or vertue in any perill. At theſe words <hi>Oriana</hi> ſmiled, ſaying. Seeing then you are mine, I grant you to be my Knight, and you ſhall aide the Queenes ſiſter.

This is very well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, anſwered <hi>Oriana:</hi> wherefore they ſent for the Prince, and tolde him al the platforme they had laid: who humbly thanking them, wold prouide all things ready for him-ſelfe, and therefore departed. Then went he to finde <hi>Gandalin,</hi> making him acquainted with the whole, ſaying. I pray ye brother, conuay mine armour ſo cloſely as you can into the Queenes Chappell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I hope this night to receiue mine order: and for I muſt right ſoone depart hence, I would know if you haue any will to beare me company. Beleeue me, quoth <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> neuer with my will ſhall I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from ye. Of theſe words was the Prince ſo glad, that the teares ſtood in his eyes with ioy. Well ſaid he, prouide all things ready as I told ye: wherein <hi>Gandalin</hi> failed not, for ere ſupper he tooke ſuch order, as all was done vnſeene of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the Prince got him ſecretly into the Chappell, where he armed himſelfe except the head &amp; hands. So ſtaying there for the Ladies &amp; King <hi>Perion,</hi> he fel on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Alter, deſiring God to be his aide: not onely in conquering ſuch as he ſhould deale withall in Armes, but alſo in obtaining her, who cauſed him to endure ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mortal paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The night being come, &amp; the Queen with-drawne, the Princeſſes <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila</hi> with their wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, came to the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel where the <hi>Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſea</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, &amp; <hi>Mabila</hi> hauing ſent for K. <hi>Perion,</hi> he was no ſooner entred but ſhe thus began. My L. ſeeing you haue taken ſo much paines for me as to come hither, I pray you grant Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> daughter: to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> a ſmall requeſt ſhe will make to ye. I would be loath, ſaide the King to deny her, as well for her Fathers honor as her own ſake. <hi>Oriana</hi> aroſe to thanke him, whom whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beheld ſo faire, he thought all the world could not match her in beauty: thus ſpeaking to her. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, doth it pleaſe you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me any thing? Not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand my Lord, quoth ſhe, but intreat ye to giue my Gentleman the order of knight-hood: this ſaid ſhe, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him as he kneeled before the Altar. When the king ſaw him, he wondred at his goodly ſtature, and ſaid to him. My friend, would you receiue the order of Knight-hood; Yea my good Lord, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7181:18"/>
the Prince, may it pleaſe you to giue it me. In Gods name be it done, ſaid the King, who giue you grace ſo well to proceede therein, as he hath beſtowed ſeemely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection on you. Then putting on his right ſpur, and dubbing him with his Sword, thus ſpake. Now haueye the Order appertaining to a Knight, but I would oppertunity had ſerued me, to haue giuen it you with greater honor: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, according to mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of you, I hope you will proue ſuch, as your renowne ſhall ſupply what wanteth here in performance. Afterward King <hi>Perion</hi> took leaue of the Ladies, who highly thanked him, &amp; then ſet on his way toward <hi>Gaule,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending the new Knight to the heauenly protection: this was the firſt act, that might beare teſtimony of theſe louers ſweete deſires. If it ſeeme to the Reader, that their purpoſe was not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to affection, but ſimple in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their vehement paſſions: I anſwer, that they ought to excuſe their age, likewiſe it often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that they which thinke themſelues moſt expert in thoſe pleaſing and amorous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, haue beene by this God ſo ſtrongly bound, and liuely attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as not only he depriued them of ſpeech, but of iudgment alſo, &amp; it is neceſſary for ſuch perſons to vſe greater words, then theſe two who as yet had not learned them. But this new Knight being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly furniſhed, and ready to his iourney by his Ladies conſent: would in thanking the company, take a more ſecret conge of <hi>Oriana.</hi> And ſhe who for his ſudden par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, felt new paſſions in her heart, yet neuertheleſſe diſſembling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: tooke him by the hand, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aſide, thus ſpake. <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> you will be gone then, but firſt I pray ye tell me, whether you be the Sonne of <hi>Gandales</hi> or no: for according to the good opinion I haue of you, I thinke you to be iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued of better place. Then reherſed he all that King <hi>Languines</hi> had told him, wherein ſhe conceiued very great pleaſure: which done, they committed each other to God. So departed the Prince from this company, and right-ſoone found <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who attended for him at the Kings lodging dore, with the reſt of his Armes and his Horſe, whereon he mounted, and left the Citie vnſeene of any, becauſe as yet it was not day ſo rod they on till they came into a Forreſt.</p>
                  <p>Now is the greateſt part of the day ſpent, before they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelues in any place: but hunger conſtrained them to feede on ſuch viandes as <hi>Gandalin</hi> had brought with him from the Citie. During this time, they heard in the Wood on their right hand the voyce of ſome one, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to them very doleful, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prince rode preſently that way: where he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a knight dead, and hard by him another in little better caſe, for he was ſo wounded, that he had no hope to liue. As for the partie that ſo cried, it was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who lay vpon the knight, preſſing him ſo ſoore, as made his hart to faile him: and which was worſt of all, the villanous woman tocauſe his death the ſooner, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly thruſt her hands into his wounds. But when the wounded knight eſpied the Prince, ſo well as he could he craued ſuccor, ſaying. Ah gentle Sir, for Gods ſake ſuffer me not to be thus murthered by this ribaud. Greatly was the Prince abaſhed at this wicked dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and therefore very roughly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7181:18"/>
thus ſpake. Woman withdraw your ſelfe, for you doe the thing not beſeeming you or your like. She as one aſhamed, retired, and the Knight full of anguiſh fell in a ſwoune, which made the Prince very deſirous to know what he was: but fearing that he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy yeelded his breath, quickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, &amp; vſed ſuch good meanes as reuiued him againe, when he began to cry. Ah I am dead, good friends bring me to ſome place where I may haue councell for my ſoule. Take courage, anſwered the Prince, for you ſhal haue what you demand: but I pray ye tell me, what fortune brought ye hither, or where is he that hath thus hardly intreated ye? It is, ſaid the Knight, through this wicked woman, who (albeit I was rich and puiſſant, yea far much more then ſhe) I made choiſe, for the good loue I bare her, and eſpouſed her as my wife: neuertheleſſe ſhe diſcourteous creature, forgetting the good and honor I had done her, hath ſundry times abandoned her honeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, namely this night paſt with this Knight here dead, whom I hauing neuer before ſeene, by chance yeſterday he came to me: and this laſt night thus villanouſly abuſed me, where taking him with the head, we had a combate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein (as you ſee) he loſt his life. But when this ſtrumpet ſaw I had ſlaine him, fearing I would do as much to her: ſhe fell at my feete and deſired pardon, whereto I eaſily condiſcended, prouided, that ſhe offended no more. Hereupon, I intreated her to bind vp my wounds, but ſhe perceiuing how grieuouſly I was hurt, and brought into very weake eſtate through ouer-much loſſe of my bloud, to reuenge the adulterous villaines death, ſhe aſſaied to kill me outright: and to make me lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the more in dying, cruelly ſhe thruſt her hands into my wounds, ſo that well I perceiue I cannot long liue. Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech ye good Sir, helpe me to an Hermitage which is neere at hand, where I ſhall find ſome religious man, to comfort me in the agonie of my Soule. Such compaſſion tooke the Prince on him, as he and <hi>Gandalin</hi> taking him in their armes, caried him on a Horſe to the Hermitage: in meane while the wretched woman ſtole away priuily, and a little before, ſhe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that her Husband would be reuenged on her, ſent for helpe to three of her bretheren, who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not far from that place, giuing them to vnderſtand which way they ſhould come. In her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring they met with her, and ſhe had no ſooner eſpied them, but ſhe thus cried out. Ah helpe me good bretheren, for heere before is a theefe, who hath ſlaine this Knight which lieth heere, and hath beſide ſo wounded my Husband: as there is no hope of life left in him: let him not therefore eſcape ye, nor he that is in his company, becauſe the one is as deepe in the euill as the other. Such like ſpeeches vſed this Harlot, that by the death of the Prince and <hi>Gandalin,</hi> her treaſon might be couered: therefore that her Husband ſhould not dy alone with her will, ſhe ſhewed them the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> euen as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Hermitage where he left the wounded Knight. Here-upon the three bretheren (too light of beleefe) galloped toward him, crying. Traitour thou art but dead. You lye villaines, anſwered the Prince, for right well ſhall I defend my ſelfe from ſuch traitours as you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7181:19"/>
are. Beſtirre thy ſelfe then, ſaid the bretheren, for thou haſt offended vs all three, and we all wil be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on thee if we may. By good hap the Prince had his Sheeld and Launce ready, and his Helmet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well laced, wherefore without any further anſwer, he ſharply charged them, and meeting with the firſt, pearced through both his Sheeld and arme: and withall threw his Horſe &amp; him ſo fiercely againſt the ground, as his right ſhoulder was broken in the fall: in like manner was one of the Horſes legges, ſo that neither the one or other could riſe. At this encounter he brake his Launce, wherefore he ſuddenly drew his Sword, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelfe to the other twaine, gaue one of them ſuch a forcible ſtroke, as ſlicing through his Armour, entred the fleſh to the very bone on his ſhoulder like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſo that therewith he fell from his ſaddle. Being thus diſpatched of two, he came to the third, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him with ſuch a ſound blow on the Helmet, as the poore Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was conſtrained to imbrace the necke of his Horſe, thereby to ſheeld himſelfe from falling, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe as greatly amazed as the other were. Here-upon the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that brought them thether fled away, which the Prince percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing cried to <hi>Gandalin</hi> that he ſhould ſtay her: in meane while the firſt Knight hauing recouered himſelfe, vſed theſe ſpeeches to the Prince. We know not Sir, whether this fight hath beene for right or wrong, For right it could not be, anſwered the Prince, vnleſſe you thinke I haue done wrong, in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring the husband to this trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous woman, whom cruelly ſhe hath cauſed to dy. When the three Knights heard that, they were very much abaſhed, and then thought they had bene abuſed by their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wherefore they thus replied. In ſooth my Lord, ſo pleaſe you to aſſure vs, we will ſhew on what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion we aſſailed you. You ſhall haue good aſſurance ſo to doe, ſaid the Prince, yet will I not acquit ye from the combate. Then he that firſt ſpake, reherſed all the words of their ſiſter, according as hath beene already declared. In good ſooth quoth the Prince, neuer was villanie diſguiſed in ſuch ſorte, for ſhe hath done far otherwiſe: as you may vnderſtand by her husband himſelfe, who being nere his death, I conuaied to an Hermitage hard at hand. Seeing it hath ſo fallen out, ſaid the three bretheren, diſpoſe of vs as they that remain at your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And mercy ſhall ye haue, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Prince, if firſt ye will loyally ſweare to me, that you will cary this woman and her husband, to the Court of King <hi>Languines,</hi> &amp; there before him recite al that hath happened: ſaying withall how you were thereto conſtrained by a yong Knight that ſent ye thether, &amp; who this day departed from his Court, deſiring him to cenſure on this miſ-deed as he ſhall thinke good. All this they promiſed and ſwore to performe: wherefore commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to God, he rode away, leauing them together.</p>

One of them bare a Launce in her hand, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were come to the Prince, ſhe with the Launce aduanced her ſelfe to him ſaying. My Lord, take this Launce which I giue ye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I can aſſure ye, that within three dayes it will ſtand ye in good ſteed, as therewith you ſhall deliuer from death, the houſe from whence ye are diſcended. The Prince amazed at theſe words, thus anſwered. How can it be Lady, that a houſe ſhould, liue or dye; It ſhalbe, quoth ſhe, euen ſo as I haue ſaid, and this preſent I was deſirous to bring ye, as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of recompence, for two fauours I hope to receiue by you, the firſt whereof ſhall be: <hi>When one of your beſt friends, ſhall by you haue one of the greateſt honors that euer he can receiue, whereby he ſhall fall into the deepeſt danger, that any Knight hath done theſe ten yeeres ſpace.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me Lady, anſwered the Prince, ſuch honor (if God pleaſe) I will not doe my friend. Full well I known, quoth the Damoſell, that ſo it ſhall come to paſſe: then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on her Palfray, departed: this Damoſell you muſt note, was <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda the vnknowne.</hi> When the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Damoſell (who heard the words) ſaw her forſake her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſhe determined for certaine daies to ſtay with the Prince, to ſee what he ſhould doe, wherefore ſhe ſaid. My Lord, although I am a ſtranger, if you thinke it conuenei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, I would gladly for a while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with ye, deferring a iourny that I haue to my miſtreſſe. The Prince well perceiued ſhe was a ſtranger, which made him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of whence ſhe was: where-to ſhe replied, that ſhe was of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</hi> And that himſelfe could not gain-ſay, becauſe her language gaue aſſurance thereof, for hauing heard his Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> at her firſt comming into <hi>Scotland,</hi> it made him the better remember that Country ſpeech, whereupon he ſaid. If you pleaſe (faire Damoſell) to goe with me, I will defend ye to my power: but I pray ye tell me, if you know the other Lady that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen now gaue me this Launce? Truely Sir, quoth ſhe, neuer did I ſee her, till now I met her on the way, and then ſhe ſaid to me: that the Launce ſhe caried, ſhe would giue to the beſt Knight in the world, deſiring me (withall) to let you vnderſtand after her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſhe bare you great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how ſhe was named <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda the vnknowne.</hi> Ah God, quoth he, how infortunate am I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ot knowing her, if I forbare now preſently to follow her, you muſt thinke Lady the cauſe is, that I cannot find her againſt her will: and thus deuiſing they rode on,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7181:20"/>
vntill the dark euening ouer-tooke them.</p>
                  <p>At this time it ſo chanced that they met with a Squire, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded where they intended to find lodging trauailing ſo late. Where we can, anſwered the Prince. In good faith, ſaid the Squire, if you meane to haue lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, you muſt leaue the way which now you take, for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long time come to any that way: but if you will follow me, I will conduct you to a Caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to my father, who ſhall do you all the honor and good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment may be deuiſed. The Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel thinking this councel good, deſired the Prince to accept there-of, which he did, therefore the Squire rode before them as their guide, leading them derectly forth of the way, becauſe he had neuer ſeene the combates of Knights er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand: and hoping to conduct them the day following to a Caſtell where ſuch paſtime was vſed, but that night he brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their lodging, feaſting and entertaining them very ſumptuouſly: yet could the Prince take no reſt all the night, for thinking on the Lady that brought him the Launce. On the morrow very early they would be gone, and taking leaue of their hoſte, the Squire ſaid he would bring them againe into their way, acquainting the Prince as he rode, with the cuſtome of the Caſtell, which being very neere at hand he ſhewed them: the Caſtell ſtanding very ſtrong and pleaſantly, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ran a huge ſwift Riuer, and no paſſage thereto, but ouer a long draw-bridge, hauing at the end a faire Tower for defence thereof. When the Prince beheld it, he thought he muſt needs paſſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the bridge, yet he asked the Squire if there were any other way. No my Lord, quoth he, for this is the vſaull paſſage. March on then, ſaid the Prince, wherewith the Squire, the Damoſell and their company ſet forward, but the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the ſea</hi> remaining behind, entred into ſuch thought of his Lady <hi>Oriana,</hi> as he had well neere forgotten himſelfe: but at length he heard the noyſe of ſixe Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, armed with Corſlets and Helmets, who at the entrance of the bridge had arreſted the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and there would force her to take an oath, that ſhe ſhould neuer beare loue to hir friend, if he would not promiſe her to aide King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt King <hi>Perion:</hi> which ſhe refuſing, cried to the Prince for his aſſiſtance. This cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour made him forget his muſing, when adreſſing himſelfe to the Palliardes, he ſaid. Traiterous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, who commanded you to lay hands on this Lady being in my charge; In ſpeaking theſe words, he came to the chiefeſt of the ſixe, from whom right-ſoone he caught his hatchet, and gaue him ſuch a ſtroke therewith, as he fell to the ground. All the other together pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet vpon him, but one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſliced to the very teeth, and ſooner after another bare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, with the loſſe of his arme. When the three that were left ſaw their companions ſo handled, they tooke themſelues to flight, and the Prince followed them ſo neere, as one of them left his legge behinde him, the other twaine he let go, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning where he left the Damoſel, to whom he ſaid. Now boldly go on, and like euill fortune may they haue, that encourage any villany, to lay forſible hand on Lady or Damoſell. She being aſſured by theſe words, went on with the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7181:20"/>
Prince and his Squires: but ere they had gone any thing far, they heard a great noyſe &amp; tumult with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſtell. Me thinkes Sir, ſaid the Damoſel, I heare a meruailous murmuring within this Fortreſſe, therefore I would aduiſe ye to take the reſt of your armour. Goe on quoth the Prince, and feare not, for where Ladies are euill entreated (who ought euery where to goe in ſafety) there hardly abideth any man of valew. In ſooth, ſaid ſhe, if you doe not what I haue deſired, I will not paſſe any further: and ſo much ſhee perſwaded him, that at length he laced on his Helmet: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he went into the Caſtell, at the entrance whereof, he met a ſquire weeping, who ſaid. Ah God, why will they murder (without cauſe) the beſt knight in the world? alas they wold inforce him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, what is impoſſible for him to accompliſh. Theſe words of the Squire, could not ſtay the Prince, for he ſaw King <hi>Perion</hi> (who had ſo lately Knighted him) very hardly vſed by two Knights, who with the helpe of ten armed Halberders had round beſet him, ſaying ſweare, if not, thou dieſt. Greatly did it grieue the Prince, to ſee ſuch out-rage offered to King <hi>Perion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thus called to them. Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous villaines, what moues you to miſuſe the beſt Knight in the world; by heauen you ſhall all die for him. At theſe words, one of the Knights left the King, and taking fiue Halberders with him, came to the Prince, ſaying. It likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth you to ſweare, if not, you can eſcape no better then an other. What? quoth he, ſhal I then ſweare againſt my will; by Gods leaue it ſhall not be ſo. Then they of the Caſtell cryed to the Porter, that he ſhould ſhut the gate, wherefore the Prince now ſaw he muſt ſtand vpon his defence: whereupon hee ran fiercely againſt the Knight, charging him in ſuch ſorte, as he fell downe dead ouer the crupper of his Horſe, for in the fall he brake his necke. Which the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, not tarring any longer with the Halberders, came to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knight that combated with K. <hi>Perton,</hi> piercing his Launce quite through his body, ſo that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the firſt in fortune King <hi>Perion</hi> ſeeing himſelfe thus ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, ſo cheered vp his hart, as he did much better then before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemies, cauſing them by ſharpe ſtrokes of his Sword to retire: in meane while the <hi>Gentle-man of the ſea,</hi> (being on Horſe-backe) ranne among them and ſcattered them, tumbling one downe heere, and another there, ſo that at length by the aid of the king, they were all ſlaine, except certaine that fled away on the top of the walles. But the Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and followed them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they were ſo affrighted, as they caſt themſelues downe headlong fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wals: only two got them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Chamber, where they thought to remaine in ſafetie, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he purſued them ſo neer, as he buckled <hi>pel mel</hi> with them. But within the Chamber on a bed lay an ancient knight, whoſe vnweldy age had taken from him the vſe of his legges, to them that came in he vſed theſe ſpeeches. Cowardly vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom run ye ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; From a knight, anſwered one of them, who hath plaide the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in your Caſtell, for he hath ſlaine your two Nephewes, and all our companions. As thus he ſpake, the Prince caught him by the head, ſaying. Tell me (villaine) where is the Lord of this place, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

eſſe thou dieſt. The poore man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe in ſuch perill, ſhewed him the old knight lying on the bed: but when the Prince ſaw him ſo old and decrepite, he blamed him in this manner. Thou wretched olde man, hath death already ſeazed on thy bones, and yet dooſt thou cauſe ſuch a wicked cuſtome to be maintained heere? Well dooth thine age excuſe thee from bearing Armes, yet ſhall I giue thee thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert belonging to ſuch a villaine. With theſe words he made offer to ſmite off his head: Wherefore the affrighted olde man cried: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my Lord, for Gods ſake mercy. None at all, quoth the Prince, thou art dead if thou ſweareſt not to me, that while thou liueſt, ſuch like treaſon ſhall be no more maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this place: whereto the olde knight right gladly tooke his oath. Now tell mee, ſaide the Prince, wherefore haſt thou heeretofore kept this cuſtome heere; For the loue of King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Knight, who is mine Nephew, and becauſe I cannot aid him with my perſon in his warre, I was deſirous to ſuccour him with ſuch Knights errand as paſſed this way. Falſe villaine, anſwered the Prince, what haue Knights er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to do with thy deſire: ſo ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bed with his foote, threw it downe, and the olde Knight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derit: where commending him to all the Diuels, he left him, and comming downe into the Court, tooke a Horſe which was one of the ſlaine Knights, and bringing it to the King, ſaid. Mount your ſelfe my Lord, for it little likes me to ſtay any longer here, where ſuch bad people haue their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The king preſently went to Horſe-bake, and ſo they rode toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the Caſtell: but the Prince fearing leaſt the king ſhould know him, would by no meanes take off his Helmet, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they rode along, the king thus ſpake to him. I pray ye Sir knight tell me of whence you are, that haue ſuccoured me when I was ſo neere my death: warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me alſo hereafter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this place, &amp; ſhewing your ſelfe a good friend to Ladies and knights errand. As for me, I am the ſame man againſt whom they kept this ſtraight paſſage, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cruell oath for which you combated. My Lord, anſwered the Prince, I am a knight deſirous to do you any ſeruice. Beleeue me, quoth the king, that haue I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well perceiued, for hardly ſhould I haue found ſo good a friend to helpe me: yet will I not giue ouer till I know ye. Alas my Lord, ſaid he, that will little profit ye. Notwithſtanding, quoth the King, I pray ye take off your Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met: which he would not do, but put downe his Beuer a little. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king ſaw that his intreatie would not preuaile, he deſired the Damoſell to obtaine ſo much for him: whereto ſhe condiſcended, tooke the Prince by the hand, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I beſeechye Sir, grant the king what he hath requeſted. He ſeeing her importunate, took off his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, when preſently the king knew him, that it was the ſame man he had knighted at the Ladies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherefore embracing him, he ſaid. Right glad am I to know ſo deere a friend. My Lord, quoth the Prince, I knew you ſo ſoone as I came to the Caſtell, to be the man that gaue me mine order of knight-hood, wherewith (ſo pleaſe it God) I meane to ſerue you while your warre continueth in <hi>Gaule:</hi> &amp; willingly I would not be knowne
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7181:21"/>
by any one till your troubles be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. You ha ue already, ſaid the King, done ſo much for me, as I reſt bounden to you while I liue, allowing you to diſpoſe of me and mine: and if (as you ſay) you come into <hi>Gaule,</hi> you ſhall augment with aduauntage the honor due to you, then iuſtly may I tearme the hower happy, that it was my fortune to make ſo good a Knight. Such like words vſed King <hi>Perion,</hi> litle thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king how neere they were allied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; thus they rode deuiſing, till at length they came to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, when he demanded of the King, which of thoſe waies pleaſed him to take. This on the left hand, anſwered the King, becauſe it gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth directly to my Country. God haue you then in his keeping, ſaid the Prince, for I muſt needes ride this other way. I pray ye, quoth the King, remember your comming into <hi>Gaule</hi> as you promiſed me, for the hope I haue in you, hath abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged part of my ſorrow, and giueth me aſſurance withall, that by your meanes I ſhall recouer my loſſe. So tooke they leaue of each other, the king toward <hi>Gaule,</hi> and the Prince in company with the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell and <hi>Gandalin:</hi> but becauſe ſhe had now ſeene what ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, namely the proofe of the Launce which <hi>Vrganda</hi> gaue him, ſhe wold trauaile no further out of her way, but turning to the Prince, ſaid. I haue hetherto (my Lord) with right good will kept ye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, becauſe the Lady that gaue ye the Launce, ſaid ſhe brought it to the beſt knight in the world, and ſurely I haue ſeene ſo much, as I ſtand in no doubt of her ſpeeches: wherefore I ſhall now ſhape my courſe to find her I am ſent to, as before I tolde ye. I pray ye Lady, quoth he, tell me what ſhe is. It is, ſaid ſhe, the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> Daughter to king <hi>Liſuart</hi> of great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> When he heard her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med whom he loued ſo deerely, his hart began to tremble in ſuch ſorte, as he had fallen beſide his Horſe, but that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalin</hi> ſtaied him, yet fetching a great ſigh, ſaid. Ah God, my hart faileth me, the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell thinking ſome ſudden ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was the cauſe thereof, would haue had him vnarmed: but hee tolde her it was needleſſe, for he was oftentimes wont to feele ſuch paſſions. The Squire (who all this while had beene their guide) tooke leaue of the Prince, as king the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell if her way lay toward the Courte of King <hi>Languines:</hi> which ſhe affirming, he ſaid he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her thether, becauſe hee had buſines of ſome importance there. So hauing courteouſly ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each other, they returned the ſame way they came, &amp; the Prince rode on with <hi>Gandalin</hi> to ſeeke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures.</p>
                  <p>Heere leaueth the Author, to tel ye what happened to <hi>Galaor,</hi> whom the Giant caried away, and gaue in keeping to the aged Hermet, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready you haue heard. By this time had <hi>Galaor</hi> attained the age of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres, meruailouſly encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in ſtature &amp; comely perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: hauing no other exerciſe, then reading on a Booke which the olde man lent him, diſcourſing the deeds of Armes of ſundry an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Knights. Heerein he tooke ſo great pleaſure, as on this occaſion, as alſo by a naturall inſtinct, he was deſirous to be Knighted, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, he knew not whether by right ſuch honor appertained to him, Very earneſtly he queſtioned thereon with the Hermet, but the holy man who knew right well, that ſo ſoone as he receiued the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7181:22"/>
order, he ſhould combate againſt the Giant <hi>Albadan:</hi> his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with teares, he thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. My ſoone, much better were it for you to labour in the ſafetie of your ſoule, then to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture on the order of Knight-hood, which is to be maintained with wonderous trauaile. Father, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> very hardly ſhall I follow the calling, which I take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will: but in that whereof my hart hath made choyſe, if God grant me good ſucceſſe, will I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his ſeruice, for there-out may I not be during life. The good Hermit, who then well perceiued his grounded reſolution, replied. Certes my Sonne, ſeeing you are determined to follow Armes, I can well aſſure ye, that through fault of high linage, you neede not diſpaire of good hap, in reſpect you are ſon to a King and Queene: but keepe that to your ſelfe, and let not the Giant know how I told ye ſo much. When <hi>Galaor</hi> heard this, he was exceedingly contented, ſaying to the Hermit. In ſooth Father, the care I haue had all my life time to be a Knight, hath beene very great: but now I thanke God and you, I am rid thereof, for by that you haue tolde me, I cannot miſſe ofit. The Hermit noting his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt affection, doubted leaſt ſoone after he would be gone: wherefore he gaue the Giant to know his Schollers forwardnes, as alſo how his conſtitution did now very well ſerue him, being wonderfull deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of his knight-hood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould now deale in the cauſe as beſt himſelfe pleaſed. No ſooner was the Giant enformed hereof, but preſently he got him to Horſe-backe, and rode to the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, with whom he found <hi>Galaor,</hi> of more large ſtature then his yeeres expreſſed, very comely and beautyfull in euery parte, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he thus ſpake to him. I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Sonne, that you would be a Knight to follow Armes, truely you ſhall, prepare your ſelfe to go with me when time ſerueth, and your deſire ſhalbe honorably ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Father anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> heerein conſiſteth the ſumme of mine affection: ſo not long after, the Giant departed from the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, taking <hi>Galaor</hi> with him, who falling on his knee before the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent olde man, deſired that as he had fatherly nourſhed him, ſo ſtill he would remember him in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout oriſons. The holy man with the teares tricling downe his cheekes, kiſſed and bleſſed him, then mounted <hi>Galaor</hi> on Horſ-back and followed the Giant, who brought him home to his Caſtell: where for certaine time he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to combate at Armes, as alſo brauely to manage Horſes, hauing all things conuenient for the ſame, and two maiſters very expert there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. When he had continued a yeere at theſe exerciſes, the Giant ſeeing him worthy to receiue honor, &amp; ſtrong enough to endure chiualrie: diſpoſed thereon as you ſhall read hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now againe doth the Author leaue him, and diſcourſeth of that which chanced to the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> who after he departed from King <hi>Perion</hi> and the Damoſell, rod two daies together, without any aduenture: and on the third about mid-day, he arriued at a very good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fortreſſe, that appertained to a Gentleman named <hi>Galpan.</hi> This <hi>Galpan</hi> was then the moſt valiant Knight in all that Country, and therefore was greatly feared of all his Neighbours, yet did he there maintaine an abhominable and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7181:22"/>
wicked cuſtome: forgetting God, who was cheefely to be honored, bequeathed his endeuours to the ſeruice of the Diuell. For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained all Ladies and Damoſells that paſſed by his Caſtell, to enter in, where vilainouſly he tooke his pleaſure of them: and not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, enforced them to ſweare, that while they liued they ſhould beare affection to none but him, if any denied, he cauſed them cruelly to be put to death. Likewiſe he compelled ſuch Knights as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed that way, to combate one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, againſt his two bretheren, but if they were vanquiſhed, he would force the conquerour to deale with himſelfe, he being the moſt hardy knight in al thoſe parts. If it happened that he brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into any debilitie, he would take from them all they had, turning them away on foote, after he had made them ſweare, to name them-ſelues while they liued, the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>Galpan,</hi> otherwiſe, hee would depriue them of life. But God diſpleaſed with the cruelty, which ſo long time he had vſed to the hurt of many good people, would now alter this great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, and that <hi>Galpan</hi> with his complices ſhould receiue guerdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their deſerts, making them an example to all other, as you ſhall heare preſently recited.</p>

This ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full woman breathed forth many griueous ſighes, ſhewing a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kind of warre, betweene her hands and the golden treſſes of her haire, which ſhe diſcheueled and rent very pitifully. Hereat was the Prince not a little amazed, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to know what moued her to theſe extreames, he came to her with theſe ſpeeches. Faire Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I pray ye tel me the cauſe of your ſorrow. Ah my Lord, qd. ſhee, death would be now right welcome to me, being the onely friend to beare me company: for ſuch is my misfortune, as teares are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for me then rememberance of the cauſe. In ſooth Lady, ſaide the Prince, if in any reſpect I can do ye good, you ſhall find me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy withall my hart. Being ſent Sir, quoth the Damoſell, by my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes commandement, to a yong Knight, a man of ſome account in theſe parts, and paſſing along this way: foure cruell villaines ſet vpon me, and (whether I would or no) brought me into this Caſtel where a traiterous Knight diſhonorably forced me, compelling me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſweare, that I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loue any friend but him. This complaint moued the Prince to great admiration, and thus he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Follow me Lady, for your iniury ſhalbe reuenged, if God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7181:23"/>
give me leaue. Heereupon the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell immediatly went with him, and by the way he deſired her to tell him, what the man was to whom ſhe was ſent. If you reuenge my wrong quoth ſhe, I will tell ye: but I can aſſure ye he is ſuch a one, as will be right ſory when he hears of my miſuſage. Great reaſon, ſaid the Prince, hath he ſo to do: and as thus they communed together, they came to the place where ſhee ſhewed him the foure Gardants, to whom he preſently ſaid. Diſloyall varlets, wherefore haue ye abuſed this Lady as ſhe trauailed on her iournie? Becauſe (quoth they; wee ſtood in no feare of you: but if you get ye not the ſooner, your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment ſhalbe worſe then hers was. Without any more talking he drew his Sword, and comming to one that heaued his hatchet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, quite cut away the right arme from his body: then turning to another, cleft him ouer the face to the very eares. When the reſt ſaw their companions thus mained, they fled away ſo faſt as they could, running through a by way along a Riuer ſide: but the Prince making no ſhew of purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, wiped his Sword and put it vp againe, then comming to the Damoſell, bad her go forward. My Lord, quoth ſhe, hard by is a gate, where I found two armed Knigthts attending. Well, ſaid he, and I ſhall find them when I come thether. So rode they on, &amp; as the Prince entred the baſe court, he ſaw the Dungeon dore open, and an armed Knight on Horſe back come forth, after whom they within let downe a Port-cullis, and ſhut the dore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: then the Knight of the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell aduancing himſelfe, very bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus ſpake to the Prince. Poore wretch, too ſoone art thou come hether to receiue ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor. Diſhonor? quoth Prince, tuſh theſe are but words, leaue what ſhall happen to the preſence of God, who only is skilfull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and tell if thou be the villaine that did force this Lady? No, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Knight, but if it were I, what then? I meane, quoth the Prince, to reuenge her wrong if I can. Go to, ſaid the Knight, I ſhall ſee then what kinde of reuendge you vſe. So giuing the Spurrs to his Horſe, ran as fiercely as he could againſt the Prince, yet he failed in the attaint: but the Prince meeting him with full carire, gaue him ſuch a greeting with his Launce through the Sheeld, as the armour being vnable to reſiſt it, let paſſe the yron through both his ſhoulders, whereby he fell downe dead in the place. Hauing with-drawne his Launce, prepared him-ſelfe for another that came to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor the firſt, who pearcing quite through the Princes Sheeld, left the head of his Launce in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which was of ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t profe: but in the encounter he met his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie ſo derectly, as he rent his Helmet from his head, caſting him ſo violently off his Saddie, as hee was able to ſit no more on Horſe-backe. The Knight ſeeing himſelfe thus vnarmed, cried for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to come helpe him, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three Halberders iſſued forth, to whom he ſaid: Looke well my friendes that this man eſcape vs not. At theſe words, they ranne all three violently on the Prince, and buckled ſo neere him, as they ſlew his Horſe betweene his leggs, whereby he was conſtrained to fight on foote: and ſo offended was he thereat, that hauing reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered himſelfe, he ſmote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Launce through the Knights head, which made him preſently yeeld the ghoſt. And now he beſtirres himſelfe againſt the other three, who cowardly ſtealing behinde him, wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him on the ſhoulder, whereby he loſt a great quantity of his bloud: but full well he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed the villaine that did it, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the deereſt bloud he had in his body, by cleauing him with his Sword as it bad beene an Axe. The other two terrified heer-with, ranne vp into a long Gallery, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Come my Lord, come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for we are all vanquiſhed. In meane while, the Prince ſeeing his owne Horſe was ſlaine, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on that belonged to the knight he ſlew laſt: ſoone after he ſaw an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Knight ſtand looking forth at a dore, who perceiuing the Prince had eſpied him, ſaid. What hath moued thee to come in heere and kill my people? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, anſwered the Prince, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deſire I haue to reuenge this Lady, who hath beene here wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged moſt diſhonorably. As thus he ſpake, the Damoſell came to him, and knowing the Lord of the Caſtell that forced her, ſhe ſaid. Ah gentle Knight, ſee that this monſter eſcape you not, for by him haue I loſt my former honor. Libidinous Ruffian, quoth the Prince, deerely ſhalt thou pay for thy diſloyall dealing: Goe arme thee, elſe will I ſlay thee naked as thou art, for to thee or ſuch like villaines ought to be vſed no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: but the Damoſell more and and more ſtill cried. Kill, kill the Traitour, that hereafter he liue not to abuſe any more, otherwiſe will their ſhame be laid to your charge. Lewde woman, anſwered the Knight, in an euill hower came he hither by thy councell, and in thy company. And thou that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt me ſo brauely, attend my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and flie not away, for by no other meanes canſt thou warrant thy ſelfe. So he departed, and ſoon after came armed into the Court, where he mounted on a luſty white Courſer: then comming to the Prince, he began to menace him, ſaying. Well maiſt thou curſſe the time that euer thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt this Damoſell, for it will coſt thee the price of thy head. Each one, ſaid the Prince, muſt keepe his head ſo well as he may, and he that cannot, let him looſe it. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out longer ſtay they coutched their Launces, which at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter ran into their Sheelds and armour, wounding ſome-what deep into their fleſh: and ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly did their bodies meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they were both laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on the gound, when quickly recouering themſelues, with their Swords drawne they prepare to the combate. Fierce and cruell ſtrokes were giuen on either ſide, to the great admiration of ſuch as beheld them, for many peeces of their Sheelds &amp; armour was ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred round about them: &amp; which is more, their Helmets were ſo torne and battered, as oftentimes their bare heads bore off the blowes, ſo that the ground was coloured with their bloud: but <hi>Galpan</hi> had receiued a wound through the ſight of his Helmet, which made the bloud trickle into his eyes, and he to wipe them retited backe alit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. What <hi>Galpan?</hi> ſaid the Prince, deſireſt thou to breath? doſt thou not remember that thou fighteſt for my head? if thou defendeſt not thine owne well, thou art like to looſe it. Be patient a while, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galpan,</hi> and let vs breath a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for we haue time enough to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7181:24"/>
make an end. It is no reaſonable motion, ſaid the Prince, ſeeing I fight not with thee for curteſie, but to reuenge the diſhonor thou haſt done to this Lady. With theſe words he gaue him ſuch a ſtroke on the head, as made him fall to the ground on his knees, yet quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he aroſe and tooke hart a freſh: but the Prince would not let him range about as he deſired, for hee was ſo out of breath, that he could hardly lift vp his Sword, wherefore he did nothing but croutch vnder his Sheeld, yet was it ſo ſliced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in peeces, as very little was left to defend himſelfe withall. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> ſeeing he had no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, began to flye before the Sword of his enimie, and at length (as his laſt refuge) thought to ſaue him-ſelfe in a little Tower which his Gardants vſed to ſtand in: but the Prince following him hard at the heeles, got him by the Helmet and puld it off, and giuing a full ſtroke at him, therewith ſmot his head from the ſhoulders, afterward he came to the Damoſell, ſaying. Faire Lady, now may you chouſe an other friend if you pleaſe, for he to whom you promiſed, hath diſcharged ye of the bargaine. Thankes be to God and you Sir, quoth ſhe: and as they returned from the Tower, they heard the dore ſhut too, wherefore he mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on <hi>Galpans</hi> Horſe, which was eſteemed one of the goodlyeſt in the world, and ſaid to the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. I pray ye Lady, now let vs be gone hence. My Lord, quoth ſhe, if it like you, I will cary his head to him whom I am ſent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to him on your behalfe. Do not ſo, ſaid the Prince, for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage will be too troubleſome, but take the Helmet if you will. The Damoſell liking well of his aduiſe, commanded her Squire to cary it with him: and ſo they rode from the Caſtell, the ſeruants whereof were all gone, &amp; had left the gates wide open. But the Prince not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Damoſels promiſe, that ſhe would tel him the Knights name ſhe was ſent vnto: therefore earneſtly he entreated her to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him therein. Good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quoth ſhe, his name is <hi>Agraies,</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Praiſed be God, ſaid the Prince, who made me able to do ſo much, as ſo good a Knight ſhall be no more wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by traiterous <hi>Galpan:</hi> for you are (in mine opinion) well auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and worthily may you call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> a good Knight, in reſpect he is one of the beſt I know, and if for him you haue receiued diſhonor, it now returneth to your commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Go then and ſay to him, that a Knight of his, humbly ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, whom he ſhall field at the warres in <hi>Gaule</hi> when he commeth thither. Gentle Sir, quoth ſhe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you loue him ſo well, I pray ye grant me one requeſt. That will I, quoth the Prince. Let me then, ſaid ſhe, vnderſtand your name. Lady, quoth he, at this time forbeare the knowledge thereof, and command what elſe you pleaſe, you ſhall not be denied. No other thing will I deſire anſwered the Damoſell. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, ſaid the Prince, it is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle courteſie to requeſt the thing, which willingly I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale to any one.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7181:24"/>
not a little glad that ſhe knew his name: but when he was gone from her, he remembred the wound on his ſhoulder, which ſtill bled very freſhly, ſo that he might eaſily be tract by his bloud, &amp; on his white Horſe it had dropt in many places. At euening he came ſome-what neere a Fortreſſe, where he beheld a knight vnarmed comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, and after he had well viewed him, he ſaid. My Lord, I pray you tell me where haue you beene ſo wounded? In ſooth, quoth the Prince, at a Caſtle not very far hence. And how, ſaid the Knight, came you by that goodly white Horſe; I tooke it, anſwered the Prince, in requitall of mine owne, that was there ſlaine by traiterous villaines. But would <hi>Galpan,</hi> quoth the Knight, ſuffer ye ſo to do? Yea mary Sir, replied the Prince, he is now become more patient, for hee hath endured the loſſe of his head. When the Knight heard of <hi>Galpans</hi> death, he preſently alighted from his Horſe, and ran to kiſſe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces feete: but he would not ſuffer him, yet could he not hold him from embracing his Sheeld, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Ah Gentle Knight, how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am I indebted to you; you are to this place the moſt wellcome man in the world, for by your meanes haue I thorowly recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mine honor. Leaue wee this talke, ſaid the Prince, &amp; ſay where I may quickly finde ſome remedy for my wounds. In my houſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the knight, abideth a Neece of mine, who ſhal heale your hurts better then any other. So riding on they arriued at the caſtle, where being diſmounted, they walked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great hall, the Knight repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the way, how <hi>Galpan</hi> had kept him from bearing Armes one whole yeere and a halfe, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to change his name, and ſweare to call himſelfe while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the conquered by <hi>Galpan:</hi> but now, quoth he, ſeeing he is dead, mine honor is reſtored me againe. Afterwarde he cauſed the Prince to be vnarmed, and laid in a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous bed, where his wounds were dilligently attended by the Lady, who aſſur ed him in ſhort timeto make him well againe: if he would be aduiſed by her councell, which he promiſed faithfully to do.</p>

he thanked the Knight that had ſent them to his Courte, yet could he not gueſſe who it was, for he nor any body elſe knew that the <hi>Gentlman of the ſea</hi> was Knighted, but the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> and the Ladies which accompanied her in the Chappell. Full ſoone was hee aduertiſed of his abſence from the Courte, but he thought hee was gone to viſite his father <hi>Gandales:</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King turning to the knight in the Litter, ſaid.

My Lord, quoth the Knight, doe therein as it ſhal like your maiſtey: as for me, I will neuer conſent that the thing I moſt loue ſhould die. This ſaid, the Knights tooke their leaue of the King, carying backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their brother in the Litter: leauing their ſiſter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue iuſtice by the Kings appoint<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who after their departure cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for her &amp; ſaid.

The execution being doone, the King was in greater penſiueneſſe then before, becauſe he knew not who the new knight ſhould be, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo ſuddenly from his Court: but the Squire ſtanding by, which lodged the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> &amp; afterward conducted him to the Caſtell, where he deliuered King <hi>Perion</hi> from death, began to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it was his gueſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid to the King. It may be (my Lord) a yong Knight, with whom the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and my ſelfe were certaine daies, and then we left him when wee came thither. Knoweſt thou his name? quoth the King. No my Lord, quoth the Squire, but hee is both yong and very beautyfull: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide I ſaw him do ſuch rare deeds of Chiualrie in ſo little time, as in mine opinion if I liue, he will proue one of the beſt Knights in the world. Then diſcourſed he at large euery action, as alſo how hee deliuered King <hi>Perion</hi> in the time of great danger. When the King had noted well his taile, his deſire to know him increaſed now more and more. My Lord, quoth the Squire, the Damoſell that came hether with me, happily can tel ye more tydings of him, for it was my chance to meet them together. Of what Damoſell ſpeakeſt thou? ſaid the King. Of her, anſwered the Squire, that lately came from great <hi>Brittaine</hi> to Madame <hi>Oriana.</hi> Preſently was ſhe ſent for, and hee demanded what the Knight was of whom there went ſuch reporte. Whereupon ſhe declared ſo much as ſhe knew, cheefely the occaſion wherefore ſhe rode with him, and in what manner the Launce was giuen him by <hi>Vrganda,</hi> as to the onely Knight in the world: but in ſooth, quoth ſhee, I know not his name, for neuer could I learne it of him. Ah God, ſaid the King, how may it be? Now was <hi>Oriana</hi> voyde of all doubting, for ſhee well knew it was her <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> but ſhee was ſo grieued with the news, which the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> had brought her, as ſhee well knew not whom ſhe might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine to: for the king her father ſent her word how ſhe ſhould prepare her ſelf in readineſſe to come to him, ſo ſoon as his Ambaſſadours ſhould bee ſent for her into <hi>Scotland.</hi> But much more willingly could ſhe affoord to ſtay in that Country, then there whether ſhe ſhould now goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

her mind, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of her gentle vſage there, but becauſe ſhe imagined by being far thence, ſhe ſhould be further from him that had the prime of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: beſide, ſhe might there hardly afterward heare any newes of him, but continuing in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhe could eaſily compaſſe it. In theſe melancholly thoughts was the amourous Princeſſe, and the King (on the other ſide) in dayly muſing, what he might be that ſent the foure Knights, with the wicked woman whom the fire had conſumed. But fiue or ſixe dayes after theſe matters were thus paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as the King was conferring with his Sonne <hi>Agraies,</hi> (who now ſtood vpon departing toward <hi>Gaule</hi> to ſuccour the king his Vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) there entred a Damoſell, who falling on her knee before all the aſſembly, framed her ſpeeches to <hi>Agraies</hi> in this manner.

What; quoth the King, is <hi>Galpan</hi> ouercome by the hand of one man; beleeue me Damoſell you tell vs meruailes. Worthy Lord, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe, he onely of whom I ſpeake hath done him to death, after hee had ſlaine all the other that reſiſted him in <hi>Galpans</hi> Caſtell: and he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to reueng their foile himſelfe, combated hand to hand with the Knight, but ſuch was his bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, as there with diſhonor hee loſt his head, which I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue brought to this Court, yet doubting the corrupt fauour thereof, and being otherwiſe adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him that ſent me to my Lord <hi>Agraies,</hi> as teſtimony of his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory this Helmet may ſuffiiſe. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, ſaid the king to al there preſent, it it the ſame Knight of whoſe name we are ignorant: how ſay you Lady, cannot you reſolue vs My Lord, quoth ſhe, I obtained it by exceeding importunity, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he would neuer haue told me. Say then good maiden, replied the King, to rid vs of all other doubtes. He nameth himſelfe, ſaid the Damoſell, the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea.</hi> When the King heard this, he was greatly abaſhed, and ſo were all the other likewiſe, afterward he thus ſpake. By my faith, I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perſwaded, that whoſoeuer Knighted him, neede not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thereof, ſeeing ſo long time he requeſted it of me, and I defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it for occaſions which I needed not to haue done, ſeeing Chiualry is in him already ſo well accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Then <hi>Araies</hi> taking occaſion to ſpeake, demanded of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, where he might meet with his gentle friend. My Lord, quoth ſhe, he humbly commendeth him-ſelfe to your good grace, giuing you to vnderſtand by me, that you ſhall finde him at the warres in <hi>Gaule</hi> if you come thether. Good newes faire Damoſell, ſaid <hi>Agraies</hi> haue you brought me, now am I more deſirous to be gone then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was: and if I may find him there, with my good will ſhall I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue his company.

Great was the ioy for theſe good newes of the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> and if any one receiued diſpleaſure, you muſt thinke it was <hi>Oriana</hi> aboue all the reſt, yet was it handled ſo couertly, as the watchfulleſt eye could not deſcerne it.

Then may the <hi>Gentle-man of the ſea,</hi> quoth he, vaunte, that he hath found more curtiſie in you then in me: but the cauſe why I prolonged the time of his honor, was that he ſeemed too yong for ſo great a charge.

It was now about the moneth of Aprill, when the Birdes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7181:27"/>
tune their Notes moſt pleaſantly, and that all Trees, Herbes, and Flowers declare the comming of the Spring time: this delightſome change made him remember her, who aboue all other flowred in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beautie, and for whom (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning his libertie) Loue hath taken him captiue, ſo that in theſe thoghts, he thus (ſomewhat loud) parled with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Ah poore <hi>Gentleman of the Sea,</hi> without Parents or Lands, that thou canſt auouch, how durſt thou lift thy heart ſo high, as to loue her who is beyond all other in beautie, bounty, and birth? Ah wretch as thou art, oughteſt thou not to conſider by theſe three things, wherein ſhe is moſt perfect: the beſt Kinght in the world may not be ſo hardy as to thinke of louing her? And thou poore vnknowne, art wrapt in a labirinth of folly, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and dying, not daring to tell it, or make ſhew thereof. In this complaint was the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea</hi> ſo carryed away, as forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all other matters, hee rode croſſe the forreſt a long ſpace, with his Helmet cloſed: till at length lifting vp his head, hee behelde a Knight well mounted, in the wood by him, who long had kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to heare his ſadde diſcourſe. When the knight ſawe the Prince had diſcryed him &amp; for that cauſe held his peace, he approched nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer him with theſe words. Beleeue me knight, it ſeems you more loue your Friend then ſhee doth you, when in commending her you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe your ſelfe: and for ought I vnderſtand by your ſpeeches, you are no ſuch man as ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend loue, therefore it is neceſſarie I ſhould know who ſhee is, to the end I may ſupply your defect and ſerue her. Sir knight (anſwered the Prince) you haue ſome reaſon for theſe ſpeeches, yet hap what ſhall, you can know no more then you doe: and I can aſſure yee, that by louing her you can get no aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. So doe not I beleeue, ſayd the knight, for a man ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue glory in trauaile, or any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the ſeruice of ſo faire a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſeeing that in the end, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but gaine his long looked for recompence: wherefore hee that loueth in ſo high a place as you doe, ſhould not be agreeued at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that happeneth. When the Prince heard him ſpeake ſo ſenſibly, imagining hee vſed theſe wordes to comfort him, he was of better cheere, and came more neere to him to continue this talk, but the Knight ſayd. Keepe yee backe, for either by friend-ſhip or force, you muſt tell mee what I haue demaunded. Now truſt me, anſwered the Prince, it ſhall not be ſo. Goe too then, quoth the knight, ſee what wil happen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defend your ſelfe. With right good will ſayde the Prince. So gan they lace their Helmets, taking likewiſe their Shieldes and Lances: but as they ſeuered them-ſelues for the Iouſt, a Damoſell came and ſpake in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Knights, I pray you forbeare a while, and tell mee one thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the combate if you can: for ſuch is my haſte, as I haue no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to tarry the end of your fight. At theſe words they ſtayed them-ſelues, demanding of her what ſhe deſired. I would faine, quoth ſhee, heare ſome news of a Knight, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea.</hi> And what would you with him? ſaid the Prince. I haue brought him ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, anſwered the Damoſell, from <hi>Agraies</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Attend a little, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7181:27"/>
the Prince, and I will tell ye ſo much as I know of him. All this time was the Knight of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ready for the Iouſt, and much offended at her that came to ſtay them, wherefore hee called to the Prince to gaurd him-ſelfe, giuing him ſuch an attaint in the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as his Launce flew in pieces: but the Prince met him full, as both Horſe and Man were thrown to the ground, when the Horſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more nimble then his Maiſter) ſeeing him ſelfe at libertie, ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the field, yet the Prince found the meanes to take him againe, and bringing him to the diſmounted knight, ſayd, Heere Sir, take your Horſe, and hence-forth deſire not to know any thing againſt a mans will. The knight would not refuſe his gentleneſſe, for he found him-ſelfe ſo ſhaken with his fall, as hee could hardly follow to catch him again &amp; in meane while he aſſayed to remount on his Horſe, the Prince left him, comming to the Damoſell that ſtayed for him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding if ſhe knew the man ſhe enquired after. No truely, quoth ſhe, I did neuer ſee him: but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> told me, that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make himſelfe knowne, ſo ſoone as I ſhould ſay that I came from him. He did not deceiue you therein anſwered the Prince, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye muſt vnderſtand I my ſelfe am the man: and with theſe words he vnlaced his Helmet, when the Damoſell ſaw his face, ſhe ſaid. In truth now doe I verily beleeue it, for your beauty I haue heard very much commended. Then tell me, quoth the Prince, where haue you left <hi>Agraies?</hi> Hard by a Riuer not farre hence, ſayd ſhe, where he ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his Troupe, attending a fit winde for Paſſage into <hi>Gaule:</hi> and is very deſirous (before he go any further) to know if you will beare him companie. With all my heart, replyed the Prince, ride then before and conduct mee the way. So rode he on with the Damoſell, and in ſome ſhort time after, they came neer the place where <hi>Agraies</hi> and his Armie were encamped: but yet before they arriued there, they heard behinde them one cry: Stay knight, for thou muſt tell me what I demanded. The Prince tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe, behold the knight who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſo lately diſmounted, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that bare him company, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſtayed to take his Armes. Now were they ſo neere the Prince <hi>Agraies</hi> Campe, and he as they all might ſee the Tourney, hauing a farre off noted the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, maruailing what he was that ſo gallantly managed his Horſe: and to ſay ſooth, hee was (in his time) a Knight of the comlyeſt grace that euer was ſeen, &amp; where he ſtroue to hide himſelfe, he was ſooneſt diſcouered, by reaſon of his brauery in horſeman-ſhip. The two Knights ran together in full courſe againſt him, breaking their Lances in pieces on his ſhield: but the Prince meeting him that had the foile in the forreſt, threw him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſaddle ſo roughly, as in the fall he brake his arme, the grief whereof made him lie ſtill as if he had bin dead. When he perceiued he was ſo well rid of one, hee drew his ſword: &amp; came to the other, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him ſuch a ſtroke on his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, as the Sword entring in, hee puld it backe with ſuch force, that the laces brake, wherby he broght it quite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his head vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſword: then he lifted vp his arme to haue ſmitten him, but the knight quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clapt his Shield before. In mean while the Prince got his ſword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his left hand (which hee could
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7181:28"/>
doe very hardly) and with his right hand tooke holde on his enemies ſhield, renting it violently from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, and afterward gaue him ſuch a blow on the head, as in great amazement hee fell to the ground. Thus did hee leaue him there with his companion, and rod with the Damoſell to the Tents of <hi>Agraies:</hi> who hauing ſeen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this quarrell, meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what he was that had ſo ſoone ouer-come two knights, therefore when he came towardes him, hee went foorth to meete him, and ſo ſoone as they knew each other, you need not make no doubt of their kinde ſalutations. Soone after the Prince alighted, and by <hi>Agraies</hi> was conducted into his Tent to be vnarmed, but firſt hee gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that the knights diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted in the fielde ſhould bee brought thither, where they were no ſooner ariued, but <hi>Agrais</hi> thus ſpake to them. Beleeue mee, my friends, you attempted great folly to meddle with this Knight. You ſay true my Lord, anſwered hee whoſe arme was broken, yet once to day I ſaw him in ſuch plight, as I little thought of any ſuch reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Afterward he declared all that happened in the Forreſt, and the communication they had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: yet he omitted the Princes complaints becauſe hee ſtood in feare to diſpleaſe him. During the repitition of theſe matters, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the one and boldneſſe of the other, was entercourſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and all that day they ſoiourned there, but on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Morning they mounted on horſe-backe, ſhaping their courſe to <hi>Palingues,</hi> a right good City on the frontires, and the outmoſt part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they found ſhipping, and embarqued them-ſelues toward <hi>Gaule.</hi> The winde ſeruing according to their deſire, in fewe dayes they landed in the Hauen of <hi>Galfrin,</hi> and marching thence in ſeemely order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hinderance, they came to the Caſtle of <hi>Baldain,</hi> where King <hi>Perion</hi> was beſieged, hauing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy loſt great number of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When he was aduertiſed of this ſuccour, you muſt imagine him comforted thereby, and their welcome to bee good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: chiefly by the Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> who hauing knowledge of their arriuall, ſent to entreat her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Agraies</hi> to come viſite her: which he did, being accompanied with the King, and the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea,</hi> and two other knights of good account. But you muſt note, that king <hi>Perio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> knew not the prince at the firſt ſight, yet at the length hé called him to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, that it was the ſame man whom he had knighted, and afterward ſaued his life at the Caſtle, wherefore thus he ſpake. My deare friend, on my faith I had forgotten ye, you are moſt welcome to this place, for your preſence giueth aſſurance, that I neede feare this warre no further, hauing the onely Knight of the world ſo neere mee. Dread Lord, anſwered the Prince, God giue me grace to ſerue you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, for perſwade your ſelfe, that while theſe troubles endure, I will make no ſpare of my perſon.</p>
                  <p>As thus they deuiſed, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Queenes Chamber, when the King taking the Prince by the hand, preſented him to her ſaying. Madame, this is the good Knight of whom here-tofore I tolde ye, he defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded me from the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that euer I was in: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray ye let no ſpare of curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie be made to him here, but giue
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7181:28"/>
him the beſt entertainment the time will affoord. The Queene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced her ſelfe to embrace him, but he fell on his knee with theſe wordes. I am ſeruant (Madame) to the Queen your ſiſter, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her I come to ſerue you, with like obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as to her owne perſon. Right graciouſly did the good Lady giue him thankes, yet little thought ſhe that he was her Sonne, for ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the ſea had deuoured him: yet was the Princes preſence at that very inſtant ſo pleaſing to her, as her eyes could not be ſatisfied with beholding him, and (through a ſecret mouing of nature) ſhe wiſhed more good to him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any in the troupe. At this time likewiſe was her remembrance ſolicited, with the former loſſe of her two Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe yeeres ſhe thought would haue equaled the Princes, if God had preſerued them, &amp; theſe occaſions vrged the teares in her eyes. Thus wept ſhe for him that nature touched her withall, and yet vnknowen was in her preſence, but when the Prince beheld her ſo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, he reputed it to the reaſon of the warre begun, wherefore hee ſaid. Madame, I hope with the aide of God, your King, and the freſh ſupply we haue brought: in ſhorte time to recouer your ioy, and for mine owne part, truſt me I will make no ſpare. Heauen proſper ye, anſwered the Queene, with happy ſucceſſe, &amp; for you are the Queene my ſiſters Knight, I wil that ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide no other lodging, but abide here with vs, and all things ſhall be appointed for yee to your owne contentment. Such was their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference together, vntill <hi>Agraies</hi> would goe refreſh himſelfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking leaue for that night, he went to his lodging where it was prouided: and gladly would the Prince haue followed him, but the Queene with-held him by ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, as he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtained now to remaine in his vnknowne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cuſtody. Right ſoone was the news of this freſh ſuccour, brought to K. <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland &amp; Daganel</hi> his Cozin, who made very ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof, becauſe (in thoſe times) was King <hi>Abies</hi> accounted for one of the beſt Knights that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was heard of, and in reſpect of his hot deſire to the fight, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (ſeeing new aide was come to his enimy) very quickly to bid him battaile, and for this cauſe he ſaid before all his people there preſent. If King <hi>Perion</hi> were ſo gentle a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion as to come ſee vs, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would do it to day then to morrow. Aſſure your ſelfe, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Daganel,</hi> he is nothing ſo haſty as I thinke: for hee feareth you to much, albeit he maketh little ſhew thereof. Know you, ſaid <hi>Galin</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> by what means we may thereto conſtraine him? Firſt let vs make an ambuſh of the greater part of our Army, which ſhall remaine with the King in this Forreſt of <hi>Baldain,</hi> then you Lord <hi>Daganel</hi> and my ſelfe will go with the reſt, to preſent our ſelues at breake of day before the Cittie: &amp; I am certaine that being deſcried by our enemies, who imagining our ſtrength is altogether, wil take hart, and not faile to come running forth vpon vs. When we ſee them approch, we will diſſemble a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous feare, and take our flight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Forreſt, where ſhall abide the King with his company: then our enemies purſuing aſſured vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in their own conceit, wil ſecke aduantage by our ſhamefull retire, &amp; ſo be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeues in the ſnare. Very well haue you aduiſed, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red King <hi>Abies,</hi> do you your ſelfe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7181:29"/>
worthy Duke giue order, that all things bee done as you haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Now might ye there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold armed men on Horſe-backe, the Souldiers muſtring, the drums thundering, and the Trumpets cheerefully ſounding, as in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, matters were ſo well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Kings Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment failed in nothing: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next morning at the breake of day, <hi>Daganel</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> ſhewed themſelues with their Squadron before the Towne. Little did King <hi>Perion</hi> at that time thinke of any ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, but altogether refreſhed his ſuccour, and honoured the Prince by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had found ſuch friend-ſhip. And to make ſome ſhew of his affection towardes him, in the morning he came with his Queene to the Princes Chamber, where they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him waſhing his hands, and perceiuing his eyes red, ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len &amp; blubbered with teares, they eaſily gathered hee had taken no good reſt that night: and very true it was, for continually hee thought of her, whoſe loue had depriued him of libertie, and likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared withall the ſlender means he had to attaine ſo high, which made him enter into ſuch profound griefe, as he expected no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie but death. The Queene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know the cauſe of his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, tooke <hi>Gandalin</hi> aſide, thus ſpeaking to him. My friend, your Maiſters countenance berayweth ſome inward diſpleaſure, hath any one heere offended him in ought? No Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> he hath by your Maieſtie receiued great honor: but he is wont to bee tormented in ſleepe as you ſee. During theſe diſcourſes, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell came to aduertiſe the King, how he had diſcoured the ambuſh and the enemies were very neere the Citie, where preſently he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doraine the Armie. Now was each one ready to horſe-backe, eſpecially the King and the Prince, who went directly to the Citie gate, where they found <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> chiding, becauſe they would not let him goe forth, thinking he ſhould tarrie too long from the fight: for he was one of the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Knights, and the beſt to giue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in neede that could bee found, ſo that if good aduiſe had beene as ready with him, as he was poſſeſſed of vnconquerable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, his like might not haue beene found in the world. At the Kings comming the gates were ſuddenly opened, and then went foorth the men of <hi>Gaule</hi> in order, who ſeeing their enemies to be ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, albeit the whole Armie was minded to goe no further, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ouer-much boldneſſe to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile ſuch an vneaquall ſtrength, and therefore aroſe among them a murmuring conteſtation. Which <hi>Agraies</hi> perceiuing, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trifling gaue the ſpurres to his horſe, crying aloud, Beſhrow him that tarrieth any longer: ſeeing them hee is to deale withall, ſhall we not venter? So ſaying, he gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopped toward his enemies, in like manner did the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea,</hi> and the reſt of their traine, who without any order of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, ran among them, and were immediatly mingled together. He whom the Prince firſt met withall, was the Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he charged ſo couragiouſly, as breaking his Launce on him, ouer-threw both man and horſe to the earth, and with this rough fall, his legge was broken. So paſſed on the Prince ſetting hand to Sword, as a chafed Lyon entred the preaſſe,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7181:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhewing ſuch deeds of Armes, as none durſt with-ſtand him: for he ouer-threw all that encountred him, killing ſome outright, chining and diſmembring others, ſo that euery one was glad to giue him way. When <hi>Daganel</hi> ſaw his men in ſuch diſorder, by the meanes of one Knight, he got the moſt of them together ſo well as he could, and round about beſet the Prince to beate him downe: which they had done, but that <hi>Agraies</hi> Percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, came with his troupe to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue him. At their arriual you might behold Launces broken, Knights tumbling downe, helmets rent, and ſhields ſcatred on the ground ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great conflict &amp; diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Iriſh-men,</hi> for King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> likewiſe came freſh vpon them with his band. <hi>Daganel</hi> (on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide) did the beſt he could to retire backe, but the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea</hi> was among the thickeſt, ſhewing ſuch chiualry, as he found before him not any reſiſtance, each one was ſo abaſhed at his behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: and <hi>Agraies</hi> aboue the reſt, ſhewed that his arme was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, for the more to hearten and cheere vp his men, he cryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude to them: follow my friends, follow the beſt Knight that euer bare Armes. When <hi>Daganel</hi> ſaw his ſide to haue the worſt, &amp; what great damage he receiued by the Prince, he determined to kill his horſe, and ſo to make him fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the crowde: but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for the Prince comming to him, let fall ſo mightie a ſtroke on his Helmet, as rent it cleane from off his head, and ſo remained <hi>Daganel</hi> vnarmed. Which when King <hi>Perion</hi> eſpied he reached him ſuch a ſalutation with his Sword, as cleft his head through the very braines: whereupon his men ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſlaine, they that had the beſt horſes fled away for life; and ſtayed not till they ſaued them-ſelues where King <hi>Abies</hi> was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhed. But King <hi>Perion</hi> ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing victory, diſcouered the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard (that came from the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt) marching in very great haſte toward him, ſhewing by their countenance a reuenge of their loſſe, wherefore ioyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they cryed; Set on them men of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſee that none of them eſcape vs, but let vs enter pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell in the field. When the <hi>Gaules</hi> found themſelues thus ſurpized, neuer were people more aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for they imagined the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh had not beene ſo great: and which moſt of all affrighted them, was, that they muſt now deale with freſh and luſtie men, them-ſelues being ſore wearyed, &amp; their horſes ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboured, as they could hardly indure their burden. Beſide, they knew king <hi>Abias</hi> was there in perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being (as you heard before) accounted one of the beſt knights in the world: and for this cauſe the moſt part of the <hi>Gaules</hi> began to tremble. But the <hi>Gentle-man of the Sea</hi> foreſeeing the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was like to enſue, came &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them rather to die then looſe one iot of their honour and reputation, ſaying: My friends and companions, be of good cheere, each one make knowne his vertue, and remember the eſteeme the <hi>Gaules</hi> haue gotten by Armes. We are to deale with the people aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied &amp; halfe ouercome, let vs not make change with them, taking their feare, and deliuering our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie: for if they but onely behold your reſolute countenances, I am certaine they are not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure yee, let vs then enter among them, for God is our defender. At
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7181:30"/>
theſe words the moſt diſheartened tooke courage, concluding to ſtay and fight manly with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who ſoone after in great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſet vpon them. Now did King <hi>Abies</hi> make knowne his magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and hardly could Prince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> men endure the aſſault, nor the Squadron that King <hi>Perion</hi> brought: for King <hi>Abies</hi> maimed ſome, other he ouerthrew, &amp; while his Launce held, he diſmounted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery knight that met with him. Afterward he layd hand to Sword, wherewith hee carried himſelfe ſo valiantly, as the hardyeſt were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat, for he made way where euer he came: ſo that king <hi>Perions</hi> men, not able longer to hold out, began to retyre ſo faſt as they could toward the Citie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea,</hi> ſaw that Fortune was ſo contrary to them, in great ſpight he entered the throng, and fought ſo fiercely, as the moſt part of the <hi>Iriſh-men</hi> were glad to ſtay, while the <hi>Gaules</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſorder retyred toward the Caſtle, then turning his horſe, he followed them. To defend this brunt there was alſo king <hi>Perion,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Agraies,</hi> who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered teſtimonie to their enemies (by the keen edge of their Swords) how well they knew to gouerne themſelues in ſuch extremities: notwithſtanding, the <hi>Iriſh-men</hi> ſeeing they had the better, ſtil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them with eager courage, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them confuſedly into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hoping that now would be the end of their warre. Such was the retire of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> ſtill more and more preſſed by their enemies, as doubtleſſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had entred the Citie after them, but that they were hindred by king <hi>Perion, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> and the Prince, who whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did repulſe the throng, till their people by them were gotten in. But now was tydings brought to king <hi>Abies,</hi> that his couſin <hi>Dagenel,</hi> and <hi>Gallin</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> were ſlaine, whereat he waxed very diſpleaſant: and ſeeing King <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with his people were incloſed in the Citie, he reſolued to take leyſure for his reuenge, wherein he was deceiued, for ſoone after he was very ſtrongly repulſed, which made him almoſt mad with anger. And as he thus raged vp &amp; downe, one of his knights ſhewed him the Prince, ſaying: My Lord, hee whom you ſee mounted on the white Horſe, is the man that ſlewe Prince <hi>Daganel</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> with many other, the beſt in our Armie. When King <hi>Abies</hi> heard that, he rode to the Prince with theſe words: Knight, thou haſt ſlaine the man whom moſt I loued in the world: but if thou wilt combate, I hope to be reuenged ſo well, as I ſhall haue cauſe to be quit with thee. Your men (anſwered the Prince) are two little trauailed to meddle with ours, notwithſtanding if thou wilt as (a Knight) reuenge him thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedſt, and declare the great hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for which thou art renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: chuſe of thy men ſuch as thou ſhalt like, and I (if it pleaſe the King) will doe as much of mine, for being equall in number, thou ſhalt gaine more honor then with ſo great an Armie, which thou haſt brought into this Countrey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſt occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me, quoth the King, thou talkeſt well, go to, chuſe thou thy ſelfe the number of men, how many or few thou thinkeſt good. Seeing you leaue it in my choyſe, replied the Prince, I will make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offer, which (it may be) you will account more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient. You
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7181:30"/>
are mine enemy for that which I haue done, and I yours for the wrong you haue done to this Realme, ſo for our ſeuerall cauſe of anger, it is not reaſonable any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then our ſelues ſhould ſuffer: let then the battaile be betweene you and me onely, and preſently (if you will) without longer dallying, yet ſhall you aſſure me from your men, as I will do you from mine, ſo that none ſhall moue, whether the one or the other be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Right well ſaid King <hi>Abies,</hi> do I allow of thy offer: whereupon he choſe ten Knights on his parte to garde the field. And as the Prince laboured to gaine the like of the King, with his conſent, hee found King <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> ſomewhat loath to grant the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: as well for the conſequence that might enſue, as alſo becauſe the Prince was much wearyed and ſore wounded beſide, wherefore they entreated him to déferre the matter till the day following. But the deſirous affection he had to be conquerour, as alſo to make a finall concluſion of the warre, that hee might returne vnder her obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, from whom he came to ſerue king <hi>Perion:</hi> would not ſuffer him to make any longer delay, of the glory and honor which he ſaw ſo neere at hand. For this cauſe he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo many perſwaſions to the king, as in the end hee was granted the Combate, and on his ſide like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were tenne knights appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for his guard and ſafetie in the field.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard in what maner the combat was accorded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene King <hi>Abies</hi> &amp; the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> and now already is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the day ſpent: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was agreed by the Lords on either ſide, (very much againſt the wils of the two Combatants) that all ſhould be deferred till the morrow morning: as well that they might refreſh themſelues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire their battered armour, as alſo for regarding ſuch wounds, as they had receiued in the paſſed encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Hereupon the two Kings withdrew themſelues, the one to his Campe, and the other to his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. But ſuch is the bruite ſpred through the Cittie, what worthy exploits the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> had done: as he could not paſſe by them, but thus they ſpake with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall voyce. Ah famous Knight, God giue thee grace to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as thou haſt begun: impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it to find a Gentleman, ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with beauty and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie as he is, for our eyes are iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the one, and our enemies full well haue felt the other. But you muſt note, that in the morning when they went to the field, the King had giuen the Queene in charge, that ſo ſoone as the Prince returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the warre, ſhe ſhould ſend one of her Ladyes to him, requeſting him not to be vnarmed in any other place then in her cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: wherefore as he went neere the Kings lodging, the Lady came
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7181:31"/>
vnto him, ſaying. Sir Knight, the Queene deſires you not to be elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where vnarmed, but in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where ſhe ſtayeth your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. In ſooth, ſaid the King, you muſt needes grant this requeſt, and I deſire it may be ſo. The Prince condiſending, went where the Queene ſtaied with her Ladies, and no ſooner was he entred, but preſently the Ladyes holpe to vn-arme him: yet the Queene her ſelfe tooke the greateſt paine of all, and as ſhee had off his coate of Mayle, ſhee perceiued he was ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which ſhe ſhewing to the King, he ſaid. I maruaile Gentle-man, ſeeing you are ſo hurt, that you tooke no longer time for your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat. It had bin needleſſe, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Prince, for I haue no wound (I thanke God) that can keepe me from the Combate. Right ſoone were the Chirurgions comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to looke thereon, and they found it greater in ſhew then dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. In the meane while ſupper was prepared, during which time, they had much talke of the accidents that day paſt: vntill the houre of reſt came, when each one depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till the next morning. Which being come, after they had ſerued God, the king ſent a rich &amp; goodly Armour to the Prince, of better proofe and ſtrength then that hee had on the day before: wherewith he armed himſelfe, and hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leaue of euery one, mounted on Horſe backe in company of the King, who bare his Helmet, the Prince <hi>Agraics</hi> his Sheeld (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was portrayed two azured Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a golden field, rampant the one againſt the other, as if they both inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded murder,) &amp; another Prince carried his Launce. In this equipage he ſet forward to the field, where the King of <hi>Ireland</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his comming, well armed, and mounted on a goodly blacke Courſer: but becauſe King <hi>Abies</hi> had in former time fought hand to hand with a Giant, and vanquiſhed him with the loſſe of his head, therefore he brought to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the like figure in his Shield, deſcribing the whole order as the deede was done. On either ſide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither a number of people, placing themſelues for moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ſight of the Combate. And now were the Champions entred the lyſts, each one couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reſoluing againſt his enemy, wherefore without longer tarying, lacing downe the ſight of their Helmets, and commending them-ſelues to God: they gaue the ſpurres to their horſes, meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo furiouſly, both with Launce, body and horſe, as their ſtaues flew in ſhiuers, yet piercing their Armour, and both were laid along in the field. But heat of hart and deſire of conqueſt, made them recouer footing quickly, and pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth the ſpields of their Launces wherewith they were wounded: ſet hand to Sword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſuch a ſtrange and cruell fight, as each one was amazed to ſee them endure ſo much. For this fight was not equally matched, in reſpect the Prince was but yong, well proportioned, and of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able height: but King <hi>Abies</hi> was ſo great, as he neuer found any knight that exceeded him a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euery way, being (withall) ſo ſtrongly made, that he was rather to be accounted a Giant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man, yet was he highly loued &amp; reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of his ſubiects, for the vertue and proweſſe which remained in him, albeit he was too much audati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and proud.</p>
                  <p>Now were theſe Champions ſo

animated againſt each other, as well for honor as the conſequence of the Combate, that without any ſtay for breathing they layde on ſuch load, as their ſtrokes reſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the fight of twentie men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And well they witneſſed no great good will betweene them, for there might ye ſee the earth tainted with their blood, the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Shields, the plate of their Armour ſcattered abroad, and their Helmets ſo bruiſed: that by reaſon their Armes being ſo ſquandered, they were vnable to hold out their ſtrokes, for euery blow cauſed the blood to guſh out abundantly, yet were they of ſuch inuincible courage, as they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to feele none of this annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Hereupon they maintained ſuch brauery the one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it could not be iudged who had the better or worſe: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, about the houre of three, the Sunne gaue an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding warme and violent heate, whereby they found themſelues ſo chafed in their Armour, as they began to wake ſomewhat feeble: eſpecially King <hi>Abies,</hi> inſomuch as hee was conſtrained to retire backe, thus ſpeaking to the Prince.</p>
                  <p>I ſee thee very neere failing, and my ſelfe am likewiſe out of breath, if thou thinke it good, let vs reſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, for afterward we may more eaſily finiſh our enterpriſe. And thus much I tell thee (although I haue no cauſe or deſire to fauour thee) that I hold better opinion of thee, then any knight that euer I combated withal: moreouer it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth me that I had an occaſion to ſee thee, &amp; much more that I am ſo long in conquering thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I might take vengeance for his death whom moſt I loued in the world, and as thou didſt ſlay him in open battaile, ſo likewiſe will I ouercome thee in ſight of both our Campes. King <hi>Abies</hi> replyed the Pince, I now perceiue it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth thee that thou canſt doe no more harme, entering ſo like a Tyrant as thou didſt to ruinate this Countrey. And as it often happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that he which delighteth in euill, can neuer broke any other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: ſo hope I to reward thee ſo well for thy paines, as thou ſhalt confeſſe thou haſt wronged theſe people, Beſide, thus much I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe thee before hand, that I ſhall giue thee as little leiſure or reſpite, as thou haſt giuen them who haue taſted thy crueltie: therefore ſticke cloſe to thy tackling, and defend thy ſelfe againſt the Knight, whom thou reputeſt fayling.

Well mayſt thou curſſe the boldneſſe that made thee enter theſe Lyſtes, for hence thou ſhalt not eſcape without loſſe of thy head.

Herewith more cruelly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before they began againe their Combat, as if they had euen then entred the field, &amp; albeit king <hi>Abies</hi> was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, by reaſon of his long exerciſe in Armes, that he knew right well how to defend and offend: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the lightnes, hardines, and promptitude of the Prince, made him in the end forget all his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, for hee was cloſely followed at an inche, as he loſt altother the reſt of his Shield, by which means the Prince could endomage him farre better then before: whereof he failed not, and in ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces withall, that the blood ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med downe his Armour in meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aboundance, cauſing him by

little and little to loſe his ſtrength, and being in this agony, ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from one ſide to another, hee could not deuiſe what to do, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the purſuing ſword of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Seeing himſelfe now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd of all hope, he concluded either ſoone to dye or haue the victory, and taking his ſword in both hands, he ran with all his might againſt the Prince, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it ſo farre into his Shield, as he was not able to pul it forth againe. Which when the Prince beheld, he gaue him ſuch a furious ſtroke on the left leg, that being quite cut from the reſt, the King was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fall downe: and right ſoone did the Prince ſet foote vppon him, tearing violently his Helmet from his head, ſaying.

Notwithſtanding, ſince it is ſo come to paſſe, I pray thee let aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be giuen to my Souldiours, that without iniury they may carry me into my Country, and dying like a Chriſtian, I may pay my debt both to God &amp; men. Faine would I haue councel for my ouer burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Soule, then afterward ſhall I render to King <hi>Perion</hi> what I vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from him. And as for thee who haſt vanquiſhed me, I deſpiſe not to dye by the valiance of ſo gentle a Knight as thou art: but withall my hart pardon thee my death, wiſhing thou mayeſt continue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and yet hereafter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me. When the Prince ſaw him in ſuch debilitie, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorowfull for his death, although he knew aſſuredly, that if he had woon the glory of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, he would haue dealt much worſe with him. During theſe ſpeeches, the Knights appointed on each ſide came to them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King <hi>Abies</hi> commanded his Captaines, to render King <hi>Perion</hi> what he had conquered in <hi>Gaule:</hi> which was accompliſhed, and by theſe meanes the <hi>Iriſh-men</hi> had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to carry home their King, who dyed ſoone after order was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for their affaires. Theſe matters thus ended, King <hi>Perion, Agraies,</hi> and all the Lords of <hi>Gaule</hi> came to the Prince, accompanying him with great ioy from the fielde into the Citie, euen with ſuch trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant glory as to Conquerours is accuſtomed: who by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe not onely ouercome their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but reſtore the Country that is well neere ruinated.</p>
                  <p>Now muſt ye vnderſtand, that a little before the beginning of the Combate, the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> who came from faire <hi>Oriana</hi> to the Prince, was arriued at king <hi>Perions</hi> Courte: and before ſhee would make her ſelfe knowne, ſhe deſired to behold the iſſue of the fight. Afterward, ſeeing him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with ſo honorable a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe, and taking him aſide, ſaid. Knight, may it pleaſe you to heare a word in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, of ſuch matter as doth verie neere concerne ye? Euen what you will, anſwered the Prince: with which words he tooke her by the hand, and keeping her from the throng, ſhe thus ſpake. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> who is onely yours, hath ſent me to you, and this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter withall, wherein you ſhall finde your name written. When he heard her named, by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of whom only he liued, he was ſo perplexed, that without vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what elſe the Damoſel
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7181:32"/>
ſaid: hauing taken the Letter, he let it fall, being readie himſelfe to beare it companie, which the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell ſeeing, ſhee tooke vp the Letter and came to him againe. Euery one that beheld him in theſe paſſions, meruayled what newes ſhe brought to procure this alteration: but ſhe puld him by the arme ſo roughly, as made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his former Traunce, thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. What now my Lord? Take you the Meſſage in ſo ill part, that comes from the onely Lady in the world, and who aboue all other lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you? for whoſe ſake likewiſe I haue taken ſo great paine to find you? Ah Ladie (quoth he) on my faith I knew not what you ſayd to me, for euen as you began to ſpeak, I felt the paine to renewe in mee, which heretofore you haue ſeene me endure. It is true (ſaid the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell) but now it is needleſſe for ye to conceale your ſelfe any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from me, for I know more of your affayres and my Ladies, then you imagine, becauſe her ſelfe hath bewrayed them to me. And if you beare her affection, you neede not be aſhamed thereof, in that ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you beyond all other: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof, ſhe telleth you by me, that ſhe muſt goe to the King her father; requeſting after your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from this warre, you would come ſee her in great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing all things in ſuch order, as at your arriual you may remaine there in the Court, vntill more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply you vnderſtand her mind, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſhe gaue me charge to tell ye, how ſhe certainly knowes you are Sonne to a King, wherewith ſhe is no leſſe pleaſed then ſhee thinkes you will be: and ſeeing (being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of your Linage) you haue proued ſo good a Knight, now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding your Nobilitie, you ſhould labour to increaſe your Fame if you can. And then againe ſhee gaue him the Letter, ſaying. Take here the Letter wherein your Name is written, and which you had hanging about your necke, at ſuch time as you were found in the Sea. The Prince tooke the Letter, and when he looked on it, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring to what good purpoſe his Lady had taken it from him, fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vehement ſigh, ſomewhat ſoftly, he thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Ah happy Letter, moſt diuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſt thou found, in reſpect thou haſt beene kept by her, who hath my heart in her cuſtodie, and for whom I haue ſo often aſſayed to die, yet cannot. For thinking on her perfection, I ſeeke to augment it by ſtrength and commendation, but of ſo ſlender value is my puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance found: that ſtriuing thereby to gaine her fauor, the leaſt paine I feele ſurpaſſeth a thouſand deaths: which (neuertheleſſe) are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced by this preſent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. O higheſt God, when ſhall I ſee the time, wherein I may giue her to vnderſtand, how great my deuotion is to obey her by ſome agreeable ſeruice? Hauing finiſhed theſe words, he opened the Letter, and ſaw his Name written therein, which was <hi>Amadis:</hi> then thus ſpake the Damoſell againe to him. I was charged, Sir, when I had done my Meſſage, to returne with all ſpeed to her that ſent me to you; therefore be thinke your ſelfe if you will command me any thing. You ſhall not depart (ſo pleaſe you) in ſuch haſte, anſwered the Prince, but ſtay with mee two or three dayes: during which time, for what occaſion ſo euer it be, you ſhall not forſake me, and then will I conduct you whither you pleaſe. In obeying-you (ſayd the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,

Then came the Queene with her Ladyes &amp; Gentle-women to vnarme him, and the Chirurgions to viſite his wounds, which when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, albeit they were many and yrkeſom to behold, yet were they to bee healed without any great daunger of his perſon. For this night the king deſired, that he and <hi>Agraies,</hi> would ſupp with him, but the <hi>Prince</hi> making his excuſe by his wounds, went to his Chamber, willing to haue no other company then the Damoſel: to whom he did all the honour that could be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hoping through her to finde remedie for part of his griefes. This Damoſell ſoiourned with him certaine time, and in reſpect of the good Newes ſhee brought him, no wound could hinder him from viſiting the great Hall, there walking and conferring with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one: but moſt with her whom he cauſed to ſtay, attending his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> till he might beare Armes. And betweene them happened a ſtrange occaſion, which was cauſe of his longer abode in <hi>Gaule,</hi> then hee expected: ſo that the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell returned to <hi>Oriana</hi> without him, as you hereafter ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this Hiſtorie, it hath beene recited, how King <hi>Perion</hi> gaue his Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> being then in little <hi>Brittaine,</hi> a Ring like another that commonly hee wore, and theſe two Rings were of ſuch an vniforme, as there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to bee diſcerned betweene them. Likewiſe ye haue vnderſtood how when the yong Prince was put vpon the water, this Ring was faſtened about his necke, which <hi>Gandales</hi> kept, till time he ſent it by the Damoſell (a little before he was knighted) with the Sword and the waxe. Now had the King ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times demaunded of the Queene for the Ring, who made him diuers doubtfull anſwers, and in the end ſayd ſhe had loſt it. But it came to paſſe, that as the Prince walked with <hi>Orianaes</hi> Damoſell, which commonly he was wont to do, yong <hi>Melicia</hi> daughter to king <hi>Perion,</hi> paſſed by him weeping, when the Prince ſtaied her; ſaying. Faire friend, why weepe ye? Ah my Lord, quoth the Princeſſe, I haue euen now loſt a Ring, which the King my Father gaue me to keepe while he ſlept. Weepe not ſo faire Virgin, anſwered the Prince, you ſhall haue another of me to giue him: So taking his owne Ring from his finger, he gaue it her. When ſhe beheld it, (thinking it was the ſame ſhe had loſt) ſhe ſaid. Ah my Lord, haue you found it, wherewith I am not a little glad, for I haue all this while ſought it. What nowe? quoth the Prince, this is not your

Ring. In mine opinion it is, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Melicia,</hi> or the onely thing of the world that moſt reſembles it. So much the better, ſaid the Prince, for more eaſily will it be iudged the ſame you loſt. Herewith went <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi> to the Kings Chamber, and finding him awake, he asked her for his Ring, then gaue ſhe him the ſame ſhe had of the Prince, which the King put on his finger, thinking it was his owne. But ſoone after as he walked through the Gallary, he eſpied in a corner lying the other Ring, which he gaue his daughter before to keepe, and taking it vp, he compared them together: where-upon he remembred, that one of theſe two was the ſame he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time gaue the Queene, ſo he asked of <hi>Melicia</hi> where ſhe had the Ring. The yong Princeſſe affraid of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, durſt not lye, but thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. My Lord and Father, your Ring I loſt, and as I ſearched for it, I met with the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea:</hi> who becauſe he ſaw me weepe, gaue me one of his, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered you in ſtead of your owne, and if that be not it, I know not where it is. When the King heard this, he preſently conceiued ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene his Queene and the Prince, imagining in reſpect of his beauty, how ſhe was fallen into ſome diſhoneſt liking of him. and therefore had giuen that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Hereupon he went to the Chamber where ſhe was, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the dore, ſate downe by her, not ſpeaking one word a good ſpace, but ſilently fixed his eyes on the ground: then breathing forth a paſſionate ſigh, he ſaid. I will not maruaile any longer Madame, why you would neuer make me any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine anſwer, when I demanded for the Ring Igaue ye in little <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine:</hi> you haue loſt it in ſuch a place, where you would be loath I ſhould know of it, but hardly can you conceale affection, when it proceedeth to ſuch effects. The <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> inconſideratly gaue it to <hi>Melicia,</hi> little thinking that it came at the firſt from me: and thereby do I know what he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth not, and your ſelfe would I ſhould not vnderſtand. When the Queene (who already by his countenance ſaw he was troubled) heard what he had ſaid, ſhe now determined not to diſſemble with him in any thing, but ſummarily made a true diſcourſe of her child-birth. And (not without teares) ſhe recounted to him, how ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in feare of the king her father, as alſo the ſeuere law vſed in his Kingdome, ſhe was conſtrained to commit her ſonne to the mercy of the ſea, and in his cradle coffin put with him, both the Ring, ſword, &amp; what elſe hath bene already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Confounded was the king with maruaile when he heard the whole truth, and preſently imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Prince might bee his firſt ſonne, whom God had ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerued, wherefore he ſaid to the Queene. According to your circumſtances reuealed, it may be, that he who is vnknowne to vs, is our ſonne, and the rather I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture ſo by the name he beareth of the ſea. Ah God, ſaid the Queen, may it fall out ſo haply? I beſeech ye my Lord, ſend preſently for him, and we will deſire him to tell vs of whence he is. Let vs go then, quoth the King, to ſeeke him.</p>
                  <p>So went they to his Chamber, where they found him ſleeping, wherefore (without making any noyſe) he approched nere the bed, eſpied his Sword, which he tooke, and after he had well viewed it, knew it to be the ſame he eſteemed

ſo much, and wherewith he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed many famous aduentures, whereupon he ſaid to the Qeuene. On my faith, this is the ſword I left in the Chamber of the King your Father, the firſt night we were acquainted together, and now do I the better beleeue what you haue ſaid vnto me. Ah God, ſaid the Queene, let vs ſuffer him ſleepe no longer, for my hart cannot endure this weighty burden: herewith ſhe tooke him by the hand and awaked him, ſaying. My Lord, ſleepe no more at this time, for other accaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons calleth you. Eaſily was the Prince raiſed from ſleepe, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beheld the Queene weeping, as one amazed thereat, he ſaid.

So God helpe me Madame, anſwered the Prince, I know not, for by ſtrange aduenture was I found in the ſea. The good Lady was then ſo ouercome with ioy, as not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeech, but vitall ſence was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her, and ſhe fell downe in a ſwoune: which the Prince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, quickly ranne to recouer her, ſaying. What aile ye Madame? further could he not imagine on the cauſe of this alteration. Ah my ſonne, quoth ſhe, now know I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thy ſelfe who thou art. The King likewiſe was ſo caried away with ioy and admiration, as he ſtood not able to ſpeake a word: now was it hard to iudge, which of theſe three felt greateſt contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the mother throwing her armes about the Princes neck, ſaid. Now may I boldly dare to kiſſe in ſafetie, hauing beene ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of thyſight and knowledge: highly am I beholding to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine bounty, who hath fauoured the offence I committed through feare, which was, in deliuering thee to the courtiſie of the waters, and ſee heere thy Kingly father that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got thee. With theſe words the Prince fell at their feete, extreame ioy reducing the teares into his eyes, and altogether praiſed God for this good aduenture: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Prince, becauſe he had beene preſerued in ſo great danger, and now at length to finde ſuch honor and good hap, as to meete with his Parents, being all this while vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to them. As thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed on the fortunes paſſed, the Queene demanded of him if hee had no other name, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which now he called himſelfe by? Yes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, quoth he, but it is not fully three daies paſt ſince I knew there-of, for as I came from the Combat againſt King <hi>Abies,</hi> a Damoſell brought me a Letter which I haue, and (as ſhe ſaith) was faſtened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my neck, being wrapped in waxe, when I was found in the ſea, wherein I finde that my name is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis:</hi> and herewithall he ſhewed the letter to the Queene, which ſhe full well knew ſo ſoone as ſhe ſaw it. Beleeue me, ſaid the Queene, this truely is the Letter that <hi>Dario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> wrote, when ſhe made the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration betweene you and me: thus though I was ere while in great griefe and ſorrow, yet now (praiſed be God) I feele as much ioy and pleaſure. Now ſeeing aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly your name is <hi>Amadis,</hi> it is needleſſe you ſhould beare any other contrary title: ſo thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he was called no more the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> but <hi>Amadis,</hi> and ſometime <hi>Amadis</hi> de <hi>Gaule.</hi> It was not long before the bruite
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7181:34"/>
hereof was ſpread through the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the good &amp; famous knight was ſonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> and the Queen <hi>Eliſena:</hi> wherefore if euery one reioyced (you muſt thinke) the Prince <hi>Agrates</hi> was not ſorry, for they were found to bee Cozin germames. Among the reſt, the Damoſell of <hi>Deamarke</hi> had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge here-of, wherefore conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what comfort this would bee to the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſhe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much as ſhe could to return toward her: knowing ſhe would giue her friendly countenance, bringing her ſo good Newes, what gracious fortune had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him whom aboue all other ſhe loued. For this cauſe ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Amadis,</hi> to diſpatch her returne to her Miſtreſſe: In that I well perceiue, quoth ſhe, you can not ſo ſpeedily depart hence as you would, nor were it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but you ſhould giue ſome contentation to them, who for the loue of you haue ſhedde ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares. Theſe wordes cauſed the teares to trickle downe his cheekes, yet ſmothering his griefe ſo well as he could, he made this anſwere to the Damoſell. Lady, I will pray that the Heauens may ſafely conduct ye; yet let mee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat your friendly remembrance, commanding the vttermoſt of my endeauours, for without your gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care my life cannot endure: withall, I finde my ſelfe ſo endeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my gracious Miſtreſſe, as I dare not requeſt any thing at her hand. Neuertheleſſe you may ſay to her, that right ſoon ſhall I come to ſhew my obedience, and in like Armor will I be clad, as when you ſaw me combate with the King of <hi>Ireland:</hi> becauſe both ſhe and you may the more eaſily know me, if I cannot compaſſe the meane to ſpeake with you; &amp; in this manner departed the Damoſel of <hi>Denmark.</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>Agrates</hi> ſeeing his Cozin <hi>Amadis</hi> was to remaine / longer in <hi>Gaule,</hi> determined to take his leaue, and calling him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſayd. Faire Cozin, for this time I muſt be enforced to leaue ye, albeit your company is more pleaſing to me then any other: but my paſſionate heart will allow me no quiet, vntill I be with her, who both farre and neere hath power to command me. It is Madame <hi>Oliuia,</hi> daughter to the King <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nain</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> who ſent for me, (by the Damoſell that brought me the Helmet of <hi>Galpan,</hi> which you ſent me, in reuenge of the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhe receiued by him) that I ſhould come to her with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ſpeed: and therefore I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may or dare faile, which is the onely cauſe of my parting with you.</p>
                  <p>Now muſt you note heere-with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that at the time as <hi>Don Galuanes</hi> brother to the king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was in the Realme of <hi>Norway</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> his Cozin: this yong Prince became ſo enamoured of the Lady <hi>Oliuia,</hi> as he concluded neuer to loue any other then her, and this made him the more earneſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by her commandement. And to tel ye what this <hi>Galuanes</hi> was, he had the name of <hi>Galuanes without la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> becauſe al the portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his father left him, was onely a poore Caſtle: for the reſt he had ſpent in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armes, &amp; entertaining Gentle-men, whereupon he had the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>without land.</hi> Such as you haue heard were the ſpeeches <hi>Agrates</hi> had with <hi>Amadis,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he requeſted to know, where he ſhould finde him at his returne from <hi>Norway.</hi> Cozin (qouth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis)</hi> I hope at my departure
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7181:35"/>
hence, to viſite the Court of king <hi>Laſuart,</hi> where I haue heard Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie to be worthily maintained, with greater libertie and honour, then in the kingdome of any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour or King. But ſeeing it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you to take another way, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire when you ſhall ſee the King your Father, and the Queene, to remember my bounden dutie to them both: aſſuring them (on my behalfe) that they may command mein their ſeruice, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as your ſelf, or any other, as well in reſpect of our alliance together, as alſo for the gracious entertainment I had in my youth, being by them moſt carefully educated and eſteemed. This done, <hi>Agraies</hi> took his leaue, beeing Honourably conducted through the Cittie, by the King and all the Lords of his Court: but ſo ſoone as the King entred the fields, he ſaw a Damoſell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming toward him, who boldly lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on the raine of his Horſe bridle, thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Remember thy ſelfe King <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> what a Damoſell ſome-time ſayd vnto thee: <hi>That when thou didſt recouer thy loſſe, the Kingdome of</hi> Ireland <hi>ſhould looſe her flower.</hi> Thinke now (I pray thee) whether ſhe ſayd true or no, thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered thy Sonne whom thou reputedſt loſt, and euen by the death of valiant King <hi>Abies,</hi> who was the Flower of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſuch a one as that Countrey ſhall neuer haue his like: <hi>Vntill time the good brother of the Ladie muſt come, who ſhall by force of Armes cauſe to be broght thither the tribute of other Countryes, and he muſt die by the hand of him, that ſhall accompliſh for her the onely thing of the world, which moſt he loueth.</hi> And ſo it hap ned by <hi>Marlot</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> brother to the Queene of that Countrey: whom <hi>Triſtan</hi> of <hi>Leonnoys</hi> killed, on the quarrell of tribute deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of King <hi>Marke</hi> of <hi>Corne wall</hi> his Vncle: which <hi>Triſtan</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dyed for the loue he bare to Queene <hi>Yſeul,</hi> being the onely thing of the world that hee moſt loued. Now muſt thou be minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hereof, ſayd the Damſel to the King, for <hi>Vrganda</hi> my Miſtreſſe ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth thee. When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard her ſpeake of <hi>Vrganda,</hi> he tooke occaſion thus to anſwere. Damoſell, and my friend, I pray you ſay to her who ſent you hither, that the Knight to whom ſhe gaue the Launce, commendeth him-ſelfe to her good grace: being now aſſured in the matter whereof then ſhe ſpake, how with that Launce, I ſhould deliuer the houſe from whence I firſt diſcended: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo it fell out, for I deliuered my Father vnknowne to me, being then at the very point of death, So without any other reply, the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell turning bridle rode backe the ſame way ſhe came, and the King into the Citie, with <hi>Amadis</hi> his Soune ſo lately recouered: for which cauſe he aſſembled all the Princes and Lords of his Realme, meaning to keepe a more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Court then euer he had done before, to the end that euery one might behold <hi>Amadis,</hi> in regard of whoſe honour and happie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, there were Knightly Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys daily vſed, beſide great ſtore of other paſtimes and delights.</p>
                  <p>During theſe pleaſures, <hi>Amadis</hi> was aduertiſed in what maner the Gyant had carryed away his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Galaor,</hi> wherefore hee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined (happen what might) to goe ſeeke him, and if poſſible hee could to recouer him, either by force of Armes or otherwiſe. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, his heart being day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7181:35"/>
mooued to goe ſee her that hourely expected his preſence, one day he entreated the King his Father: ſeeing now he had peace with his enemies, that with his leaue he might goe ſeeke aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> becauſe he was loath to remaine idle. But lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſing was this requeſt to the King, and much leſſe to the Queen, yet by opportunitie hee obtained permiſſion for his Voyage: nor could they all haue power to with hold him, by reaſon of the loue he bare to <hi>Oriana,</hi> which made him obedient to none but her. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, being clad in ſuch Armour, as he promiſed the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> he ſet forward on his iourney, embarqing himſelfe at the neereſt Port of the Sea, where by good happe he found paſſage readie. Not long was his cut into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> landing at <hi>Briſtow,</hi> a moſt noble and auncient City of that Countrey, where hee heard that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſoiourned at <hi>Windſore,</hi> royally accompanyed with Knights and Gentlemen: for all the Kings &amp; Princes (his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) did highly fauour and ſhew him obeyſance, which made <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſhape his courſe directly to the Court. Not long had he rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on the way but he met with a Damoſell, who demanded of him, if that were her readie way to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow?</hi> Yea marry is it (anſwered the Prince.) I pray ye then tell me, quoth ſhe, if I may finde any ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping there, for my ſpeedie paſſage ouer into <hi>Gaule?</hi> What affayres calles you thither? ſayd <hi>Amadis.</hi> In ſooth, replyed the Damoſell, I goe thither to finde a Knight na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom King <hi>Perion</hi> not long ſince had knowne to bee his Sonne. Greatly did <hi>Amadis</hi> meruaile hereat, for hee thought theſe newes had not been ſo farre ſpread abroad, wherefore hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded how ſhe heard thereof? I know it, qouth ſhe, from her, to whom the moſt ſecret things of all are manifeſt: for ſhe knew <hi>Amadis</hi> before he knew himſelfe, or that his Father heard of <hi>Amadis;</hi> and if you would vnderſtand what ſhee is, her name (by common report) is <hi>Vrganda the vnknowne.</hi> She hath at this time eſpeciall affayres with him, and by no other can ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer that, which ſhee now ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in feare to looſe. Beleeue me Damoſell, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe who may command euery one, doth now pleaſe to employ <hi>Amadis,</hi> I aſſure ye it is needleſſe for you to trauaile any further: for I am the man you are ſent to ſeek, and therefore let vs goe, whither you thinke conuenient. What? ſayd the Damoſell, are you <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis?</hi> Yea, verily am I, anſwered the Prince. Come, then and follow me, quoth ſhe, and I will conduct yee where my Miſtreſſe is, who attendeth your arriuall in good deuotion. Heere-with <hi>Amadis</hi> rode after the Damoſell, and thus are they gone together in company.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>How the Gyant bringing <hi>Galaor</hi> to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> that hee might dubbe him Knight, mette with his brother <hi>Amadis,</hi> by whoſe hand hee would bee Knighted, and no other.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Gyant of whom ſundry times we haue ſpoken heereto-fore, cauſing yong <hi>Galaor</hi> to bee inſtructed in managing horſes, &amp; all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes beſeeming a Knight: found him ſo capeable of euery thing, as in leſſe ſpace then a yeere, hee was growne meruailous perfect, ſo that now nothing remained, but to know of him, by whom hee moſt willingly would receiue his order of Knight-hood. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, before the Gyant moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this matter to him, one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other, <hi>Galaor</hi> came to him in this maner. Father, quoth he, you haue dayly promiſed me that I ſhould be Knighted, I deſire you would bee ſo good as your word: for there is too much time ſpent ſince I ought to haue had it. In ſooth my ſon (anſwered the Gyant) you haue reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for your words: yet tell me by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you would receiue your Order? King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> is reputed a gentle Prince, and a right good Knight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ſo it like you, I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue it at his hand. Wel haue you aduiſed, ſayd the Gyant: ſo preſently preparing all things in order, they ſet forward on their iourney. About fiue dayes after their departure, by good hap they came neere a very faire and ſtrong Caſtle, named <hi>Bradoid,</hi> ſeated on the toppe of a mountaine, enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about with Fennes and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, as alſo with a ſalt water, that ran before it wondrous ſwiftly, ſo that without a Barque it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to get thither. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Mariſh was very long, there was to paſſe ouer it a faire long Cauſey, being ſo broad that two Chariots might well meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on it: and at the entrance of the Cauſey was a draw-bridge, where-under the water ran with ſuch a violent fall, as no one was able by any meanes to paſſe it. Heere muſt ye note, that equally facing this bridge, there grew two goodly Elme trees, where-under the Gyant and <hi>Galaor</hi> beheld two Damoſels and a Squire, with a knight mounted on a black Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, this Knight was armed, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring figured in his Shield, two Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rampant: and becauſe the bridge was drawne vp, hee could paſſe no further, but called with a loude voyce to them within, that ſome ſhould come to giue him entrance, which <hi>Galaor</hi> perceiuing ſayd to the Gyant. My Lord (if it pleaſe you) I would glady ſee what this Knight will doe here. Soone after, they eſpyed at the further end of the Cauſey, by the Caſtle ſide, two other Armed Knights, accompained with tenne Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who came and demaunded of the knight, what he would? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie enter in, anſwered the Knight. It may not be, ſaid one of the two Knights, except you meane to combate firſt. I will not ſticke for that, anſwered hee that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cauſe you the bridge to bee let
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7181:36"/>
downe, and come to the combate: which preſently they did. But one of the twaine (more haſty then his companion) aduanced himſelfe firſt, and placing his Launce, ran with a ſwift carrier againſt the knight, who receiued him ſo braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he ſent both Horſe and man to the ground. The friend to the diſmounted knight thinking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his iniury, gaue forth to meete him, and failing in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint with their Launces, ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly encountered with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the knight of the Caſtle fell into the water where he was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the conquerour rode on, which the Halberders ſeeing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drew vp the bridge againe after him.</p>
                  <p>When the Damoſels ſaw he was thus cloſed in, they cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud vnto him that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, &amp; as he was about ſo to do, he eſpied three other Knights well armed come toward him, who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry audaciouſly thus ſpake. Vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was the houre to thee whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou dideſt paſſe this bridge, for thou ſhalt dye in this water, where he is drowned that was of greater repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation then thou art. Here with they all three together ran againſt him, and met him ſo firmely, as his Horſe was like to haue fallen ouer backward, yet hauing broken their Launces on him, he was at this encounter wounded in two places, neuertheleſſe, one of them he met in ſuch order, as his armour vnable to reſiſt the pointe of the Launce, pierced through with ſuch violence, that the trunchion ſtill remained in his body. This done, couragiouſly he drew his ſword, adreſſing himſelfe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twaine, and they in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt him; where-upon began a dangerous Combate betweene them: but he with the Lions in his Shield doubting his death, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much as he could to ouer-come his enemies, giuing one of them ſuch a ſtroke on the right arme, as (being cut from the body) it fell ſword and all to the ground: wherefore feeling himſelfe thus wounded, he galopped with all ſpeed to the Caſtell, crying. Helpe my friends, helpe your Lord who is in danger of killing. When the Knight of the Lions heard, that he with whom he muſt yet deale, was the Lord of the Caſtell: he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him ſuch a rigorous blow on the Helmet, as made him looſe his ſtirrops and ready to fall, had he not got hold about the neck of his Horſe: in this ſtaggering the Knight of the Lions rent his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met from his head, and he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himſelfe vnarmed, thought to eſcape by flight as the other did, but his enemy got betweene him and the Caſtell, ſaying. Thou art dead, if thou yeeld not thy ſelfe my priſoner. Alas, anſwered the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Knight, I am dead indeede if you pleaſe, but as you are a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman take pitty on me, for I doe yeeld my ſelfe your vanquiſhed. Suddenly the Knight of the Lions looking about, eſpied other Knights and armed men on foote, that came in great haſt from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell to ſuccour their Lord: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtepped to his conquered priſoner, and holding his ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his throate, ſaid. Command thy men to returne elſe ſhalt thou preſently die. Then he who faw his life in ſuch perill, cryed to them, &amp; made a ſigne with his hand, that if they loued him they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: where-upon, they behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Lords life at his enimies ſwords pointe, obeyed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with all poſſible ſpeed. Yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7181:37"/>
is not this enough, ſaid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, cauſe now the bridge to be let downe: which he did, and they came both forth on the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey where the Ladyes taried: but when the Knight of the Caſtell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them, and that one of them was <hi>Vrganda the vnknowne:</hi> Ah my Lord, quoth he, if you keepe me not from this Lady, I am but dead. Nay beleeue me, anſwered the Knight, that will not I do, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am to deale with thee as ſhee ſhall command me: then ſtepping to <hi>Vrganda,</hi> he ſaid. Madame, ſee here the Lord of the Caſtell, what is your pleaſure I ſhall do with him? Smite off his head, anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> if he will not deliuer you my friend whom he keepeth in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here-with he lift vp his ſword to feare him, when the Knight falling on his knee, cried. Ah my Lord, kill me not, I will obey whatſoeuer ſhe commandeth. Diſpatch it quickly then, ſaid the Knight of the Lions. So caled the Lord to one of the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berders within, ſaying. Go to my brother, and tell him if euer he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſee me aliue, let him quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe the impriſoned Knight to come hither, and the Damoſel that brought him with her. Right ſoone was the meſſenger gone on this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, returning immediatly with the Damoſell and the Knight, to whom the Knight of the Lions thus ſpake. Thanke this Lady who hath done ſo much for ye, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great cauſe you haue to loue her, in that ſhe hath taken wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paines to deliuer you from this thraldome. I do loue her, anſwered the reſtored Knight, and ſo will continue better then I haue done heretofore. But before he could fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh theſe words, <hi>Vrganda</hi> ran and embraced him, the like did he to her: afterward the conquerour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, what ſhould be done with her that brought him thither. It is neceſſary that ſhe dy, replied <hi>Vrgà<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> to let her know the price of ſo hainous an offence. Preſently was the poore Damoſel ſo ſtrangely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, as ſhe ran skipping ouer the marriſh quag-mires, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe againe, would haue throwne her ſelfe into the water, had not the knight of the Lions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Vrganda,</hi> to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe for this time. Prouided, ſaide <hi>Vrganda,</hi> that ſhe returne no more to offend me, otherwiſe ſhe ſhall pay for altogether. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord of the Caſtle ſaw the Damoſell was remitted, at his requeſt who ouer-came him, he thus ſpake. My Lord, I haue performed what hath bin commanded, therefore I pray ye giue me leaue to depart from her that neuer loued me. In ſooth, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> for honor of him by whom you make your ſuite, I am content, and you may returne. He being gone, the Knight of the Lions (who yet maruailed, by what occaſion the Damoſell was driuen into that furie) asked what moued her ſo to do? Ah my Lord, quoth ſhe, me thought one came round about me, and would haue burned me with a lighted torch, therefore to ſaue my ſelfe, I ſought to leape into the water. At theſe words the Knight fell into a laughter, ſaying. Your folly hath beene ouer great, faire Damoſel, to worke her ill who knowes how to reuenge it.</p>

                     <hi>Galaor</hi> ſtood and had ſeene all theſe things, where-upon he thus ſpake to the Giant Beleeue me fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I very much deſire that this worthy man ſhould giue me my order, for if King <hi>Liſuart</hi> be renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is for his poſſeſſions, but this Knight deſerues it by his ſtrength and valour. I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7181:37"/>
anſwered the Giant, go and requeſt it of him, if he deny you the fault is his owne. So <hi>Galaor</hi> went forward, accompanied with foure ſquires and two Damoſels <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, when comming to the Knight of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he found him yet vnder the trees. At his arriuall he was curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly receiued by the Knight, who reputed him one of the moſt come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gentlemen that euer he had ſeene, afterward <hi>Galaor</hi> thus began. Gentle Sir, I am come to entreat a fauour at your hand. Truely, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Knight, if your requeſt be reaſonable, it will the ſooner be granted. My ſuite Sir, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> is for nothing elſe, but that it might pleaſe you to giue me the order of knight-hood, and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you ſhall ſaue me a great deale of trauaile to king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to whom I am going for the ſame cauſe. My friend, replied the knight, you ſhall do your ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-much wrong, to leaue ſo good an occaſion by the beſt king in the world, for ſo poore a knight errand as I am. My Lord, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> the great ſtate of the king can put no ſuch ſtrenght into me, as I haue ſeene performed by you in the late Combats: therefore (ſo pleaſe it you) accompliſh in me my earneſt deſire. I can be much better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, anſwered the knight, to grant any other thing you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: for ſuch authority apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not to me, nor to you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is it ſo honorable. As thus they ſtood on theſe tearmes, <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> (vnlooked for) came to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where-with the knight of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was very glad: and ſhe hauing as yet not heard any of their talke, thus ſpake to her champion. What is your opinion of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman? Me thinks, quoth he, a brauer perſon was neuer ſeene: but he requireth ſuch a thing of me, as is neither in him or me conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. What is it? ſaid <hi>Vrganda.</hi> That I, quoth he, ſhould giue him the order of knight-hood, and yet he is now in trauaile, with deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to requeſt the ſame of the famous king <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Certainly, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> to make him ſtay, will be a greater cauſe of euill to him then good, and I will councel him not to deſiſt from his former motion: for you ought nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him, ſeeing I can aſſure ye, that honor will be better imployed by him, then any other in all the Iſles of the ſea, except one. Seeing it is ſo, replied the knight, in the name of God let it be done: goe we then to ſome Church to performe the vigill. It ſhall be needleſſe, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> to ſtand about ſuch matters now, in that I come not vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them already. It ſuffiſeth then, anſwered the Knight: ſo put he on his right ſpurre, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him, ſaid. You are now a knight, wherefore take the honor of the ſword by whom you ſhall thinke it more conuenient. Do you then giue it me, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> if you pleaſe, for by no other will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it with my will. Then he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Squire that held a ſword rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſtepped before, ſaying. No, no, you ſhall haue a better: take that which hangeth on yonder tree, and you ſhall finde it farre more faire and good. Heere-with they looked vpon the tree, yet ſaw it not, wherefore they all began to ſmile, and ſhe doing the like, ſaid to them. In ſooth it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ten yeeres ſince it firſt was hanged there, yet no paſſenger by euer ſaw it: looke better about the tree, for ſure you cannot but eaſily behold it. Now did they all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it tied to a branch of the tree,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7181:38"/>
euen as though it had but euen then beene hanged there: and by it was a Scabberd couered with gold, ſhewing moſt fine and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worke-manſhip on it. The Knight of the Lyons tooke it downe, and afterward girded it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſaying. So faire a Sword beſeemeth a knight ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and thinke ſhee hated you not, who of ſo long time hath kept it for you. Moſt cheerefully did <hi>Galaor</hi> giue her thankes, and the knight likewiſe, thus ſpeaking to them. I beſeech ye to hold me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, for I am conſtrained pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to depart from ye, and were it not I muſt goe where I am atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, no companie in the world would I deſire more then yours; therefore I deſire ye Sir, to tell me where I may find ye at my returne. In the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd the knight, where I ſhalbe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to ſee you: and becauſe it is no long time ſince I was knighted, I am the more deſirous of ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode there to attaine honour, as you cannot chuſe but doe the like if you come hither. Certes, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> to that place will I ſhortly follow ye: and Madame, quoth he to <hi>Vrganda,</hi> you haue ſo ſtrictly bound me to your ſeruice, as may it pleaſe you to account me your knight, I am readie whereſoeuer you ſhall command mee. So de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted he from them, returning to the Gyant who ſtayed for him by the Riuer ſide, where hee had hid himſelfe, leaſt he ſhould bee ſeene.</p>
                  <p>But now you muſt here obſerue, that as <hi>Galaor</hi> thus deuiſed with <hi>Vrganda</hi> and the Knight, one of the Damoſels that was in <hi>Galaors</hi> company, had conference with her that attended on <hi>Vrganda,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at large ſhee vnderſtood, how the knight of the Lyons was <hi>Amadis,</hi> Son to king <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule:</hi> whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thither <hi>Vrganda</hi> had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to deliuer by force of Armes her friend that there was kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, for by inchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhe could not compaſſe it, by reaſon the Ladie of the Caſtle was too cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in that Arte, and there had firſt enchanted him in deſpight of her, fearing no way to looſe him againe but by knightly chiualrie.</p>
                  <p>On this occaſion the cuſtome there was appointed, which <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ended, and reſtored (as you haue heard) the man for whom they came thither: and hee by the Damoſell, Neece to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Caſtle, that in enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted furie would haue leapt into the Riuer, was conducted to this place.</p>
                  <p>So ſoone as <hi>Galaor</hi> had left <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda,</hi> ſhee demaunded of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> if he knew the man to whom hee gaue the Order of Knight-hood. No, truely Madame, quoth he. In ſooth anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> it is great reaſon you ſhould knowe what he is: for he beareth ſo braue a minde, that if you both ſhould meet without further knowledge, there might happen betweene yee great inconuenience. Therefore I giue ye to vnderſtand, how he is your owne brother both by father and mother, and the very ſame whom the Gyant caryed away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then but two yeeres old and a halfe: now he is of ſo goodly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as you haue ſeene, for whoſe ſake and yours likewiſe, I haue a long time kept the Sword, where-with (I aſſure ye) he ſhall do more in exploits of Armes, then euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knight did in Great <hi>Brittaine. Amadis</hi> concieued hereat ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ioy, as the teares trickled downe his cheekes, wherefore he ſaid to <hi>Vrganda.</hi> I beſeech ye Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7181:38"/>
tell mee where I may finde him. It is not neceſſarie, quoth ſhe, that as yet you ſhould ſeeke him. Why ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> is he then conſtrained to accompliſh ſome predeſtinate matter, before I may finde him? Yea verily, anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> and it is not ſo eaſie to know as you may imagine. Long time thus continued their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, till <hi>Vrganda</hi> would depart alone with her friend: ſo ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Amadis</hi> to God, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tooke his way toward <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore,</hi> where at this time King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> ſoiourned.</p>
                  <p>Our Hiſtorie (at this time) pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of him, continuing what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Galaor</hi> the new Knight, who beeing arriued where the Gyant ſtayed for him, thus ſpake. Father, I am now thanks bee to God, and him you ſent me to, a confirmed knight. My ſonne, quoth the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, I am not a little glad thereof: and ſeeing it is ſo well effected, will yee graunt mee one requeſt? What? ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> am I to denie you any thing, except you would with-hold mee from ſeeking ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor? My ſonne, anſwered the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, I rather deſire thy happy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding therein, and that which I would haue appertaineth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Demand then what you will, ſaid <hi>Galaor</hi> for I graunt it. Faire Sonne, quoth the Gyant, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you haue heard mee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the Gyant <hi>Albadan,</hi> who by treaſon ſlewe my Father, and yet forcibly detaineth from me the Rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> which iuſtly doth belong to me: I pray ye to take reuenge on my behalfe, for no other then you may doe it: remember how well I haue nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and vſed you, as alſo my true and vnfained loue, which is ſuch, as I will yeeld my perſon euen to the death for ſafetie of yours. This matter ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> you need not requeſt, but command me to doe it: as for my ſelfe, I deſire you to reſt content, till with <hi>Albadan</hi> I haue tryed this difference, ſeeing it concerneth you ſo neere. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, heereof you may bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if I eſcape with life, I ſhall continue euermore in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to accompliſh any thing elſe for your honour and profit: in which deuoire, the whole circuit of my time is bound, as witneſſe of the dutie I owe to you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without any longer trifling, let vs ſet forward to him with whom I muſt try my fortune. So tooke they the way to the rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> but before they had trauailed farre, <hi>Vrganda</hi> ouer-tooke them, and being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with each other, ſhe ſaid to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor.</hi> Know yee (gentle Sir) who hath this day made you Knight? That doe I Madame, anſwered <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> euen the beſt knight that euer I heard of. It is very true (quoth ſhe) yet is hee of greater eſteeme then you thinke, but I would haue you to know his name: then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſhe <hi>Gandalaz</hi> the Gyant, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Gandalaz,</hi> doeſt not thou know that this knight (whom thou haſt nouriſhed) is the Sonne to king <hi>Perion,</hi> and his Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſena,</hi> and how by ſuch like wordes I bad thee take him, ſince which time thou haſt beene his Foſter father? It is very true, anſwered the Gyant. Now then <hi>Galaor,</hi> my friend, ſaid <hi>Vrganda,</hi> the man that made thee knight is thy brother and elder then thou by two yeers: wherefore when thou ſeeſt him, giue him honour, and labour to reſemble him in hardineſſe and kindſhip. May it be poſſible? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> that King <hi>Perion</hi> is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7181:39"/>
my Father, and Queene <hi>Eliſena</hi> my mother, and I the brother to ſo good a knight? Doubt not thereof (quoth ſhee) for it is ſo. Praiſed be God, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> now may I aſſureye, that I am in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before: nor wil I make any ſpare of my life, ſeeing it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary I ſhould reſemble him you talke of. Thus returned <hi>Vrganda</hi> the ſame way ſhee came, and the Gyant with <hi>Galaor</hi> rode on as they purpoſed, the Prince demanding of the Gyant, what the Lady was that had communed with them? It is quoth hee, <hi>Vrganda the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,</hi> as ſhe nameth her ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe often tranſ-formeth and maketh her ſelfe vnknowne. As thus they deuiſed together, they came to a Riuers ſide where they would refreſh themſelues, and by reaſon the heate of the day was very vehement, they cauſed a Tent to bee erected: where long they had not ſitten, but they beheld two Damoſels comming toward them by two ſeuerall wayes, and met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether directly before the Pauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. So ſoone as they eſpied the Gyant, they would haue fledde, but <hi>Galaor</hi> came to aſſure them, and curteouſly cauſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, demanding afterward whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they trauailed. I goe (quoth one of them) by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Miſtreſſe, to ſee a ſtrange fight, which one onely Knight hath enterpriſed in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, againſt the ſtrong Gyant at the Rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> to the ende I may bring her true tidings there-of. When the other Damoſell heard her ſay ſo, ſhe thus replyed. I am amazed at your ſpeeches, is there any knight in the word dare venter on ſuch follie? Certes, ſaid the firſt, it is moſt true. Beleeue me, anſwered the other, although my occaſions be elſe-where, I am content to ſtay and goe with you, to ſee a matter ſo incredible. Hereupon they would haue taken leaue of <hi>Galaor,</hi> but hee ſaid to them. Make no haſt faire Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, but tarrie if you pleaſe, and we wil beare ye companie: where-to they condiſcended, as well for the good grace they noted in this new Knight, as alſo in reſpect of his amiable countenance, which made them take great pleaſure in beholding him: then <hi>Galaor</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the Giant aſide, ſaid, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I could wiſh that you would goe no further with vs, but let me goe with theſe Damoſels to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what I haue promiſed: this hee ſpake becauſe hee would not be knowne what hee was, or that his enterpriſe ſhould bee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by them, whereto the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant (vnwillingly) did accord. So rode <hi>Galaor</hi> with the Damoſels, and three Squires the Giant left him to beare his Armour, making ſuch ſpeede in their iourney, that they arriued within two Miles of the Rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> where they lodged in the little Cottage of an Hermite, to whom <hi>Galaor</hi> impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome of his ſecret thoughts: but when hee reuealed that hee came for the Combate, the good Hermit (abaſhed thereat) diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him in this manner.</p>
                  <p>My Sonne, who hath aduiſed thee to this boldnes, ſeeing there is not in all this Countrey ten ſuch Knights, as dare aſſaile the Gyant, ſo fearefull and monſtrous is he to behold: and you being but yong, to hazard your ſelfe in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, aduenture the loſſe both of bodie and ſoule, becauſe ſuch as wilfully ſeeke their owne death, are very homicides of themſelues. Father, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> God
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7181:39"/>
worke his will with mee, for by no meanes may I let paſſe mine enterpriſe. Greatly was the good man mooued to compaſſion, ſo that the teares be deawed his milke-white beard, beeing able to make no other anſwere, but thus: If not my Sonne, I deſire God to aſſiſt yee, ſeeing you will giue no better credite to me. Good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> be mindfull of mee in your deuout Prayers: and thus till next morning they ſpent the night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galaor</hi> hauing armed himſelfe, went to the Rocke which was not farre from the Hermitage, for there might be eaſily diſcerned the Fortreſſe &amp; great Towers, which deliuered good marke of a moſt ſtrong Caſtle. When one of the Damoſels ſaw they approched ſo neere, ſhe demaunded of <hi>Galaor,</hi> if he knew the Knight that ſhould performe the Combate? I thinke (quoth he) I haue ſeene him ſome-time: but tell me (I pray yee) from what place are you come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this paſtime? And what is the Lady that ſent you? None muſt know ſo much, ſayd the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, but the Knight him-ſelfe which dealeth in the Combate. Thus continued their talke, till they arriued at the Caſtle of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badan,</hi> the gate wherof they found faſt ſhut, but <hi>Galaor</hi> ſtepping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to called the Porter: at which noiſe, two menſhewed themſelues ouer the Porch, demaunding of him what he would haue. Goe, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> and ſay to <hi>Albadan,</hi> that heere is a Knight, who is ſent from <hi>Gandalaz</hi> to defie him: and if he come not out the ſooner, he will ſhew himſelfe of leſſe valour then reputation. You haue reaſon (ſayd one of them in mockage) but he will quickly bring a remedie for your chollor, if you doe not helpe it your ſelfe by running away. So departed the Watch-men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Gyant of theſe Newes, and when the Damoſels vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that <hi>Galaor</hi> him-ſelfe muſt execute the enterpriſe, being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with amazement, they ſayd. Ah my Lord, you attempt a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ouer-much folly, would God you might ſpeed ſo well, as with honor to accompliſh an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of ſuch conſequence: As for me (quoth one of them) I dare tarrie no longer with ye, for I ſhall die at the ſight of the Monſter with whom you haue to deale.</p>
                  <p>Damoſels, ſayd hee, ſeeing you may not be aſſured heere, depart I pray ye to the Hermitage, where we lodged this laſt night, and if I dye not in fight, I will not be long from ye. Beleeue me, replyed the other Damoſell, what-ſoeuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen I will not goe, for I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to ſee the ende.</p>
                  <p>The boldneſſe of the one made them both tarrie, yet did they ſunder themſelues by the Forreſt ſide, becauſe the Gyant ſhould not ſee them, and hoping the better to eſcape away if the Knight ſped not well.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Oone was the Giant aduertiſed of theſe newes, wherefore not long after he came forth of the Caſtell, mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted on a horſe proportionable to ſuch a huge body: for it ſeemed an elephant, &amp; he on his back made ample reſemblance of a huge <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus,</hi> or like a mountaine mouing, rather then a man. Armed he was in plates of iron ſo long, as from his throate they couered all the ſaddle on the horſe, hauing on his head a bright ſhining Helmet, and in his hand a mighty iron Mace, being the weapon where-with hee commonly vſed to fight. Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affraide were the Squires and the Ladies that beheld him, and <hi>Galaor</hi> was not ſo aſſured, but hee ſtood ſome-what abaſhed: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he reſolued ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly, as the neerer he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the leſſe account he made of his huge enemies Mace. When the Giant ſaw him come marching ſo brauely toward him, he ſaid. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile demie man, how thou dareſt with ſuch boldneſſe tarry thy death he that ſent thee hither might either borow thy courage, or thou his corpulence, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended I ſhould breake my faſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the houre of dinner came. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> ſomewhat diſcontented with theſe deſpiſings, thus anſwered. Thinkeſt thou huge beaſt that thy barking can aduantage thee, or hinder me? my confidence is in him who abated the pride of the great Philiſtine, and can likewiſe deliuer thee more baſe and vile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duſt. Exceeding angry was the Giant at theſe words, wherefore without any more talke, he lifted vp his Mace to ſtrike, ſeeming in his marching as though a Tower had beene caried about, but <hi>Galaor</hi> being prompt &amp; nimble, ſtooped his Launce, and with a rough ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere of his horſe, attainted him on the ſtomacke ſo brauely, as he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the mighty <hi>Poliphemus</hi> forgoe one of his ſtirrops, his Launce therewith ſhiuering in pieces in the aire. At this encounter the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant thought to haue ſtroken him downe with his Mace, but he was too roughly and ſuddenly ſtaied, whereby his blow was giuen in vaine: for the Mace which was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and comparable to a huge beame in bignes, being deliuered with ful force of both his armes: fel downe ſo weightily, as the Giant himſelfe was not able to hold it, whereby it lighted on the head of his owne horſe ſo peazantly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feld there-with, dyed preſantly vnder him, the Giant tarying a good while before he could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelfe againe. Yet the horſe being of courage, did ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtriue to get vp, but <hi>Galaor</hi> thruſting his ſword into his belly, cauſed him at length to lie there ſtill enough: but in the end, the Giant did the like to <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe, and he ſeeing in what great danger now he was, by his wonted dexterity quickly got footing. Then approching his enemy, drew the ſword <hi>Vrganda</hi> had giuen him, wherewith wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching when the Giant lifted his Mace, he gaue ſuch a ſtroke at it where he held his hands, as brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſtoke in pieces, he left but
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7181:40"/>
little length for the Giant to holde it by: yet he made ſhift to buffet <hi>Galaor</hi> there-with in ſuch ſorte, as he was conſtrained to ſet one hand to the ground to ſuſtaine himſelfe. But all this did no iot aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him, for comming to the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, (who yet kept play with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of his Mace, which by wary eſcapes the Prince ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented) he gaue a ſtroke at him with ſo full force, as cleane cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the left arme from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the ſword paſſing further with like ſtrength, met the Giants leg ſo directly, that it wounded him through the fleſh, with a wide gaping wound to the very bone. Feeling great paine by both theſe maimes, he cried out aloud: Ah vnhappy wretch that I am, to be thus ouercome by the ſtrength of one man. Being in extreame rage, he ſought to faſten hold on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Galaor,</hi> but the ſore wound on his leg would let him ſtand no longer, conſtraining him to fall on his knees to the ground: &amp; as the Prince aproch't to him, he thought with his other arme to pull him down, but <hi>Galaor</hi> perceiuing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſtroke at him againe &amp; ſmot off his hand. Now was the Giant deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled of all force, being ſo woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ouer-trauailed withal, that he was no longer able to endure: by which meanes <hi>Galaor</hi> more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parted his head fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſholders, which he deliuered his Squires to cary with him. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Damoſels beheld this famous conqueſt, they left their ambuſh, &amp; came to regard this maruaile, ſaying to <hi>Galaor.</hi> In ſooth worthy Knight, great good nurture hath beene beſtowed on you by your educator: for as we haue here-tofore heard, he hath the profit and vengeance, and you the honor exceeding all.</p>
                  <p>As they were about to rerurne, they ſaw ten Knights come forth of the caſtle chained together, who cried to him. Come my Lord, come take this place, ſeeing you haue done him dead that ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly detained vs priſoners. What thinke you? ſaid <hi>Galaor</hi> to the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels, may we ſoiourne here this after noone? Truely, quoth they, we thinke nothing to the contrary. So went they into hhe Caſtle, where <hi>Galaor</hi> diſcharged the priſoners: &amp; ſoone after, viands for dinner was brought him and his company by the ſeruants. When they had refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them-ſelues, and at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure viſited the Fortreſſe, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects inhabiting the Rock came all to him, and would haue done him honor as to their Lord: but he by no meanes would accept thereof, for he tolde them that what he had done, was on the behalfe of <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laz,</hi> to whom that place by right appertained. And I, quoth he, as bound to him by duty, came hither to prepare his lodging: therefore I pray ye that he may be well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of you all, and obey him as your true and naturall Lord, for wel am I aſſured, that he wil in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All things thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and accorded, <hi>Galaor</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thence with his company, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Hermitage, where the Hermit attended for happy newes: but he was not alittle glad to ſee <hi>Galaor</hi> come with ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7181:41"/>
wherefore he thus ſpake. My ſon, daily are you bound to praiſe the diuine bounty, whoſe loue hath giuen you grace to execute this notable vengeance. On the morrow, after he had receiued the good mans benediction, he ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on hias way, &amp; one of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels intreted him, that he would ſuffer her to trauaile in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whereto right willingly he gaue conſent. And I, quoth the other, muſt take another way, in that I had not come thus farre, but onely to behold the iſſue of the combat, which I haue ſeene with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as I muſt needs make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable reporte thereof to other, &amp; ſo ſhall I not faile to do in the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> whether now I go to finde a brother of mine gone thether before me. Faire Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> if you meete a yong Knight, who beareth in his Shield a couple of Lions, I pray ye ſay to him, that the Gentleman, to whom not long ſince he gaue the order of Knight-hood, doth hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſalute him, adding this withall, how he endeuoureth to honor the order, and when they both ſhall meate, he will acquainte him with ſuch matter betweene them, as yet perhaps he knoweth not. So tooke the Damoſell her leaue of <hi>Galaor,</hi> who afterward thus began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with the other. You know Lady, that I haue finiſhed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with the Giant, and you ſaide to me before I began it, how the Knight himſelfe ſhould know what ſhe is that ſent you thether. Very true, anſwered the Damoſell, but if you would be reſolued therein, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and within fiue daies I will ſhew you her. That ſhall not let me, ſaid <hi>Galaor:</hi> thus rode they on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo long, till at length they came to a forked way, and <hi>Galaor</hi> who rid muzing before, thought ſhe had followed him: but ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted behind a little, and when ſhe hoped to ouer-take him againe, it was her hap to take the wrong way. This chanced at the entrance of the Forreſt of <hi>Braganda,</hi> which ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Countries of <hi>Claire</hi> and <hi>Greſca,</hi> where long he had not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but he heard a voice thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to him. Ah good Knight, help me. <hi>Galaor</hi> turning his head to ſee what was the cauſe: I thinke, quoth one of his Squires, it ſhould be the Damoſell that departed from vs. What? ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> hath ſhe left vs? Yea truely, anſwered the Squire, ſhe tooke the way leading on the left hand. Beleeue me, quoth he, I had very little care of her, &amp; haſtly without taking his Helmet, hauing only his Shield and Lance, he galopped ſo faſt as he could to the place where he heard the voice, and hard at hand he eſpied fiue men on foote, armed with Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and Halberds, and a Dwarffe on horſe-back, who cruelly laied on the Damoſell with a ſtaffe. When <hi>Galaor</hi> approched neere them, hee came to the Dwarffe, ſaiyng. Thou villainous and deformed creature, ſoone ſhall I ſend thy ſoule to the Diuell: and running fiercely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with his Launce, threw him againſt the ground maruail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly amazed. Then came the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eagerly vppon him, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him on euery ſide: but to the firſt he gaue ſuch a grieting with his Launce, as he lay ſprangling on the earth. Another of them buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led cloſe to him, laying load on his Shield with his Halberd, but at length he pierced his Lance quite through his body. When the other three ſaw this maſſacre, they ranne away ſo faſt as they could ouer-thwart the Forreſt, and <hi>Galaor</hi> not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7181:41"/>
able to ouertake them, returned backe againe to the Dwarffe, who being gotten on horſe-back, fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after the other, crying. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed Knight, in hapleſſe houre haſt thou miſuſed my men, for thou ſhalt dy an euill death. <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing the Dwarffe laboured ſo hard as he could to ſaue himſelfe, would follow him no further, but went to ſee if his Launce were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken, which he had left in the body of the dead man: and finding it ſound as it was before, gaue it to his Squire, ſaying to the Damoſell. Ride now before me, and I will guard you better then I haue done.</p>
                  <p>So tooke they the way againe they had left, that brought them to a Riuer named <hi>Braz,</hi> which could not be paſſed at the foord: now rode the Damoſell ſomewhat farre before <hi>Galaor,</hi> finding the paſſage ſo ready, as ſhe went ouer before he came. In meane while he ſtaied the returne of the boate, he eſpied the Dwarffe come after him cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Villainous traitour thou art dead, if thou deliuer not the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell thou tookeſt from me. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle account did <hi>Galaor</hi> make of his words, but looking backe, he ſaw three Knights come after the Dwarffe well mounted, one of the three thus ſpeaking to the reſt. It were great diſhonor for vs, to ſet all three together vpon one man: and as for my ſelfe, I thinke ſcorne to be aſſiſted by any. Hauing ſo ſaid, with a full courſe he ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prince, who likewiſe was ready to entertaine him, and they encountred in ſuch ſorte, as the Knight pierced <hi>Galaors</hi> Armour, making him feele the naked pointe of his Launce: but <hi>Galaor</hi> bad him ſo brauely welcome, caſting him from his ſaddle with ſuch might as he lay on the ground not able to ſtirre, whereat the other twaine were ſo abaſhed, that they ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prince, the one failing, and the other breaking his Lance: which <hi>Galaor</hi> determining to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, ſtroke his Launce into the ſight of the laſt Knights Helmet, as he made it fall from his head, and he (hauing loſt his ſtirrops) ready to lye along. Meane while, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond who had not broken, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt <hi>Galaor,</hi> &amp; ſped in mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Now albeit the encounter was with great vigour, yet eſcaped the armour on either ſide. Hauing thus galantly ſhiuered their ſtaues, they drew forth their ſwords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a fierce and cruell combat, and while the fight endured, the Dwarffe without ceaſing cryed to his men. Looke well that he eſcape not, but kill him leaſt he get away. Then <hi>Galaor</hi> comming neere him who had loſt his Helmet, reached him ſuch a ſtroke on the head, as he tumbled downe dead before him. And when the third ſaw his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion ſlaine, being affraid of him-ſelfe, he turned his back and away: but <hi>Galaor</hi> purſued him ſo neere, that he gaue him a blow betweene the neck and the ſhoulders, which brought off a great many plats of his Armour. Now did the run-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies feare more &amp; more encreaſe, when he felt his enemy ſo neere at hand, wherefore the better to ſaue himſelfe, he caſt his ſhield back o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his ſhoulders, &amp; fled away faſter then he did before: which <hi>Galaor</hi> perceiuing, would follow him no longer, but haſtily returned, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to take the Dwarffe and binde his legs to a tree, from which the Dwarffe kept himſelfe wel enough, for he had gotten more ground in running away then the other. Here-upon he came to the firſt that he diſmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, who hauing ſome-what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7181:42"/>
recouered himſelfe, <hi>Galaor</hi> thus ſpake to him. Inſooth your misfortune grieueth mee more then your fellowes doth, for like a good Knight you came alone to me, albeit I know not on what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, in reſpect I neuer offended ye as I remember. It is very true, anſwered the Knight, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you muſt note what the Dwarffe ſayd to vs: how you had beaten him, ſlaine his men, and taken a Lady perforce from him, that was in his companie.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Damoſell on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Riuer) he falſly ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were it that I had brought her away perforce, ſhe would not tarry for me, ſo willingly as ſhee doth: but ſhe vnhappily ſtraying in this Forreſt, the Dwraffe met with her, offering to leade her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way againſt her will, and becauſe ſhe would not obey him, he gaue her many cruel ſtrokes with a ſtaff. Ah, Traitour that he is, anſwered the knight for this villainie ſhall I reward him if euer wee meete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And becauſe <hi>Galaor</hi> found the Knight in ſo good ſort, he holpe to take his horſe that had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped: deſiring him to puniſh the Dwarff for his treaſon. This done, he entred the boate and paſt the water, afterward hee and the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell rode on their way, ſhee ſhewing him ſoone after a Caſtle neere at hand, which ſtood very brauely on the toppe of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ſaying. Here will be the beſt lodging we ſhall finde this night: and alighting from their horſes, they were entertained there with maruailous curteſie, it being the dwelling of the Damoſels mother. Soone after was the Prince vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and then the Damoſell came to him in this manner.</p>
                  <p>To the ende (my Lord) I may keepe promiſe with yee, if you pleaſe to ſtay heere till I returne, which credite me ſhal be very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily: I will bring ye newes of her whom you deſire to ſee. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> prouided that you make no tarriance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue affaires of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance elſe-where. Let it ſuffice, replyed the Damoſell, you ſhall ſee me againe ſooner then you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine. And ſo ſhe departed, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch diligence, as <hi>Galaor</hi> was not diſpleaſed with her ſtay. At her returne, they mounted on horſe-backe, and rode together croſſe the Forreſt, which when they left, the night ouer-tooke them: whereupon the Damoſell forſaking the out-right way, turned aſide, and by time the greater part of the night was ſpent, they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at a very faire Citie, named <hi>Grandares,</hi> where comming to a Caſtle gate, the Damoſell ſayd. Now let vs alight, and follow me, for here will I ſhew you her, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: but leaue not your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous and Armour, becauſe one can ſcant tell what may happen. The Damoſell went before, and <hi>Galaor</hi> followed her till they came neere the wall. Get vp heere ſaid the Damoſell, and I will goe on the other ſide to attend you. With much adoe he aſcended the wall, by reaſon of his weightie Armor, as alſo beeing troubled with his Shield and Helmet. When the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>oſell ſaw hee was amounted, ſhee entred the Pallace to guide him as ſhe begun: in meane while <hi>Galaor</hi> was diſcended, and ſate hard by a Poſterne that entred a Garden, where he tarryed ſo long, till the Damoſell came and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the doore with one of her companions, but ere hee entred,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7181:42"/>
they thus ſpake. Although you haue attained thus farre, yet before you paſſe any further, you muſt needs tell vs whoſe ſonne you are. Let that alone anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> for I haue ſuch a Father, as til the time of better happe, I am content not to name him. Neuertheleſſe, quoth one of them, it is very neceſſarie we ſhould know, for it ſhall not be any way to your hinderance. I am (anſwered <hi>Galaor)</hi> Sonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and the Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and it is not ſixe dayes paſt ſince I could not tell yee ſo much. Stay then ſaid the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: ſo they cauſed him to be vn-armed, caſting a Mantle about his ſhoulders and afterward went on, the firſt Damoſell going before, and the other comming behinde him. In this manner they entred the Pallace, paſſing through a chamber, where many Ladies and Gentlewomen were in bed: and if any one demaunded who went by ſo late, the Damoſels (his guides) made anſwere for him. Thus not perceiued by any, they came to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Chamber, wherein when <hi>Galaor</hi> entred, he ſaw ſitting on a gorgious bedde a moſt beautifull Ladie, with an Iuory combe kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing her faire locks: but when ſhe eſpied <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhe preſenly caſt on her head a Chaplet of Flowers, and came to meete him whom the Damoſels had brought, ſaying. My Friend, you are right heartily welcome, being the beſt knight in the word that I know. And you, Madame, quoth he, are moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily found, being the faireſt Ladie that euer I ſaw. Then the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that had guided him thither, thus ſpake. My Lord, ſee here my Miſtreſſe, now am I diſcharged of the promiſe I made ye, and if you would haue me ſay any more: ſhe is named <hi>Aldena,</hi> daughter to king <hi>Serolys,</hi> and becauſe the wife to the Duke of <hi>Briſtoya,</hi> is ſiſter to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe nouriſheth her here, as her owne daughter. And you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, (quoth ſhee to the young Princeſſe, haue here preſent (as I can aſſure yee) the Sonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule:</hi> wherefore you being both the children of Kings, excelling in beautie and natures perfections, if ye loue together no one dare blame ye. Here-with ſhe went preſently foorth of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and making faſt the doore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her, left the two loues alone: by which meanes they ſpent this night ſo amorouſly, as they that haue taſted like fortune may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and therefore meed I make no further talke thereof.</p>
                  <p>But the houre being come when <hi>Galaor</hi> ſhould depart, he was wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduiſed thereof by the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, who brought him to the place were ouer-night hee had left his Armour: and after hee was inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted therein (as hee ought to be) he went along the Garden againe where-through he came in. And as neuer any good chanceth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome miſhap attending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo nowe came it to paſſe for there found he the Dwarffe ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that had ſo miſuſed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you haue heard, who no ſooner eſpied him, but hee cryed out. Beleeue me, Sir Royſter, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe waſt thou to enter heere, for thou dyeſt, and the traitereſſe that did conduct thee. Come foorth Knights, come foorth, here is a man that ſecretly came out of the Dukes Chamber. It was no time then for <hi>Galaor</hi> to ſleepe, but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly getting vp the wall, caſt him-ſelfe on the other ſide, where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his horſe readie, he preſently mounted: notwithſtanding, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7181:43"/>
Dwarffe and the reſt (well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſecret iſſues of the Caſtle) with all ſpeed purſued him, and perceiuing how this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous Dwarffe was cauſe of all this trouble, ſtayed, ſaying to him-ſelfe. Either I will die, or bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged on this rediculous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if I catch him. Then came the other and ſet vpon him, but ſo brauely did he defend himſelfe, as none of them durſt be bold to tary neere him: for he being mooued to exceeding impatience, thruſt himſelfe in the midſt among them, laying about with courage, as well they found who they dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing the Dwarffe ſtill kept aloofe, determining to die, but he would lay hold on him, and entring among the thickeſt of them, before his Launce brake he ſlew two out-right: then drawing his Sword, made them ſo ſoundly acquainted with the ſharpe edge thereof, as he that thought him-ſelfe hardyeſt, was glad to giue him way, for no one medled with him but was layd along. At length they compaſſed him in ſuch ſort, as they found meanes to kill his horſe, which made him fall to the ground in very great danger, for now they verily intended to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him, and the Dwarffe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe that hee could not eſcape, came neere to ſhew ſome part of his man hood: but when he ſaw <hi>Galaor</hi> had in ſpight of them recouered his feet, and happy was he which kept furtheſt from him, hee turned his horſe to eſcape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet by chaunce <hi>Galaor</hi> got hold on the reines of his bridle, giuing him ſuch a blowe on the ſtomacke with the hilts of his Sword, that he fell to the ground ſo loutiſhly, as the blood guſhed foorth at all the conduits of his head. Then lightly mounted hee on the Dwarffes horſe, and the Beaſt ſeeming to ſtorme at this change, from an euill fauoured Dwarffe to one of the beſt knights in the world, made proofe whether his Rider could ſit faſt, or no, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning violently with him a good diſtance from his enemies. And turning to make an ende of his worke, as by chaunce he lifted his eyes to the Caſtle, he ſaw in one of the windowes the Ladie whom he had choſen as his friend, ſhee ſhaking a white hand-kercher to him, meaning he ſhould be gone with all poſſible ſpeed, which hee did, becauſe hee perceiued more enemies at hand. With nimble pace he hyed him away, not tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till hee recouered the Forreſt, where to refreſh himſelfe a while, he gaue his Helmet to his Squire.</p>
                  <p>Now ſhall ye vnderſtand, how when the Dukes Knights ſaw him make ſuch haſte away, ſome were of the opinion to follow him, the reſt ſaid it was in vaine, ſeeing hee had gotten into the wood, &amp; thus debating, they went no further, but ſtood as men confounded, with maruailing howe one man could be able to vanquiſh ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Meane while the Dwarffe was come to himſelfe againe, but hee felt his body ſo ſore and bruiſed, as very hardly could he ſtand on his feet, yet ſtill he cryed to them in this manner.</p>
                  <p>My friends, cary me to my Lord the Duke, for I will let him know what hee muſt needes reuenge. Through theſe importunate accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, he was brought by them before the Duke, to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, how he met the Damoſell in the Forreſt, &amp; becauſe he would haue accompany her home, ſhee cryed out till a Knight came to and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7181:43"/>
her, who killed his men, and beate him likewiſe very cruelly. Afterward, how hee followed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with three Knightts to haue her from him, and they in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were diſcomfited.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that ſhee brought the ſame Knight to his Honours Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and ſuffered him to bee with her in the Dukes owne Chamber. The Duke being highly offended herear, demaunded if he knew the Damoſell he thus complained on. Yea, my Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, if I ſee her againe. Here-upon all the Ladyes, and Gentle-women were ſent for, and ſo ſoone as the Dwarffe beheld her he ſayd. This is ſhee (my Lord) by whom your Pallace is diſhonoured. Ah Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, anſwered the Damoſell, thou lyeſt faſly, for had not the Knight come to reſcue mee in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, thou wouldeſt haue abuſed mee: &amp; villanouſly didſt beate me, becauſe I would not conſent to thee. Very much incenſed with anger, was the Duke againſt the Damoſell, and ſayd to her. By mine honour (falſe woman) I will make thee to reueale the truth. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he ſent her to cloſe priſon: yet not-with-ſtanding all the paine ſhe endured, ſhee would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer any thing touching her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes ſecrets, albeit ſhee was there very long tormented: to the no little griefe and ſorrow of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> that dearely loued her, and knew not by any other how to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of her <hi>Galaor.</hi> But the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thinking he hath kept ye too long from <hi>Amadis,</hi> returneth to him: intending when place &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall ſerue, to finiſh that which afterward happened to <hi>Galaor.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat ioy had <hi>Amadis</hi> at his departure from <hi>Vrganda,</hi> as well for vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that the man whom hee had Knighted, was his owne Brother, as alſo becauſe he approched neer the place where his <hi>Oriana</hi> ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hoping ere-long to haue a ſight of her. And ſo long trauailed he through a Forreſt where-into he had entred, as he was ſurprized with darke night before he could finde any houſe for lodging, yet notwithſtanding the obſcuritie of the night, he eſpied in the wood a great fire: wherefore he rode thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward, and by the way chanced on a faire Fortreſſe, as he gathered by the lights he beheld through the glaſſe windowes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere thereto, he heard the voyces of men and women ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tunable to ſweet Muſicke that conſorted with them. When he came to the gate, he knocked and called for ſome to open it: but the harmony of the Muſicke, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noyſe in the Caſtle, made ſuch hinderance, as hee was not heard. Notwithſtanding, hee ſtill more loud knocked and called, till certaine came and peeped foorth at ſmall creuiſes in the gate, and ſeeing him, one of them demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what he would haue there ſo late. Sir, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I am a ſtrange Knight that ſeekes for lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.

Strange? quoth he within the Caſtell, it appeareth ſo by thy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but more by thy manner of walking ſo late: our country-men deſire the day time, and thou ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt it, fearing to be ſeene, or leaſt thou ſhouldeſt haue occaſion to Combate, and at ſuch an houre as this is, none trauaile the way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be Diuels. Beleeue me, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> little courteſie doe you know or ſhew, that vſe theſe words, ſeeing without further knowledge what I am, you not only rebuke but condemne me: and I thinke if you are poſſeſſed either with ſence or man-hood, you haue ſometime beene in like diſtreſſe as I am, and hauing found it in your ſelfe, neuer reproue it in another. Thou maieſt make triall thereof if thou wilt, quoth he in the Caſtell: but get thee walking, for here ſhalt thou ſet no foote this night. Now truſt me, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I thinke thou wouldeſt haue no man of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew in thy company: yet before we part, I am deſirous to know what thou art. That will I tel thee, quoth the other, on this condition, that when ſo euer we meete, thou ſhalt combate with me. I will not ſtick for that, anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> Know then, ſaid he within, how I am <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> who commands thee not to ſtray ſo farre this night, but that I may find thee to morrow morning. Thou vaunteſt of thy ſelfe very much, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> but if thou wilt cauſe Torches to be brought hither to giue vs light, and come forth preſently without longer ſtay: we ſhall ſoone ſee who ought to haue the worſſe lodging this night. What? ſaid <hi>Dardan,</hi> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with an Owle, the enemy of the day, muſt I bring Torches, and this night take Armes? vnwiſe is he, that ſo late to gaine ſuch ſimple honor, will either put on ſpurre or Cuyrate: and with theſe words he went from the gate.</p>
                  <p>Heere may the Reader by him-ſelfe diſcourſe awhile, what fruite ouer-braining commonly bringeth with it, &amp; contrariwiſe, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (among all other vertues) is in modeſtie. No well grounded courage, or gallant diſpoſed body, can duely put in exerciſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the one or other, if mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration &amp; temperance be not their guids therein. And albeit valiance &amp; hardines is a great gift of God: yet are they ſo pernitious in ſuch as haue them, (who are tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with paſſions, or the glory of ambition,) as they be euen no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then cowardiſe &amp; preſumtion. Eloquence, and the facultie of well ſpeaking, is a rich and precious gift of nature, augmented and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by long vſe and ſtudy, to giue light and decking to the faire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the ſpirit: but it is there a more hurtfull peſtilence in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, then when a well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Oratour will miſuſe his art &amp; ſweetnes of language? Haue not ſome bin knowne to perſwade ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people, to enterpriſe things which afterward haue brought their ruine and ſubuertion? I leaue the confidence of the wiſe, and the opinitiue in their owne beauty, the one procuring to many the loſſe of their ſoules, and the other to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number the deſtruction of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: ſo hurtfull in all things it too much vſurpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ouer-weening, and immoderate eſtimation of our ſelues. I will not heere compare the wiſdome of <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie of furious <hi>Aiax,</hi> or the violence of <hi>Turnus,</hi> with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of <hi>Aeneas:</hi> nor make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remonſtrances by the ſucceſſe of great matters, happening to

mighty perſonages both <hi>Greekes</hi> &amp; <hi>Latines.</hi> It ſhall content me, to ſet for example this only accident of indiſcreete <hi>Dardan,</hi> to the end that yong Gentlemen, who take delight to read this Hiſtory: ſeeing on the one ſide the patient magnanimity of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and on the other the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious brutality of <hi>Dardan,</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the vertues to be imitated, &amp; the vices to be deteſted and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> then ſomewhat diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the outragious ſpeeches of <hi>Dardan,</hi> departed, not ſo much caring for his lodging, as how to be reuenged: &amp; concluded, ſome-time in walking about, and other while in reſting by a buſh, to paſſe the incommodity of this night in the Forreſt, thus to beguile the time till day riſing. As there hee traced vp and downe, he heard the ſpeech of ſome body nere him, and looking about, eſpied two Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels on horſe-back accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Squire: after they had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him, and he them, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from whence he came ſo late armed, wherewith <hi>Amadis</hi> throughly reported, all that had happened to him at the Caſtell. Know you, ſaid the Damoſels, the name of the Knight? That doe I, quoth he, for he tolde me his name is <hi>Dardan.</hi> Very true, ſaid they, hee is called <hi>Dardan the proud,</hi> the moſt audatious Knight in this country. I beleeue it well, anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> Sir Knight, quoth they, ſeeing you are ſo vnprouided of lodging, if you will take patience to remaine this night in our tentes, which are pitched heere hard at hand, you ſhall be welcome. He glad of this courteſie, rode with them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there alighted, <hi>Amadis</hi> cauſed his Squire to vnarme him. When the Damoſels ſaw him ſo faire, and of ſuch honeſt conuerſation, they were well pleaſed with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and ſo they ſupped together merily, afterward they gaue him a pallad to reſt vpon. Neuertheleſſe, before they parted, they demanded of him whether he trauailed. To the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis.</hi> And ſo do we replied the Damoſels, to ſee what ſhall happen to a Lady, one of the beſt and moſt noble in the Country, who hath committed her welfar to the triall of a Combate, and it muſt be within few dayes following bee performed before King <hi>Liſuart:</hi> but yet wee know not who will be the man, for he againſt whom the cauſe muſt be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, is one of the beſt Knights in all great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> What is, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the Knight ſo much eſteemed, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many good? It is the ſame <hi>Dardan,</hi> anſwered the Damoſels, from whome ſo lately you came. And on what cauſe, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> ariſeth the Combate? I pray ye (faire Ladyes) if you know, let mee vnderſtand it. Sir, quoth one of them, this <hi>Dardan</hi> loueth a Knights daughter of the Country, who at his ſecond nuptials maried her I am to ſpeake of: now hath this Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell the beloued of <hi>Dardan,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſuch hatred againſt her faire mother, that ſhe hath ſaid to her friend, how ſhe will neuer loue him, except he bring her to King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, and there openly maintaine, that all the poore La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes goods appertaineth to her, and if any gain-ſay it, he to iuſtifie the ſame in Combate. Theſe news were highly pleaſing to <hi>Amadis,</hi> for by theſe meanes he intended to compaſſe occaſion, to be reuenged of the wrong he did him: and that in the preſence of <hi>Oriana,</hi> who ſhould there perceiue what her
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7181:45"/>
Knight was, which made him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ſuch thoughts, as the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels well noting it, one of them thus ſpake. I pray ye Sir, for cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, acquaint vs with the reaſon of your ſudden muſing, if it may without offence be knowne. Faire Ladies, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if you will promiſe me as loyall Gentle-women, to keepe it ſecret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it to no one, willingly ſhall I tell ye: all which they ſolemnely ſware to performe. I intend (quoth he) to combate for the Dame you ſpake of, and minde not to faile: but I would haue it concealed from any but your ſelues. When they heard what he ſayd, they were much abaſhed, notwithſtanding they made great eſteeme of him: ſeeing what they had vttered in praiſe of <hi>Dardan,</hi> could not affray him, but hee would hazard the Combate, and therefore ſhee that alreadie had broken the matter, thus replyed. Gentle Sir, your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a high reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued minde, and wee will pray for your proſperons ſucceſſe. So gaue they ech to other the good night, and went to reſt till the morning, when they diſlodged together. Then entreated the Damoſels, that ſeeing hee went to the ſame place they did, and in the Forreſt kept men of euill behauiour: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee would not forſake their company, whereof he made them promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Along they ride with ſundrie diſcourſings, where among other talke, they deſired, in reſpect they met ſo happily together; that he would bee content to let them know his name. My name, quoth he is <hi>Amadis,</hi> but I pray you keepe it onely to your ſelues. Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on by vaſte and vnfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places, one day, when furtheſt they were from doubt, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held before them vnder a tree, two Armed Knights prepared for the Iouſt: who ſeeing them comming, ſtepped into the midſt of the way, the one ſaying to his companion. Which of theſe two Damoſels wouldeſt thou haue, and the other I meane to take my ſelfe? I will ſaid (the other) haue the firſt. And I her companion, anſwered the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo without more words they came to lay hands on them. <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> who miſliked ſuch dealing, without the Damoſels conſent, addreſſed himſelfe to the Knights: demaunding what manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour this was, to Ladyes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from honeſt place? Such, quoth they, as beſeemeth women of their age. What anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> would you then force them? Who ſhall let vs (quoth they) if wee pleaſe? Marie, that will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Amadis:</hi> then lacing his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, he tooke his ſhield &amp; Lance, ſaying. Let the Damoſels alone you ſhameleſſe men, and defend your ſelues. Without any more talke they gaue their ſpurres to their Horſes, meeting together with ſuch puiſſance, as the Knight brake his Launce, and <hi>Amadis</hi> gaue him ſuch an attaint, that hee carryed him from his horſe to the ground, with his head vnder, and his heeles vpward: breaking the laces of his Helmet in the fall, ſo that his head remained without ſhelter.</p>
                  <p>When the other ſaw his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion downe, he would reuenge him, and couching his Launce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> met him ſo full, as piercing his Armour, wounded him a little, and his ſtaffe was ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered all in pieces: but the Prince falling with his Launce, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred him ſo fiercely with his body
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7181:45"/>
and Horſe, as he lay tumbling hard by his fellow, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comming to the Damoſels, he ſaid. I pray ye heere-after come no more behinde, but for your better ſurety keepe ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. A while he taried to ſee if they would riſe againe, but perceiuing they made no ſhew thereof, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to charge them any further, &amp; ſo rode on with his company. Soone after they came to a faire plaine, whereby a pleaſant Riuer had his courſe, and there they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Tents to be erected: as well to regard the hurt of <hi>Amadis,</hi> as alſo to refreſh themſelues. But as they ſate at meat, the two diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Knights came riding thither, ſaying to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Sir Knight, you haue won the Ladies at the Lance, now muſt ye defend them by the ſword, otherwiſe we will cary them hence in deſpite of you. But you ſhall not, quoth he, if I can let it: ſo drawing his ſword againſt him that firſt made offer, in ſhort time he brought him into ſuch diſtreſſe, as without the ſnccour of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, he was vnable to hold out any longer: which <hi>Amadis</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, ſaid. Ah Knight, the Ladyes make ſlender account of you, that you muſt come both vpon one man. Yet notwithſtanding he wold not forbare, but as the patterne of vnconquerable valour, gaue him likewiſe worke enough to doe, ſo that all their wrong turned to his honor: for he gaue the laſt ſuch ſtrokes on the helmet, as the ſword glaunſing on his ſhoulders, cut in twaine the cuyrates of his armour, &amp; ſliced his fleſh to the very bone, which made him let fall his ſword, and run away halfe dead. Then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the other, he cut off his hand vnder his Shield, the paine whereof was ſo yrkeſome to him, as he cryed. Ah I am ſlaine. Thus ſpeaking, he threw his ſword to the ground, and the Shield from about his neck. All this auaileth not, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> for I wil not leaue thee, except firſt thou ſware, neuer to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Lady againſt her will. Alas, quoth he, I promiſe faithfully, and will performe it. Here-with <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> came, who gaue him his ſword and Shield againe, permitting him to go for helpe whether he would: and <hi>Amadis</hi> returned to the Tent, where the Damoſels reioyſing for his ſafe returne, ſaid. In ſooth Sir, we had beene diſhonored without your aide, which is much better then we expected, and ſuch, as not onely aſſureth your reuenge for <hi>Dardans</hi> iniurie, but the Ladyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if fortune permit, you doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake her quarrell. Then was hee vnarmed, and after his wound was dreſt, he ſate downe to meat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p>At their departure thence, they lodgded at a good Ladies Caſtle, where they were moſt courteouſly entertained, and on the morrow trauailed all day, without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture worthy rehearſal, arriuing neere <hi>Windſore</hi> where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> lay, when <hi>Amadis</hi> thus ſpake to the Damoſels. Faire Friends, I would not be known to any one, therefore til ſuch time as the knight come to the combate, I intend to with-hold my ſelfe from the place: and when the houre is, let your Squire bring me tydings thereof hither. Sir, quoth the Damoſels, as yet there wants two daies of the aſſignation, therefore if you pleaſe we wil tarry with you: and our Squire ſhall goe into the Towne, and bring vs word when the Knight is arriued. I am well content, ſaid he: whereupon they pitched their Tent betweene a little wood and a Riuer, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> preently put off his armour.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7181:46"/>
Now did the Damoſels change their opinion, and thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to go into the Towne, to ſee how things were in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying, they might returne when they pleaſed. <hi>Amadis</hi> not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking thereof, willed them to do ſo, in meane while (being vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) he mounted on horſe-backe, inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to ſtray abroad a little for his pleaſure &amp; <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalin</hi> guided him through the wood. Riding along, as they were on the ſide of a little mountaine, he might eaſily behold the Towne, and when they were at the higheſt, they alighted from their horſes: when <hi>Amadis</hi> ſitting downe vnder a tree, caſt his eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that part where he iudged the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhould be, then regarding the walles, the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and the whole Caſtle, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forth a vehement ſigh, hee ſayd. Ah happy Towers, within you is the onely flower of the world: and thou faire Towne, how fortunate art thou in containing that, which all the harts and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of men cannot comprehend? High in diuine grace were he, who for maintenance of this quarrell ſhould ſpend his life: but much happy he, that without other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate then his ſmall deſert, ſhould reach a bliſſe ſo incomparable. Then reſting his head on his arme, he entred into a deepe conceit, which prouoked him to ſudden ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and in this melancholly the teares trilled downe his cheekes: in mean while <hi>Gandalin</hi> who knew his complexion, ſtanding where he was vnſeene of any, eſpied a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troupe of Lords and Ladyes comming toward them, whereof he made haſt to aduertiſe the Prince, but he was ſo perplexed, as he could not anſwere, wherefore <hi>Gandalin</hi> tooke him by the arme, ſaying. My Lord, ſee you not what a great traine maketh toward vs? At theſe words he came to himſelfe, beginning to ſigh, and lifting his eyes to heauen, ſaid. <hi>Gandalin,</hi> if in this loue I were maiſter of my ſtrength, as I am in diuers other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neither ſhouldeſt thou haue neede to aduertiſe me, nor my ſelfe be without councell ſo much as I am. But I feele my ſelfe ſo oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as all the enemies in the world cannot bring me to ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as this ouer ruling paſſion doth: therefore I pray thee talke to me, of the felicity a man ſhall enioy in death, for other may I not taſte, and practiſe no meanes of my life, ſeeing the contrary doth ſurmount it. What my Lord? anſwered <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> eſteeme you the victory ouer your ſelfe ſo difficult, after ſo many conqueſts of ſtout and bold ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? Why do you not think, that peraduenture ſhe loueth you well, for whom you endure ſuch aſſaults, and happily by as great reaſon as you loue her? your perſoage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe, beauty, and nobility of lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, can they deſerue leſſe, then the good grace of the moſt rare &amp; and exellent Lady in the world? let theſe humours (my Lord) repell your deſperations. Further hee would haue proceeded, but <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> brake him off in anget, ſaying. Wretch dareſt thou blaſpheme ſo much, as to ſay, that he who hath merited no conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world, may be equalled with ſo perfect a thing as is my Lady? enter no more into ſuch tearmes, if thou wilt not haue me thine enemy, and ſo looſe my conuerſation. Well, well, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> I pray ye wipe your eyes, leaſt thoſe that come hitherward perceiue you haue wept. What? anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> comes their any body? Yea mary, quoth <hi>Gandalin,</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:7181:46"/>
and now they be at hand: here-with he ſhewed him the Knights &amp; the Ladyes, who were hard by them, by time <hi>Amadis</hi> was mounted. Then (as though hee had ſtayed for their companie) hee ſaluted them, and riding among the traine hee beheld a Ladie (very comely and beautifull) who wept very grieuouſly, where-upon hee left the reſt, and rode with her, ſaying. Madame, God comfort yee, and giue you ioy. In ſooth, anſwered the Lady, and thereof haue I need, in that (as now) it is very farre from mee, which except Heauen fauour me with better grace, I am vtterly out of hope euer to ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And ſo high a Maieſtie, ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi> can prouide therefore when he pleaſeth: Not-withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if you were ſo contented, I gladly would know the cauſe of your ſadneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue mee my friend, quoth ſhe, all that euer I enioy in this world, conſiſteth in the tryall of a Combate. By theſe wordes hee knew this to be the Lady of whom the Damoſels had tolde him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherefore hee enquired fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if as yet ſhee had found a knight on her behalfe? No true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſayd the Lady, and (which grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth mee moſt of all) to morrow muſt my delay bee exterminate. What will ye then doe? anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> What would you that I ſhould doe? quoth ſhee but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and looſe all vnleſſe (by hap) I finde one in the Kings Court, who mooued thereto by charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compaſſion, will courteouſly defend the right of a deſolate wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Such fortune ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhall I pray may befall yee, for I ſhould not be a little glad thereof, as well for your owne ſake, as alſo becauſe I neuer thought well of your aduerſarie. I thanke ye gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sir, quoth ſhe, to God, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the reuenge of my wrong. So paſſed on the Ladie, and <hi>Amadis</hi> turning bridle, rode backe to the Pauillion, where he found the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels, who were already retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the towne: and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they told him, how <hi>Dardan</hi> was come into the field, with full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to doe his deuoire. And truſt me, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> it was my happe to meet the diſtreſſed Lady, euen the ſame whom the caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth: heere-with hee declared all the talke they had together.</p>
                  <p>But now is the houre of quiet come, and each one went to reſt till the point of day, when the Damoſels being riſen, came to tell <hi>Amadis,</hi> how they would goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Towne, and ſend him worde when <hi>Dardan</hi> was readie. Not ſo, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> I will not bee farre behinde yee, but let one ride before, to aduertiſe me when <hi>Dardan</hi> ſhews himſelfe in the field. After he was armed, they went all to horſe-backe, and being come to the iſſue of the Forreſt, he ſayd to the Damoſels. Now may you goe (if you pleaſe) for I will not depart this place till I heare ſome newes from you. Away they went, when <hi>Amedis</hi> alighting, tooke off his Helmet to refreſh himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner did the Sunne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the Eaſt, but the King came to the place appointed for the Combate (which was without the Towne, hard by the Walles) where <hi>Dardan</hi> not long after ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe, in ſuch manner and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage, as an ambitious man v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to gaine goods &amp; honour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo like an amourous Champion to maintaine the quarrell of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: who to countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him with the greater fauor, was queintly led
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7181:47"/>
by the reines of his Palfray, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting himſelfe before the king on his knees, he ſayd. My Lord, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinance by you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, this Ladie and I humbly beſeech ye, that the goods may be deliuered her, as is no more then reaſon: for if any Knight oppoſe him ſelfe againſt her, heere am I readie for the Combate. The king then called for the Ladyes defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, but ſhe (poore ſoule) appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alone. Why Lady, quoth the King, are you vnprouided of a Champion, that you come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any to defend your right? So helpe me God (anſwered ſhe wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping) I am (my Lord) forſake of all, except you grant me mercie. Great compaſſion had the King on her, for he knew her to be very vertuous: but he could not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order reaſon and the Law. In the meane while, <hi>Dardan</hi> who thought no reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce would come, ſate downe in the middeſt of the field, attending the third houre, which was the time according to the cuſtome, when the King would pronounce ſentence to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour: but one of the Damoſels ſeeing nowe the needefull time, made haſte to let <hi>Amadis</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what want of his preſence was in the field. For this cauſe he immediately mounted on horſe-backe, and being armed as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, commanded the Damoſell and his Squire to goe ſome other way, for he would not be ſeene by any from whence he came: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, that if he were Victor, hee would returne againe to the Tent. So departed <hi>Amadis</hi> alone, riding on a braue white Courſer, (as he promiſed the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> in <hi>Gaule)</hi> and arriued at the place where <hi>Dardan</hi> held the world in wonder of him. The king and his Nobles ſeeing him come from the Forreſt, ſtood ſomewhat in doubt of him, for hee carryed ſuch a gallant and Knightly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuance, as promiſed a-farre off that his enemie ſhould finde him of hautie diſpoſition: which made the King (aboue all other) deſirous to know him, and thinking ſhe for whoſe cauſe hee came knew his name, he called and demanded of her the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Dread Lord (anſwered the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) I neuer ſaw the man before, nor doe I know what he is. By this time was <hi>Amadis</hi> entred the field, when doing reuerence to the king and the Ladyes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out longer ſtay he came to <hi>Dardan:</hi> demauu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if hee were the man, that would maintaine the quarrell of her, for whom the poore Ladie was put to ſuch trouble; becauſe, quoth hee) I am come in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and alſo to keepe promiſe with thee. What didſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me? replyed <hi>Dardan.</hi> That I would ſee thee in the day-time, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> &amp; wetteſt thou when? It was at ſuch a time, as thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whitled with wine, or glorie, or elſe the truſt thou hadſt in thy ſtrong Caſtle, ſpeakeſt ſo out-ragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to me ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding without, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried both with trauaile &amp; hunger. And therefore doe I make the leſſe account of thee, anſwered <hi>Dardan:</hi> but cauſe her to come hither, for whom thou wilt doe ſuch a doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deed, to know if ſhe will accept thee as her Champion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward doe the vtter-moſt thou canſt. When the King ſaw they talked ſo long together, he would haue heard what they ſaid: but the good Widdow came, and to her, <hi>Dardan</hi> thus ſpake. Dame, this Knight would maintaine thy right, wilt thou ſubmit all to what he can

doe? With all my heart (quoth ſhe) ſeeing it pleaſeth him to ſtand ſo much my Friend, and God ſpeed him no otherwiſe then my cauſe is iuſt. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the two knights were at the very point to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, the King perceiued that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> Shield was bruiſed in two places, both with ſtrokes of the Sword, and point of the Launce, wherefore he ſayd to ſuch as ſtood neere him, that if the Knight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded another ſhield, he would gladly giue him one: but <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo hot in deſire to reuenge himſelfe and the Ladie, that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to nothing but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Thus the Ladyes accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiued, the two Champions tooke their carrire againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo roughly, as their Launces pierced their Armour and flew in pieces, without any other harme as yet: but when their bodies met, <hi>Dardan</hi> was ſent to the ground, yet it happened ſo wel for him, as hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faſt the reines of his horſe, he recouered himſelfe more nimbly, and mounted againe, as one both valiant and branely diſpoſed, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetting hand to his Sword. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaw him ſo quickly vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, &amp; in ſuch readineſſe for his owne defence: hee approached to him, when began ſuch a battaile betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as euery one preſent maruailed thereat. On all ſides were placed the inhabitants of the Towne, and many other that came farre off, as well on mightie Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds in the fielde, as alſo on the towers and walles of the Caſtle: but aboue the reſt, the Queene was there preſent with her Ladies, moſt deſirous to behold who ſhould beare away the honour of this cruell Combate; for they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med two ſo gallant companions, as it was hard at firſt ſight to iudge the better. Such were the rigorous ſtrokes deliuered on either ſide, that ſparkes of fire flew foorth of their Helmets and Armonr, their Shields cut in pieces, and their blood colouring the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which mooued exceeding compaſſion in the Regardants, who ſeemed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners in their danger, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as ech one fauoured the wel-fare of his Friend: but the two Champions gaue no reſpect there to, becauſe their deſire was to make knowne both to the Ladyes and themſelues, the man deſeruing higheſt account.</p>
                  <p>When King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſaw them endure ſo long, he ſayd aloud, that hee neuer beheld a more ſingular Combate, purſured with greater courage and man-hood: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he determined not to depart, vntill he had ſeene the finall iſſue thereof, permitting them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as themſelues pleaſed. And to the ende (quoth hee) that the Conquerour may bee dignified with more then accuſtomed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I will cauſe his deſerts to be liuely carued in Marble, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of my Pallace, to prouoke the like perfection in all other, that are deſirous to follow Armes. In ſuch manner as you haue heard continued the two Knights a lone time, the ſtanders by being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcerne who had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for without taking breath or reſt their fury continued, as thogh their ſtrength had more and more encreaſed. But <hi>Amadis</hi> who by chance turning his head to the place where the Ladyes ſtood, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed his faire Miſtreſſe, louely <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> whereby hee felt his vertue augmented in ſuch ſort, that hee was as freſh and luſtie, as if but then he entred the field, imagining he was become more then a man.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7181:48"/>
Now followed hee the fight with ſuch cruell extreames, as in ſhort time he diſſolued the doubt who ſhould be ſuperiour: for <hi>Dardan</hi> (not-withſtanding all his defence) was conſtrained to draw backe, ſeeking how to eſcape the wreake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtrokes of his enemie, which without ceaſing wounded his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in many places: his horſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no longer able to endure, ſtumbled ſo often, till at length he ſet both his knees to the ground, which made <hi>Dardan</hi> thinke it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fight on foot, wherefore he ſayd to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Knight, our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are wearie, and faile vs, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we cannot doe as we would: and if we were on foot (me thinks) in ſhort time the doubt would be deſcided. Theſe wordes did <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> ſpeake ſo loud, as the King and his Lords eaſily heard them: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeemed aſhamed, thus anſwering. Althought it be vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in a Knight, to forſake his horſe ſo long as he can keepe him: yet ſince thou thinkeſt to combate better on foot then on horſe-back, we will a light, and defend thy ſelfe well, for thou ſhalt haue need.</p>
                  <p>Here with they diſmounted, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailing ech other ſo furiouſly, as if but now they begun the Combat, ſhewing more ſharpe cruelty then before they had done: yet <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> euer-more kept the aduantage, commonly deliuering two ſtrokes for one, which made <hi>Dardan</hi> doe nothing, but defend his enemies blowes, who compelled him to turne &amp; reqoile, as himſelfe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo that ech one accounted him very neere vanquiſhed, blaming him becauſe hee kept not ſtill on horſe-back. But as he turned here and there, flying the ſlicing Sword of <hi>Amadis,</hi> he was driuen vnder the Ladies Scaffold, which made them cry: <hi>Dardan</hi> can hold out no longer, he is ouer-come if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Combate againe. Yet for all this <hi>Amadis</hi> would not leaue him, but preſſed him ſtill with ſuch purſuite, as hee brought him hard by the Queens Scaffold, when ſhe and all the Ladies ſayd. Without queſtion, <hi>Dardan</hi> is dead.</p>
                  <p>At this clamour, <hi>Amadis</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the voyce of the Damoſel of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and lifting vp his head, eſpyed her ſtanding by the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana:</hi> by means wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he became ſo farre beſide him-ſelfe, as hee ſet the point of his Sword to the ground, forgetting not onely the daunger wherein he was, but alſo ſtood amazed at the ſight of his Miſtres. Which when <hi>Dardan</hi> beheld, he tooke heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and charged his enemie ſo brauely, that if he had longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, he would haue gone away Conquerour: but the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> noting this change, ſpake out aloud. In an vnhappy houre did the Knight behold any Lady in this company, whereby he hath loſt what he wun of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> it is no time now for his heart to faint. Theſe words confounded <hi>Amadis</hi> with ſhame, that gladly could he haue giuen entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to death, fearing leaſt his Lady would ſuſpect cowardize in him. For this cauſe lifting vp his Sword, he gaue <hi>Dardan</hi> ſuch a ſtroke on the Helmet, as made him ſet both his hands to the ground: then falling vpon him, he rent the Helmet from off his head, &amp; tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in ſuch ſort on him with his feet, as he fell downe like one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of his ſences. Afterward, taking him by the locks of his haire he beate him on the face with the pummell of his Sword, ſaying. Thou dyeſt <hi>Dardan,</hi> if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7181:48"/>
not the Lady free. When <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> ſaw himſelfe in ſuch eſtate: he replied: Ah gentle Knight, for Gods ſake mercy, kill me not, I will acquit her.</p>
                  <p>Now approached the King and the other Lords to heare what hee ſaid, and while they ſtood confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with him, <hi>Amadis</hi> as yet aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his fault committed, drew backe through the throng: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee had gotten behinde them all, ſo couertly as he could he ran toward the Forreſt, leaning them al muſing at <hi>Dardan,</hi> who filled the empty arie with his complaints. In meane while his beautifull friend came to him, who inſted of giuing comfort for the foile he ſuſtained through her, began to deteſt and deſpiſe him, ſaying. <hi>Dardan,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſeeke thee ſome other friend then me, for while I liue, will I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue thee, or any other, then the good Knight who valiantly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame thee. How now Lady? quoth he, is this the reward of my honor &amp; life aduentured for you? you then are not the friend to <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> but to fortune, who is no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner contrary to me, but preſently you are mine enemy. Haue I then eſcaped death by the mercy of my foe, to endure worſſe then death by the cruelty of my friend? Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſuffereth me to liue, and yet you repine at my infortunate life: now ſhal I make knowne to all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by your example, that ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is no leſſe hurtfull to ſuch as exerciſe it, then to any one offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there with. Hereupon he tooke his ſword, and before it could bee imagined what he meant to do, he ſmote her head quite from her ſhoulders: then as a man tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with madnes, ſtaring euery where round about him, declared by his angry, countenance, that high and not vulgare, was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe he imbraced in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity.</p>
                  <p>The King ſent his archers to conuay him thence, but ere they came to him, he ſtroke himſelfe ſo violently to the heart, as the bloud ſpouted in the archeis faces, and then he cryed out, ſaying. Now friend art thou reuenged by my vengeance, and thine enemy ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the deſpiſed life thou leſtſt me. So falling downe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the laſt figne of his death, where at each one was confounded with maruaile, as well for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty of the caſe, as pitting the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laſt words he breathed: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they remembred his paſſed life, wholly addicted to ouer-weening folly, they reputed this vnfortunate end happened to him, not ſo much by accident, as the deuine orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which made them ſorrow no more, but couerted their thoughts to commend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</p>

                  <p>But now the rumour being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and they teturned to the Pallace, he called for the ſtranger that won the honor of the day: but after long enquiry, no one could certainly tell what was become of him, albeit certaine comming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wood, reported how they ſaw a Knight returne from the field thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-ward, being alone and making great haſt.

But did you, (quoth <hi>Oriana)</hi> take no regard of his Armes? Yea mary did I, replied the Damoſell, albeit the cruell ſtrokes receiued thereon, made me hardly perceiue what deuiſe was there figured: yet me thought the ground was a golden field, and the like I told ye he bare in <hi>Gaule,</hi> with two azured Lions rampant por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed therein, which being bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered all in pieces, he preſently made him ſuch another, aſſuring me to weare no other when hee came into this country, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will doubt no further but it is he.

                  <p>Thus was <hi>Gandalin</hi> conducted into the Queenes chamber, where the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> was, to whom the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> came, and ſpeaking ſome-what loude, ſayd.

                     <hi>Gandalin</hi> all this while accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pained his words with ſuch teares, and often among breathed foorth ſo many mournefull ſighes, as would haue enforced the very Rocks to rueth: but perceiuing <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> was touched to the quicke, he began againe in this manner. Ah, gentle Madame, conſent not to the death of ſuch a Seruant of yours, and ſo good a Maiſter of mine: for beſide the common loſſe which will be great, in you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhall conſiſt the fault, more-ouer you ſhall maculate that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beautie, with the high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſtaine of crueltie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. Here did he knit vp his perſwaſion, attending an anſwere from the Princeſſe, but ſhee was not able to deliuer one word, ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently was her heart ſurprized and ouer-come: and holding downe her head, let fall wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtreames of teares downe her daintie checkes, which enforced her to turne on the other ſide, leaſt ſhe ſhould be diſcried: then when as <hi>Gandalin</hi> would haue begun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſhe ſtayed him with a pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſigh, ſaying. Ah, my friend, I pray thee ſay no more, vnleſſe thou be willing to ſee me die here preſently. Now ſtood ſhee ſilent a prettie while, often wringing and ſtraining her fingers with griefe, then ſetting apart all diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe ſoftly thus ſpake. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance thou giueſt me of thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters loue, is highly pleaſing and agreeable to me: but the paſſion thou ſayeſt he endureth, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me to the very death, ſo that I feele both his paine &amp; mine owne. Ah God, let me not be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of death, to a man ſo high and precious of deſert as hee is, rather let me worke mine owne death, for if he die, I may not liue one houre. Thou art come to tell me his painefull trauaile, &amp; now thou mayeſt goe to let him vnderſtand mine, which if thou kneweſt ſo wel as thou doeſt thy maiſters, inſtead of blaming me with crueltie, thou wouldſt rather iudge me vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and if I vſe any crueltie, it is againſt my ſelfe, whom I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of reſt, pleaſure, and well-neere life it ſelfe.

Then taking a coſtly Ring off her finger, ſhee thus proceeded. Deliuer him this token from mee, as the onely Iewell I moſt eſteem, and ere thou goeſt thou ſhalt ſee the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila,</hi> who is ſo wiſe and diſcreet, as ſhe will eaſily vnderſtand thee: yet thou muſt ſay ſome-what loud to her, that thou haſt brought her tydings from her mother. Here-upon <hi>Oriana</hi> called her to talke with the Squire, whom the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> (her mother) had ſent to her: but when ſhe ſaw it was <hi>Gandalin,</hi> ſhe then ſuſpected how matters went: wherefore <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> went to the Queene, leauing them in deepe talke together.

Madame, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> the chiefe cauſe of his comming into this Countrey, was to ſeeke for the good Knight <hi>Amadis,</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Gaule,</hi> of whom you haue heard ſuch famous report.

Now truſt me, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Queene, right glad would I be, to ſee ſo good a Knight in the Kings company, for it would be a great comfort to him many wayes hauing to deale with ſo many Countres: wherefore I aſſure ye, if he doe come hither, hee ſhall finde here ſuch honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, as he ſhal haue no cauſe to depart in haſte. Of his Proweſſe Madame, replyed <hi>Oriana,</hi> I know little, but what common bruite hath blazed abroad: but heereof I am certaine, how hee was one of the moſt braue yong Gentle-men that euer I ſaw, when in the King of <hi>Scots</hi> Court he ſerued <hi>Mabila</hi> and me. All this while <hi>Mabila</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with <hi>Gandalin,</hi> enquiring if his maſter were as yet arriued. Yea Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> the ſame was he that vanquiſhed <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and expreſſe charge hee gaue me to ſalue you on his behalfe.

ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> hee were happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if the force of loue made him not in worſe caſe then dead: for Gods ſake therefore doe you aſſiſt him, being thus fully perſwaded, that if he finde no eaſe to cure his afflictions, you ſhall looſe the beſt Knight in the world, and the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of your fathers fame. He may be well aſſured, anſwered <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila,</hi> how hee cannot with greater deſire employ mee, then I haue to doe him pleaſure: and will him not to faile in what the Princeſſe hath commanded him: as for thy ſelfe, being iudged to come from the Queene, my mother, thou mayeſt come and ſpeak with vs at al times as need ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gandalin</hi> tooke his leaue for that time, returning toward <hi>Amadis,</hi> who attended the anſwere of life or death, and into ſuch debilitie was he brought by theſe extreams as hee had ſcant force enough to ſupport himſelfe: for the ſhort ſight hee had of his Ladie at the Combate, encreaſed ſuch a deſire in him to ſee her at more libertie, as euery houre ſeemed to him longer then a yeare. When hee ſaw that <hi>Gandalin</hi> was returned, in hope of happy newes, hee came and embraced him, not daring to demaund any thing of him, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt matters ſhould not fall out to his contentation: but <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> with a cheerfull cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, told him that he brought no fadde tydings, and ruſhing into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at firſt, ſaid. My Lord, God make yee as conſtant, as you haue cauſe to be conteut, for if you haue that vertue, you are the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and accompliſhed Knight in the world. Ouer-whelmed with ioy, <hi>Amadis</hi> caught him in his armes, demaunding what he had done, ſeene, and heard? I haue ſeene and heard, anſwered <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> the felicities of Paradiſe, and know that they are prouided for you, if you hinder it not your ſelf. Ah <hi>Gandalin,</hi> quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> ieſt not with me, but tell me the very trueth. Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> declared word by word, how euery thing happened, firſt of the counterfeit Letter, and next the appointed meeting at the window: and (by the way) reported ſome part of his owne ſpeeches, moouing a change of conntenance in <hi>Oriana,</hi> then her anſwere, euen to the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before rehearſed: likewiſe how he talked with <hi>Mabila,</hi> and how willing ſhe was to aſſiſt him with her vttermoſt habilitie. <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo fed with content by theſe reports, that hee made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe one thing ten times, and I cannot tell which of them was moſt affectionate: either <hi>Gandalin</hi> in reporting, or <hi>Amadis</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, for both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed inſatiable, in the end <hi>Amadis</hi> thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>My faithfull Companion, I thought my ſelf altogether indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy Father, who ſaued me from the daunger of drowning in the Sea, but I confeſſe, that duty belongs more neceſſarily to thee: becauſe (by thy diligence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) thou haſt giuen me a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life then he preferued. But tell me now, didſt thou take good marke of the place to which ſhe commuanded me? Aſſure your ſelfe thereof, quoth <hi>Gandalin.</hi> for ſhe her ſelf ſhewed it me. Ah God, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> how ſhall I deſerue the great good ſhe doth for me? Away from me now all ſorrowe and complaining. Yet this is not all my Lord, quoth <hi>Gandalin,</hi> See here a token ſhe hath ſent ye, as a teſtimonie of her honourable loue
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7181:51"/>
to you: ſo he gaue him the Ring which came from <hi>Oriana,</hi> and after he had long beheld it, kiſſing it a thouſand times, put it on his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſaying. Faire Ring, that haſt beene ſo happy, as to be caried and accounted deere by the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed creature in the world, albeit thou be now in a place of much inferiour honor yet haſt thou not changed thy miſtreſſe, for both thou and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>So they brake off co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, and went into the Pauillion, where <hi>Amadis,</hi> (notwithſtanding) <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> councell) could not but ſhew himſelfe pleaſantly diſpoſed, whereat the Damoſels were verie glad, becauſe ſuch behauiour, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſeemed him then his former penſiuenes.</p>
                  <p>When the houre of reſt was come, each one went to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſttomed lodging, and ſoone after <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing the time commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his enterpriſe, aroſe and found <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who had already prepared for their iourney: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being armed, they mounted on horſe-backe, taking the moſt conuenient way for their purpoſe to the Towne. When they came to the Garden, which <hi>Oriana</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed <hi>Gandalin,</hi> they aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and tied their horſſes at a tuft of trees nere adioyning, afterward they went through a hole which a water-courſe had made in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wall, and approched the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow where <hi>Oriana</hi> lay: faire and ſoftly did <hi>Amadis</hi> knock thereon with his finger, ſhe not yet ſleeping who expected his comming, and when ſhe heard the louing ſignall of her friend, ſhe awaked <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſaying Sweete ſiſter, I thinke your coſin knocketh at the window. My coſin? anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> it may be ſo, but you haue greater intreſt in him then I, or all other of his linage together. <hi>Mabila</hi> preſently aroſe, and lighted a waxe taper which ſhe had hid for the nonce, when <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> likewiſe was got out of bed, they came together and opened the caſement, where they found <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> no more attending then hec was attended. If they were then well pleaſed, it were folly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, for all the contentments in the world, might not be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ioy of ſeeing each other. And without queſtion, they had two inducing reaſons thereto, for beſide the nouriſhment they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued together in their yonger yeeres, and their firſt amity, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by the rememberance and good opinion they had of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: their beauty and perfections were ſo correſpondent, as if they had neuer ſeene one another till that very inſtant, yet had they cauſe enough to loue together. <hi>Oriana</hi> had on ſuch braue attire beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the night, as ſet the heart of her loue on fire, for vnder a fine &amp; dainty white frontlet, appeared the rareſt golden treſſes of haire that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nature made, and about her ſhoulders ſhe had a mantle of figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cloth of gold, imbroidered all ouer with rich and coſtly flowerts, as it might beſeeme the greateſt Maieſtie in the world. And for her ſelfe, a thing more faire was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be found, the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of her preſent comfort, dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

her face with ſuch a heauenly beauty, as it ſeemed that nature in pride of her art, made this piece to excell all other in perfection. I will leaue you then to conſider on the iudgement of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who (when ſhe was nothing ſo glorious in fairenes) thought her worthy the loue of the beſt Knight in the world: now if he ſtood mute, blame him not, hauing the only iewell of his heart before him, and therefore ſhe to breake off this ſilence, firſt ſpake in this manner. My Lord, if I haue giuen you the liberty (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my duty and cuſtome) to ſee me in this place at an houre ſo vnfitting you muſt commit the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the ſecurity, which our former nurturing together loyally promiſed, and likewiſe to the good opinion of your great vertues ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Madame, I account my ſelfe not ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by fortune in any thing elſe, as honored at my firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into your ſeruice, euen the very higheſt tipe of grace ſhe could affoord me: nor do I feele my ſelfe ſo beholding to my vertues, as I reſt double bound to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that report ſo wel of me.

Good Friend, quoth the King, your departure muſt not be ſo ſoone, except you delight to diſpleaſe me. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> in reſpect my endeauour is altogether to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey you. Doe you thinke, ſayd the King, it is any obedience, if I may not entreat a longer ſtay? In ſooth, my Lord, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> you may and ſhall command, for in greater matters then this I will not offend ye. Goe then and vn-arme you, replyed the King; and ſpeaking theſe wordes, him-ſelfe tooke him by the hand conducting him to a ſumptuous chamber, where he left him to take ſome refection, with <hi>Arban</hi> King of <hi>Norgalles,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keepe him companie: for King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was a Prince, that eſpecially fauoured and honoured ſtrange Knights.

No verily, anſwered the King, for in reſpect of the promiſe I made him I durſt not demaund that queſtion of him. It may be, ſayd the Queen, he is the Sonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule.</hi> I would it might fall out ſo well, anſwered the King. Doe you know, quoth the Queene, who may put vs out of this doubt? euen the Squire that talked with <hi>Mabila,</hi> who came to ſearch him in your Court, and ſaid, how hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of his arriuall in this Countrey long before.

None but good, my Lord, anſwered <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> all your noble Friendes are in perfect health, commending them-ſelues to your Excellencie, but hence-forth Sir, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale your ſelfe no longer: then turning to the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Mightie King, hee that hath beene ſo long time vnknown, is this braue Prince, the famous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> Sonne to the inuincible king <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule:</hi> and then came his Fathet to vnderſtand ſo much, when he ſlewe in combate the puiſſant King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by meanes whereof he recouered his Realme which was well-neere loſt. By theſe deuiſes was <hi>Amadis</hi> diſcoured, and better wel-commed then before: for till the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was not knowne, but through his famous deedes, the renowne whereof was euery-where blazed abroad, and now was hee ſo well honoured for his vertue as his Nobleneſſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So ſpent they the whole day in honourable Feaſting, vntill ſuch time as each one with-drew him-ſelfe; when king <hi>Liſuart</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the King of <hi>Norgalles,</hi> that he ſhould lodge in <hi>Amadis</hi> chamber: afterward when they were alone, to ſound his minde, &amp; vnderſtand by all meanes poſſible, if he would conſent to remaine in his ſeruice. Thus leauing them together, hee returned to the Queene, and to her thus ſpake. Madame, hardly ſhall I cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> to ſtay (as mine) nor can I tell which way to compaſſe it, albeit, I neuer had greater deſire to any Gentle-man of long time, for the high account is helde of him, would cauſe mee to bee much more feared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted. My Lord, quoth the Queene, graunt him any thing he ſhall demaund, and doe your ſelfe preſent him what you imagine will beſt pleaſe him. Hee reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth nothing of me, replyed the king, for if he did, I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto more willingly then he could deſire. Me thinkes it were good, ſayd the Queene, to entreat him firſt, by ſome other of our Court, &amp; if they cannot preuaile, will him to come ſee mee, your daughter, and our Cozin <hi>Mabila:</hi> they likewiſe ſhall ſolicite the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they knew him when hee ſerued them as a Squire. Then ſhall we let him vnderſtand, how all the Knights here are yours, and none but thinks him-ſelfe honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby: him will we deſire to be one of the Company, that you may enioy his ſeruice when need ſhall require. This will be a good meane, anſwered the king to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his ſtay, and if he will not be wonne by you, we may well iudge him of leſſe ciuility the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chiualry. Now becauſe it waxed ſome-what late, the King bade his Queene good-night, &amp; went to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. On the other ſide, the king of <hi>Norgalles</hi> perſwaded his new-come gueſt, that he would abide in the Court of king <hi>Liſuart:</hi> but <hi>Amadis</hi> could ſo cunningly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7181:54"/>
that he altogether diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the chiefe point of his deſire, and might not by all theſe entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be wonne. When he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he laboured in vaine, on the Morrow-morning hee brought him to the king, of whom <hi>Amadis</hi> made offer to take his leaue: But the king anſwered him in this manner. My good friend, you ſhould haue done me pleaſure not to depart ſo ſoone, yet can I not conſtraine ye to tarrie againſt your will, but my Queene would gladly ſee you before your departure. Nor will I goe my Lord, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> before I haue done my dutie to her: where-upon taking him by the hand, he brought him into her Chamber, and thus ſpake to her. See heere, Madam, king <hi>Perions</hi> Sonne of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who is come to ſalute you before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. In ſooth my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Queene, he doth mee great honour, and he is very hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wel-come hither.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtepping to her, fell on his knee to kiſſe her hand, but ſhe cauſed him to riſe and ſit downe by her: when the king per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing they would enter into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talke, with drew himſelfe to diſcourſe with his knights, while they conferred together. In mean while the Queene courteouſly entertained <hi>Amadis,</hi> but the other Ladies and Gentle-women, who had heard ſuch fame of his beautie and excellent perferfections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to eye him very diligently, maruailing that Nature had ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched him, with the onely thing they moſt deſired. Now knew <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> by their countenances what iudgement they held of him, yet durſt he not turne his head aſide, fearing leaſt ſeeing his <hi>Oriana,</hi> by ſome ſudden mutation, hee might reueale what carefully he couetted to hide. And as he continued in this perplexitie, the Princeſſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi> came and did him reuerence, where-upon the Queene (the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to compaſſe her intent) called her daughter, who diſſembled as if ſhe ſcant knew him, and thus ſhee ſpake to her. Faire daughter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you not the ſonne of king <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who ſerued you well while he was your Squire, and yet may doe (if it pleaſe him) now he is a Knight? in ſoothe, you muſt al aſſiſt me in deſiring him to grant mee one requeſt. And know ye what it is? quoth ſhe to <hi>Amadis,</hi> the king earneſtly entreateth you to remaine in his Court, and yet as I vnderſtand, you haue no wil to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him ſo ſmall a fauor. We ſhal ſee anon, if Ladies hold greater Priuiledge in knights, then men doe, therefore wee all ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one ſuite, that you would be knight to my daughter and my ſelf, &amp; likewiſe to them whom you ſee in this faire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie. And if you will doe ſo much for vs, you ſhall deliuer vs from ſeeking ſupport in any other, who happily cannot be ſo agreeable to vs: for wel we know if you be our knight, we ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe all them that attend on the king. The Ladyes were before ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, what they ſhould doe in this caſe, wherefore they flocked about him altogether, and with ſignes of earneſt Supplication, confirmed the Queenes requeſt: eſpecially <hi>Oriana,</hi> who gaue him a ſigne that he ſhould conſent, but very wiſely diſſembled it, although he had no other deſire in the world: wherefore the Queene ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo ſlow in anſwering, as if ſhe would haue preſſed him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſaid.

                     <hi>Amadis,</hi> what is he that dare do otherwiſe, then grant your will and theſe Ladyes preſent, ſeeing you are the moſt honorable Queen of the world, and they likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the higheſt point of ſeruice? therefore madame, by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and the Princeſſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> as alſo theſe other Ladyes who are loth to be denied, I am content to tarry with you: yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this condition, that I will doe nothing but for you onely, and if I acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh any ſeruice for the King, it ſhall be yours and none of his. Then as our Champion, anſwered the Queene, all we accept you: &amp; theſe glad tidings ſhe ſoone ſent to the King, who was ſo highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therewith, that he commanded the King of <hi>Norwales</hi> to goe and beare him company, and himſelfe for ioy went preſently to him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking him in his armes, he ſayd. Gentle Knight, right glad am I of your conſent to the Queene, and for my part be you well aſſured, that my deſire is to entreat you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your deſerts. <hi>Amadis</hi> on his knee humble thanked him, albeit he only ſtaied by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>Oriana,</hi> and no ſuch other matter as he feigned to the Queene.</p>
                  <p>For this time the author leaueth <hi>Amadis,</hi> returning where he left the Prince <hi>Galaor,</hi> who being departed from the Duke of <hi>Bryſtoyaes</hi> Caſtle, where the villainous Dwarffe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily diſcouered him: all that day he wandred in the Forreſt of <hi>Arinida,</hi> not meeting any one to direct him a more ready way, yet toward euening, he ſaw a Squire come toward him, mounted on a right good Courſer. Now had <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> receiued a certaine wound, by one of the three Knights that aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him as you haue heard, which by reaſon of dallying with his new friend the night paſt, began to feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ranckle very much, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe not halfe currant, he ſaid to the Squire. My friend, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt thou where I may finde cure for a ſmall wound I haue? What if I do? anſwered the Squire, yet will I not company any ſuch coward as thou art, becauſe it were to my ſhame and diſcredit if I ſhould. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of that, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> tell mee where I may finde helpe for my wound? Rather, quoth the Squire, would I ſeeke one to giue thee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Shew me the way, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galaor,</hi> and I will aduenture what thou feareſt me withall. I may chuſe, ſaid the Squire, except I liſt. Nay thou ſhalt do it, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> by friendſhip or force. By force, replied the Squire, thinkeſt thou I will do any thing for ſo bad and falſe a Knight as thou art? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Galaor</hi> heard him ſpeake ſo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, he drew his ſword, making ſhew as if he would ſmite off his head, ſaying. Villaine thou ſhalt conduct me, elſe will I ſend thy ſoule to all the Deuils. The Squire being affraid, thus anſwered. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou enforceſt me, I will bring thee to a place where thy folly ſhall be chaſtiſed, and my outrage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged. Heere-with he rode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leauing the right way, <hi>Galaor</hi> following ſome diſtance behinde him, and by time they had ridden the length of a mile, they came to a Fortreſſe ſeated in a pleaſant vally, brauely enuiro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed about with trees: the Squire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pointing him to the place, ſaid.

the bridle, giuing theſe ſpeeches to the Knight. Another time Sir, learne to mount your horſe ſooner, for I haue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vſe this horſe, &amp; mean to keep him til you can get him from me.

Ah Sir, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, anſwered the voice, for I am tied with a ſtrong chaine. By theſe words, <hi>Galaor</hi> knew well it was ſome priſoner, wherefore he ranne againſt the dore with his foote ſo ſtrongly, that he made it flye from off the hindges, &amp; entring, beheld a faire Damoſell tied by the neck with a great chaine, who thus ſpake to <hi>Galaor.</hi> Alas my Lord, what is become of the maiſter of this Caſtle and his company?

                  <p>This Damoſell was wiſe, well gouerned, &amp; of good grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe could ſo queintly anſwer &amp; intreate <hi>Galaor,</hi> that he became highly enamoured of her: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure no longer this kindled fire of affection, thought good to make ſome proofe if ſhee would loue him, whereupon hee thus began. You know (faire Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell and my friend) that I haue deliuered you from priſon, but in giuing you liberty, I am become my ſelfe captiue, and brought into great danger vnleſſe you helpe me.

Suddenly aroſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great tempeſt, which with mighty windes ſo troubled the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the thunder ratled with ſuch violence, as if heauen and the neather religion would haue met together.

                  <p>Meane while the ſea became na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigable, the weather faire, and the waters calm: which made the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe determine to goe aboord her ſhip, that ſhe might paſſe into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> whither the King her father had ſent her, to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the Queene <hi>Briſena.</hi> Which being vnderſtood by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> after he had acquainted her with the cauſe of his iourney, hee gaue her aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: that very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would come to her, as well to ſhew her his faithfull ſeruice, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſeeke his coſin <hi>Amadis</hi> in king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, according as hee made him promiſe; wherewith ſhe was not a little contented, deſiring him earneſtly not to tary long fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her. Thus courteouſly taking leaue of each other, the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi> departed vnder ſayle, and in fewe dayes after they landed in great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> when comming to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore,</hi> where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> kept his Court: both by him, the Queene, <hi>Oriana,</hi> and all the other Ladyes, was the Princeſſe and her trayne graciouſly welcommed, as well to honor the King her father, as alſo in reſpect of her excellent beauty.</p>
                  <p>Now remained <hi>Agraies</hi> on the ſea ſhore, giuing many a long look after the ſhip which caried away the iewell of his heart; and hauing loſt the ſight of it, he tooke his way to <hi>Briantes,</hi> a right good towne in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the King his father ſoiourned, and his Vncle <hi>Gaiuanes Without land,</hi> in whoſe company he intended ſhortly to viſit King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarts</hi> Court. For there, quoth hee to <hi>Galuanes,</hi> ſhall we finde more good Knights, then in any other Court of King Chriſtian, there likewiſe may we gaine honor and renowne better then in <hi>Scotland:</hi> where we haue none to trye our ſelues againſt, vnleſſe ſome fewe that ſlenderly follow Armes. This <hi>Galuanes</hi> was of gentle heart and a good Knight, deſirous among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reach the top of honor, yet of ſimple habilitie, as you haue heard before: now the enterpriſe of theſe twaine thus concluded, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had obtained licence of the King, they went on boord with their horſe &amp; armour, ech one like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Squire atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wind at wil, in ſhort time they landed at <hi>Briſtow,</hi> where they made no long aboad, but riding through a Forreſt, they met a Damoſell who dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of them, if that way would conduct her to the Rock of <hi>Galteres.</hi> No, quoth they, but tell vs Damoſell why you trauaile thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? To ſee if I can finde the good Knight, ſayd ſhee, who knoweth how to remedy a griefe I endure at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. You abuſe your ſelfe Damoſell, anſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> for at the Rock you demanded, you

ſhal finde no other Knight then the great Gyant <hi>Albadan,</hi> to whom if you bring any cauſe of ſorow, he wil quickly double it on your own head. If you knew ſo much as I doe, quoth the Damoſell, you would not imagine me to be abuſed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Knight I aske for, hath vanquiſhed the Gyant, and killed him in battaile hand to hand. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me virgin, replied <hi>Galuanes,</hi> you tell vs matter of great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, in reſpect neuer any Knight dealt alone with a Gyant, vnleſſe it was King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who combated with one, himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed, and the Giant naked, which was the cauſe of his death; and yet this attempt of the King, is thought the greateſt ſtratageme that euer was heard of: then ſound not your ſpeeches, to any likely-hood, for this Gyant ſurpaſſeth all other in ſtrength &amp; cruelty. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, anſwered the Damoſell, the Knight I ſpeake of hath done no leſſe then I told ye: wherewith ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

His name (quoth ſhe) is <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſon to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule.</hi> Ah Lady, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> you declare the only newes of the world to content me withal, naming my Coſin, who more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly was reputed dead then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Hereupon he reported to <hi>Galuanes,</hi> what he had heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Galaor,</hi> how he was taken away by the Gyant, and till this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he neuer heard of him. By my faith, anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> the life of him and his brother is miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and their beginning of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie ſo famous, as I thinke their like is not to be found through the world; but Damoſell, what would you haue with that Knight? My Lord, quoth ſhe, I ſeeke his ayde on the behalfe of a Damoſell, who is impriſoned by the accuſation of a Dwarffe, the moſt villainous creature that euer was born: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhe added the whole diſcourſe of <hi>Galaor</hi> and the Dwarffe, as hath beene already declared to you, yet ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed the louely pranck of <hi>Aldena.</hi> And becauſe Sir, ſayde ſhe, the Damoſell will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme what the Dwarffe hath auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the Duke of <hi>Briſtoya</hi> hath ſworne, that within ten dayes ſhe ſhall be burned aliue: which is an occaſion of great griefe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ladyes, doubting leaſt ſhee through feare of death will accuſe ſome of them, and tell withall to what end <hi>Galaor</hi> came into the Dukes Caſtle: more-ouer, of the ten dayes, foure are already expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Seeing it falleth out ſo, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> you neede tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile no further, for we will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what <hi>Galaor</hi> ſhould doe, if not in ſtrength, yet in good will, and therefore be you our guide to the place. The Damoſel turned her haqueney, and led them with ſuch ſpeede to the Dukes Caſtle, that they arriued there the day before the execution ſhould be. Now was the Duke ſet down to dinner, when the two Knights entring the great hall, humbly ſaluted him, &amp; when he ſaw them, he requeſted they would ſit downe to dinner with him: but they anſwered, that hee ſhould preſently know the cauſe of their comming, where-upon, <hi>Galuanes</hi> thus began. My Lord, you detaine a Damoſell priſoner, by the falſe and diſloyall accuſation of a traiterous Dwarffe; we deſire that ſhe may be deliuered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing ſhe hath no way miſ-done: and if it be needfull to proue her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7181:58"/>
by battaile, let come two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to maintaine the quarrell, for we are ready as her defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders. Wel haue you ſayd, replyed the Duke: and calling for the Dwarffe, thus ſpake to him. What anſwereſt thou to theſe Knights challenge, who ſay that falſely thou haſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to impriſon the Damoſell, and will proue it againſt thee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen battaile? it behoueth thee to find ſome defence for thy ſelfe. For that I am not to ſeek my Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, I haue ſuch on my behalfe, who ſhall make known the truth of what I haue ſaid. Here-with he called a frollick Knight his Nephew, ſo like him in pitch and proportion, as one would haue thought he had no other father, to him he ſayd. I pray ye Nephew maintain my quarrell againſt theſe two Knights. Scarſe had he thus ſpoken, but his Nephew returned this anſwer to <hi>Galuanes</hi> and his companion. Well Gentlemen, what will you ſay againſt this loyal Dwarffe, who was ſo iniured by the Knight the falſe Damoſell brought hither? It may be one of you is the man I ſpeake off: but whether it be or no, I will proue in Combate he dealt villainouſly, &amp; the Damoſell ought to dy, becauſe ſhe brought him into my Lord the Dukes Chamber. <hi>Agraies</hi> who found himſelfe moſt touched in his owne conceite, ſtepped forth with this anſwer. In ſooth, neither of vs is the man, albeit we deſire to imitate his vertues, but wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch he hath done no wrong, &amp; if the Duke pleaſe, this difference ſhall be ſoone decided: for on his behalfe will I maintaine, that the damoſel ought to be deliuered, &amp; the Dwarfe in her ſtead burned as a traiterous villaine. I iuſtifie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, replied the Dwarffes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion: then calling for his armour, full ſoone was he mounted on a gentle Courſer, and turning to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> who preſented him the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare, thus ſpake. Would God Knight thou wert the man by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this quarrell bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, too high a price ſhould I ſet on thy folly. We ſhall quickly ſee, quoth <hi>Agraies,</hi> what thou canſt doe, but I am aſſured if he were preſent, he would make no account of two ſuch braggers as thou art, how iuſt or vniuſt the cauſe were on his ſide, by greater reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then do I leaue thee to iudge, how notably he would handle thee in this, conſiſting on truth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. While theſe menaces thus paſſed on either ſide, the Duke ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not from the table till dinner was done, when ſeeing the Knights prepared to execute their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he conducted them with a braue company of Gentlemen, to the place apointed to end ſuch controuerſies, where all accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ceremonies being obſerued, the Duke thus ſpake to <hi>Agraies.</hi> Performe the vttermoſt of your habilitie, yet ſhall not the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel be deliuered: for to the Dwarffe hath not been offered iniury alone, but to ſuch beſide as are of higher reckoning then your ſelfe. My Lord, quoth <hi>Agraies,</hi> you cauſed her to be apprehended only by his falſe accuſation, and he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued your iudgement with a lye: wherefore if my fortune make mee Conquerour, you ought by good reaſon to deliuer her. I haue tolde you what I meane to doe, ſaid the Duke, and otherwiſe it ſhall not be. <hi>Agraies</hi> tarrying for no more wordes, turned his horſe, running a braue carrire againſt the Dwarfes Knight, and in the encounter brake their ſtaues gallantly, meeting like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo furiouſly with their bodies,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7181:59"/>
as they were both laide along on the ground: yet quickly they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered themſelues, and vnſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing their weapons, deliuered fierce and cruell ſtrokes to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; their Swordes being verie ſharpe, the Knights valiant and hautily diſpoſed, by means where-of, their Armour, Helmets and ſheeldes, were in ſhort time made of ſlender reſiſtance: yet <hi>Galuanes</hi> well ſaw, how his Nephew had ſtil the better of his enemy; if then he had before eſteemed him a good Knight, farre greater reaſon had he ſo to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding, hee was ſo hot and vigorous, as often-times he ſeemed out of breath, which made euery one imagine (regarding his violence) that hee could not long endure. But in him it proued farre otherwiſe, for the longer the Combate endured, his courage and ſtrength the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by reaſon whereof he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Conquerour, as ſhall hereafter be declared. The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to the Dwarffe found him-ſelfe ſo hardly handled, as he drew back a little, thus ſpeaking to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies.</hi> Me-thinkes Sir Knight wee haue made proofe enough, of what we are able to performe in theſe affaires, wherefore I am of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that he whoſe quarrell I vndertake, &amp; the other for whom you entred fight, are not faulty in any thing wherewith they are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; otherwiſe our combate could not thus long haue endured, but victory wold fal to one of vs. Wel haſt thou ſayd, anſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> that the Knight for whom I venter is iuſt and loyall, but the Dwarffe is a villaine and a traitour: nor will I ſuffer thee to reſt, till with thine own mouth thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe as much: defend thy ſelfe therefore better then thou haſt done. Theſe angry wordes did ſomewhat eleuate the Dwarffes Knights courage, but he had loſt ſo much bloud, that he was no longer able to holde out; by meanes whereof <hi>Agraies</hi> took his pleaſure on him, becauſe the other did nothing but defend his ſtrokes which when the Duke beheld, by reaſon he fauoured him, he was highly diſpleaſed, and to ſhun the ſight of his death, departed toward his Caſtle, ſwearing thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to worke reuenge for him on all Knights errant, by doing then: all the ſhame he could poſſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. He being in this furie ſpake ſo loude, as <hi>Galuanes</hi> ouerheard him, wherefore he thus anſwered Duke thou dooſt enterpriſe a great war, eſpecially againſt ſuch as are known to more worthy Lords the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art, ſeeking thus to ſmother vp the blame of others. As thus he contended with the Duke, the Dwarffes champion fell at <hi>Agraies</hi> feete, who immediatly ſnatching off his Helmet, caught him by the head, giuing him many blowes with the hil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ah gentle Knight, quoth he, giue me my life, for I truely confeſſe, that hee who you fight for is vertuous and loyall, &amp; promiſe withall to gaine the Da moſels releaſe from impriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment but for Gods ſake I deſire ye, let me not reprooue the Dwarffe mine Vnckle with treaſon.

                  <p>All this while the Duke heard none of theſe words, becauſe hee was gone ſomewhat further off: but <hi>Galuanes</hi> laid hold on his horſe bridle, ſaying: By God (Duke) you ſhall not departe hence, vntill you haue ſeene he extreamity of your Champion: for he is either dead or vanquiſhed; what anſwer then make ye concerning the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels right, &amp; the treacherous iniury offered her by the Dwarfe? What? ſaide the Duke, thinkeſt thou I will breake mine oath, or do any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then I haue determined? I know not, quoth <hi>Galuanes,</hi> what concluſion you haue appointed. Mary this, replied the duke, that ſhe ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Why? quoth <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes,</hi> will ye not then deliuer her? No, ſaid the Duke, and if thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide not for thy ſpeedy departure out of my Country, thou ſhalt well know that thou haſt diſpleaſed me. Is it true? anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> doe ye threaten me contrarie to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and will not diſcharge the Damoſell ſo honourably iuſtified? By heauen henceforth I defie thee, as well on mine own behalfe, as all other Knights errant whatſoeuer. Very well, quoth the Duke, the like do I to thee, and al ſuch as thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleſt. So went the Duke into his Caſtle, and <hi>Galuanes</hi> returned in an exceeding chafe to <hi>Agraies,</hi> but reioycing at his Nephewes glorious victory, he ſomewhat quallified his angry choller: yet did he tel him all the Dukes mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and what defiance had paſſed on either ſide, wherewith <hi>Agraies</hi> was very much moued, chiefely for the wrong he threatned to the Damoſell; whereupon he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: In ſooth my Lord and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, it is againſt all reaſon, that ſuch a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus ſpoken, he called for his horſe, which being brought him, he mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted thereon, ſpeaking thus to the vanquiſhed Knight: My friend remember your promiſe, &amp; accompliſh it ſo ſoon as you can, that the Damoſell may be releaſed from her impriſonment. In good faith, quoth he, I will performe my vttermoſt hability therein. So rode away <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> toward the Forreſt of <hi>Arinida,</hi> where whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they entred, <hi>Galuanes</hi> thus began: You know Nephew, that I haue defied the Duke, in reſpect of the iniurie he offered vs: but if I might giue aduiſe, I would thinke it good for vs, to ambuſh our ſelues a while in this wood, where we may eaſily take him or ſome of his. I promiſe ye, ſaide <hi>Agaies,</hi> I like well your counſell: wherefore without paſſing any further, they made choyce of a little thicket, where they alighted, ſending their Squires to the Towne to prouide them victuals.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the Duke (as you haue heard) being with-drawn to his Caſtle, grewe into ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt the Damoſel, as he thought preſently to ſend her to the fire: where-upon he called for her, &amp; willed her for to haue minde of her ſoule, becauſe the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhee ſhould bee burned, if quickly ſhe declared not the truth of the Knight: but all theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings could not drawe one word from her. Now becauſe the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed Knight had promiſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> to labour for her deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the Duke, ſo ſoone as hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7181:60"/>
from the field, hee came and fell on his knees before the Duke: beſeeching him moſt inſtantly to graunt, what he had promiſed on the Ladies behalfe. But the Duke by all meanes excuſed the matter, ſaying, he had ſollemnely vowed ſhe ſhould dye, if ſhe reuealed not the thing he was deſirous to know. Therefore (quoth he) I will rather conſent to the ruine of my whole Eſtate, then in one iotte to the breach of my oath. In this manner was the Knight denyed and the next morning, very earely he ſent for the Damoſell, to whom hee ſpake thus as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Thou lewd and diſobedient wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, now make choice of the fire, or reſolue me in the matter I haue demanded, for one of them thou muſt doe. My Lord, quoth ſhee, you may appoint what you thinke good; but if I die in this manner, it will be againſt all law and reaſon. Preſently he committed her to two Sergeants at Armes, accompanied with ten Knights well prouided for their defence: and for the more ſuretie that ſhee ſhould not be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued, himſelfe mounted in perſon on a goodly great horſe; then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the towne, along they ride thorow the fieldes by the Forreſt ſide, and being come to the place prepared for execution, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded foorth-with ſhe ſhould be throwne into the fire, ſaying: Let the ſtubborne Strumpet die in her obſtinacie. But <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> being ready armed to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their fortune, diſcerned when the troupe came from the towne toward the forreſt; wherefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out longer tarying, (hauing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen expreſſe charge to one of their Squires, to haue a ſpeciall care of the Damoſels ſafety) ſlyly left their ambuſh, beholding the poore mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den readie for the fire; when ſhee perceiuing her preſent daunger, cryed to the Duke, that ſhe would tell what he deſired, onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the time of her death. The Duke beleeuing ſhee intended as ſhe ſayd, came to her; when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly he eſpied <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> gallopping toward him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo lowd that hee might eaſily heare them; Duke, now ſhalt thou be forced to deliuer the Damoſel. At theſe words were all the Dukes Knights greatly aſtoniſhed, yet prepared they for their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, where-upon began between them a fierce and cruel fight. Now though <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> were alone againſt ſo many, yet did they ſo brauely behaue themſelues, as at the firſt on ſet they quailed the greater part of them, before they could deuiſe which way to turne themſelues: wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the Duke was ſo amazed, that fearing his owne death was neere at hand, he with-drew himſelfe behind his men; yet <hi>Caluanes</hi> perceiued it, wherefore he cryed to him: Trayterous Duke, This day thou beginneſt to feele the warre thou didſt enterpriſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Knights errant: then ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the preaſſe, hee min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to charge the Duke, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred aſide, willing his Knights to kill their enemies horſes, which they on foote might eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe. In briefe, theſe two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions ſhewed ſuch chiualrie on their foot-men, as they were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed and driuen to flight, the moſt of them ſo cruelly wounded, that they were ſcant able to keepe themſelues on horſe-backe in their eſcaping away: and the Duke who was better mounted then any of them, made ſuch haſte, as hee brought the firſt newes hereof to the towne, being eagerly purſued

My Lord, the young Gentle-man whom not long ſince you Knighted before the caſtle of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doid,</hi> when you vanquiſhed the two Knights on the bridge, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the cawſey, where you took the Maiſter thereof priſoner, and deliuered by force of armes the friend to <hi>Vrganda:</hi> moſt humbly ſaluteth you by me, being the man whom he reputeth as his Lord, &amp; giueth you to know, how he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth to reach the height of honor, which he will attaine, or dye in the attempt: likewiſe when he ſhall performe ſome-what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the name of Chiualrie, he will acquaint you with more then yet you know, vntill which time hee ſhrowds it in ſilence. <hi>Amadis</hi> ſoon remembered ſhe ſpake of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherefore with ioy the teares dewed his cheekes, and the Ladies well noting this alteration, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed thereat, eſpecially <hi>Oriana:</hi> who (as you haue heard heereto-fore) was grounded in ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on toward him, as ſhe was well neer depriued of power to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it.

Greatly were all the hearers aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at theſe newes, but aboue all the reſt the Queene: who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Damoſell, if ſhee knew whither he trauailed from thence. Madame, quoth ſhe, I parted from him ſoone after, leauing him in the company of a Damoſell, who came from her miſtreſſe to ſeeke him, becauſe ſhe was deſirous to know him; at which time he went with her, &amp; ſince I neuer ſaw him. What thinke you heere of Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis?</hi> ſayd the Queene, do not you know of whence he is? Yes truely. Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I can ſay but little herein: I thinke he be mine owne brother, for ſo <hi>Vrganda</hi> not long ſince aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, Doubtleſſe, quoth the Queene, the fortune of you both is admirable, &amp; I maruaile how you could come to the knowledge of your Parents, or they of you? yet would I be glad to ſee that Knight in the Kings ſeruice. While theft ſpeeches endured, <hi>Oriana</hi> who ſate farre from the Queene, and heard none of theſe newes, was in ſuch greefe to ſee <hi>Amadis</hi> ſhed teares, as being vnable to conceale the ſame, ſhe ſayd to <hi>Mabila:</hi> I pray ye (faire friend) call your coſin <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> that we may know what hath happened to cauſe him mourne. <hi>Mabila</hi> made a ſigne to <hi>Amadis</hi> to come, and when he was with them. <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhewing her ſelfe ſome-what griened, thus began. Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> it may full well be ſayd, that by ſome Lady you are now mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to pittie, I pray ye tell vs what ſhe is, and from whence this Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell

brought you theſe tydings. <hi>Amadis</hi> quickely perceiued his Miſtreſſes diſeaſe, wherefore hee declared all that the Damoſell told the Queene: which appeaſed the iealouſie of her hote Louer, and made this ſhew more amiable conntenance, thus ſpeaking to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis.</hi> Alas, my Lord, I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to pardon the fault, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed onely by falſe ſuſpition againſt you. I promiſe ye Madame, quoth he, there is no cauſe of pardon, nor did my heart euer thinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe againſt you: but could you like thereof, that I ſhould goe ſeeke him the Damoſell departed from, and bring him hither with me to ſerue you? for this I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, if I bring him not, it will be very hard to get him hither. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue mee, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> I would gladly wiſh ſo good a knight in his company, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhal doe well to goe ſeeke him: yet before you depart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Queene herewith, that ſhe may imagine, how by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement onely, you enterpriſe this iourney. Humbly did <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> regratiate his Miſtreſſe: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her counſell hee went to the Queene, to whom he began in this manner. It were good (in mine opinion, Madame, that the King had this knight likewiſe, to attend on his ſeruice. Certes, quoth ſhee, I would it might be ſo if it were poſſible. If you will grant me leaue, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> to goe finde him, I haue no doubt of bringing him hither: otherwiſe I know you ſhall hardly ſee him, till hee haue made himſelfe knowne in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. You doe very much for the king, quoth ſhe, if hee doe come; neuertheleſſe, I referre it to your owne diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Amadis</hi> obtained licence to depart, which hee did very early the next Morning, hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company then <hi>Gandalin;</hi> and ſpending moſt part of the day ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through the Forreſt, he ſaw a Lady come toward him, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with two Damoſels and foure Squires: who weeping very grieuouſly, conducted a knight in a Litter, whereat <hi>Amadis</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed, demaunded what moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to be ſo ſorrowfull, and what he was they had in the Litter. He is, quoth the Ladie, the onely cauſe of my care and penſiueneſſe, my Lord and Husband, who is wounded in ſuch ſort as I feare his death. <hi>Amadis</hi> aduanced him-ſelfe to behold the man, and lifting vp the couerture of the Litter, ſaw a Knight lye there, of goodly perſonage: but of his face hee could make no iudgement, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it was cruelly cut and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled; whereupon hee called to him, ſaying. My friend, who hath thus wronged thee? yet did the Knight make no anſwere; which made him goe to the Lady againe, and aske her the queſtion. Gentle Sir, quoth ſhee, a knight that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a Bridge not farre hence, did it, who as we paſſed by ſayd to my Lord, how hee muſt ſweare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were of king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> court or no: which made my husband demand why he would know. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaid the knight, no friend of his ſhall paſſe here, but I will kill him. What is the occaſion of your hatred, replyed my husband? I wiſh ſo much ill, quoth the knight, to that vngracious king, as I would gladly haue him in my power, to take vengeance on him at my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and in deſpight of him, heace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth ſhall I ſlay all ſuch as are belonging to him.

                     <hi>Daodan,</hi> for whoſe ſake I meane to deale in ſuch ſort, as the king and his wel-willers ſhall receiue by me infinite diſpleaſures and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours. When my husband heard him, as one agreeued at his villainous ſpeeches, he anſwered. Know thou that I am one of his Court, &amp; his vowed ſeruant, who neither for thee or any other will deny him. Highly diſpleaſed was the knight of the Bridge with this anſwere, and without any more wordes charged my husband, ſo that betweene them grew a cruell combate: but in the end, my Lord was brought into this hard extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and farre more worſe in the knights opinion; for hee reputed him to be ſlaine out-right, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs within three dayes to carry him before king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight him withall.

Yea verily, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> and if my hap prooue ſo good, hee ſhall neuer heereafter abuſe any other. Ah, gentle Knight, quoth ſhee, I will pray for your proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Afterward ſhee gaue him one of her Squires, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to GOD, rode on with her husband; and <hi>Amadis</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſtayed till hee came to the Bridge, where hee ſawe the knight playing at Tables with another: but quickly leauing his paſtime, being ready armed, hee mounted on horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> backe, calling for <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> in this manner. Holla, holla Sirra, I forbid ye to paſſe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till yee haue ſwome. What ſhall I ſweare? anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> Whether thou be of king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, or no, ſaid the Knight: for if thou belong to him, heere muſt thou leaue thy head behinde thee. It is a queſtion, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> if thou canſt doe ſo much: but I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee, I belong to the Queene his wife, euer ſince not long agoe. Since when? replyed the knight. ſince a diſinherited Lady, ſayd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> came hither for her right. But thou art not hee, quoth the knight, that foughteſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate for her? I am the man, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> who wonne her peace. By my head, ſaid the knight, now ſhalt thou looſe thine, if I can; for thou didſt kill the onely honour of my linage. I killed him not, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> but made him diſcharge her of his outragious demand, and afterward he became a murtherer of himſelfe. All this cannot profit thee, quoth the knight, for by thee and no other he dyed: now for his ſake, ſhalt thou looſe thy life. Hereupon they gaue the ſpurres to their horſes, and breaking their Lances brauely, met ſo furiouſly with their bodies, as the knight of the Bridge was thrown to the ground; whereof he was not a little aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: but by reaſon the helmet of <hi>Amadis</hi> was vnlaced in the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, while hee amended it, the knight had leiſure to mount him-ſelfe againe, and to giue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie two or three ſtrokes with the ſword, before he had time to draw out his. All which afterward hee very well requited; for ſtriking full at his head, hee brake away the skirts of his helmet, and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his blow, me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

When his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the bridge ſawe him thus ſlaine, they truſted to their heeles, yet <hi>Amadis</hi> would not follow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but returned to the Squire that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him thither: willing him to make haſte to his Lady, and let her vnderſtand how he had reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her husbands iniurie: which he immediately did, not ſparing the worthy attaints at Sword and Launce, which he had ſeene <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> beſtow on the Knight of the bridge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> hauing there no more to do, iſſuing forth of the Forreſt, entred on a large &amp; goodly plaine, brauely beautified with violets, ſweete hearbs, and all other deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of natures tapiſtrie, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently prouoked the remembrance of his <hi>Oriana:</hi> riding on in diuers amorous thoughts, he ſaw come toward him an euill fauoured Dwarffe, on a ſimple Palfrey, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he called to know from whence he came.

When <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> heard this, thinking hee had meant his brother, he ſayd: I pray thee my friend conduct me to the place where I may ſee him. With all my heart, replied the Dwarffe, on condition you will graunt me one requeſt, and goe with me whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall guide ye. The great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he had to finde his brother, made him ſoone conſent. Come with me then, quoth the Dwarffe, and I will bring ye where you ſhall behold the good Knight. So rode they on till darke night ouertooke them, which the Dwarffe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, he ſayd to <hi>Amadis,</hi> My Lord, hard by is a Caſtle where we may lodge this night, for there is a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who will friendly welcome vs. Thither they rode, and had kinde entertainment, when ſupper being ended, <hi>Amadis</hi> was brought to lodge in a ſumptuous bed: but he could take no reſt, his thoughts ſo hammered on the perfection of his miſtreſſe. And taking leaue the next morning of their friendly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſſe, continued on their iourney till about mid-day, when they ſaw two Knights fighting againſt one, then <hi>Amadis</hi> approching to them, ſaid: Gentlemen, may it pleaſe ye to pauſe a while, and tell mee on what occaſion your quarrell ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth? At theſe words they ceaſed, &amp; one of the two thus replied: It is becauſe this Knight maintaineth, that he alone is as able as we two together, to bring a hauty enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to end. In ſooth, ſayd <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> your difference is very ſlender, for the bounty of the one dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth no iot of the other. The Knights perceiuing he ſpake the truth, ended their ſtrife, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Amadis,</hi> if hee knew the Knight in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bated for the iniured wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, whereby the good Knight <hi>Dardan</hi> was ſlaine. Why aske ye? quoth <hi>Amadis.</hi> Becauſe, ſaid the Knights, we would gladly meete with him. I know not, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> whether your meaning be good or bad, yet is it not long ſince I ſaw him in the Court of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Hauing ſo ſayd, he rode on his way, when the three Knights hauing conferred a little together, they began to gallop after him: &amp; he no ſooner heard them, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe; then doubting they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7181:63"/>
ſome harme to him, he claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on his Helmet and his Shield, yet had he no Lance, nor they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Alas my Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, what will ye doe? conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you not they be three, and you alone? What matters that? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if they aſſayle me without reaſon why; by good right I muſt aſſay for mine owne defence.</p>
                  <p>On theſe ſpeeches, they came to him in this manner. Sir knight, we would demaund one thing of you, which we deſire ye not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, otherwiſe you may not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcape vs. The ſooner ſhall I grant it, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> if it bee reaſonable. Tell vs then, as you are a loyall Gentleman, where you imagine we may find him that ſlew <hi>Dardan?</hi> Hee who could doe no leſſe then ſpeake the trueth, thus replyed. I am hee, albeit I would haue you thinke, that I doe not ſo ſoone fulfill your requeſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of adding any praiſe to my ſelfe. When the knights heard him, they cryed altogether: Ah traytour, thou dyeſt; and drawing their ſwords ſet violently vpon him. <hi>Amadis</hi> offended to ſee him-ſelfe thus aſſailed, by them whom ere-while he had ſo friendly paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: reſiſted them with ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute courage, as at the firſt ſtroke he ſmote one of their armes from the body, the griefe whereof made him fall beſide his horſe: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d alſo felt his ſword ſo peizant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee cleft his head to the very teeth, and ſent to keepe his fellow company. When the third beheld their bad ſucceſſe, hee put the ſpurres to his horſe and got him away, but <hi>Amadis</hi> being not ſo well mounted, let him eſcape, returning to <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarffe, who thus ſpake. Credite me my Lord, hence-foorth will I truſt better to your wordes then I did: let vs therefore make haſte hence if you pleaſe. So riding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, at length the Dwarffe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in a pleaſant valley two high Pine-trees, neere which was a Knight mounted on a luſtie Courſer, and two other whom not long before hee had vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, they running to catch their horſes there ſtrayed about the field. And looking againe, hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied another knight lay leaning on his helmet, hauing his ſhield by him, and twentie Launces rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt the Pines, with two ſpare horſes likewiſe ready furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. My Lord, quoth the dwarffe, doe you ſee the Gentleman that leaneth on his Helmet? What then? ſayd <hi>Amadis.</hi> He is, replyed the Dwarffe, the good Knight I promiſed to ſhew you. Knoweſt thou his name? quoth <hi>Amadis.</hi> He nameth himſelfe, anſwered the Dwarffe, <hi>Angriote diſtranans,</hi> and is the beſt knight that I haue heard report of. Tell mee then, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> why he keepeth there ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Launces? I can therein, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Dwraffe, full well reſolue ye, liſten then a while. He loueth a Ladie of this countrey, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him aboue all other: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he hath preuailed ſo much by fight, as her parents were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to giue him her. After he had gotten her into his power, he thought himſelfe the happieſt man in the world: but ſhee tolde him, he ſhould wade into no ſuch fond opinion, becauſe hee tooke a yong Ladie againſt her will. And albeit, quoth ſhee, perforce you haue enioyed me, yet while I liue neuer ſhall I loue, ye if you do not performe one thing for me. What Lady anſwered <hi>Angriote,</hi> is it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7181:64"/>
within compaſſe of my puiſſance? That is it, ſaid ſhe. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand then ſweete Madame, replied <hi>Angriote,</hi> for I will accompliſh it euen to the death. The Lady whoſe euill will was toward him exceeding great, thinking to appoint him a place moſt conuenient for his death, or elſe to get him there ſo many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as her Parents might enioy better aſſiſtance to take her from him: intreated him and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to guard this vale of Pines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all knights errant that ſhold paſſe this way, cauſing them by force of Armes to take an oath, how they ſhould afterward tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile to King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, there to confeſſe her more beautifull the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ladyes they loued. And if it ſo fell out, that the brother to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griote</hi> (whome you ſee on horſe-back) were vanquiſhed, and could endure the combate no further: then <hi>Angriote</hi> ſhould keepe this paſſage alone, during the ſpace of one whole yeere. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> this cauſe they depart not hence all the day time, and at night returne to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle on the mountaine you ſee at hand: hauing already maintained their enterpriſe three moneths, in all which time <hi>Angriote</hi> neuer ſet hand to Sword againſt any Knight, becauſe his brother hath ſtil beene conquerour. Truſt me, ſaid <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> I beleeue thou ſayeſt true, and ſo I heard in the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> where not long ſince a Knight arriued, who confeſſed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griotes</hi> Lady to be more faire then his friend, and me thought he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her name <hi>Grouoneſa.</hi> Very true, quoth the Dwarffe: but now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are reſolued, remember your promiſe to me, and bare mee company as you ſayd you would. With right good will, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> which is the way? Euen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this vale, replied the Dwarffe, but becauſe of this hinderance, as yet I thinke wee ſhall very hardly paſſe. Care not thou for that ſayd <hi>Amadis:</hi> ſo giuing his horſe the ſpurres, he rode on, and ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he met a Squire, who thus ſpake to him. Go no further Gentleman, if you will not grant the Lady vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pine, to be more beautifull then your Miſtreſſe. Neuer will I yeelde to ſuch a ſlander, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> without force or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame conſtraint. Returne then, ſayd the Squire, otherwiſe you muſt combate with the twaine you ſee before. If they aſſaile me, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> I muſt defend my ſelfe ſo well as I can: ſo vſing no more words, he rode on forward.</p>

As for the combate, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I like it much better, then to confeſſe the greateſt lye in the world. I know
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7181:64"/>
well, ſayd the Knight, you muſt do it with diſaduantage in an other place. And truſt me, quoth <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> I thinke not ſo. Stand on your owne defence then, replied the Knight: wherewith they gaue the carrire againſt each other, meeting together ſo furiouſly, as the knight was vnhorſſed: yet held he faſt the raines of his bridle, till they brake in his hand, which cauſed him to fall on his necke to the ground, where hee lay without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of himſelfe or any other. Heereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> alighted, and pulling the Helmet from his head, perceiuing that he was in a ſound, wherefore he buffetted him in ſuch ſorte, as he came to himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Thou art but dead, ſayd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> if thou yeeld not thy ſelfe my priſoner. When the Knight ſaw the naked ſword ouer his head, fearing his death, he yeelded. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> mounted againe, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Angriote</hi> already on horſe-backe, ready to reuenge his brothers iniurie: and a Squire came to the Prince, bringing him a Launce, which he preſented him withall from <hi>Angriote.</hi> Soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tered ſo galantly, as their Launces flew in pieces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further harme, and ending their carrire, <hi>Amadis</hi> quickly drew his ſword, turning to <hi>Angriote,</hi> who thus ſpake. Make not ſuch haſt (Knight) to combate with the ſword, becauſe thou ſhalt haue time enough for that anon, (this he ſayd, in reſpect he reputed him-ſelfe the beſt at the ſword that might be found:) But I pray thee, quoth he, let vs iuſt till our Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces faile, or one of vs be ſent to the earth. Knight, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I haue weighty buſines elſe-where, and may not trifle time with tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heere. What? ſaid <hi>Angriote,</hi> thinkeſt thou to eſcape me ſo light ly? I promiſe thee it is the leaſt part of my thought: yet I pray thee let vs try one courſe more. <hi>Amadis</hi> was content, and taking ſuch Launces as each of them liked, finiſhed the Iuſt with ſuch violence, as <hi>Angri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> was caſt downe and his horſe vpon him. <hi>Amadis</hi> leaping from his ſaddle, ſaw that a ſmall trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion of a Launce had a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred his body, yet ſcorning any ſhame ſhould be deſerned on his ſide, fighting for the honor and beauty of his Goddeſſe <hi>Oriana:</hi> ſnatching forth the trunchion, and marched with his ſword drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Angriote,</hi> who ſeeing him come, ſayd. I ſee Sir Knight thou art very young, and me thinkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be worſe with thee, thou wert better to confeſſe my Lady fairrer then thine. Then ſhould I lye very fowlly, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> and (by my will) I ſhall not diſſent ſo farre from the truth. Theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches enkindled collor on either ſide, which made them charge ech other with ſuch vigour, as not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they that beheld them, but euen themſelues were driuen into doubts, thinking it impoſſible to endure ſo extreamely. And to ſay ſooth the cauſe was hard, for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> vndertooke the honor of his Lady, for which hee could rather chuſe a thouſand deathes, then ſhe ſhould looſe one iot of her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: and this opinion ſtill whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his courage, that <hi>Angriote</hi> was compelled to diuers ſimple ſhifts, to auoyde the fierce aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of his valiant enemy, who had wounded him in twenty ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places, and he perceiuing his death at hand, ſtepped aſide, thus ſpeaking to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Beleeue mee Sir Knight, there is more valour in thee then I imagined. Yeelde thy
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7181:65"/>
ſelfe, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſo ſhalt thou do wiſely, ſeeing thou art already brought into ſuch danger, for with the finiſhing of our combate, thy life will likewiſe end: which can be no pleaſure at all to me, in that I eſteeme of thee better then thou weeneſt. Theſe words he vſed, as well for the braue Chiualrie he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Angriote,</hi> as alſo the great honeſtie he ſhewed to the Lady in his poſſeſſion: whereupon <hi>Angri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> returned this anſwer. It is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I ſhould yeeld my ſelfe to the beſt Knight in the world, and the like all other to doe that beare armes: Beleeue me then gentle Knight, I not ſo much ſorrow for my foyle, as the wrackfull chance threatned to me, by looſing this day the onely thing in the world I moſt loue. That ſhall you not, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> if I can helpe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the Lady ſhould ſhew her ſelfe very ingratefull, if ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not your honorable paines in her defence, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but ſhe will requite ye with the good you haue deſerued. As for me, I promiſe ye to imploy my vttermoſt hability, in cauſing her conſent thereto, ſo ſoone as I ſhall returne from a ſearch I haue now in hand. My Lord, ſayd <hi>Angriote,</hi> in what place may I hereafter finde you? In the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> where (hy Gods helpe) I meane ſhortly to be. So tooke he leaue of <hi>Angriote,</hi> who gladly would haue had him in his Caſtle, but he might not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of his iourney.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth <hi>Amadis</hi> followe the Dwarfe, who guided him fiue daies without any aduenture, ſhewing him at length a meruailous ſtrong and pleaſant Caſtle, ſaying: Sir, within yonder hold you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the promiſe you made me. And I will doe it for thee, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> if it confiſt in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. I am in good hope thereof, quoth the Dwarffe, in reſpect I haue ſeene ſome proofe of your fortune: but know ye Sir how the place is named? No verily, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> for till now I was neuer in this Country: It is called <hi>Valderin,</hi> replied the Dwarffe: and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing, they came neere the Caſtle, when the Dwarffe willed him to take his Armes. Why? ſaide <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> ſhall we haue any ſuch neede? Yea mary, quoth the Dwarffe, for they ſuffer none to come forth that enter ſo lightly. <hi>Amadis</hi> buckled on his helmet, riding in before, the Dwarffe and <hi>Gandalin</hi> following after, then looking on euery ſide they could ſee no creature. This place ſayd <hi>Amadis</hi> is not inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where is the requeſt thou ſaidſt I ſhould do for thee? Credit me Sir, ſayd the Dwarffe, I haue ſome-time ſeene heere a moſt braue Knight, and the ſtrongeſt in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie that euer I ſaw, who in that porch killed two Knights, one of them being my maiſter, him hee put to death very cruelly, without regard of fauour or mercy: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge whereof, I would deſire that traytors head, which I haue long failed in obtaining, becauſe all ſuch as I brought hither, haue loſt their liues or remaine here in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity. Thou doeſt the part of a loyall ſeruant, anſwered <hi>Amadis:</hi> yet oughteſt thou to bring no Knight hither, before thou tell him againſt whom he ſhall fight. My Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, the man is knowne well enough, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for one of the beſt Knights in the world: therefore when I haue named him, I could not meet with any ſo hardy as to reuenge my cauſe. Belike then thou knoweſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7181:65"/>
his name, ſaid <hi>Amadis.</hi> Yea my Lord, replied the Dwarffe, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Amadis</hi> hereupon went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, looking round about if hee might ſee any body: but all was in vaine, wherefore to reſt his horſe, he ſtaied there till euening, ſaying to the Dwarffe. What wilt thou I ſhall doe now it is ſo late? Alas my Lord, quoth he, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo neere at hand, me thinkes it were good wee departed hence. Nay truſt me, anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> I wil not budge hence till the knight come, or ſome other that can tell me tidings of him. But I dare not tarry, ſayd the Dwarffe, leaſt <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> chance to know me, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I practiſe the meanes of his death. Yet ſhalt thou beare me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> as I will not excuſe my ſelfe from the promiſe I haue made thee. As thus they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned, <hi>Amadis</hi> eſpied a Court ſomewhat more backward, where-into he entred and found no body: but he ſaw a darke place vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and certaine ſteps leading into the earth. <hi>Gandalin</hi> got holde on the Dwarffe, who would haue run away, and <hi>Amadis</hi> tooke great pleaſure to beholde his trembling, ſpeaking thus merily to him. Feare not tall fellow, but let vs go down theſe ſtaires, to ſee who is beneath. My Lord; quoth the Dwarffe, for Gods ſake ſpare me, nothing in the world can make mee goe into ſuch a fearefull place. If thou goe hence, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> how wilt thou enioy the thing I promiſed thee, or know that I do my indeuour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Ah Sir, quoth he, I acquite you, and holde my ſelfe fully ſatisfied. But ſo do not I, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> becauſe hereafter thou ſhalt not ſay I brake my promiſe. On my faith Sir, ſayd the Dwarffe, I freely diſcharge ye, and if you pleaſe to let me go, I will tarry for you in the way as we came hither. Get thee gone then, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> for heere will I abide till to morrow morning attending the Knight.</p>
                  <p>In this manner the poore dwarfe eſcaped thence, and <hi>Amadis</hi> went downe the ſtaires, comming into a plaine place ſo darke, that hee could not imagine where he was: yet he proceeded on, and by gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on a wall felt a barre of iron, whereat hung a key which he took, opening therewith a chaine that locked a port-cullis, then heard he a lamentable voyce thus complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Ah God, how long ſhall we remaine in this miſerie? ſweete death why ſtayeſt thou from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring vs, who call to thee as our laſt refuge? Soone after the voyce ceaſed, which made him holde on his way, and enter a vault hauing his ſword and Shield ready: then paſſing further, he came into a great Pallace, at the entrance whereof hung a lampe burning, &amp; ſixe men laide along aſleepe, with their Shields and Hatchets lying by them, the beſt of which he took himſelfe. They not awaking hee went on by them, and ſoone after heard another grieuous lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this manner. Ah God full of pitty and mercy, ſend death if it pleaſe thee to deliuer vs from this hell. Now was <hi>Amadis</hi> in worſe caſe then before, for one of the ſixe Souldiers ſuddenly awaking, ſayd to his fellow: Ariſe, take theſe rods and make that curſed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſing another kinde of ſong, who hath thus diſturbed vs in our ſleepe. Mary and I ſhall, anſwered the other: ſo hee aroſe and tooke the rods, but as he went, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſee <hi>Amadis</hi> before him, whereat he was ſomewhat affraid,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7181:66"/>
yet to be better aſſured, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who is there? I, quoth <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> What art thou? ſaid the other. I am, quoth he, a ſtrange Knight. Who brought thee hither, ſayde the Souldier, without any licence? No body, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> but my ſelfe alone. The worſe for thee, replied the Souldier, now muſt thou be encloſed among theſe infortunate people, who cry as thou heareſt. Then ſtepping back, he ſhut the dore againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and waking his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſaid. My friends I haue found a ſtrange knight, who to his harme hath entred on his good will. Let me talke with him, anſwered the Iaylor, and if I lodge him not worſe then the reſt, then blame me. So taking his hatchet and Shield, he came to <hi>Amadis</hi> with theſe words. Caitife, if thou wilt not die, throw downe thy weapons, leaſt with my hatchet I ſlice thy fleſh, &amp; make carbonadoes of it. Very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry was <hi>Amadis</hi> to be thus threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wherefore he returned this anſwer. Slender is thy reaſon in thinking to feare me with thy words, but the Deuils ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright thee a great deale more: for I will make them a preſent with thy ſoule, which ſo long hath giuen power to thy wicked body in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill. Preſently they ſmote at each other with their hatchets, the ioylor deliuering his ſtroke on the helmet of <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſo that it entred very far therein, &amp; <hi>Amadis</hi> cutting through the iaylors Shield, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to throw both it and his hatchet downe to ſtand to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defence of his ſword: which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured not long likewiſe, wherefore he minded to grapple <hi>Amadis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the body, becauſe he was a man of maruailous ſtrength, yet could he not do ſo much as hee meant, in reſpect <hi>Amadis</hi> was a Knight both ſtiffe and ſturdy. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, the iaylor griped him very cruelly, till the Prince gaue him ſuch a blow on the face, as brake his iaw bones, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling him to fall downe amazed, <hi>Amadis</hi> had the meane to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his promiſe, ſeperating with his ſword the body from the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>The other Souldiours that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held this fight, not thinking the iaylor was dead indeede, cryed to <hi>Amadis:</hi> how on perill of his life he ſhould not kill him, leaſt they likewiſe ſhould ſend him after. I know not, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> what may become of me, but I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine he is ſafe enough for doing any more harme: herewith hee drew his ſword, and taking vp his hatchet againe, marched toward them that came againſt him, who charged him very ſharpe and roughly: yet the firſt he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with, followed the iaylor, ſo did the ſecond, and the fourth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmitten on his knees to the ground, had dyed, but he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for mercy, the other twaine bearing him company in the ſame ſuite. Caſt downe your weapons, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> and ſhew mee them that complained ſo wofully: which they did, guiding him the way to the captiues, when <hi>Amadis</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring another voice ſomewhat neer him, demanded what he was. My Lord, replied the Souldier, it is a Lady in extreame anguiſh. Open the dore, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> that I may ſee her. Then one of them ran where the iaylor lay dead, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two keyes from his girdle, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the dungeon where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was encloſed: but ſhe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the iaylor entred, cryed. Alas man, take pitie on me, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe me with no more torments.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7181:66"/>
Ah King, quoth ſhe, breathing forth a bitter ſigh: hard was my lot to be beloued of thee, ſeeing I buy my affection ſo deerely. Her grieuous moanes moued ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in <hi>Amadis,</hi> as the teares trickled downe his cheekes, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her this anſwer. Lady, I am not the iaylor that locked you heere, but the man who meanes to deliuer you hence if I can, a ſtrange Knight, ſeeking my fortune euery where. Alas my Lord, ſayde ſhe, what is become of the iaylor and his companions? He and ſome of them, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> are ſent to hell to looke their copeſ-mates: then one of the Souldiers hauing brought a light, the Prince ſaw how the Lady was tied by the neck with a great chaine, which had ſo worne &amp; diſployed her garments, as the naked fleſh appeared in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, and when ſhe beheld that <hi>Amadis</hi> pittied her, ſhee thus ſpake. Although (my Lord) I am at this preſent ſequeſtred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>al my lifehood, yet time hath been, when I was the wealthy daughter to a King, and for a King you finde me in this miſery. Lady, quoth <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> it behooueth you to embrace patience, theſe are but the mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of fortune, which no one is able to preuent or eſcape: and if the man for whom you haue thus ſuffered, be of any account, or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you, I am ſure he will conuert right ſoone this poore eſtate into rich aboundance, and remunerate your long ſorrowes with ioy and gladnes. So he cauſed the chaine to be taken from her neck, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding garments to be brought and put about her: wherefore hee that brought the lights, ran for a ſcariet mantle, which <hi>Arcalaus</hi> not long before gaue the iaylor, and caſt it about the Ladies ſhoulders. This being done, <hi>Amadis</hi> tooke her by the hand, conducting her forth of the darke priſon, ſaying; She ſhould neuer returne thither againe, but he would looſe his life before: and paſſing by where the iaylor and the other lay ſlaine, the Lady began thus to complaine. Ah cruell hands, how many wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and torments haue you giuen me, and diuers in this Caſtle without deſert? althought your bodies at this inſtant ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not receiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>digne ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gance, your damned ſoules may euermore abide in ſufferance. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> while I go to deliuer the reſt of the priſoners, I leaue ye in my Squires cuſtody, ſo paſſing on to the port-cullis, he met the Souldier that brought the lights, ſaying. Sir, <hi>Arcalaus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth where the Knight is that entred heere, whether he be dead or taken. He who caryed the torch before the Prince, was ſo affraid at theſe words, that he let it fal, which <hi>Amadis</hi> made him take vp againe, thus ſpeaking to him. Villaine, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou being in my guarde? goe on. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſending the ſtaires, they came into the open Court, where they ſawe the greater part of the night was ſpent, the Moone ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cleare, and the weather faire: but the Lady feeling the aire, and beholding the heauens, was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat with ioy, that ſhe fell on her knees before <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſaying: Ah gentle Knight, the Almighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect thee, and require the good I haue receiued by thee, deliuering me from comfortleſſe darkeneſſe. <hi>Amadis</hi> looking round about for <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and finding him not, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he had loſt him, wherefore he ſaide: If the beſt Squire in the world be dead, I will take ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge for his death may I but find his murderer, as neuer was the like

heard before. Being thus ouer-come with griefe, hee heard one crie, wherefore hee ran which way he thought beſt, and found the Dwarffe (that parted from him the night before) hanging by one leg on high at a great piece of wood, hauing a fire vnderneath him full of filthy ſtinking ſauours: &amp; neere him he eſpied <hi>Gandalin</hi> tied to a tree, toward whom hee was going to vnbinde him, but hee ſaw the Dwarffe had greateſt need of help, wherefore he cut the cords in twaine that held him vp, catching him in his armes to ſet him on his feete, afterward he vnlooſed <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> ſaying: In ſooth my friend, whoſoeuer entreated thee thus, made little reckoning of thy good deſerts. Now becauſe he would deliuer the other priſoners, he met the Lady comming forth of the Caſtle, as he returned back againe, but going on, he found the gates faſt ſhut againſt him: whereupon he ſtaied ul day light in a corner of the Court, ſitting downe by the Lady, accompanied with two of the Souldiers, the Dwarffe and <hi>Gandalin.</hi> And as they communed together, <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſhewed the Prince a place where-into he ſaw a horſe led, which <hi>Amadis</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee, came to the dore and found it ſhut: but he ran ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt it with his foote, that he made it fly open, finding the horſe there ready ſadled and bridled, whereon he mounted, attending the day and ſight of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> who he knew was already arriued at the Caſtle, by matters he heard of <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> and the Dwarffe. In meane while he conferred with the Lady, demanding what the King was ſhe loued ſo deerly, and for whom ſhe had ſuſtained ſuch iniury. Worthy Lord, quoth ſhe, <hi>Arcalaus</hi> getting intelligence, of the Princes affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion toward me whom I loue ſo loyally, this diueliſh enchanter being his mortall enemy: thought he could be no better reuenged on him, then by depriuing me of his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, imagining the griefe here-of would be greater to him then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other. Being thus perſwaded, he ſtole me away, at what time I was with many great perſonages, who were not able to giue me any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor, by reaſon of the traiterous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous ſorceries: for they could not deuiſe what was become of me, becauſe a wonderfull darke cloud enuironed me, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from following mee to this place, ſince when, I neuer ſaw light till now you brought mee forth. The diſloyall wretch ſaid by the way as he brought me, that he would be reuenged on my loue &amp; my ſelfe by theſe meanes: I poore ſoule enduring the torments, and my loue the griefe of my abſence, yet ignorant where. Madame, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I pray ye name the man you ſpake of. It is King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Norwales,</hi> anſwered the Lady, whom it may be you know. I know him right well, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> for he is one whom I deerly loue, and now do I leſſe pitty your ſufferings then before: becauſe they haue bin for one of the beſt men in the world, who will ſo well recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them, as by rendring you incomparable ioy, your loue and honor ſhall both be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>While thus they communed together, faire day appeared, when <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaw a Knight leaning in a window, who thus demanded. Art thou he that didſt kill my iaylor &amp; my ſeruants? Art thou he, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> that ſo treacherouſly put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth knights to death, abuſing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe both Ladyes and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7181:67"/>
by heauen thou art one of the vileſt villaines that euer I heard of. As yet thou knoweſt not, ſaid <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus,</hi> the vttermoſt of my power, but ſoone ſhalt thou haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof, to rid thee of ſuch boldnes in asking me what I can do, whether it bee wrong or right. Herewith hee went from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and not long after came downe into the Court, being well armed, &amp; mounted on a luſty bay courſer. Now you muſt note that this <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> was one of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyeſt Knights in the world, yet no Gyant, wherefore when <hi>Amadis</hi> behelde him of ſuch ſtature, hee doubted not of his great force and ſtrength. <hi>Arcalous</hi> perceiuing hee eyed him ſo much, dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what moued him ſo to doe? I imagine, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> that according to thy large proportion, thou ſhouldeſt be a man of exquiſite Chiualrie: but thy peruerſe and humaine actions are a foule ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh thereto. Now truſt me ſayde <hi>Arcalaus</hi> I thinke my ſelfe highly beholding to fortune, who hath brought thee hither to make mee ſuch a ſmooth ſermon: but all this will not helpe thee, therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy ſelfe. So charging their Launces, they brake ſo brauely on their Shields, as the ſhiuers flewe vp into the aire, and with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence met their horſes and bodies, that they were both laide along on the ground. Quickly they aroſe, &amp; with their ſwordes began a bloudy combate, wherein deſire of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and hauty reſolution of vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable courage, made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a long time, till <hi>Arcalaus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring aſide, thus ſpake to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Knight, thou art in danger of death, and becauſe I know not who thou art, tell me, that when I haue ſlaine thee, I may yet commend thy boldnes in entring heere. My death, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> is in the hand of God whom I reuerence, and thine in the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, who is weary of helping thee: and bequeatheth thy body to ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable miſchiefes, as a preſent periſhing of ſoule and altogether. But ſeeing thou wouldeſt ſo gladly know my name. I am commonly called <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> Knight to the Queene <hi>Briſana:</hi> let vs now then chat no longer but fall to the combate, for on my parte I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe no more reſting. <hi>A calaus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing his Shield, came with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fury againſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> who knew full well how to welcome him: and ſuch eager ſtrokes paſt on either ſide, as their ſhields were ſcattered in pieces about them, &amp; likewiſe many plates of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Now was it about the third houre, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Arcalaus</hi> hauing ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned great loſſe of his bloud, was forced to ſend vp and down before his enemy, and ſeeing the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent death before his eyes, fled to that part of the Caſtle where he came out: yet <hi>Amadis</hi> by cloſe purſuit ſtill continued his feare, whereupon he ſtept into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at the dore whereof ſtood a Lady beholding the combate, and he was no ſooner encred the roome, but be caught vp another ſword, turning his face <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The open Court, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> is more ſpacious and conuenient. I will not come foorth, quoth <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> for thy pleaſure. What? ſaide <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> thinkeſt thou ſo ſlily to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape? ſo placing his ſhield before, he entred the chamber: but as hee lifted vp his ſword to ſtrike, he was depriued of ſtrength and the vſe of his members, ſo that hee fell to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7181:68"/>
the ground as he had beene dead. Yea mary, ſaid <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> this is the way to make thee dye as I deſired, ſleepe then till I wake thee. How ſay you Lady? quoth he to her that ſtood by, am I not (in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) well reuenged on him? Indeed ſaide ſhe, he is now altogether at your commandement. Preſently he vnarmed him, <hi>Amadis</hi> not fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any thing was done to him: afterward <hi>Arcalaus</hi> put on himſelfe the Princes Armour, thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Lady. Madame, looke (on perill of your life) that no one remoue him hence, vntill his ſoule haue forſaken his body: then hee intended to iourney to the court, where each one ſeeing him in the Armour of <hi>Amadis,</hi> might thinke he had ſlaine him.</p>
                  <p>But now the ſorrowfull Lady ſo lately deliuered from priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, made ſuch mone as would haue melted a heart of Adamant, and what <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalins</hi> countenance was, you may eaſily iudge: when <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ſawe the Lady lament, he ſayde. Dame, ſeeke ſome other to deliuer you from priſon, for I haue diſpatched your hardy Chamhion. Theſe wordes made <hi>Gandalin</hi> in ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpare, as he fell downe like one ſenceleſſe, and <hi>Arcalaus</hi> called the Lady to him in this manner. Come hither miſtreſſe, and you ſhall ſee him dead that durſt ſo boldely combate with me. When he had ſhewed him to her, he dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded if he were not now quiet enough, The comfortleſſe Lady ſeeing him in ſuch eſtate, wanted no teares to expreſſe the aboundance of her griefe, and withall: Ah God, quoth ſhe, how yikſome will the reporte of his death be to many? then <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldus</hi> calling his wife, ſayde. So &amp;;soone as this wretch is dead, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon this Lady where ſhe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for I will go to the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and there declare how I combated with <hi>Amadis,</hi> by couenant, that the conquerour ſhould cut off the head of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and within fifteene daies following, to publiſh his victory openly in great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> By theſe meanes none ſhal quarrel with me about his death, and I ſhall obtain the greateſt glory in the world, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouercome him that conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red everyone. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went he where he left <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarffe, commanding them to be locked vp in a priſon: but <hi>Gandalin</hi> who wiſhed death, thinking his maiſter was dead indeede, would not goe with him, deſiring ſome one to kil him: and to enforce <hi>Arcalaus</hi> doe him ſo much fauour, reuiled him with names of traitour &amp; villaine, hauing ſlaine the moſt loyall knight in the world, <hi>Arcalaus</hi> made no account of his words, but bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not goe willingly, he dragged him by the eares, and thruſt him into the dungeon, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If I preſently kill thee, thou ſhouldeſt endure no more paine, but heere thou ſhalt ſuffer worſe then death. So mounted <hi>Arcalaus</hi> on the horſe of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with three Squires, rode toward the Court of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Rindaloya</hi> the Lady deliuered by <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> from priſon, made ſuch exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue lamenrations for him, as euery one pittied her, ſhee thus ſpeaking to the wife of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> and the reſt in the company. Ah faire Ladies, beholde yee not the beauty of this braue Gentle-man, who in ſo young yeeres was the onely Knight in the world? miſ-hap attend on ſuch, who by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, iniurie men of vertue: O ſoueraigne creator, why dooſt thou ſuffer ſo bad minded people to liue? The wife of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> who though her husband was addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſhameleſſe crueltie, yet ſhe being of gracious and pittifull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, grieued in her very ſoule to beholde his dealings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually praied for his amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, comforting the wofull Lady ſo well as ſhe could. As thus they were deuiſing together, they ſaw two other Ladyes enter the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, each one bringing in her hand good ſtore of candles lighted, which they ſet round about on the cantons of the chamber: finding <hi>Amadis</hi> thus lying before the wife of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> and the reſt, they being not able to lift or ſtirre him. Then one of the Ladyes ſo lately there arriued, tooke (out of a little caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſhe carried) a Booke, whereon ſhe began to reade, and diuers times another voyſe anſwered her. As thus ſhe continued her lecture, many other voyces were heard, as they imagined them more then an hundred: then came another book flying into the chamber, ſeeming as if the winde caryed it, and fell downe at her feete that reade, ſhe pulling it in foure parts, burned it at the foure corners of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the candles ſtood. This done, ſhe returned to <hi>Amadis,</hi> and taking him by the right hand, ſaid. Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> ariſe, you haue ſlept too long vneaſily. Immediately, <hi>Amadis</hi> awaked, and riſing vp, thus ſpake. Alas where am I? I maruaile that I am aliue. Beleeue me Sir, anſwered the Lady, ſuch a one as you are muſt not dye in this ſorte, rather wil the heauens permit, that they who haue deſerued it ſhall dy by your hand. Herewith the two ſtrange Ladyes, not ſaying any more, returned the ſame way they came, leauing <hi>Amadis</hi> much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at this aduenture, and looking about for <hi>Arcalaus:</hi> but he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed by <hi>Grindaloya,</hi> how he was gone to the court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> clad in his Armour, and mounted on his horſe, to reporte that he had ſlaine him in combate. Indeede I felt, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> when he vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me, but on my faith me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I dreamed: and ſeeing he is gone with my armour, I will make his to ſerue me at this time. Hauing put on the armor of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> he demanded of <hi>Grindaloya,</hi> what was become of <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarffe: ſhe tolde him they were impriſoned.

looke to the ſafetie of this noble woman till I returne. Comming fourth into the Court, it was a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to ſee how <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ſeruants fled his ſight: but <hi>Amadis</hi> let them run, and went to the darke vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe priſons which were filled with captiues.</p>
                  <p>Now to tel ye in what diſtreſſed manner they were, you muſt note, the place was a vault of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred toyſes long, yet no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one foote and a halfe in breadth, without aire or light, and (which was worſt of all) ſo ful of priſoners, as they could ſcantly ſtand one by another. <hi>Amadis</hi> called <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who being in a manner dead, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his maiſters voyce, began to tremble: yet thinking it was not he, becauſe he verily imagined him to be dead, entred into diuers doubts of himſelfe, whither hee dreamed, or was enchanted. All this while <hi>Amadis</hi> greatly grieued, becauſe <hi>Gandalin</hi> made no anſwer, wherefore he called aloud againe: <hi>Gandalin</hi> where art thou? why doſt thou make me trauaile ſo much? ſpeake I pray thee. When he ſaw (for all this) <hi>Gandalin</hi> anſwered not, he asked the other priſoners, if a Squire ſo lately brought in there, was dead or aliue: but the Dwarffe remembering the voyce of <hi>Amadis,</hi> cryed out. Alas my Lord, we are both heere together aliue as yet, albeit we haue often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough wiſhed for death. Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> cauſed candles to bee ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the lamp, which hung at the entrance of the dungeon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them all to come forth, to their no little ioy and comfort, ſeeing themſelues deliuered from ſuch miſerable ſeruitude: and when they came into the open Court, they fell on their knees before the Prince, thanking God and him for this happie benefit. <hi>Amadis</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their faces ſo pale, wan, and ouer-ſpent, ſeeming rather bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ghoſtes then liuing creatures, was moued to exceeding compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, eſpecially they being an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty priſoners in all, and thirty of them were Knights at Armes: as he caſt his eye euerie where among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hee made more account of one then all the reſt, who notwithſtanding his ſicknes and debility, ſeemed of braue and comely conſtitution, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that <hi>Amadis</hi> noted him ſo much, ſtepped to him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Who ſhall we ſay (my Lord) hath done vs this grace, by deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo long wretched thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Such as know me, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Prince, doe call me <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> Sonne to King <hi>Perion,</hi> Knight to the Queene <hi>Briſana,</hi> and domiſticall ſeruant to king <hi>Liſuart</hi> her husband: in ſearch of a Knight I was brought hither by this Dwarffe, to whom I made promiſe in a ſute he had. In ſooth my Lord, replied the other, I am a Knight likewiſe, and ſeruant to the ſame King, who knoweth me full well, as likewiſe the moſt in his Court doe, with whom I haue been ſeene in greater honor then now I am: becauſe euer ſince my departure from the Court, I haue liued in the miſerie from which you redeemed me. How may I call your name? ſaide <hi>Amadis. Brandoyuas,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Knight. Full well did the Prince reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that he had heard report of him in the Court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore courteouſly embracing him, he ſayde. Right glad am I, my ſtars ſo fauoured me, to deliuer you &amp; theſe other fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a helliſh place: and though I neuer ſaw you til this preſent, yet oft haue I heard the King and his Barrons talke of your

Chiualrie, your long abſence bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no little griefe to them. The reſt of the priſoners co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed their bounden dutie to him, deſiring him to appoint them what they ſhould doe: hee willing them to ſhape their courſe whether they thought beſt. My Lord, quoth they, albeit we know not what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Countryes may harbour vs, yet will we ſtill continue your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted ſeruants, to attend on you when and whereſoeuer need ſhall require. So each one kiſſing his hand, they tooke their leaue, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their iournys as they thought good, not any of them tarying with <hi>Amadis,</hi> but <hi>Brandoyuas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now go they to the wife of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, Amadis</hi> thus ſpeaking to her.

What I will doe, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready toldeye, it now remaineth, that at my requeſt you giue this Lady <hi>Grindaloya</hi> honorable attire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe her birth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour deſerueth no leſſe: in like manner, I would haue an Armour for this Knight, to requite his own which was taken from him, and a horſe as beſeemeth one of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. If you miſlike of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, doe more or leſſe as you thinke good, but ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> owne part, I will haue hence the armour of <hi>Arcalans</hi> in liew of mine, and his horſe, by reaſon mine own was better: yet muſt I tell ye withall, that hee hath taken a ſword from me more worth then all the reſt. Sir, anſwered the Lady, your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is ſo reaſonable, that beyond the power you alone haue heere, I ſtand bound in dutie to fulfill your commandement. Then ſent ſhe for the ſame armour belonged to <hi>Brandoyuas,</hi> and cauſed a horſe to be deliuered him: as for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhe brought her into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where ſhe clothed her in moſt ſumptuous accouſtrements, and returning to <hi>Amadis,</hi> deſired him to eate ſomewhat before he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereto he willingly condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. Now was the beſt viandes brought foorth, ſo ſhort warning might affoord, but <hi>Grindaloya</hi> was in ſuch haſt to be gone, as ſhe was loth to be troubled with any: whereat <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Brandoyuas</hi> merily ſmiled, eſpecially at the Dwarffe, who looked ſo pale and wan with feare, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to offer one word, which made <hi>Amadis,</hi> thus to ieſt with him. Tell mee Dwarffe, wilt thou that we tarry heere till <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> come, and I to giue thee the ſuite thou deſireſt? In ſooth, my Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, ſo deere hath the requeſt coſt me I made to you, as (while I liue) neither of you or any other will I craue the like: for Gods ſake then let vs be gone ere the Diuell come againe, for I cannot ſtand on the leg he hung me by, beſide, my noſe is ſo full of ſulphurous and ſtinking ſmels, as neuer ſhall I giue ouer ſneezing till I die. The Dwarffes words made them all laugh hartely, and after they had repaſted, <hi>Amadis</hi>

bidding <hi>Arcalaus</hi> wife farwel, mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horſe-back with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Lady thus ſpeaking at his departure. I ſhall pray Sir Knight, that God may ſend peace between my husband and you. Beleeue me Lady, quoth he, though I neuer care for it with him, yet ſhall it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine twixt you and me, becauſe you deſerue it. So fortuned it after-ward theſe words tooke effect, and highly profited the good Lady, as in ſome part of this hiſtory you ſhall heare recited.</p>
                  <p>Now are they departed from the Caſtle of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> riding till the night ouer-tooke them, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at a Ladyes place fiue leagues thence, where they were entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with very gracious welcome: and on the morrow, after they had thanked their friendly hoſt, as they rode together, <hi>Amadis</hi> thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with <hi>Brandoyuas.</hi> Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sir, I trauaile in ſearch of a Knight, as here-tofore I told ye, &amp; imagining it will be little pleaſure to you to follow me, it were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe then if we parted. In ſooth Sir, anſwered <hi>Brandoyuas,</hi> I gladly would goe to King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> court, notwithſtanding, if you thinke it good, I will keepe ye company. Little neede ſhall I haue thereof, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I thanke ye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alone, ſo ſoone as I haue brought this Lady into ſuch ſafety as ſhe thinkes meete. My Lord, quoth ſhe, I will accompany this Gentleman if you pleaſe, ſeeing he trauaileth to the Court of King <hi>Liſuart:</hi> and there I hope to finde him for whom I was priſoner, who I am aſſured will be glad of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance. Now truſt me, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> very well ſayde, goe then together, and God be your guid. Thus are they ſeperated, now remaining none with <hi>Amadis</hi> but <hi>Gandalin</hi> &amp; the Dwarffe, of whom the Prince likewiſe demanded what he meant to do. Mary be your truſty ſeruant, ſayde the Dwarffe, if you like ſo well as I. I am well pleaſed, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> and thou ſhalt doe what thou wilt thy ſelfe. In ſooth my Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, ſeeing you releaſed me, I would gladly remaine in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, for I know not where I may be halfe ſo well: the man and the maiſter being both agreed: they tooke their way as fortune liked to conduct them.</p>
                  <p>Not farre had they trauailed, but they met one of the Ladyes, that reſcued him from enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Arcalaus</hi> Caſtle, ſhee wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and mourning very grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: which mouing <hi>Amadis</hi> to pitty her complaints, made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the cauſe thereof. A Knight who rideth not farre before, quoth ſhe, hath taken from me a little caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, wherein is matter of great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, yet no way able to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him: for ſuch things are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as within theſe three dayes one in my company and my ſelfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored from death the beſt Knight in the world, and ſhee likewiſe of whom I tell ye, is violently caryed away by another Knight, who is ridden before intending to force her. Heere you muſt obſerue, that the Damoſell now talking with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> knew him not, by reaſon his helmet beuer couered his face: but when he heard how her casket was taken from her, hee neuer left gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopping till he ouer-tooke him, to whom hee thus ſpake, Knight, you deale not courteouſly, giuing this Lady cauſe thus to complaine of you, and me-thinkes you ſhould do a great deale better, to deliuer the casket againe you tooke from
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7181:70"/>
her: but when the Knight heard him, hee fell in a great laughter. Why do ye thus laugh Sir? ſayd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis.</hi> I laugh at you, anſwered the Knight, whom I thinke ſcant wiſe in giuing councell to him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it not, the leſſe hope may you haue in ſpeeding in your ſuite. It may be, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> you care not for my words, yet it were good to deliuer the thing is none of yours. Belike you threaten me the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? ſayde the Knight. Not you Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> but your ouer-much boldnes in vſing force where it ought not to be. Is it true, quoth the Knight: with theſe words hee ſet the casket aſide in a tree, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſayd. If your brauery be ſuch in deedes as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in words, come teach mee know it and receiue the law. So gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſpurres to their horſes, they encountred together in ſuch ſorte, as the Knight being diſmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his horſe fel ſo heauily on him, that he was not able to riſe againe: in meane while <hi>Amadis</hi> fetched the cofer, and deliuering it to the Damoſell, ſayd. Take your owne faire Lady, &amp; tarry here till I bring your companion. Preſently he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted after the other Knight, ouer-taking him at a thicket of trees, where he had tyed both his horſe and the Ladies, trayling her by the haire of the head into the wood, there to commit his villainous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but <hi>Amadis</hi> cryed to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude in this manner. Of an euill death maiſt thou dye traytor, that wrongeſt a Lady in this ſorte without offending thee. As the Knight ſtrougled with her to get her into the wood, hee looked vp and ſaw <hi>Amadis,</hi> whereupon he left her, making ſpeede to his weapons and mounted on horſeback, then approching neere the Prince, hee ſayd. By my hand Knight, in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe time for thee didſt thou hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me of my will. Such a will, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> as diſtaineth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, both men and beaſts deſpiſe. If I take not reuenge for it, quoth the knight then let me neuer weare armour againe. The world therein ſhall ſuſtaine a great loſſe, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> of one addicted to ſuch villainy, that ſeeks to force Ladies, who ought in all liberty and honor to be defended, and ſo they bee by all loyall Knights. With a braue courſe they met together, when though the knight brake his lance, yet was hee hurled againſt the ground ſo violently, as the weight of his armour and ſtrength of his fall, made him lye trembling in a trance. Which <hi>Amadis</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, to rid him out of his paine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, he trampled on his belly with his horſe feete, ſaying. Thus ſhalt thou looſe thy deſire of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Ladyes. And as for you faire ſoule, I hope heereafter you are rid from any danger of him. The more am I to thank you my Lord, quoth ſhe, would God my companion who hath loſt her casket, were as well deliuered as I am. She was the firſt, I met withall, anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> wherefore firſt of all I ſuccored her ſo well, as ſhee hath recouered what was taken from her, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde where my Squire conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her hither-ward.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the heat was ſome-what violent, <hi>Amadis</hi> put off his helmet to take the ayre, when the Damoſell immediately knew him: for it was ſhee that at his returne from <hi>Gaule,</hi> conducted him to <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda the vnknowne,</hi> when by Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry he deliuered her friend at the Caſtle of <hi>Bradoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7181:71"/>
each other, the like courteſie he ſhewed to the other Damoſell. Alas! quoth they, had we but drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on ſuch a defender, no villain could haue wronged vs halfe ſo much. On my faith, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the help you gaue me within theſe three daies, may not be compared with this matter of no validitie: for I was in greater extreamity the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, but how could you poſſibly vnderſtand thereof? My Lord, (quoth ſhe that tooke him by the hand when hee was enchanted) mine Aunt <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſent me to the Caſtle of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> by whoſe meanes we came thither, and you were recouered. Heauen ſhielde from euill that good Lady, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> who hath ſo many waies bound me her obedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant: and you faire Damoſels, the meſſengers of this fauour, haue you any thing elſe wherein to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me? No my Lord, ſaid they, take you the way you left, and wee wil returne from whence we came. Fare well ſweet Virgins, replied <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> remember my humble du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the health of your Miſtreſſe, telling her, ſhe knowes right well I am her Knight. In this manner rode the Damozels one way, and <hi>Amadis</hi> another: wherefore wee muſt now tell what happened to <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> ſince his departure from the Caſtle of <hi>Valderin.</hi>

                     <hi>Arcalaus</hi> had his head and hands vnarmed, wherefore without ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Gentlemen, he ſtepped to the King with theſe words. Sir, I come to acquite a promiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſtand bound, namely to let you vnderſtand, how I haue ſlaine a Knight in battaile, that ſome-time bare theſe armes. And albeit I muſt be content to declare mine owne prayſe, which were more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable for me, being reported by another in mine abſence: yet am I conſtrained to do no leſſe, ſeeing the couenant was betweene me &amp; him whom I haue ſlaine: <hi>viz.</hi> that the conquerour ſhould diſpoyle the vanquiſhed of his head, and preſent it before you as this day. Full loth was I to be ſo cruell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee tolde mee hee was your Queenes Knight, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and ſo hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe whom I vanquiſhed. As for me Sir, I tolde him in truth that I was <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> whom fortune
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7181:71"/>
hath graced with ſuch ſinguler fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: for I haue ſlaine the man, ſome-time owner of this armour and horſe, which as a teſtimony of my victory I brought with mee. Ah God, ſayde the King, is then the moſt vertuous and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Knight in the world dead? you lowring heauens, why began ye ſo braue to courſe in him, and now on ſuch a ſudden to cut it off? Theſe ſorrowfull newes prouoked ſighes and teares, both in the King and his royall company, which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> perceiuing, not ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe, returned the ſame way he came, feigning himſelfe likewiſe very ſad and grieued: but you muſt thinke he went not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ſtore of curſes, euery one inſtantly deſiring God, to ſend him an euill and ſpeedy death, which with their Swordes they could gladly haue beſtowed on him themſelues, but that they heard howe <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſlaine by an accorded battaile.</p>
                  <p>The King being ouercome with penſiueneſſe and ſorrow, returned to the Towne, where theſe newes were ſo opened to euery one, that at length the Queene and her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes heard thereof, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerted their former plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in to mourning. At this time was the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> in her chamber with the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> where hearing the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den clamour and noyſe, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to goe vnderſtand the cauſe thereof. Alas good Lady, too ſoone was it brought to her, for no ſooner was ſhe acquainted with the death of <hi>Amadis,</hi> but her immoderate paſſions expreſſed the anguiſh of her heart: and more to afflict this gentle Princeſſe, the other Ladyes came weeping into her chamber, ſaying. Ah Madame, what tongue can deliuer this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull miſhap? yet durſt ſhe not (good Lady) bee too forward in enquiring the manner thereof, leaſt the cinders of her affection might be diſcouered: and as if ſhe had beheld <hi>Amadis</hi> dead before her, ſhe ſayde. Alas! he is dead, it can not be otherwiſe. It is true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, anſwered the Damoſell, but what remedy? you muſt not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dy for company. Theſe words made <hi>Oriana</hi> fall into a ſwoune, which the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> beholding, thought ſhee had too indiſcreetly brought her theſe bad tidings, whereupon ſhe called the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſaying. Helpe Madame, my miſtreſſe dyeth. She being come, ſaw that ſhee neither moued or breathed, doubted leaſt life had taken leaue indeed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe commanded the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to ſhut the dore, to the end her loue all this while ſo well concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, might not breake foorth into open ſuſpition. Then vnlacing her garments to giue her more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as alſo bathing her temples and pulſes with vineger &amp; cold water, ſhe recouered againe, when deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a faint figh, with a feeble voiſe ſhe thus ſpake. Ah ſweete friends, hinder me not in the way of death, if you deſire my reſt, and would haue God find him another world, who knew not how to liue one day without me. Ah flower and mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of chiualrie, thy death is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable not to me alone, but to the whole world, who is replete with griefe for thee, becauſe they haue loſt him who in bounty, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, hardines, and all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, did honor them aboue the compaſſe of all deſire. And were yet any feeling in thee, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thou wouldſt not ſorrow for thy loſt life, but for my loue, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7181:72"/>
by thy miſſe maruailous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: for thou haſt left ſuch honor in the world behinde thee, conquering ſo incomparable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in this ſhort time of thy life, that (rekoning thy merites) thou diedſt poſſeſſed with many yeeres. Thus liueſt thou in place immortall, I remaining heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone after thee, can giue but woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and vnthankfull ſpeeches. Ah cruell death, ſufficed it not that mighty loue murdered him with his feathered ſteele, but thou muſt kill him out-right with thy cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſtroke? well, in reſpect it is ſo, offend not thy ſelfe my loue, for thou ſhalt ſoone ſee reaſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her that did thee wrong, who beeing the cauſe, will beare thee company in death. And I may iuſtly challenge him of wrong, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equall loue had vnited our willes to ſeperate our perſons in this ſorte: where hauing affoorded our ending together, wee likewiſe might haue inioyed one ſepulchre. After theſe words ſhe ſwounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in <hi>Mabilaes</hi> armes, and in ſuch manner altered her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as they reputed her verily dead, her faire and golden lockes being diſcheueled, her armes and legges depriued of vitall motion, euen as when the ſoule hath taken his flight, from the body. <hi>Mabila</hi> deſparing of any life left in her, was ſo ſurpriſed with griefe, that ſhee was conſtrained to leaue the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell alone with the Princeſſe, &amp; walking ſome-what aſide by her ſelfe thus lamented. Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible wiſdome, let mee not liue to endure theſe trauailes, ſeeing thou haſt taken theſe two from me whom I loued as my life. But when the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> ſaw her ſelfe thus alone betweene two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, ſhee was maruailouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed: yet as one wiſe and well gouerned, ſhee ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila.</hi> Why Madame? when were you wont to abuſe your honourable vertues? is it now time to forget your ſelfe? will you thus conſent to the death of my Lady? you rather ought to aide and comfort her, then thus to forſake her, and procure her fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther danger if ſhee reuiue againe. Come I pray yee ſuccour her, for now is the time of greateſt neede, and let theſe lamentations be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till another time. <hi>Mabila</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Damoſell ſaide true, wherefore ſhe came to <hi>Oriana,</hi> and feeling by her warmeneſſe ſome hope of life to bee expected, they lifted her vpon the bed, when ſoon after her ſpirites returned to their office: and to qualifie this agonie, they could deuiſe no better means, then to buſie her eares with ſome or other ſpeeches. Why Madame? quoth one, will ye leaue vs? at leaſt yet ſpeake to vs. Madame ſaide the other, your <hi>Amadis</hi> is yet aliue and well. At the name of <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhee opened her eyes, turning her head here and there as if ſhe looked for him: which good humour <hi>Mabila</hi> deſirous to continue, proceeded thus. <hi>Amadis</hi> commeth Madame, and ſhortly you ſhall ſee him. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> giuing a great ſigh, ſtarted vp, ſaying. Alas ſweete friend, where is he? We vnderſtand, quoth ſhee, that he is in very good health, and how the Knight who brought theſe bad tidings, is wont to vaunt of himſelfe without cauſe feeding himſelfe with falſe praiſe of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Knights. Why? ſaide <hi>Oriana,</hi> haue I not heard that hee brought his horſe and armour? A matter of nothing, anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> they may as wel be borrowed or ſtolne, or he (happily) ſent with that falſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7181:72"/>
allarme, to try out conſtancy: then finding vs thus weakely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, hee ſhould haue had the thing he deſired. I would not haue you thinke ſo ſimply Madam, that <hi>Amadis</hi> could be ouercome by one and no better a knight then he, nor were it reaſon to credit a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mender of himſelfe, bringing his owne glory for teſtimony and no other approbation: I am aſſured that <hi>Amadis</hi> will come ere long, and if he finde you not onely dead in a manner, but thus giuen ouer to griefe: it will coſt his life, ſo ſhall you deliuer vnhappy proofe, what wicked feigning by malice can do, and thus you both ſhall die one for another, When <hi>Oriana</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, how by this meane ſhe might be the death of her friend, if by good hap he yet enioyed life, and imagined likewiſe that <hi>Mabila</hi> ſpake the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe tooke courage, caſting her eye on the windowe, where many times <hi>Amadis</hi> and ſhe had amorouſly conferred, when firſt he ariued at her fathers Court, and intercepting a number of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſighes, thus ſpake. Ah window, the witneſſe of my aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, how piercing is the doubt of him whom thou cauſeſt me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and by whoſe gracious words both thou and I were made happy? Of this I am certaine, that neuer canſt thou indure ſo long as two ſo loyall louers might (by thee) enioy ſuch delight as he and I haue done: which fayling mee now, giueth me ſtrange and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable torments to bee my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and hence-forth ſhall my ſad ſpirit remaine in bitter ſadnes, vntill the comming of him or my death. <hi>Mabila</hi> perceiuing the cheefeſt danger was paſt, laboured to confirme her opinion more ſtrongly then ſhee had done, in this manner. Why Madam? thinke you if I held theſe babling newes for truth, I could haue the power to comfort you in this ſort, the loue I beare to my Cozin is not ſo little, but rather I ſhould incite all the world to weepe, then want conſolation for you, who ſtand in ſuch neede thereof. But I ſee ſo ſlender appearance of beleefe, as I will not before time require, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute you vnfortunate, becauſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforting our ſelues without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance: The euill hereby may be amended, and the good made much more worſe, eſpecially it will be the meane of diſcouering, what hath ſo long time beene ſhaddow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſecret. Alas, quoth <hi>Oriana,</hi> if he bee dead, I care not though our loue were openly knowne for all our miſhaps in reſpect of it are nothing.</p>
                  <p>Thus debating and deuiſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the two Ladies all that day kept their chamber, not ſuffering any other to come in: for when the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> (who paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed often in and out) was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſhe anſwered that ſhe accompanied <hi>Mabila,</hi> whom ſhe would not ſuffer to part from her, by reaſon of her griefe for her Coſin <hi>Amadis.</hi> Thus was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ſecret ſadneſſe couered, all night ſhe being vnable to take any reſt, ſuch were her aſſaults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween doubt and deſpaire, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting any thing that paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her and <hi>Amadis</hi> ſince their younger yeeres. But on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row about dinner time, <hi>Brandoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> entred the palace, leading <hi>Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daloya</hi> in his hand, which gaue great ioy to ſuch as knew them, for of long time they could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what was become of them: they falling on their knees before the king, were quickly called to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,

his maieſty thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Sir <hi>Brandoyuas,</hi> how chaunce you haue tarryed ſo long from vs? Alas my Lord, quoth he, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment hath bin the cauſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out (had not the good Knight <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> giuen liberty to me, this Lady and many more, by ſuch deedes of Armes as are vnſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) we could neuer haue been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered. Yet was he once in danger of tarying there himſelfe, by the villainous coniurations and ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Arcalaus:</hi> but he was ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by two Damoſels, who deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from all the exorciſmes. When the King heard him name <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom hee verily thought to be dead? What my friend? quoth he, by the faith thou oweſt to God and me, is <hi>Amadis</hi> liuing? Yea my good Lord, anſwered <hi>Brandoyuas,</hi> it is not ten dayes ſince I left him in good diſpoſition: but may it like you to tell me, why you demanded ſuch a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Becauſe, ſayd the King, <hi>Arcalaus</hi> yeſterday tolde vs he had ſlaine him: heere-with he declared his ſpeeches, and the manner how. What a traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous villaine is that? replied <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doyuas,</hi> but worſe is befalne him then he weeneth as yet: hereto he added what paſſed betweene <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> &amp; <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> as already you haue heard, whereby each one forſooke the ſorrow of the former falſe newes, the King preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, that <hi>Grindaloya</hi> ſhould be conducted to the Queene, that ſhee might vnderſtand theſe happy tidings.</p>
                  <p>Into the Queenes chamber is ſhe brought, and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> hearing her reporte, ran with all ſpeede to the Princeſſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> who hearing by her the truth of all, the paſſage of her ſpeech was ſtopt for a long time, ſeeming as one confounded with enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thinking in theſe newes ſhee gaue her the bag, or that ſhe drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, but when ſhe recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the vſe of her tongue, ſhe thus anſwered the Damoſell. Alas my friend, did I raue? or toldeſt thou me that <hi>Grindaloya</hi> teſtified to the Queene, how <hi>Amadis</hi> is not dead? In good faith, quoth the Damoſel, I came but euen now from her highnes chamber, where <hi>Grinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loya</hi> declared how <hi>Arcalaus</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Happy bee this houre, ſayde <hi>Oriana,</hi> but I pray thee goe tell my mother, that <hi>Mabila</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates her to ſende the Lady to comfort her: which ſhe did, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning right ſoone with <hi>Grindaloya</hi> to <hi>Oriana.</hi> I leaue to imagine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhee were well entertained or no, with all the modeſt courteſies ſo glad tidings deſerued, likewiſe whether <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila</hi> gaue her audience, when ſhe recounted <hi>Amadis</hi> deedes of armes at <hi>Valde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> the miſery of her and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the danger whereinto he fell afterward by the enchantments of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> from which hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by two ſtrange Damoſels. The diſcourſe hereof ſo pleaſed &amp; contented them, that I think <hi>Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daloya</hi> had an endleſſe taske in the reporting, for <hi>Oriana</hi> muſt heare euery thing often redoubled. But repeating the dangers of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and the miſery from which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the poore captiues, cauſed teares ſo thick as winters haile to trill downe her cheekes. Thus tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Grindaloya</hi> all day wiih the two Princeſſes, and had not ſo ſoone departed, but that ſhee was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, how that King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales,</hi> (who loued her deerely) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected her returne in the Queenes chamber. Good reaſon had ſhe to take leaue of <hi>Oriana,</hi> and ſeeke him
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7181:73"/>
from whom ſhee ſuffered ſuch ſorrow: But when theſe loyall lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers met together, each one was delighted ſo ſubſtantially, as <hi>Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daloya</hi> thought her griefes well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced. Now becauſe the Queene vnderſtood, how ſhee was daughter to King <hi>Ardroyd</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis,</hi> and all her miſeries had been for the loue of king <hi>Arban:</hi> with inſtant intreaty ſhee procured her ſtay in the Court, doing her all the honour and fauour could be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Grindaloya</hi> was not curious in granting the Queenes requeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe king <hi>Arban</hi> was partaker in the ſame ſuite: by this occaſion the Queene was aduertiſed, that ſhee had a maruailous faire ſiſter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Aldena,</hi> who was nouriſhed in the Duke of <hi>Briſtoyaes</hi> caſtle, which made her preſently diſpatch a Gentleman thither, with requeſt that the Dutcheſſe would ſend her to the Court. This <hi>Aldena</hi> was the friend to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhee for him ſuffered ſuch iniurie by the Dwarff as you haue heard before diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Iue dayes together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade <hi>Galaor</hi> at the Monaſtery, whether he was conducted by the Damozell he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from priſon, attending there the recouery of his wounds: but when hee found himſelfe able to weare his Armor, he tooke leaue of the ſiſters, and rode on his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, euen which way fortune plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to guide, for he had minde to no part more then another. About mid-day he arriued in a valley, in the middeſt whereof ſtood a fayre fountain, where he found a knight armed hauing no horſe: <hi>Galaor</hi> maruailing thereat, demanded if hee came thither on foote, the knight returning this anſwere. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me no, but riding through this Forreſt to a Caſtle of mine, I met with certaine theeues that ſlew my Horſe: thus am I brought into the ſtate you behold me, by reaſon my ſeruants heare not of my misfortune. Why? You ſhall haue my Squires monture, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galaor:</hi> I thanke you ſir, quoth the Knight, yet before wee part hence, you ſhall know the great vertue of this fountaine, for there is no poyſon in the world ſo ſtrong, that hath any force againſt this water, wherefore by reaſon of ſo ſoueraigne a benefit, often times enuenomed beaſts doe drink here-of, and are preſently healed: beſide, diuerſe of this Countrey vſe to come hither, and finde redreſſe for all their infirmities. In ſooth you tell me meruailes, replied <hi>Galaor,</hi> and ſeeing I am now ſo neere it, I will alight to drinke thereof as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue done.

from his Horſe, bidding his Squire alight to drinke as he did: but while they were drinking, the knight claſped on his owne head <hi>Galaors</hi> helmet, and taking his Launce mounted on his Horſe, when leauing the Prince drinking he rode away, ſaying. Farewell Knight, I muſt be gone, tarry thou here to beguile another as I haue done thee. <hi>Galaor</hi> lifting his head from the water, and ſeeing the Knight make ſuch haſt away, thus called to him. Ah villaine, neuer did theefe ſuch a treacherous pranck as thou haſt done: for thou haſt not alone deceiued me, but committed an act of great diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, which thou ſhalt well know, if euer I meet with thee. Yea mary, anſwered the knight, reſt your ſelfe there, till you recouer ſome other meane to combat with me.</p>
                  <p>Gone is the Knight ſo faſt as he could gallop, leauing <hi>Galaor</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing like a mad man, but ſeeing there was no remedy, he mounted on his Squires horſe and purſued him, til at length he came to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way: when not knowing which of them to take, becauſe he had loſt the ſight of him, hee ſtood ſtill in great penſiuenes, till at length hee ſaw a Damoſel come riding a pace toward him, of whom hee deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if ſhe met not a knight moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a bay Courſer, bearing in a whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

I would quoth he recouer again my horſe &amp; Armes, for they be mine, and by falſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies hee hath carried them from me. When happened this? ſaid the Damoſell: wherewith <hi>Galaor</hi> told her all the diſcourſe. Well, quoth the Damoſell, what can you doe to him being thus vnarmed? for I thinke hee tooke them not away to reſtore them againe. I care for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> but to finde him once more.

Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me then, quoth ſhe, ſo turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her horſe, rode the ſame way ſhe came, keeping co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany a while together: but the Damoſell being better mounted then he, left him behinde with his Squire, &amp; rid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo faſt, that they had loſt the ſight of her, trauailing the ſpace of 3. miles without any news of her, but at laſt on a great plain they ſaw her returne againe, here you muſt note, that the cauſe of her riding thus before, was to aduertiſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knight (being her deere friend) of their comming, and hee had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſent her to fetch <hi>Galaor,</hi> to deceiue him of the reſt of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: which he imagined eaſily to do without danger, ſeeing hee had gotten the chiefeſt thing of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and afterward he intended to kill him, or put him to ſome noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhame. For this cauſe he tary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Pauilion, erected by him on the plaine, and no ſooner came ſhe to <hi>Galaor,</hi> but thus ſhe ſpake. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end I might not faile in my promiſe, I forſooke your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a while, only to ſee if the man you looke for, were in the place I left him or no: there haue I found him, little thinking on your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in yonder Pauilion may you ſpeake with him at pleaſure. As thus they deuiſed together, they came to the Tent, wherefore <hi>Galaor</hi> alighted to enter, but the Knight meeting him at the doore, ſaid. Sir knight, what moueth thee to come in here without licence, truſt me it is but little for thy profit,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7181:74"/>
becauſe thou muſt here leaue the reſt of thine Armour, or die pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. Thou mayſt be therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> and the wordes of ſuch a wretch as thou art cannot feare me.</p>
                  <p>This reply very angerly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Knight, lifting vp his ſword to ſmite the Prince on the head, but <hi>Galaor</hi> cunningly eſcaped the blowe, giuing his enemy ſuch a ſtroake on the top of his helmet, as made him ſit one knee to the ground: then quickly laying hold on him, got the helmet beſide his head, ſpurning him ſo ſtrongly with his feete, that therewith hee fell on his face to the earth. When the Knight beheld himſelfe in ſuch danger, he called with a loud voice to the Damofell for ſuccor, where-upon ſhe ſtepped to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſaying: that hee ſhould holde his hand, for this was the boone he promiſed to giue her. But he being in extream choller, gaue no eare to her ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, bringing the Knight into ſuch eſtate, as hee left no vitall motion in him: whereat the Damoſell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to deſpaire, breathed forth many grieuous lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſaying. Alas wretch that I am, too long haue I trifled time: for in ſeeking to beguile another, my ſelfe am worthiely requited with deceite. And thou traytor quoth ſhee to <hi>Galaor,</hi> who haſt thus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly put him to death, heauen ſend thee a more worſe and hapleſſe end, for by thee haue I loſt my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felicity in this world: for which (bee well aſſured) it ſhall coſt thee thy life, becauſe thou haſt broken promiſe with mee, and in ſuch a place will I demand reuenge on thee, as nothing but thy death ſhal expiate my anger, wert thou a Knight of greater hardineſſe then thou art: if then thou make refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall there, I ſhall haue more then iuſt occaſion to publiſh in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the puſillanimity of thy faint hearted courage.</p>
                  <p>Faire Damoſell, anſwered <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> if I had thought his death would haue beene ſo grieuons to you, I could haue ſpared part of my diſpleaſure, though iuſtly hee deſerned no leſſe, but you ſpake when it was too late. The worſe for thee, replyed the Damoſell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy death ſhall recompence his. <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing ſhee continued her threatning ſpeeches, without any further anſwere left her, lacing on his helmet, mounting on the horſe the dead Knight tooke from him: and hauing ridden a pretty while, hee looked backe to ſee if the Damoſell followed him, when perceiuing her hard at his horſe heeles, demanded of her whither ſhee trauailed. With thee, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Damoſell, and neuer will I leaue thee, till I haue found op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to requeſt the boone thou didſt promiſe me, which ſhal be the loſſe of thy head by ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill death. Me thinkes it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſayde <hi>Galaor,</hi> for you to take ſome other ſatisfaction of me, and happily might bee more pleaſing to you. Not any thing elſe, quoth ſhee, thy ſoule ſhall accompany his whom thou haſt ſlaine, elſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhalt thou accompliſh what thou haſt promiſed mee. Well, well, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> I muſt ſtand to the hazard of that as I may: thus quarreling, they rode on three dayes together, and entered the Forreſt of <hi>Angaduze,</hi> an aduenture there happening to them, whereof the Author hereafter maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But now he returneth againe to <hi>Amadis,</hi> who taking his leaue of <hi>Vrgandaes</hi> Damoſels, as you haue
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7181:75"/>
heard before recited: rode on till about noone time, when iſſuing forth of the Forreſt, hee ſaw on a plaine a very faire Caſtell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out came a goodly Chariot, ſo brauely equiped as euer he beheld any, it being drawen by two braue red ſteedes, which were couered with imbroydered crimſon ſattin, as it made a very dainty and ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew. The Chariot was guarded by eight armed Knights, yet <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> being deſirous to ſee who was in it, drew ſomewhat neere to lift vp the rich couering, but one of the Knights came to him with theſe rough wordes: Keepe backe Sir Knight, and bee not ſo bold to come thus neere. What I doe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> is for no harme. Whatſoeuer it bee replyed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, trouble your ſelfe no further, in reſpect you are not worthy to ſee what is here couered: for if you enterpriſe the like againe, it will value your life, becauſe thou muſt deale with all in this troupe, and ſome ſuch one is amongſt vs, as is able alone to get the maiſtrie of thee, more eaſily then may wee altogther vſe thee as we liſt. I know not, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> the Knights va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour you ſpeake of, but hap good or bad, I will ſee what is in the Chariot. Herewith hee tooke his Armes, which the two Knights ſeeing that rode formoſt, they ran both againſt him, the one breaking his Launce, and the other miſſing: but <hi>Amadis</hi> ſped otherwiſe, for the firſt very eaſily hee caſt from his ſaddle, &amp; the other he threw both horſe and man to the ground. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> went towarde the Chariot, yet was he ſtayed by two other Knights, one of them being likewiſe diſmounted, and with his ſword hee gaue the other ſuch a welcome on the pate, as hee was glad to keep himſelfe from falling, by catching faſt holde about his horſe necke, when the other foure ſawe their companions ſo vſed by one Knight, they maruailed not a little, and being willing to reuenge their iniury, altogether fiercely charged <hi>Amadis.</hi> With this laſt aſſault hee found himſelfe ſore combred, for one of them tainted him in the ſhield, and another in his armour, as hee eſcaped hardly from beeing ouerthrowne: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee held out vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, deliuering ſuch ſtroakes to the firſt he met, as hee fell beſide his horſe in a ſwoune. The three that remayned turned their faces, ſeeking which way they might ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hurt him: but hee ſnatched a Launce from one of them, which yet remayned whole, and met one with ſuch a full carriere, that pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing quite thorough his throate, hee fell to the ground and gaue vp the Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>After his death, he came to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of them, and with his ſword ſmote the helmet from his head: when ſeeing hee was a very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent knight, hauing his head and beard ſo white as ſnowe, mooued with pittie, he friendly thus ſpake. Father, henceforth it were good you left the vſe of armes to youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then your ſelfe, ſeeing you haue liued ſo long without gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning honour or commendation, marry your age doth now excuſe yee. In good faith anſwered the Knight, your ſpeeches are very contrary, becauſe if it bee ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for young men to ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne and fame by armes: it is more neceſſarie that an auncient man ſhould doe his endeauour, to maintayne thoſe affaires ſo long as he can. Beleeue me Father, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> your reaſon is good.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7181:75"/>
While thus they talked together, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaw him who was firſt vn-horſed, make great haſt toward the Caſtle, and ſo did the other which were wounded: wherefore hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to the Chariot, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the couering, beheld there a tombe of Marble, hauing a crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King figured thereon, clothed in his royall ornaments, yet was his Crowne and part of his head ſome what ſeuered aloofe from the reſt. Hard by ſat a very antient Lady, and neere her a yong Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of moſt excellent beauty, whom very gratiouſly hee ſaluted, ſpeaking to the antient Lady in this manner. I pray ye tell me Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, what figure is this which you accompanie ſo carefully? What Sir Knight? quoth ſhee, (not knowing her gardants were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited) who gaue you permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſee our ſecrets? None o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> then my deſire thus to doe. In good faith, quoth the Lady, this is in you a great part of preſumption, and I meruaile that my Knights would ſuffer it: then putting her head forth of the Chariot, ſhee ſaw ſome of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Madam, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> your people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled me: but now may it pleaſe ye to ſatisfie my demand? Neuer ſhalt thou, quoth ſhe, be reſolued therein by me, hauing offered mee ſuch monſtrous abuſe: ſo ſaying, ſhe cauſed the horſes to hie away with the Chariot. <hi>Amadis,</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſo agreeued, would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her no more but rode on his iourney: then were the dead bodies put into the Chariot, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueyed into the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>Now had the dwarffe heard all that paſſed betweene <hi>Amadis</hi> and the Lady, but hee knew not what was within the Chariot, wherefore he deſired to know of his Maſter. I cannot tell thee, quoth he, for ſhe would make no anſwere thereof to me. In ſooth, ſaid the Dwarffe, it is ſtrange that women haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hold their peace. As thus they rode beguiling the time, on a ſudden they eſpied the old Knight now vnarmed, gallop apace after them, crying ſo loud as he could to <hi>Amadis,</hi> that he ſhould ſtay, which he did, when he deliuered him this meſſage. My Lord, I come to you by commandement of the Lady whom you ſaw in the Chariot, and ſhe being willing to make amends for the iniury ſhe did ye, deſires you to take a lodging this night in her Caſtle. Ah Father, replyed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> I found her in ſuch griefe for the debate betweene me and your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, that I think my prefe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce will rather be hurtfull then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to her. Aſſure your ſelfe, ſaid the knight, your returne will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acceptable to her. <hi>Amadis</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a knight of ſuch yeeres would haue told no leaſing, was content to goe with him, ſeeing with what affection he coloured his ſpeeches and by the way hee demanded of him, why the pictures head was made in ſuch ſort, but he would tel him nothing, ſaying, the Lady would thorowly reſolue him in all. Beeing come to the Caſtle, he ſaw the Lady and the Damoſell awayting his comming on the bridge, who bad him very hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily welcome. Ladies, quoth he, I would be glad to doe you good, but loath to offend yee. When hee was entered, hee ſaw a great
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7181:76"/>
many armed men, who flocking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, cryed. Yeeld Knight elſe thou art but dead. Nor ſhall you ſaid hee, with my will, keepe me your priſoner. So hee laced his Helmet, but he had no leyſure as yet to take his ſhield, ſo ſharpely was he aſſayled by his enemies: yet did he worthily defend himſelfe, ſending them to the Earth he met withall, at length by the multitude of his aſſaylants, he was driuen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a corner of the Court, which he recouering, and keeping them therein all before him, endomaged them much better then hee did before. But while hee was thus combatting, he ſaw the Dwarffe and <hi>Gandalin</hi> carried into priſon, whereat hee conceiued ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as being exempt from feare of death, he layed ſuch loade on his enemies, that no one durſt come neere him: albeit they were ſo many, as often times hee was in danger to fall on his knees, yet looking for no mercy at ſuch mens hands, would deerely buy his death among them, cauſing diuerſe of them to fall dead at his feete. And the diuine bounty regarding him in pitty, deliuered him from this perill by the young beautifull Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, who marking his braue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour in Chiualrie, intended to ſaue him, calling one of her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to whom ſhe ſaid. The gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant minde of this Knight moueth me to compaſſion, ſo that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all mine ſhould die, then he, therefore follow me. Why Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? anſwered the Gentlewoman, what meane ye to doe? Let looſe my Lyons, anſwered the Lady, that they may bee ſcattered, who offer wrong to the beſt Knight in the world: and thou (being my vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile) I command thee preſently to goe let them looſe. Which ſhe duſt not deny, but immediately ſent them forth of the Caue: then the Lady to make them retire that combatted with <hi>Amadis)</hi> cryed to them: Looke to your ſelues my friends, for the Lyons are gotten looſe by ſome miſchaunce. The men being all afraide, fled vp and downe to ſhunne the fury of the beaſts, but the Lyons made ſuch ſpeede after them, as diuerſe they ouertooke and rent in pieces. When <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaw himſelfe thus rid of his enemies, ſeeing the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of the Caſtle was yet open, he went out and held the doore faſt to him, while the Lions deuoured the other in the Court.</p>
                  <p>In this manner <hi>Amadis</hi> eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his bloody foes, yet was he ſo ouer-trauailed, as he could hardlie ſuſtaine himſelfe: Wherefore he ſate downe on a ſtone, holding his Sword ſtill ready drawne, a great part whereof was broken, and the Lions being yet ſo hungrie, as they ranne about the Court to ſeeke way into the fields: nor was there any man in the Caſtle ſo hardie, that durſt come downe to ſhut them vp againe, no, not the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell who had the gouernment of them, for they were ſo chafed, as no obedience was looked for in them, not the wiſeſt of them knew how to remedy it: Except the olde Ladie ſhould intreate the ſtrange Knight to let them forth, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining becauſe ſhee was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, hee would grant her requeſt ſooner then to the reſt But ſhee conſidering her falſe dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, durſt not aduenture to moue the ſuite: Yet when ſhe beheld it was her laſt refuge, ſhee put her head foorth of the window thus ſpeaking to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (Sir Knight) wee haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated ye very hardly, yet let your

courteſie excuſe what is paſt: and to ſaue our liues, open the gate that the Lyons may come ſoorth, to the end our preſent feare may be quallifyed, and they raunge the fields as is their deſire. This fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable kindnes let vs obtaine at your hands, whereby wee ſhall yeeld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the wrong wee haue done ye: and on my faith I ſweare to you, our intent was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to gaine you our priſoner, vntill you conſented to bee our knight. Madame, anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> you ſhould haue labored your determination by a more honeſt way: for without conſtraint I would willingly haue yeelded my ſelfe, as I haue to diuers Ladies, who knowe full well my ſeruice. Will ye then Sir, quoth ſhe, open the gate? No, replied <hi>Amadis:</hi> wherewith ſhe went from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the young Lady trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſhewed her ſelfe, thus calling to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Ah gentle Sir, ſuch are within heere, who could not ſuffer the iniurie done to you, the better they deſerue to finde ſome fauour. With ſuch ſeemely modeſty vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Ladie theſe words, as <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> asked her, if ſhe would haue the gate opened? Yea mary Sir, quoth ſhe, I humbly deſire ye. Preſently he aroſe to obey her requeſt, but ſhe willed him to ſtay a while, till the olde Lady warranted him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance from the reſt of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: nor could he but commend her wit and diſcretion, who get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him ſecurity from all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, made promiſe likewiſe, that <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarffe ſhould be deliuered from impriſonment. Then came the ancient knight, of whom we ſpake before, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>Amadis,</hi> he ſayd. Becauſe me thinkes (Sir) your Shield is greatly impared, and your ſword in like manner broken, take this ſhield and this mace, wherewith you may defend the Lyons when they come forth: ſo throwing the mace and the ſhield downe, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> willingly tooke them vp, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this anſwere. Let me neuer be ingratefull to them that ſuccor me in neede. By heauen, ſaide the knight, ſeeing you vſe loyaltie to worſe then beaſts, no doubt is to be made of your mercy to reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures. <hi>Amadis</hi> opening the wicket, the Lyons furiouſly ran foorth, and he entred the Caſtle, which they within perceiuing, came with the Ladies to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him, deſiring pardon for their offences committed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarffe. By my ſoule, ſaide <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> neuer was I ſo miſuſed vpon no occaſion, but ſeeing all enmity is ouer-blowne, you muſt giue me a horſe, for your ſeruants (I thanke them) haue flaine mine. Sir knight, anſwered the olde Lady, it is now ſomewhat late, if you pleaſe to vn-arme your ſelfe, and reſt here this night, to morrow you ſhall haue a horſe, or what elſe you neede. In hope you meane no worſe then you ſay, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> I will not refuſe your offer, becauſe the time doth requeſt no leſſe.</p>
                  <p>Foorth-with was he vnarmed in a ſumptuous chamber, and a coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mantle brought to wrap about him, then returning to the Ladyes who attended his comming, they were ſtricken into admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his excellent beauty, but much more at his valour being ſo young: and caſting his eye on her, at whoſe entreatance he let foorth the Lions, he reputed her one of the faireſt that euer was ſeene, but he ſpake nothing to her as yet, by reaſon hee proceeded in this
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7181:77"/>
manner with the old Lady. I pray yee Madame let mee vnderſtand, why the picture which I ſaw in the Chariot, hath his head ſo ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Sir Knight, quoth ſhe, if you will promiſe to accompliſh the couenants, before you be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the accident: I will tell ye, if not, I pray ye holde me excuſed. It were no reaſon Madame, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Amadis,</hi> to promiſe any thing ouer-lightly, being ignorant to what it may relate: but if you will let me heare the couenants, they ſeeming reaſonable, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a Knights power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, feare not to tell me, for I will imploy my vttermoſt therein. You haue reaſon, anſwered the Lady: then cauſing each one to with-draw, except the faire young vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ſhe thus began. Vnderſtand gentle Sir, that the figure of ſtone you behelde, was made in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this Ladyes father, who lyeth entombed in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, being in his time a crowned King, but on an eſpeciall feſtiuall day, as he helde open Court and royall, hee was aſſailed by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vnckle to this mayden, who came to tell him, that the Crowne hee wore was his, by as good right as hee could clame it, they being both iſſued from one roote. Then drawing a ſword, which he had hid vnder his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, gaue him ſuch a ſtroake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with on the head, that it parted in ſuch ſorte as you ſaw in the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Long time before did the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour excogitate this treaſon, and to the end he might the better exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, hee confederated himſelfe ſecretly with certaine of the Kings ſeruants, by whoſe meanes he wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtronger in his enterpriſe. But the King being dead, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall wretch was honoured with the Crowne, for the murdered Prince had no other heire then this his faire daughter, whom the aged Knight that brought you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had in guard, he ſhewing him-ſelfe ſo faithfull to her, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaied her thence ere her vnckle could take her, &amp; performed ſuch painefull dilligence, that hee brought my orpha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ne Neece hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for her better ſaiety. Afterward finding the meane to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the body of the King her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, each day we put into our Chariot, riding there with about the fields as you ſaw vs, we hauing all ſollemnely ſworne not to ſhew it to any one, vnleſſe by force of armes we ſhould be compelled thereto: and though ſuch a one happened to ſee it, yet would we not reueale why we conducted it ſo, except he would promiſe to reuenge this horrible treaſon. Now if you be a noble Knight, bound to proſecute vertue, and on ſo iuſt occaſion, you will imploy the forces God hath lent ye in a matter of right: for my part, I will continue as I begun, vntill I finde two other Knights on this behalfe, that you three for vs may confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the traitour and his two ſons, who will alow no combate, vnleſſe they fight altogether, which they haue often publiſhed abroade: how ſuch as will reproue their dealings, muſt come in this ſorte. In ſooth Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> great reaſon haue you to ſeeke meanes of reuenge, for the moſt famous iniurie that euer I heard of, and he who hath done it, ſurely cannot long endure without ſhame and miſ-fortune, becauſe heauen ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſuch monſtrous actions: but if you can bring it to paſſe, that one after another they will come to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the combate, by the helpe of

(replyed <hi>Amadis.)</hi> Mary if it ſtand with your liking, ſaid the Lady, a yeere hence to repaire hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe, if you liue ſo long, you ſhall finde ſome other heere, for by that time I hope to get two knights more, and you the third to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this quarrell, I promiſe ye, ſaid <hi>Amdis,</hi> not to faile in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, therfore neuer trouble your ſelfe to ſeeke other twaine, becauſe I meane to bring them with mee, yea, ſuch as ſhall well defend the right of this Lady, and reuenge the treaſon done the king her Father. Theſe words he ſpake in reſpect he hoped ere then to find his brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> and intended to bring his Cozin <hi>Agraies</hi> with him, by whoſe aſſiſtance he doubted not to finiſh the enterprize. Right humbly the Ladies thanked him for his good will, and becauſe, quoth they, they whom you muſt deale withall are valiant, rough, &amp; expert in Arms, as any the circle of the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth: wee requeſt your choice may be made of ſuch Knights, as ſhall be able to run through this worke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beleeue me Ladies, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if I had found one I am in ſearch of, I would not ſtand long ſtudying for the third, were our enemies Diuels and no Men. Tell vs then gentle Sir, ſaid the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if you pleaſe, of what Countrey you are, and where we may finde you in time of our need?

                  <p>By this time was ſupper ready, and the tables couered, wherefore they brake off talke and went into a very faire Hall, where ſuch good cheere and honour was made him, as might be deuiſed, euen vntill the houre of reſt came. The good night being giuen on all ſides, by the Damoſell that let looſe the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hee was conducted to his chamber, where ſhe kept him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany an indifferent while, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ſpeeches, ſhe vttered this. You haue her neere you my Lord, who ſuccoured you this day more then you imagine. Wherein faire Lady? anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> My ſelfe, quoth ſhe by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the young Princeſſe, ſhe pittying your perill and the wrong offered you: was charged to let looſe the Lions from their Denne. I neuer ſaw, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> a more wiſe and diſcreete Lady of her yeares. In ſooth, ſaid the Damoſel, if ſhe liue, ſhe ſhal be endued with two extremities, the one in beauty, and the other in wiſedome. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ye, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> to thanke her moſt humbly on my behalfe, and how in acknowledging the good ſhe did me, henceforth I will remayne her Knight. I am wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my Lord, anſwered the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to carry her this meſſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know it will bee moſt wel-come to her: ſo bidding him good night, ſhe departed the chamber. Now was <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarff lodged in the next roome where they heard what had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Amadis</hi> and the Damoſell, and becauſe the Dwarffe knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as yet of his Maiſters loue to <hi>Oriana,</hi> he imagined ſome new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was kindled betweene the young Princeſſe and him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the offer he made to bee her Knight. And to ſuch end did he retaine this opinion, as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Amadis</hi> after-ward had ſmall ioy thereof: for hereby he thought to receiue a cruell death, as in continuance of this Hiſtory ſhall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7181:78"/>
be declared. The night being ſpent &amp; bright day appearing, <hi>Amadis</hi> came to bid the Ladies farewell, requeſting to know their names a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he ſhould combat. The Father, quoth the Lady, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Abiſeos,</hi> his eldeſt ſonne, <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi> and the other <hi>Dramis,</hi> all 3. moſt valiant Gentlemen atarms, excelling al other in that countrey: which likewiſe is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sabradiſa,</hi> confining on the Kingdome of <hi>Serolys.</hi> Very well replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> by Gods leaue we ſhall one day ſee what they can do. When he was armed, as he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a luſty courſer, the ancient Lady had giuen him, the young Princeſſe preſented him a goodly Sword, which ſometime belonged to the King her Father, ſaying. Sir Knight, I pray ye henceforth (for my ſake) to weare this Sword ſo long as it will laſt, and I ſhall pray it may be helpefull to you in all your affaires. I aſſure ye faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> for your ſake will I carefully keepe it, and thanke you therefore with all my heart: hereof likewiſe ye may be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that I remaine to obey you, and ſhal aide you in all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your eſtate and honour. Well might it be diſcerned in the Lady, how theſe humble thankes and his former offer, pleaſed her not a little, wherefore the Dwarffe, (who noted the geſtures on eyther ſide) ſoftly ſaid to her, Madame, you haue this day made no ſmall conqueſt, hauing ſo good a knight at your commandement.</p>

What mooues you (Sir) to wrong my Dwarffe without cauſe: now truſt mee it is but ſimple man-hood, to lay hand on ſuch an excrement of nature as hath no defence of himſelfe, but being in my guard the preſumtion is great.

their horſes: yet quickly recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelus, they began a moſt ſharpe and cruell combate with their Swords. Now were they in greater danger of their perſons, then euer they had beene before, for their Shields being ſliced in peeces, their ſwords coloured with their blood, their Armor broken, their helmets battered, and them-ſelues ſo ſore laboured: as they were conſtrained to draw back a while to take breath, when the knight that conducted the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell thus ſpake to <hi>Amadis.</hi> My frend you may iudge the danger wherein we both may fall, if longer we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Combat: therefore I pray ye let mee haue my will on the Dwarffe, and I will amend the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence afterward, if it may bee tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an offence to you.

                  <p>At this inſtant an other knight chanced to paſſe by, who ſeeing the combattants ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now truſt me, ſaid the Knight, full well doe you manifeſt a wicked diſpoſition, practiſing (for your pleaſure) the death of two ſuch braue men, whoſe health and ſafety you rather ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, then imagine ſuch a diſloyall thought toward them: but tell me I pray ye, what reaſon you haue to hate them ſo?

By my conſcience Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, replyed the Knight, I neuer thought ſuch malice had remained in a woman of your ſort, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue aſſuredly (being yet ſo yong) if longer you liue, you will accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome your ſelf to ſuch vilainie as this you begin withall: whereby you ſhall infect the ayre and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elements, to the diſaduantage of the honeſt and vertuous Ladies liuing at this day. But to ſhielde them from ſuch danger, and theſe two good Knights, whom treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly thou wouldeſt ſhould kill each other, I will make a Sacrifice of thee according to thy deſerts: then lifting vp his Sword, he ſmote her head quite from her ſhoulders, that it fell on the ground at her horſe feete, ſaying. Take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of thy merits, for the loue I beare to thine Vnckle <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> who kept me his priſoner, till the vertuous Knight <hi>Amadis</hi> deliuered me: then running to the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, he cryed out aloud: Holde Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> hold your hand, for the man you fight againſt is your brother <hi>Galaor.</hi> When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard theſe words, he threw down his Sword and Shield to the earth, and embracing <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſaid. Alas my friend, my brother, rightly may I be tearmed the moſt vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Knight in the world, offering you ſuch outrage as I haue done. <hi>Galaor</hi> amazed at this aduenture, knew not what to ſay: but ſeeing how <hi>Amadis</hi> humbled himſelfe on his knee, he fell downe likewiſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring pardon, reputing himſelfe wonderfull vnfortunate, in wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thus his Lord and brother: then <hi>Amadis</hi> weeping with inward conceite of ioy, thus anſwered. Noble brother, and my friend, I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the paſſed perill well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, becauſe it beareth witnes of what we are able to doe. So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off their helmets to refreſh themſelues, they heartily thanked the Knight that rhus cauſed their acquaintance: whereupon he told them all what the Damoſell ſaid, &amp; the execution hee committed on her. Now truſt me, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> neuer was falſe ſtrumpet more rightly ſerued, and now am I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargd of the promiſe I made her. All the better for mee, ſaid the Dwarffe, and thereby haue I ſaued my head: yet I meruaile why ſhee ſhould hate me ſo much, in reſpect I neuer ſaw her till now to my knowledge. Then did <hi>Galaor</hi> at large diſcourſe, what happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him, the Damoſell, and her friend, as you haue heard already rehearſed: but the Knight that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated them, ſeeing their Armour all couered with blood, thus ſpake to them. My Lords, your Armours deliuer teſtimony enough, how diſcourteouſly your Swords haue intreated your bodies, wherefore me thinks long tarrying in this place, will but endanger your wounds: let me requeſt ye then to mount on horſeback, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to the Caſtle, whether you ſhall not onely be welcome, but finde helpe for your hurts by one skilfull therein.

                  <p>In ſhort time they arriued at the Caſtle of <hi>Balays,</hi> where they found Gentlemen and Ladeies that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly entertained them: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Balays</hi> had ſent them word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how he brought with him the two beſt Knights in the world, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> who deliuered him from the ſtrong priſon of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> and his noble brother <hi>Galaor.</hi> For this cauſe were they welcommed much more honourably, and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a goodly chamber to bee vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, where likewiſe ſtood two coſtly beds, and a table furniſhed with ſoueraigne medicins for their wounds, the cure whereof, two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (being Neeces to <hi>Balays)</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke, for they were very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly skilled in Chirurgery.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T chanced on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine day, that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſummoned a meeting in <hi>Windſore</hi> Forreſt, which was well ſtored with red Deere, and all other game needefull for hunting. And as he was in chaſe of a Hart, hee eſpied a good diſtance from him, three armed Knights to croſſe the way: wherfore he ſent a Squire to them, with requeſt that they would come vnto him: vpon this meſſage they immediatly obeyed, returning with the Squire to the King, and when they drew neere him, he quickly knew <hi>Galuanes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſeen him many times before: when embracing him, the King bad him hartily welcom, and the reſt in his company likewiſe, for he was a Prince, that moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly entertayned all Knights, eſpecially ſtrangers: then hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what the other were. My Lord, quoth <hi>Galuanes,</hi> this young Prince is my Nephew <hi>Agraies,</hi> ſon to the king of <hi>Scottes,</hi> and one of the beſt Knights in the world I dare aſſure ye: the other is <hi>Oliuas,</hi> whom your Maieſty hath well knowne heretofore. The King em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them very louingly, ſaying to <hi>Agraies:</hi> Faire Cozin, I muſt needes take this gentleneſſe very kindely, that you would voutchſafe to ſee me. As for you ſir <hi>Oliuas,</hi> I thought you had forgotten vs, confidering the long time ſince you were here: and in ſooth it is a matter very diſpleaſant to mee, when ſo good a Knight as you are would ſo abſent himſelfe. Dread Lord, anſwered <hi>Oliuas,</hi> my earneſt affaires kept mee hence againſt my will, which hath made me the more negligent in your ſeruice: and yet I am not free from them, as (if you pleaſe) I ſhall let ye vnderſtand. Then he reported, how <hi>Galuanes</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> came to his Caſtle, by meanes of the Damoſell that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them thither, whom they very worthily deliuered from death: likewiſe how the Duke of <hi>Briſtoya</hi> treacherouſly ſlew his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin, for which hee humbly craued Iuſtice, with free liberty to combat before his Maieſty, where he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to make him confeſſe his treaſon. After the King had well pondered his diſcourſe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the hard dealing of the Duke: he was highly diſcontented for he knew <hi>Oliuas</hi> Cozin to bee a good Knight, whereupon he thus anſwered. Beleeue mee ſeeing the Duke hath committed ſuch a fault, &amp; you requeſt iuſtice of me, aſſure your ſelfe to obtaine it, and I will ſend for him to come iuſtifie it in perſon.</p>
                  <p>Preſently the King gaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hunting, returning with the 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knights to his court, conferring on many matters by the way: among which the King demanded of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes,</hi> why the Duke of <hi>Briſtoya</hi> would haue burned the Damoſell whom they reskued. Becauſe Sir, quoth he, ſhe brought a knight na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Galaor</hi> into his pallace, and (as we vnderſtand) it was in the night time, and no other reaſon had hee to alledge.

But <hi>Oliuia</hi> louing him as you haue heard, (ouermaſtring her will with reaſon, as a moſt wiſe &amp; well aduiſed Princeſſe) gaue little in outward ſhew: till after ſundry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable ſpeeches paſſing betweene them three, they had ſome leyſure to ſtand a while aſunder from all the reſt. Yet did <hi>Agrates</hi> keep neere his Miſtreſſe, taking her by the hand, and playing with her fingers often ſent her a ſweete kiſſe in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: ſo that by intire regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her, he was tranſported with ſuch ſinguler delight, as he neither heard or made any anſwere to his ſiſter. She being ignorant as yet of his diſeaſe, knew not well what to thinke, for notwithſtanding all her courteous ſpeeches, his minde was otherwiſe buſied then on her: yet in the end ſhe diſcouered the cauſe of this ſuddaine mutation, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that <hi>Oliuia</hi> and her brother were ſurprized with each others loue.

I hope to obtaine ſo much of her, anſwered <hi>Agrates:</hi> whereupon he went to the Queene &amp; thus ſpake. Madam, if you could, ſpare mine vnckle a little, you might doe his Neece a very great pleaſure, for ſhe is deſirous to talke with him.

We ſhall confer, quoth ſhe, more conueniently at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, becauſe I haue many things to tell ye which were needeleſſe for my brother to vnderſtand: nor ſhall he, they being of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as they are.

And well ſaid Neece, anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets are ſo great, as they muſt needes bee kept from him. So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her by the hand, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to one of the windowes, by meanes whereof, <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia</hi> were left alone: When the Prince perceiuing hee had liberty to ſpeake, trembling in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of affection, he began thus. Madam, to accompliſh your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement when you parted from mee, as alſo to ſatisfie my heart which neuer enioyeth reſt, but in the gratious contentment, conueyed thereto through mine eyes by your preſence, I am come hither to ſerue and obey you: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you on my Faith, that being neere your perſon, my ſpirits feele themſelues viuified in ſuch ſort, as they ſuffer with great ſtrength the anguiſhes of continuall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which makes them dead in time of your abſence.

Good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had ſhe Madam, quoth <hi>Agraies,</hi> to be ſorrowful, and not ſhe alone, but all the reſt of his linage were bound to no leſſe: knowing when our Coſen dyeth, the chiefe and moſt excellent of vs all dyeth, yea the beſt Knight that euer bare Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

on his body, and you muſt thinke, his death would haue beene auenged and accompanied with many other. Ah, ſayde ſhe, the villaine <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ſhrewdly affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, and euill death betide him, for troubling this royall Court in this ſorte.</p>
                  <p>By this time the King was ready to the table, wherefore he ſent for the three knights from the Queen, commanding them to ſit downe by him in company of many great Lords and Barrons. And as the ſeruice came in, two Knights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the hall, who falling on their knees before the King, the firſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus ſpake. God proſpet your Maieſtie with increaſe of ioy and honor, moſt humbly I deſire to know, if <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule</hi> be in this Court. Not at this preſent, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King, but we could wiſh he were heere. Right glad would I be, ſayd the Knight, to finde him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by his meanes I hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer what I am now farre from. Tell vs my friend, quoth the King, if you pleaſe, who you are. My Lord, replied the ſtranger, I am a ſad Knight named <hi>Angrioted' Eſtranaus,</hi> and this other is my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales</hi> (who was there preſent) heard him ſpeake of <hi>Angriote,</hi> hee ſtarted from the table, and ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to the King, ſayde. Doth not your Maieſtie know Sir <hi>Angriote?</hi> ſuch as haue dealt with him, wil ſay he is one of the beſt knights in your Kingdome. My friend, quoth the king to <hi>Angriote,</hi> I pray you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and pardon me, if I haue not honoured you according to your deſerts: for the fault was only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through ignorance, but be ſure you are welcome &amp; that with heart, but ſay I deſire ye, how came you acquainted with <hi>Amadis.</hi> My Lord, replyed <hi>Angriote,</hi> I haue knowne him no long time, and my firſt ac quaintance was very deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought, for I neuer thought to dye till I was wounded: but he that did me the harme, promiſed after-ward to giue me help, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needfull now to cure me: hereto he added the whole accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as you heard it before. In ſooth, ſayde the king, I would be glad theſe matters ſhould haue a good end, but now come ſit downe with vs to dinner, afterward we will conſider thereon as we may. Next to king <hi>Arban</hi> was <hi>Angriote</hi> placed, and as they were about to riſe from the table, <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> the Dwarffe to <hi>Amadis</hi> entred the hall: whom <hi>Angriote</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, called him, demanding where he had left his Maiſter, becauſe he ſaw him laſt in his company. Sir, quoth the Dwarffe, whereſoeuer I haue left him, hee maketh good account of you: then falling on his knee before the King, hee thus began. <hi>Amadis</hi> my Lord humbly ſaluteth your maieſtie, and all the reſt of his friends in this Court. Dwarffe, ſayd the king, where didſt thou leaue him? In ſuch a place my Lord, quoth the dwarffe, where he is of good cheere: but if you would knowe any more, it muſt be in the preſence of the Queene. With right good will, anſwered the King, and heereupon ſent preſently for the Queene, ſhee quickly comming, being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on by diuers beautifull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, the moſt part of them the amourous friends to the knights then wayting on the king, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they purchaſed leaue (during the Dwarffes diſcourſe) to deuiſe with them, at better leyſure, then long time before they could: but the Dwarffe beholding the Queen preſent, thus proceeded. Madame,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7181:82"/>
my Lord and maſter <hi>Amadis</hi> in all humble reuerence ſaluteth your excellency, commanding mee to tell ye, that he hath found Prince <hi>Galaor</hi> his brother hee ſought for. Now truſt me, ſaid the Queene, I am heartily glad thereof. But on my credit Madame, quoth the Dwarffe, neuer was heard of ſuch a perillous meeting of two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for if God had not the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prouided, both the one and the other had neuer beene ſeene againe, ſo neere were they both at the point of death: but by hap a good Knight arriued there, who names himſelfe <hi>Balays,</hi> and hee found the meanes to agree them. Then tolde hee all the whole acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, how <hi>Balays</hi> ſlew the Damoſel that procured their quarrell, for which, <hi>Balays</hi> was highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of them all. But where haſt thou left them replyed the Queene? At the Caſtle of <hi>Carſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> Madame, ſayde the Dwarffe, where <hi>Balays</hi> dwelleth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence I was diſpatched hither with this meſſage. But tel me Dwarff, quoth the Queene, what thinkeſt thou of <hi>Galaor?</hi> I thinke Madame anſwered the Dwarffe, that hee is one of the goodlieſt knights in the world, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a reſolution not one iot infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the beſt: and did you ſee him in company of my Lord, you could make little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them.</p>
                  <p>I maruaile ſaide the Queene that they come not hither. Aſſure your ſelfe, replied the Dwarffe, no ſooner ſhall they recouer health, but they will be here with you, for ſo they expreſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded me to tell yee. So ioyfull was the King hereof, that he minded to keepe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Court after they were come: commanding his Lords &amp; Barons not to depart his Court, whereto they all willingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſcended. He likewiſe deſired the Queen, to ſend for all the chiefe Ladies in the Realme: For the more honorably quoth hee, you are attended on by Ladies, the more Knights ſhall they finde heere to deſerue their loue, on whom I will beſtow many rich gifts and preſents.</p>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7181:83"/>
eaſily might a great many wounds be deſerned on his head, and a trounchion of a Lance, peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the iron quite through his necke and throate: beſide, in ſuch manner did the dead Knight holde vp his hands thereon, as if he would haue pulled foorth the Lance. Greatly was <hi>Amadis</hi> and the reſt amazed hereat, and faine they would know what the knight ſhold bee, but they could ſee no body of whom they might enquire, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place neere that was inhabited, which moued <hi>Amadis</hi> thus to ſpeake. Doubtleſſe without ſome great occaſion, this knight was not brought into this place, beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and furniſhed in this ſtrange manner: if wee ſtay heere a while, ſome aduenture or other muſt needes enſue thereon. And ſo think I, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> whereupon hee thus ſpake. Brother, this raſh oath, ſome-what diſpleaſeth me, for I doubt it will be an occaſion of our long tarying in this place. What I haue ſaid, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> is done: with theſe words he alighted from his horſe, and ſate downe at the dead knights feete: which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twaine perceiuing, concluded not to leaue him, but euen to take ſuch part as he did.</p>
                  <p>Now was it between noone and euening, when they being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, might at more eaſe viſite the wounds of the dead man: and <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing his hands on the trunchion in his throate, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with griefe and maruaile, hee ſayd. Doubtleſſe hee yeelded his ſpirite as he now holdes his hands, becauſe they ſtill remaine in the place. And as they were thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning together, they heard a great noyſe of ſome comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, when preſently they eſpied a knight and two Squires, the one bearing a ſhielde and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and the other driuing a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell before him, ſhe giuing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhreekes and out-cryes, becauſe the knight ſmote her often with the end of his Launce: and thus they paſſed by the bed where the dead knight lay, when the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſawe the three knights by the coatſe, cryed Ah good knight who lyeth on the bed, wert thou aliue, I am ſure thou wouldeſt not ſuffer me to bee thus cruelly handled, if hazarding thy body in a thouſand perrils might defend me: would God the death of theſe villaines had excuſed thine. Sayſt thou ſo? quoth the knightt that vſed her ſo hardly, and thou ſhalt know the price of thy words: then ſmote her with his Lance ſo cruelly ouer the head, as made the blood in great aboundance to trickle downe her face, and ſo rode on ſtill beating her: which <hi>Amadis</hi> grieuing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, ſaid to his companions. In ſooth, neuer did I ſee ſuch a bad minded knight, to out-rage a poor Damoſell in ſuch pittifull manner: but (if God be my guide) he ſhall not long abuſe her ſo. Therefore brother, quoth he to <hi>Galaor,</hi> if I tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too long, ſet forward I pray ye to <hi>Windſore</hi> with <hi>Balays,</hi> and I will come thither with what ſpeede I may: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mounting on horſe-back, hee commanded <hi>Gandalin</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and gallopped after the knight, who by this time had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great deale of ground.</p>
                  <p>Thus remained <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Balays</hi> alone there till night, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very darke, they could not ſee, but heard a knight come riding the ſame way which <hi>Amadis</hi> took, who complaning of griefe in his legge, lay holding himſelfe about his horſe necke, but when hee eſpied <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Balays,</hi> he demanded if
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7181:83"/>
they knew the knight that rid ſo faſt the ſame way he came. Why aske you? anſwered <hi>Galaor.</hi> Becauſe ſayd the knight, I would hee might breake his necke, for hee runneth ſo rudely, as if hee followed ſome Diuell. What rudeneſſe hath hee offered you? anſwered <hi>Galaor.</hi> He would not tell mee, quoth the knight, neither by entreatance or other curteous meane, why hee made ſuch haſte: and I ſeeing him ſo ſelfe willed, layde holde on his horſe bridle, reſolued to make him pay for his boldnes, and to ſatisfie me either by friendſhip or force. Well, anſwered <hi>Balays,</hi> what did hee there tell ye? Nothing to my demand replyed the knight, but peremtorily thus ſpake. That hee would tarry no longer to tell mee, except I firſt combated with him. Hereupon we charged each other, he giuing me ſuch a ſhrewde puſh with his Lance, as I and my horſe were tombled quite ouer, and in the fall I brake my legge as you may beholde. When <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Balays</hi> heard his reporte, knowing full well hee ſpake of <hi>Amidis,</hi> they fell into a great laughter, ſaying. In good faith now are you taught againſt another time, not to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer importunate to knowe any thing againſt a mans will. Belike you mocke me then, anſwered the knight, and truſt mee you may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to repent it: then comming neere <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe, hee gaue him ſuch a blowe on his noſe, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him furiouſly to break his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, gaue him liberty likewiſe to run about the field, and thinking he was not reuenged enough, ſought how to ſerue <hi>Balays</hi> horſe in the ſame ſorte, but they both ſtepped between with their Lances, &amp; kept him off: which the knight percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, giuing the ſpurs to his horſe, he rode away, ſaying. If I had ſped the other knight ſo well, I would haue thought my ſelfe halfe reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced: learne you then to ſcorne me another time. Is it true, ſaid <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> and God neuer help me in my need, if I make thee not leaue thy horſe for the other thou haſt ſent raunging. Preſently he leapt into his ſaddle, deſiring <hi>Galaor</hi> to ſtay for him til morning, for then at the vttermoſt he hoped to returne.</p>
                  <p>By theſe accidents is <hi>Galaor</hi> left alone, attending newes of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he vowed: for hee had ſent his Squire to recouer his horſe, which by mishap tooke his way into a thicke woode. In meane while the greater part of the night is ſpent, &amp; <hi>Galaor</hi> could enioy no reſt, through extreame affection after his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: but about breake of day hee found his ſpirits ſo ouer-watched, as (whether he would or no) he was complled to take off his helmet &amp; ſhield, and leaning on them forgot himſelfe ſo much that when hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, hee neither ſaw the candles burning, or the dead knight which lay on the bed, whereat he became ſo ſorrowful, as he entred into theſe complaints. Well I perceiue, that I am vnworthy ſo high an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, ſeeing ſo fondly I haue fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſuch an eaſy matter. Now ſee I how Fortune (through this my ſioathfulnes) ſcorneth the little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour ſhe ſhewed mee at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and well may ſhe do ſo, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I would ſo careleſly fall aſleep, at ſuch a time as ſhe commanded me to watch. But ſeeing I haue ſo wilfully offended, I will amend it by an anſwerable penance: for I will recouer on foote with the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel of my body, the murdered man carried from me in my ſleep. Then followed he the track of their feet, whom he imagined had conuayed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7181:84"/>
thence the Knight, and walking on warily, as loth to faile thereof, he heard the neighing of a horſe: which made him ſhape his courſe thither-ward, albeit hee could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerne nobody, yet paſſed he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe hee heard the like noiſe of other horſes. Not far had he gone, but he eſpied two Knights armed, one of them being alighted from his horſe, &amp; reading cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In vaine did they make mee come to this place, for I vnderſtand not one word of them: wherewith hee mounted againe, and they rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way not ſeeing <hi>Galaor,</hi> but hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them, ſaying. Gentlemen, can ye tell me who hath caryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a dead knight, who not long ſince, lay vnder a tree in the foure cornered ſtreete behinde? Verily, anſwered one of them, wee knowe nothing thereof, but about mid-night we ſaw three Damoſels paſſe by, and ten Squires with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting a litter. Which way did they take? ſaid <hi>Galaor.</hi> This on the left hand, replied the knight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo giuing them thankes, he went the ſame way he was directed, &amp; ſoon after ſaw a Damoſell comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, to whom he ſaid. It may be (Lady) you can tell me who hath caryed away the dead knight, that lay vnder the tree not farre hence. If you wil promiſe me, quoth ſhe, to reuenge his death, which is an exceeding great griefe to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: I will reſolue you therein. I will not ſtick for that, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> for it ſeemeth by your words, it is an act of iuſtice to do it. Very true, ſaid the Damoſell, mount vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me on my Palfary, and I ſhall direct ye to your deſire. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had ridden about two miles, ſhee ſhewed him a maruailous faire ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and alighting at the gate, ſhe bad him enter: But remember, quoth ſhe, what you haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And becauſe I haue ſolicited, you heereto, I pray yee let me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your name.

Neuertheleſſe <hi>Galaor</hi> approching neere, and ſtepping to an anciant knight, demanded of him what the dead knight was. Sir, anſwered the olde man, while hee liued hee was ſuch a one, as all the world may bemone his miſ-fortune. Do you know his name? ſaide <hi>Galaor.</hi> He is called <hi>Anthebon</hi> replied the other, one of the moſt vertuous Gentlemen that euer liued in <hi>Gaul.</hi> When <hi>Galaor</hi> heard he was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to king <hi>Perion</hi> his father, his heart began to ſtorme, and as hee pittied him the more, ſo his deſire encreaſed to reuenge his death: whereupon hee entreated the knight to acquaint him with the truth of this tragicall accident: Sir, quoth he, this infortunate Gentleman which you ſee, was (in reſpect of his bounty and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) maryed to a wife, who now lamenteth for him, ſhe being the Lady of this Caſtle. In time they had a very faire daughter, and ſhe growing in yeeres, was beloued by a knight, our too neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but the young Damoſell euer hated him, and aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not abide him. Where-of he getting intelligence, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſome meane or other to

ſteale her hence, and being ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, (forgetting God, as alſo his owne honour) watched when this goodknight, (as cuſtomely he vſed) ſhould goe to the cornered ſtreet there to ſucour ſuch as often were diſtreſſed, becauſe it is the moſt dangerous place in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                  <p>Knowing him thus to bee from home, the diſloyall wretch entred this Caſtle, and finding the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Within a while after, hee left his Caſtle, beeing well mounted and armed, placing himſelfe vnder the tree where you ſawe this knight dead, to what intent I cannot tell: but vnhappily the Lord of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle came that way, hauing left his horſe and Armour, becauſe hee onely intended to take the ayre. The cowardly wretch ſeeing what aduantage hee had of him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the promiſe hee made his Lady, thought it place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to get him reputation, and no witneſſes by to report the contrary, ſo without giuing him warning, or ſpeaking one word to him, ſtealing behinde him, ſmote his Launce thorough his necke, as you heere beholde.</p>
                  <p>Thus, vnprouided of defence, likewiſe ſuddenly and moſt villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly, was this good knight ſlain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet the blody traytour not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, alighting from his horſe, gaue him many needleſſe cruell woundes with his ſworde, and ſo deſpitefully left him there.

Are you he, replyed the old man, whom we found leaning aſleep on your helmet? The very ſame man, anſwered <hi>Galaor.</hi> Why did you reſt ſo homely there? quoth the old man. To reuenge his death, ſayd <hi>Galaor,</hi> if by reaſon I might doe ſo much. Ah worthy Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the old man, heauen grant the finiſhing thereof to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: then taking him by the hand, he brought him to the bed whereon the dead man lay, thus ſpeaking to the ſorrowfull Lady. Madame, this knight ſaith (to his power) he will reuenge the death of your Lord. Alas gentle knight quoth ſhe, the God of heauen keepe you in that good minde, for I can finde no kinred or friend in this countrey, who will doe ſo much for me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Lord was a ſtranger: yet whlie he liuid, euery one ſhewed great friendſhip in lookes, but now their kindnes is cold enough. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> in reſpect both he and I were borne in one countrie, my deſire is the greater to reuenge his death. Are you, ſaid the Lady, the ſonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> whom my deceaſed Lord often told me was in king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court? Neuer came I there Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> in all my life: but tell me what he is that did this treaſon, and in what place I may find him? Gentle Lord, quoth ſhe, you ſhall be conducted thither if you pleaſe: neuertheleſſe I ſtand in doubt, (conſidering the perill) you will miſlike the enterpriſe, as many others haue done, who were heretofore accompanied thither. Herein Madame, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> is the difference between good and bad, yet if you will allow mee ſo much, as you did them that made refuſal, happily I may ſpeede better then they did. The Lady noting his honourable diſpoſition, called two of her Damoſels, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to conduct <hi>Galaor</hi> to the knight that held her daughter perforce. In footh Madame, ſayd the Prince, little credite ſhall you haue by ſending me on foote, my owne horſe I loſt (not long ſince) in the woode by hard fortune: I pray ye then let mee haue another on this condition, that if I reuenge not your cauſe, I may ſland bound to deliuer him againe.

death. Tell me his name, replyed <hi>Galaor.</hi> Hee is called <hi>Palingues,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Damoſels. Being now come hard by the Caſtle, they ſaw the gate was faſt, which made <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> call out aloud, whereat an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Knight came on the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, demanding what he ſought for. I would enter the Caſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor.</hi> This gate, quoth hee, is appointed to no other end, but for the comming forth of ſuch as remaine heere within. Which way ſhall I enter then? ſaid <hi>Galaor.</hi> I will ſhew you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quoth the Knight: But I doubt I ſhall trauell in vaine, and that you dare not come to vs. Now truſt mee, replied <hi>Galaor,</hi> I would faine haue beene within long ſince.

Which <hi>Iaor</hi> did, giuing his horſe to the Damoſels, went to the place where hee was appointed.</p>
                  <p>Then came the Knight againe and another with him, ſeeming of greater ſtature then his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they two winding a winche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ouer the wall let downe a basket with a cord, ſaying to the Prince. If you will enter here, the paſſage by the basket is this high way. But if I put my ſelfe therein, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> will yee promiſe to draw me vp in ſafety? Yea true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, quoth they, albeit afterwarde wee will not warrant yee. Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their wordes, hee entered the basket, ſaying. Drawe mee vp, for on your honeſt promiſe I aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Herewith they beganne to winde vp the basket, which the Damoſels ſeeing, marueling not a little at <hi>Galaors</hi> hardineſſe, ſayde. Ah good, Knight God ſhield thee from treaſon, for doubtleſſe thou ſheweſt a gentle and valiant heart.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Knights had drawen him vp, taking him and the basket in at the top, afterwards the knights thus began with him. Gentleman, it is neceſſary you ſweare to aide the Lord of this Caſtle, againſt ſuch as would quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with him for the death of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thebon,</hi> otherwiſe you neuer ſhall depart hence. What? ſayd <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor.</hi> Did one of you twaine kill him? Why demand you? reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other. Becauſe, quoth hee, I am come to let the murderer knowe, how hee hath committed a deed of horrible treaſon. Come yee for that intent? ſayd they, now ſurely you might haue beene a great deale better aduiſed: Dareſt thou threaten vs, and art in our cuſtody? alas, wee muſt haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of account at thy hands, &amp; we muſt chaſtice the folly wherewith thy braine is troubled: then drawing their ſwordes, they layde vpon him very furiouſly. When <hi>Galaor</hi> ſawe himſelfe thus wronged both in words and deeds, hee entred into ſuch choller, as quickely hee made them feele the edge of his ſword, ſo that the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels might eaſily heare the clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the ſtroakes on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: for the two knights were ſtrong and vigorous, and <hi>Galaor</hi> well mooued with hot diſpleaſure. Ah God, quoth one of the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, harke how the worthy knight dealeth with the traytors, let vs not depart hence till wee ſee ſome end thereof. All this while <hi>Galaor</hi> ſo laboured his enemies with ſuch ſharpe charges, as their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſomewhat to deſpaire, for to one of them hee gaue ſuch a blow on the helmet, as his ſword entred three fingers deepe into his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afterard
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7181:86"/>
hee buffeted him with the hilts of his ſword, that hee made him fall on his knees to the ground. In meane ſpace the other ſpared not <hi>Galaor,</hi> but layd loade on him to reuenge his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe head the Prince had now ſeuered from his ſhoulders: and comming to the other, the coward began to turne his backe, running downe the ſtaires faſter then euer hee came vp: but <hi>Galaor</hi> followed ſo nimbly, that laying holde on him, hee made him ſure for euer letting downe the basket againe, to drawe vp any more knights on the wals.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the Prince knewe not <hi>Palingues,</hi> and doubting one of theſe twaine to be he, he threw them ouer the battlements to the Ladies, bidding them to looke on them &amp; afterward to reſolue him: but they anſwered they were ſo mangled as they could not iudge of them, and they were perſwaded that <hi>Palingues</hi> was neither of theſe twaine. Whereupon <hi>Galaor</hi> went downe into the Caſtle, and as hee looked euery where about him, he eſpied a faire young Lady, who cryed aloud: <hi>Palingues, Palingues,</hi> is this the great chiualry for which thou wouldeſt be renowned? now thou flyeſt like a cowardly and faint hearted knight, yet ſayeſt thou wert a better man at armes then my murdered father, whom thou killedſt (as thou vaunteſt) in combate hand to hand. In ſooth what euer I doubted is now come to paſſe: why doſt thou not attend this Knight who looketh for thee? if there be any manly heart or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in thee, ſhew it now in need when thy life depends thereon. At theſe words <hi>Galaor</hi> looked more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and eſpied <hi>Palingues</hi> well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, who was opening the doore of a Tower to ſaue himſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtepped to him, ſaying. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue mee Knight, this flying wil little aduantage thee, and leſſe the ſtrong holde thou wouldeſt enter into: for thou muſt anſwer the life of good <hi>Anthebon,</hi> whoſe death thou diddeſt compaſſe by mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous villany. <hi>Palingues</hi> ſeeing there was no other remedy, turned and fiercely ſmote at <hi>Galaor,</hi> his ſworde entring ſo farre into the Princes ſhield, as he was not able to pull it out againe: by meanes whereof <hi>Galaor</hi> reached him ſuch a blowe, that therewith his right arme was cut quite from his body, the griefe whereof ſo pained him, as hee ran into the chamber where the Ladie was, thinking by this poore ſhift to defend his life. But <hi>Galaor</hi> getting hold on his legges, dragged him along on his backe out againe, and with his ſworde ſmote his head from his ſhoulders: This is, quoth hee, the rewarde of thy treacheries done to <hi>Anthebon,</hi> and payment for thy treaſon in the action of his death.</p>
                  <p>The daughter of <hi>Anthebon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at this deede, hauing heard <hi>Galaor</hi> often name her father, fell on her knees before him with theſe words. Alas my Lord, you haue bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me in ſuch duty to you, as neuer ſhall I be able to requite your paines, my ſelfe being of ſuch ſimple and ſlender ability: but the good will I haue to recompence this benefit, hath imprinted daily prayers in my heart to God for you, hauing ſo iuſtly reuenged the death of my father, and the wrongfull forcing of this tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. <hi>Galaor</hi> curteouſly taking her vp, embracing her in his armes, thus anſwered. On my faith faire friend, hee were a man of little ſence, that would offer
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7181:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſpleaſure to ſuch a one as you are, ſeeing you much bettet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be loued and ſerued, then with griefe or fauour to bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but tell mee, haue you any more enemies in this Caſtle? No Sir, replyed the Damoſell, thoſe which remaine, are to doe you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and obeyſance. Let vs goe then, quoth hee, to let in two Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels, who were my guides hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from your Lady mother. So taking him by the hand, ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the gate to bee opened, &amp; the two Damoſels entered leading <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe: but when they ſawe their yong Miſtreſſe, they humbly made her reuerence, demanding if her fathers death were reuenged to her deſire. Yea verily, quoth ſhee, I thanke God and this knight, who hath done that many other could not doe.</p>
                  <p>It was now the vehement hot time of the day, wherefore <hi>Galaor</hi> tooke off his helmet to refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, when the Lady ſeeing him ſo young and beautifull, as alſo ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant in deedes of armes: began to bee touched with loue, and ſetting aſide both feare and baſhfulneſſe, ſhee began to imbrace and kiſſe him, ſaying. My honorable Lord &amp; friend, more cauſe haue I to loue you then any other creature li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. In good faith, quoth he, and I loue you likewiſe, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of your beauty and good grace, as alſo for your deceaſed fathers ſake, he and I being borne in one Countrie. May if it pleaſe ye Sir, ſayde ſhee, to tell mee your name? Such as are acquainted with mee, anſwered the Prince, tearme mee <hi>Galaor.</hi> In ſooth my Lord, quoth ſhee, often haue I heard my father ſpeake of Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> your brother, and of you likewiſe, ſaying you were the ſons to the King of <hi>Gaul,</hi> his liege Lord and Soueraigne. As thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, they entered alone into a chamber, while the Damoſels with the reſt were pouiding viands: wherefore <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing time and place ſo commodious, to requeſt the loue of her that vſed him ſo kindly, ſhee being a Lady, young, freſh and faire, named <hi>Brandueta:</hi> himſelfe likewiſe actiue and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of ſuch ſweete baytes, thus ſpake.

                  <p>The Lady not one iot behinde him in amorous affection, ſhaped him this anſwere. I haue tolde yee my Lord, that I loue you more then any other liuing creature, therefore you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Beleeue me Sir, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand very audatiouſly: but if I know not how to charme ſuch bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, let armour neuer come on my backe againe. So placing their Launces in their reſts, they brake their ſtaues in the encounter: but the knight was caſt headlong out of his faddle, and before he could recouer him ſelfe againe, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtood ready with his ſword to take his life, which he perceiuing, and that he muſt bee forced to beg his pardon, thus ſpake. Gentle Sir, take pittie on mee, and looke what of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence I haue committed by any hard dealing, ſhall be amended by better vſage. Sweare then, ſayd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> neuer to wrong Lady or Damoſell againſt her will. With all my heart, replied the Knight, and as <hi>Amadis</hi> was comming to receiue his oath, the villaine thruſt his ſword into his horſe belly, which made him preſently fall downe dead, and <hi>Amadis</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in very great danger: ſo that before he could get vp againe, the knight deliuered him many cruell ſtrokes, ſaying. By God Sir, now ſhall I deerely teach ye, how you enterpriſe another time to correct your better. At length <hi>Amadis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered footing, and gaue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſuch a blow through the ſight of his helmet, as cut the one ſide of his face cleane away: wherewith he was ſo aſtonnied, that he fell to the ground, when <hi>Amadis</hi> ſetting his foote on him, quickly ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7181:88"/>
his heade from his ſhoulders. The night induring all this while, yet comfortably lightned by faire <hi>Cynthia,</hi> whereby the Damoſell ſawe the death of her aduerſary, which made her fall at the princes feete with theſe wordes. Alas wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy knight, the God of heauen (not I) muſt require this honourable kindneſſe, for without your helpe, much better had death beene to mee then life: yet let mee requeſt this further curteſie, no more but your company to a Caſtle not far hence, where I ſhall be in ſafety to my owne deſire, and to trauell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone thither will be dangerous for mee. Nor ſhall you faire Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> be in ſuch feare, for I will not leaue yee till you be where you would: ſo hee willed <hi>Gandalin</hi> to bring him the knights horſe, and to helpe the Damoſell on her palfray, afterward they rode as ſhee conducted them. Of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters they conferred by the way, ſhee acquainting him with the whole hiſtory of the dead knight, whole death you haue heard how <hi>Galaor</hi> reuenged. And comming into a meddowe by a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſide, they alighted from their horſes, betaking themſelues to ſleepe a little, becauſe it was night, ſhee lying on a mantle that <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> ſpread for her, and <hi>Amadis</hi> leaning on his helmet as his beſt pillowe. But as they all thus ſlept, it chanced a knight came riding by, who ſawe them, and without making any noyſe, with the great end of his Launce, hee iogged the Damoſell till ſhe awaked. When ſhee behelde him on horſe-backe, thinging it was <hi>Amadis</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her, ſhee ſtarted vp as one halfe aſleepe, demanding if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to departe. Yea marry, quoth the knight, and taking her by the hand mounted her vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him. Why doe ye ſo? ſaid the Damoſell, your Squire might helpe mee to mine owne horſe, without troubling you in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It were needleſſe, anſwered the knight, for ſeeing a booty is ſo well offered, I meane to haue the carriage of it my ſelfe. Theſe wordes made the Damoſell ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her ſelfe deceiued, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe, ſhee behelde where <hi>Amadis</hi> lay faſt aſleepe, wherefore ſhe cryed out ſo loud as ſhe could. Ah helpe me Sir, quoth ſhee, for heere is one I knowe not will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly carry mee away. When the knight heard what a noyſe ſhee made, hee gaue the ſpurres to his horſe, riding away in a maine gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop: but <hi>Amadis</hi> awaking and not ſeeing the Damoſell, was greatly diſpleaſed, haſhly calling <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> to bring him his horſe, afterward hee poſted the ſame way the knight had taken. At length hee got a ſight of them, marking their entrance into a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of trees where he miſtooke his way in ſuch ſort, as hee knew not which ſide of the woode to take: when (though hee was one of the moſt patient men in the world) he conceiued this griefe marueilous vnkindly, ſaying to himſelfe. Now may the Damoſel well report, that I haue done her as much ſhame as ſuccour: for if I defended her from one forcer, by my ſloathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I haue left her in the power of one worſe then he.</p>
                  <p>Thus riding in and out among the brambles, offering much iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to his horſe, at length he heard the winding of a horne, which made him follow the ſound there-of, imagining: the knight did it for his pleaſure. Soone after hee eſpied a ſtrong Caſtle on the top
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7181:88"/>
of a mountayne, and approaching neere perceiued it was begirt with a high wall, whereon were many great Towers, and the gate made ſure with mighty barres. As hee was ſeeking ſome place of ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the watch diſcrying him, ſaid. What man at ſo late an houre commeth armed ſo neere? I am a ſtrange knight, anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> What would you haue? ſayde the watch. I ſeeke for one, quoth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> who not long ſince tooke a Damoſell from mee. Wee ſawe none ſuch, anſwered the watch. Hereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> paſſed further, and diſcerned a little doore open, and the Damoſell with the knight to enter thereat on foot, becauſe they could not come neere it on horſe backe: then <hi>Amadis</hi> calling to the knight, thus ſpake. Stay a while I pray you Sir, and tell mee before you ſhut the gate, if you be the man that tooke a Damoſell from mee? If I tooke her from you, anſwered the knight, you had the leſſe care of her keeping. And the leſſe manhood, ſayde <hi>Amadis,</hi> was in you, to ſteale her from mee while I ſlept, beeing aſſured you could no otherwiſe haue carryed her from me ſo lightly. My friend, quoth the knight, I haue her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and of her owne good will ſhe came with mee, without any manner of ſoliciting or forcing. In good faith, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if you ſhew her me, and ſhee affirme as much, I ſhall reſt contented. It is not long to morning, ſayde the knight, and then I will let yee ſee her here, if you will enter vpon the cuſtome of the Caſtle? What is the cuſtome? replyed <hi>Amadis.</hi> You ſhall be tolde it, quoth the knight, and I thinke you will finde it too hard for your enterpriſing. If I would preſently agree thereto? ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> might I now enter? Not as yet, anſwered the knight: but if you tarry till day light, wee ſhall behold what you can doe. So going in, he clapped too the door, wherefore <hi>Amadis</hi> was contented to awaite the breake of day, vnder a tuft of trees hard by the Caſtle, and when the Sunne began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, hee heard the gate open, which made him quickely mount on horſe backe: then comming forwarde, hee ſaw a knight armed at all points, and vnder him a luſty courſer, whereupon the Porter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Amadis,</hi> demanding if he would enter. Why haue I tarryed heere elſe, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> all this while? But firſt, quoth the Porter, you muſt vnderſtand our cuſtome, to the ende you may not ſay after-warde that you were deceiued. I therefore thus aduiſe ye, how whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſhall be entred here, you muſt enter combate with this knight, and if he get the victory, you muſt ſweare to doe the commandement of a Lady heere within, or elſe be committed to a miſerable priſon. If hee chance to be vanquiſhed, it is nothing in reſpect, for you muſt be commanded to another gate, and there enter combate with two other, whom if your fortune like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be ſo good as to ouer come: you haue then to deale with three other, they being right valiant and tryed men at armes, and all theſe you muſt fight againſt vnder the firſt condition: but if you beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the honour in each of theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, right ſhall bee done in whatſoeuer you demand. On theſe conditions, replyed <hi>Amadis,</hi> I am well content to enter, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe I would ſee the man, who tooke the Damoſell from are this night paſt.</p>
                  <p>So ſoone as hee was entred, the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7181:89"/>
firſt Knight and he encountred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but <hi>Amadis</hi> ouerthrew his enemy ſo furiouſly, as his right arme was broken in the fall, which made him glad to yeelde for ſafety of his life. At the ſecond gate hee found the other two ready tarrying for him, threatening him with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if he did not well defend him-ſelfe: I muſt buy my libertie, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> with your deereſt blood, keepe it therefore from me ſo well as you can. Then couering them-ſelues with their ſhields, hee met one of them ſo directly that he fell to the ground, and his horſe vpon him, very ſore ſhaken and bruſed with his fall, then comming to the other with his ſword drawne, hee ſmote the helmet quite beſide his head, when being loth to proceed any further with him, he ſaid. Now truſt me knight, it is the greateſt folly in the world to fight, thy head being bare. Care not you for that, anſwered the knight, I will keepe as ſafe as you ſhall do yours. And I wil trie your cunning, quoth <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis:</hi> then ſtriking a full blow at him, which the knight ſhifting his body aſide to eſcape, loſt his ſtirrops and fell beſide his horſe, when <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> quickly ſtepping to him, got holde of him by the necke, ſaying. See knight how well thou defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thy head, art thou not well worthy to looſe it for thy wordes? When the knight ſaw what danger he was in, he fell on his knee, and thus ſpake to the Prince. Ah wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Sir, for Gods ſake mercy, and ſeeing you haue ſo well aduiſed me, neuer will I hereafter bee ſo raſh in folly, therefore I yeeld my ſelfe to your mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> being thus pacified, took a freſh Lance &amp; mounted on horſe-back againe, riding now to the laſt gate, where he eſpied La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes and Gentlewomen on the wales, who ſaid to each other: If he paſſe the bridge in deſpite of our guardants, hee ſhall performe a moſt rare deede of Chiualrie? While thus they communed, the three knights came foorth to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile <hi>Amadis,</hi> the firſt of them vſing theſe words. Knight yeeld thy ſelfe, or ſweare to doe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Lady. Theſe are but wordes, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> from which I can defend my ſelfe well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: I cannot put on the minde to yeeld my ſelfe, or accompliſh the Ladyes will you ſpeake of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know not what ſhe is. Here-upon a fierce combate began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Prince and the three, who ſhewing themſelues to bee right hardy knights, and <hi>Amadis</hi> full loth to receiue the foyle, made a long doubtfull iudgement of victory: till at length by many wounds &amp; great loſſe of blood, the knights were able to holde out no longer, flying into the caſtle for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety of themſelues, yet one of them fell downe by the way, whom <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſware ſhould die if hee yeelded not preſently. Alas my Lord, quoth he, with all my heart I ſubmit my ſelfe, and ſo ought all other to do that combate againſt you, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your happy fortune ſince you came to this Caſtle. With theſe words hee deliuered his ſword to the Prince, who gaue it him again, and followed the other twaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pallace, where hee met di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Ladies and Damoſels, when the choyce of them all in beauty, thus ſpake to him. Stay awhile Sir knight if you pleaſe, for alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy you haue done ſo much, as you ſhall obtaine what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Lady, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> command then your Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to yeelde themſelues van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7181:89"/>
And what ſhall you bee the better for that? ſaid ſhe. When I accepted the conditions of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce here, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> it was ſaide, that I muſt either be killed, or vanquiſh him that I combated withall: otherwiſe I haue not the right was promiſed. You miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it replyed the Lady, for it was tolde ye, that if perforce you entred thus farre, you ſhould haue reaſon in what you demanded: ſay now therefore what is your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? I demand a Damoſell, quoth hee, which a Knight tooke from mee this laſt night paſt, while I ſlept by the riuers ſide not farre hence, and hither hee brought her againſt her will. I pray ye Sir, ſaid the Lady to ſit downe and reſt ye: in meane while I will ſend for the Knight who ſhall anſwere ye. Then ſate they downe together, and ſhe proceeded on this manner. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate yee Sir to reſolue me, if you knowe a Knight that is named <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis?</hi> Why aske ye Lady? quoth hee. Becauſe, replyed ſhee, all the guard you found in this Caſtle was appointed for him, and aſſure your ſelfe if hee entred heere, hee neuer ſhould depart hence againe, if firſt hee denyed not a promiſe that he made. What was it? anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis.</hi> I wil tel ye Sir, ſaid ſhe on this condition, that with your vttermoſt indeauor you will cauſe him to acquite it, either by Armes or otherwiſe, by reaſon hee hath not done it iuſtly. In ſooth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, quoth hee, if <hi>Amadis,</hi> hath promiſed any thing wherein hee is to bee touched, I will (if I can) cauſe him to diſcharge it. Shee who vnderſtood not to what ende hee thus ſpake, anſwered as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. I heartily thank ye Sir, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnderſtand that <hi>Amadis</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Angriote d'Eſtrau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Now truſt mee Madame, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prince, you ſay right well I will endeauour to make him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite you.

But Madame, ſaide hee, are you ſhee whom <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griote</hi> loueth ſo? Yea truely, quoth ſhee. I know him very well anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> that hee is one of the beſt Knights in the world, and me thinkes there is no Lady or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman ſo rich or faire, but might thinke herſelfe happy and fortunate to haue ſuch a Knight as he.

Let vs ſee then, ſaide the Knight, which of vs ſhall haue her. This man of whom we ſpeake, was Vncle germaine to <hi>Angriotes</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, named <hi>Gaſinan,</hi> ſhee louing and honouring him aboue all her other kinred: for hee was the beſt Knight of his race, wiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete, ſo that ſhee was altogether gouerned by his counſell.

I know not quoth ſhee, what you imagine of him, but I repute him one of the beſt in the worlde: otherwiſe hee could not haue entered heere by ſtrength of Armes as hee did. Say you ſo? replyed <hi>Gaſinan,</hi> you praiſe him ouer much, for paſſing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended gates, when men of ſuch mean account had them in charge.

And ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his courſe thither, hee found there fiue theeues well armed with Croſlets and Hatchets, who vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainouſly would force a Damoſell: one of them dradging her by the hayre of the head in a ſtraite way on the mountaine, and the other beating her forwarde with great ſtaues, <hi>Balays</hi> ſeeing them vilely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe her, entred among them ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Trayterous murderers, dare you ſo boldly lay holde on a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell? let her alone, elſe ſhall you die according to your deſerts.

the other foure would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge their companions death, &amp; altogether inuironed <hi>Balays</hi> with ſuch ſharp aſſaults, as one of them ſmote downe his horſe vnder him: yet <hi>Balays</hi> diſmayed nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, but beeing couragiouſly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, quickely recouered footing, and drawing his ſworde, layde ſo fiercely about him, that another of them fell downe headleſſe at his feet. In briefe, two more of them accompanied their fellowes in like fortune, when the laſt ſeeing hee could not preuent like doome, fell on his knees before <hi>Balays,</hi> ſaying. Good my Lord haue compaſſion on me, for if I die in this wicked life I haue ſo long vſed, vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly both body and ſoule will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh together. Since thou doeſt, anſwered <hi>Balays,</hi> ſo willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thy fault, thy life I giue thee, to the ende thy repentance hereafter may make amends for al: &amp; faithfully hee kept promiſe with <hi>Balays,</hi> for ſoone after he became a religious Hermit, ſpending the reſt of his dayes in great deuotion.</p>
                  <p>But now returneth <hi>Balays</hi> to the Damoſell, who being not a little glad ſhe was ſo happily deliuered, gaue him thankes for the ſuccour ſhee found in ſuch neceſſity, and hee requeſting to know how ſhee happened into this daunger, ſhee thus begun. Hauing occaſion (Sir) to trauell in theſe parts, in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way on the mountaine they ſtaied mee, it beeing the common place for their theeuiſh aſſaults: and after they had ſlaine my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, they brought mee into this place, all of them ſwearing to force me one after another, but God and you haue graciouſly deliuered me. Her modeſt behauiour in ſpeech and comely beauty, made <hi>Balays</hi> to waxe ſomewhat enamoured, which made him thus to interrupt her. In ſooth faire Damoſell, I perceiue they haue dealt with ye vngently, for they were very loath to parte with yee: but ſeeing fortune hath allowed ſuch a conuenient mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, euen where wee may lay a foundation of loue, let me requeſt this fauourable kindneſſe, that wee may not loſe ſo good an oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I know not Sir, quoth ſhee, how you are minded, but had they compelled mee to their laſciuious deſires, both God and the worlde might holde mee excuſed: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwife, if I ſhould willingly grant you ſuch an vnhonourable requeſt, what excuſe might then ſerue either you or me? Hitherto you haue ſhewed your ſelfe a well diſpoſed knight, let mee intreate yee to accompany chiualrie, with continence and vertue, as by duty you are bound. When <hi>Balays</hi> heard her anſwere ſo ſoberly, hee repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that hee had offered her ſuch vndecent wordes, ſaying. With reaſon (faire virgin) you haue ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied mee, yet pardon me for attempting ſo bad a ſuite: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it is no leſſe ſeemely for knights to moue Ladies with loue, then for them modeſtly to deny as you haue done. And albeit at the firſt we imagine it a great conqueſt, to obtayne of them what we moſt deſire: yet when wiſely and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetely they reſiſt our inordinate appetites, keeping the thing (without which) they are worthy no praiſe: they bee euen of our ſelues more reuerenced and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. This is the cauſe, quoth ſhe, why I more eſteeme your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to mine honour then my life, becauſe the difference betweene the is farre inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable. Well, ſaid <hi>Balays,</hi> what will you now I ſhall do for you? Let vs leaue theſe dead

carcaſſes, replyed the Damoſell, and goe where wee may ſtay till day light. I like your counſell, anſwered <hi>Balays,</hi> if I had another horſe, but being now deſtitute, I know not what to doe. We will ride on my horſe, ſaide the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, till wee finde further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: ſo he mounting vp before the Damoſell, they rode till they came to a pleaſant meddow, where they reſted themſelues till Sunne riſing, and then they went to horſe backe againe. Now becauſe <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> intended to ſeeke the knight, who cauſed <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe to eſcape away from him, hee asked the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell what ſhould become of her. My Lord, quoth ſhee, not farre hence is a houſe, whither when you haue brought mee, you may depart to what place you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>As thus they rode communing together, he ſawe a knight come towarde him, carrying his legge on his horſes necke, but drawing neerer, he put foote in ſtirrop, couching his Launce againſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> and running at him, threwe him and the Damoſell both from the horſe, afterward he vſed theſe ſpeeches. In ſooth Lady, I am ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for your fall, but to amend the wrong I haue done ye, I will bring yee where you ſhall be contented, becauſe he that hath the charge of you, is vnworthy to haue ſo faire a creature in his cuſtody. Ere this had <hi>Balays</hi> recouered himſelfe, and knowing him to bee the knight he ſought for, hee drew his ſworde ſaying. By thee villaine haue I loſt my horſe, and my companion thou haſt in like ſorte abuſed, now fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mee vnprouided, thou takeſt delight in offering me wrong: but both for him and my ſelfe will I be reuenged on thee, elſe let mee be thought vnworthy of my order. What? quoth the knight, art thou one of them that mocked mee as I rid in the darke? I hope now I haue put the mockerie on thee. Heereupon they preſently fell to combate, and many ſharpe blowes were giuen on either ſide, till <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays</hi> at length faſtning holde on his enemy, got him vnder foot, when renting his helmet from his head, hee tooke his life as ranſome for his villany: and breaking his ſword in peeces, layd them by him, then mounting on his horſe, and the Damoſell on her owne, they tooke their way toward the tree where he left <hi>Galaor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe their ſtomacks well ſerued them to meat, they alighted at a little Lodge, where dwelt two women of auſtere and holy life, who beſtowed on them ſuch cheer as they had: the Damoſell acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with all her mishap, and how <hi>Balays</hi> deliuered her from the theeues, at what time they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to diſhonor her hauing ſlaine her ſeruants, and ſhee deſtitute of helpe, whereof the holy women were very glad, by reaſon thoſe theeues did much harme in that countrey. After they had refreſhed themſelues, <hi>Balays</hi> and the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell took their leaue, and comming to the tree, met <hi>Amadis</hi> there new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned from his enterpriſe: wherefore they concluded no more to ſunder themſelues, vntill they arriued at King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court. By this time the night drew on apace, whereupon the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell earneſtly intreated them, to lodge that night at her Fathers which was not farre off: they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well of her friendly offer, wene with her, beeing there entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vſed very honourably.

                  <p>When the King had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereon with them of his blood, as alſo diuers other knights and auncient Gentlemen: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that within one moneth (all excuſes ſet apart) the Duke ſhould come in perſon to anſwere <hi>Oliuas,</hi> and if with two knights more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide himſelfe hee would iuſtifie his cauſe, <hi>Oliuas</hi> ſhould likewiſe prepare two other knights. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hereof was preſently ſent to the Duke, and open Proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation made the ſame day: that all Gentlemen following Armes, ſhould bee ready at the Citty of <hi>London,</hi> on the day of our Lady following in September. Like ſummons was ſent abroade by the Queene, to aduertiſe the Ladies and Gentlewomen of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, by which meanes great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorte came to the Court, where all kindes of paſtimes and ſporres were inuented: without reſpect of fortunes malice any way, who commonly in great aſſemblie of ſtates, when leaſt they thinke of her variable changings, often tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, that men purpoſe, but ſhe will diſpoſe.</p>
                  <p>All this royall company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ioy and pleaſure, a Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſtrangely attryred entered the Pallace, and a Gentleman that bare her company, demanding where the King was: whereof being reſolued by his Maieſty him-ſelfe, the Damoſell thus ſpake. In ſooth (my Lord) well do you ſeem a King by your porte and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet may it bee doubted what your heart is. Damoſell, quoth the King, you muſt iudge of what you ſee, and hereafter knowe the reſt when you haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to prooue.

day to try the matter I doubted. Neuertheleſſe I will deferre it till the feaſt of September, becauſe I heare you will then keepe Court at <hi>London,</hi> where muſt bee aſſembled many valiant men, who ſhll know by the promiſe you haue made me, how worthy you are to gouerne ſuch a noble Realme, and how highly Chiualry is honoured by you. Damoſell, ſayde the King, ſo much as effects may better my wordes, ſo much the more will it glad me, to ſee good ſtore of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knights there preſent. My Lord, quoth ſhee, if effects anſwere your wordes, I ſhall haue great reaſon to bee contented. So tooke ſhee leaue of him, returning the ſame way ſhee came, whereat euery one was much abaſhed, and diſpleaſed with the Kings raſh promiſe, not knowing any reaſon for it: and now they began to miſdoubt, that the enterpriſe of this woman would bring the Kings perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome danger. But his heart was ſo addicted to magnanimity, as (whatſoeuer happened) hee would not be reprooued with cowardice: and ſo dearely did his ſubiects loue him, that they rather deſired a thouſand deaths, then to ſee him ſuffer any mishap or iniury. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lords and Barons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him, (greatly fearing ſome threatned inconuerience) to alter the promiſe, hee had ſo lightly made: ſhewing it was not beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his Maieſty, to deale with ffaires of knights and Gentlemen, he being placed in authoritie ouer them.</p>
                  <p>While they ſtood on theſe tearmes, there entred three knights, two of them being very well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the third hauing on no Armour at all, for hee was a man of ancient yeares, as ſeemed by his white head: yet in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance appeared a more cheerefull colour, then commonly hath been noted in a man of age, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was of tall and comely ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This knight carryed in his armes a very coſtly Cofer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding for the King, the Gentle-men ſhewed where hee ſate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him way to his Maieſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom hee fell on his knees, thus ſpeaking. God bleſſe ſo good a Prince as is king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> for within theſe few dayes, hee hath made the moſt worthy promiſe, that euer King did, if he intend to keepe it. Beleeue me knight, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King, I neuer promiſed ought, but it was in my power, &amp; and therefore the eaſier to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: but I would faine knowe your meaning heerein. I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Sir, quoth the knight, that you intend to maintaine chiualrie in the very higheſt honour, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein (now a dayes) fewe Princes delight, therefore are you to bee commended aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Heerein you were tolde truth, ſayde the King, and you may bee well aſſured, that I will doe my vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt to aduance the cauſe of vertue, while I liue. Long may you continue in this minde reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the knight, and becauſe I haue likewiſe heard, how you haue ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the Princes and Lords of your countrie, to be ready at your Court the next feaſt of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: I haue brought you heere a thing with mee, which ſuch a king as you are ought moſt royally to receiue. Then opening the Cofer, hee took forth a Crowne of gold, ſo ſumtuouſly embeliſhed with Orientall Pearles, and pretious ſtones, as neuer was ſeene a more coſtlier Iewell: euery one being
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7181:93"/>
of the minde, that it was to impale the head of ſome eſpeciall mighty Lord.</p>
                  <p>When the king had long and earneſtly beheld it, he was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to haue it, at what price ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, which the knight perceiuing, ſaide. This Crowne my Lord is of ſuch workemanſhip, as no ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weller in the world can make the like, and beſide, the vnualuable riches thereof, it hath a vertue highly to be eſteemed: for the king that keepeth it in his power, ſhall encreaſe in all felicitie and honor. So will it happen to the king who muſt enioy it while he liueth, and long time haue I kept it, no king but you that euer ſaw it: but if you like it ſo well, I will make ye a preſent thereof, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, you helpe to ſaue my head, which I am in ſome danger to loſe. All this while was the Queene in place, earneſtly wiſhing that the king her husband might haue it, where-upon ſhe ſaide to the king. Me-thinkes (my Lord) it would full well become your Maieſtie, if you may haue it at ſo eaſie a rate as he demandeth. Madame, quoth the knight, I haue a better thing for you if you pleaſe to buy it, it is this mantle, the richeſt and faireſt that euer was ſeene: for beſide, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones wherewith it is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, it is imbroydred with all ſorts of beaſts and birds, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath giuen life to. On my faith, anſwered the Queene, it is a moſt rate and curious piece of worke, not wrought (as I thinke) by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine capacity. You ſay true, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, replied the knight, for the like hereof is not to bee found, yet may not the riches compare with the property, and great vertue of this mantle, which is ſuch, as it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belongeth to maried Ladies, then any other: becauſe ſhee that weareth it, ſhall neuer be offended with her husband. A vertue of cheef regard, anſwered the Queen, if it haue any ſuch indeede? I haue tolde ye true, Madame, quoth the knight, if you will buy it, you may proue. Now grew ſhe maruailous deſirous of it, what-ſoeuer price ſhould be paide for it, eſpecially to conſerue peace and loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the king and her, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſayde to the knight: Say Sir, how do you eſtimate this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and the Crowne? My Lord, quoth he, and you good Madame, I beſeech you to vnderſtand my fortune. I am but lately eſcaped the hands of him, who long time kept me priſoner on a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is no little cauſe of griefe to me, for I am out of all hope to finde remedy while I liue: and becauſe I know not well the valew of theſe iewels, I will leaue them in your coſtody; vntill the day you holde open Court at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where you ſhall deliuer them againe to me, or giue ſo much for them as I then demand. In meane while you may make triall of them if you pleaſe, for hauing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented what I haue ſayd, you may the more willingly pay well for them. Now truſt me, ſayd the king, ſeeing you repoſe ſuch confidence in mee, aſſure your ſelfe to haue whatſoeuer you requeſt, or elſe they ſhall bee reſtored againe. It ſuffiſeth, quoth the knight, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Lords, he thus procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Worthy Lords, you haue all heard what the king hath promiſed me, that he will reſtore the mantle &amp; the crown, which I leaue in your preſence, or giue me whatſoeuer I ſhall dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. So much his Maieſty hath ſaid, replied the Lords, &amp; we are witneſſes thereof. Adiew then,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7181:94"/>
anſwered the ancient Knight, for perforce I muſt returne to the moſt cruell priſon, that euer poore Knight was encloſed in. But here you muſt note, how during the time of this conference, the two armed Knights, which conducted the old man, was ſtill in preſence, the one of them hauing the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of his helmet open, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a young man, the other held downe his head as loth to bee knowne, being of ſo tall and mighty ſtature, as no Knight in the Kings Court might bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled with him.

Beſide, ech one reioyced to ſee <hi>Amadis,</hi> who by the falſe report of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> was thought to be dead: and graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did the King entertain them all, conducting them to a chamber where they were vnarmed, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the vilanous inuention of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> and the Damoſell that cauſed their Combat together, practiſing the death of two ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Princes, who were but euen now in the prime and flower of their youth. Right ſoone did the King aduertiſe the Queene of their arriuall, when accompanied with <hi>Agraies, Galuanes</hi> and King <hi>Arban,</hi> he went with them among the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: but <hi>Amadis</hi> caſting his eye on <hi>Oriana,</hi> and ſhe on him, I leaue their ioyfull paſſions to your iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, remembring that when long abſent louers meete, lookes, ſighs, and teares are familiarly entercour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, being the only meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ech others heart. Yet <hi>Amadis</hi> thought it not beſt to ſtand ſtill thus muſing, left euerie eye ſhould grow cunning in coniecturing the cauſe: which to auoide, he fell on his knee before the Queen, ſaying. Madam, according to your charge at my departure from the Court, I haue brought this Knight, whom I preſent as onelie yours. I thanke ye Sir <hi>Amadis,</hi> quoth the Queene, both he and you are welcome to our preſence. In good faith Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid the King, you doe me wrong if you take them both: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> alreadie is yours, me thinks you ſhould be content with him, and leaue Lord <hi>Galaor</hi> for mee. You aske no ſmall matter, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Queene, but if he be ſo pleaſed, I am not againſt it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſuch a preſent was neuer giuen in great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſeeing you are the beſt King that euer raigned here, ſo good a Knight is well beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on you. But what ſay you Lord <hi>Galaor?</hi> the King is deſirous to haue you, will ve then be his?
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7181:94"/>
Madame, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> me thinks that any thing ſo great a prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, ſhould be granted if it were poſſible: here am I to obey you in euery reſpect, ſo pleaſe my Lord and brother to like thereof, becauſe he hath greateſt authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ouer me. It contents me very well, ſaid the Queene, that you ſhould doe as your brother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,, for through him ſhall I haue title in you, by reaſon he is mine. I am yours indeede Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you muſt be my fellow ſeruant to the Queene. With all my heart replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> I am content, and ſeeing you haue giuen mee to her ſeruice, for euer I ſhall remaine at her diſpoſition. I thanke you ſir, quoth the Queene, now may I boldly giue you to the King, for I ſee he would be glad of ſo good a friend: then ſtepping to the King, ſhe ſaid. My Lord you are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of this knight, I giue him you, on this condition, that you loue and intreate him according to his deſerts, which may not be valued at any meane rate. Beleeue me Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered the King, I take this gift moſt kindely at your hand, aſſuring you, he ſhall ſoone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how I loue and eſteeme him: nor can I be ſo affectionate to him, as he hath noble vertues whereby to induce me, which none can va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue or compare withall. But if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> durſt haue ſpoken, he glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie would haue maintained the contrary, for he perſwaded him-ſelfe, that he loued his <hi>Oriana,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his brothers deſert, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatſoeuer. So remained <hi>Galaor</hi> in the Kings ſeruice, from which he could not be ſeparated, for any quarrell concerning <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> as wee ſhall haue occaſion to declare hereafter.</p>
                  <p>All this while <hi>Oriana Mabila,</hi> &amp; <hi>Oliuia,</hi> had withdrawne themſelues from the other Ladies, likewiſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> were talking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when <hi>Galaor</hi> was thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly entertained by the King and Queene: wherefore <hi>Mabila</hi> called her brother, ſaying. I pray ye cauſe the knight to come hither that ſtandeth with you conferring, becauſe we are deſirous to ſee him. <hi>Agraies</hi> returned where he left <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> who diſſembled as if hee thought not on the Ladies, till the Prince thus ſpake: My Lord, theſe Gentlewomen would faine ſpeake with you, and deſire you to come a little more neere them: which he preſentlie did. But <hi>Mabila</hi> being wiſe and diſcreete, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>gnorant what medicines ſhould be applied to paſſionate mindes: after they all three had ſaluted them, <hi>Mabila</hi> took <hi>Amadis</hi> by the hand, deſiring him to ſit between <hi>Oriana</hi> and her, leauing <hi>Agraies</hi> to court his <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia:</hi> they being ſet, ſhe merily thus began. Although I am now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe foure friends, whom I haue moſt cauſe to loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: yet haue I ſuch preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe elſe-where, as I muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity leaue you a while. Thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed ſhe bring the louers together and by a pretty wile gaue them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, to content their thoughts with ſecret communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now beginneth <hi>Amadis</hi> to confer with his Ladie, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to declare the great affection, which vnder good hope gaue him life and eſſence: extreme loue took him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the facultie of ſpeech, yet his eyes not vnmindfull of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, ſupplied the defect of the tongue, deliuering teſtimony to their diuine obiect, how farre the ſad and languiſhing heart was
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7181:95"/>
tranſported by eaſe and pleaſure. Which <hi>Oriana</hi> perceiuing, ſhe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly tooke his hand vnder her mantle, and wringing him by the fingers ſighing thus ſpake. My lord and friend, what dolour and griefe did the traytor procure in me, who brought hither tidings of your death? neuer was poore maiden in greater perill, and not without cauſe: for neuer did woman ſuſtain ſuch a loſſe, as I ſhould haue done in looſing you. And as I am better loued then any other, ſo hath my fortune graciouſly fauoured mee, that it ſhould be by him who is of higher deſert then any other. Here-with <hi>Amadis</hi> caſt downe his lookes as baſhfull to heare himſelf ſo prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by her to whom all commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was due<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and feeling his ſpirits altered, ſtroue to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, but the words died in his mouth, which cauſed <hi>Oriana</hi> thus to proceede. How can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe my Lord, but I muſt needes loue you aboue all other, when they that neuer ſaw you, do highly loue, honor, and eſteeme you? and I being ſhee whom you affect moſt deerely, haue I not great reaſon to loue you better then my ſelfe? On my faith Madam, anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> your ſweete and gentle words, are ſufficient to make mee die a thouſand deaths, &amp; as many times to reuiue me againe: but how? I pray you at this time onely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my extremity with pitty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during worſe then death by louing you too vehemently: for if I had died as <hi>Arcalaus</hi> reported, euen then had begun my reſt and quiet, if I had not known you before. And albeit the houre of your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is my intire felicity, yet am I aſſaulted with ſuch violent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as my heart would altogether conſume in griefe, without the pleaſure it receiueth in doing you ſeruice, and the good it ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by your remembrance of me. But neceſſity conſtraineth me, to craue the mercy as yet vndeſerued, by ſuch intreatance as no deſert may value, onely to increaſe my hability in ſeruing you, which if you grant me not, a ſudden and cruell death will take hold on me. Theſe words were accompanied with ſuch aboundance of teares, as was no ſmall griefe to her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. Alas my Lord, quoth ſhe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare theſe often repetitions of your death, the thought thereof is inſupportable to mee, for ſhould you die, I were vnable to liue one houre after: conſidering all the pleaſure I haue in this world, is in the ioy of your health and welfare. Nor can I but be aſſured of your words, by reaſon mine owne caſe is ſufficient therein, being copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with you in euery torment: but if yours ſeeme more violent, this is the reaſon, my will being equall with yours, wanteth the ſtrength you haue in ſuffering, &amp; cannot ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the deſire of our hearts, which vrgeth loue and griefe more in you then me, albeit my ſhare is not one iote the leſſe. But this I promiſe you on my faith, if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or our owne endeauour, can compaſſe no meane to yeelde vs content, my ſelfe will ſearch ſome way whatſoeuer happen, bee it hate of Father, Mother, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; Friends: for we may not thus procraſtinate our ioy, and groane vnder the weighty burden of deſire the flame whereof climeth ſo high, as the martyrdome of our hearts may eaſily bee diſcouered. No doubt theſe wordes were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to <hi>Amadis,</hi> and gaue ſuch cheerefull life to his hope, that hee was rauiſhed with inwarde
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7181:95"/>
conceit thereof: when ſhee ſeeing him mute, trode vpon his foote, ſaying. Diſcomfort not your ſelfe my Lord, for I will not fayle what I haue promiſed, nor ſhall you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part till you perceiue it: and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will the King hold open Court, when both he and the Queen muſt depend on your aſſiſtance, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well that your preſence ſhall honour the company.</p>
                  <p>As they would haue continued in longer talke, the Queene called <hi>Amadis,</hi> cauſing him to ſit downe by <hi>Galaor,</hi> for the King was gone to his chamber. Then began the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to cenſure on the brethren, but they reſembled each other ſo like, as little difference could bee diſcerned betweene them: euery one being of the opinion, that theſe twayne were the moſt perfect amongſt all Knights, both in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nobleneſſe, bounty, and good grace: but <hi>Galaor</hi> was ſomewhat whiter in complexion, and <hi>Amadis</hi> of bigger bone, his locks more criſpt and faire, and hauing a little more red in his face then <hi>Galaor</hi> had. Soone after, the Queene wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Galaor</hi> to go ſee her daughter and the other Ladies, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the excellent beaury of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> imagined ſuch another was not to be found in the world, and by her often ſighing with alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of colour, he ſuſpected her to be the onely cauſe, that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liked ſo well to ſtay in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court. Right courteouſly was hee welcommed among the Ladies, and diuerſe familiar ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches paſſed betweene them: till the King being ſet to meate, ſent for <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Galaor</hi> to beare him company, as alſo <hi>Agraies</hi> and his vnckle <hi>Galuanes.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this book it hath been declared, how the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine bountie calling <hi>Liſuart</hi> to the Realme of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſoone after of a diſinherited Prince, made him the peaceable King of ſuch a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, by the death of his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Falaugris,</hi> who dyed without any heire of his body begotten. Likewiſe how he was reputed ſuch a great Lord through the world, as many Knights came from ſtrange Countries to ſerue him, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues happy, except they might bee named Knights of his Court. But within a while after, whether this fortunate king forgot the author of his good, or elſe it happened by diuine permiſſion: this happy Realme fell into perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and the illuſtrous ſtate of King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was troubled and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, that all men might know: how he onely is Lord and King of all liuing creatures, who exalteth and abaſeth when him pleaſeth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you ſhall here vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.

                     </gap>ie, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to maintaiue with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour might be deuiſed. But in the ſelfe-ſame place, where he thought the greater part of the world ſhould yelde him obeyſance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the firſt mutabilities of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, bringing his eſtate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in danger of vtter ruine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as you ſhall vnderſtand at large.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Liſuart</hi> departing with all his traine from <hi>Windſore,</hi> to keepe his Court at the famous Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> it was wonderfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the Lords, Ladies, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen that gaue their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, eſpecially ſo many young Gentlewomen beeing there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: ſome to regard the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeuce of the Court, other to do ſeruice to their louely miſtreſſes, and nothing now generally min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but paſtime and pleaſure. The King likewiſt (for greater maieſtie of his Court) ordained that none of this aſſembly ſhould lodge in the Cittie, but to erect their Pauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in the fields and meddowes, along the banckes that hemmed in the faire riuer of Thames, leaſt the extreame heate might be hurtfull to them: all which being done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appointment, the fields ſeemed as a moſt royall Camp, or as if the greater part of the world were there aſſembled. But becauſe the king arriued there two or three daies before the feaſt, he went to his Pallace, accompanied onely with his Queene, <hi>Amadis, Galaor, Agraies, Don Galuanes,</hi> and certaine other his moſt fauoured: the reſt kept themſelues in their tents, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the herbingers had in quarters limited them. With ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts of paſtimes was the King entertained, which continued till fortune (enuying his felicitie) changed them into griefe &amp; tears: by the meanes of a Lord, no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the King, but his nerrer neighbour then friend, named <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinan,</hi> a man opulent in riches, and endued with few vertues, as may be gathered by the matter enſuing.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Barſinan</hi> was Lord of a Countrey, called <hi>Sanſuegua,</hi> and very familiar with <hi>Arcalans</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, who not long before came to him, and conferred with him in this manner. My Lord, quoth hee, the great deſire I haue to doe you ſeruice, hath made me inuent the meane (if you like thereof) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer in ſhort time the Realme of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> quietly into your hands, without much hazarding your perſon, or any great expence. When <hi>Barſinan</hi> (who was a very ambitious man) heard the wordes of <hi>Asculaus,</hi> who promiſed to make him King if he would: he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. In good faith, my deere friend <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> if thou canſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the thing thou vaunteſt of, no feare ſhall hinder me to hazard my perſon, much leſſe will I reckon of expence, if I ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny likely-hood in the compaſſing. It is a thing, ſaide <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> very eaſie to bee done, and preſently ſhall you vnderſtand by what meanes: prouided, that you ſweare to me, after you are ſeated in the regiment, to make me ſuper-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and cheefe maiſter of your houſe-holde. That will I, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Barſiinan,</hi> with any thing elſe thou ſhalt deſire. Marke then the platforme, quoth <hi>Arcalaus.</hi> You know how King <hi>Liſnart</hi> hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly publiſhed, this feaſt of ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember to holde open Court, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you muſt goe well accompai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with knights, then ſhall I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter in ſuch ſort, that I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7181:96"/>
will carry away the King priſoner, no man aliue being able to ſuccour him: in like manner will I carry thence his Daughter, whom you ſhall take to wife, and afterward will I ſend ye the Kings head. Thus in reſpect the Princeſſe is right heire to the Crowne, and you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying her in Mariage, being well accompanied with Knights as I tolde ye: eaſily may you make ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure on the Realme, nor ſhall you finde any to ſpeake againſt it. In ſooth, anſwered <hi>Barſinan,</hi> if ſuch an enterpriſe might ſort to effect, I would make thee more rich and mighty then euer were any of thy linage, as alſo the chiefe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander my houſe. It ſufficeth ſaid <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> your ſelfe ſhall ſoone perceiue that ſeldom I enterprize any thing but it comes to paſſe: then faile not to bee preſent in the aſſembly at <hi>London.</hi> So came the traytour <hi>Barſinan</hi> to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> feighning his intent to do him honor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King ſent many of his knights, entertaining him as a moſt noble friend, appointing his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all things elſe neceſſary for him, and being with the King in his pallace, he entred into theſe ſpeeches. My Lord, vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what royall magnificence you meane to keepe in your Court, as alſo the good Knights and braue men were here to be ſeene, this day I intended to honour you with my perſon: not as your vaſſaile or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, holding my Countrey of God and by the Sword, but as your good neighbour and friend, if you pleaſe. Truſt me, quoth the King, you do me very great pleaſure and honour, and I thanke you for this gentle paines, that you would bee ſeene in ſo good company: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you Lord <hi>Barſinan</hi> and my friend, this courteſie ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in what I may, for I make very eſpeciall account of you. Your Maieſty dealeth very kindely with me, replied <hi>Barſinan,</hi> and I proteſt on my faith, to bee ready in councelling your affaires for the beſt, according as I haue a long time deſired. See how the traytor lied in euery word, but the good king miſdoubting nothing, requited his offer with many thankes, and to do him the greater honour, appointed his lodging in his owne Palace, himſelfe and his Queene going forth of the Citty with their Tents and Pauilions, immagining he could not do too much for the traitour. And firſt he acquainted him with the whole enterprize, and wherefore he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this great aſſembly, declaring the names &amp; Sir names of the beſt commended Knights, their haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proweſſe and reſolutions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom hee forgot not <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Galaor,</hi> whoſe hardines was impoſſible to be equalled, they two being accompliſhed with all the vertues required in Chiualrie. When the king was withdrawn to his Tents, and <hi>Barſinan</hi> to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, he began to conſider on the ſtrength of his Maieſty, as alſo the loue and obeyſance ſo many great Princes ſhewed him: which made him vnable to enioy any reſt, and often times he repented his fooliſh enterprize, ſeeing how hard it would proue in execution.</p>
                  <p>Now he minded to alter his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, when ſodainely ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion entred his braine, ſo that wauering vp and downe in his thoughts, he could not reſolue one any certainety. On the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he came to the King, who was now clothed in his royall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe it was the firſt day of open Court: and he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7181:97"/>
one to goe to the Queeene, willing her to ſend him the Crown he had of the Knight, and ſhee to clothe her ſelfe in the ſumptuous mantle. Hereupon ſhe preſently ſent for the Cofer, and opening it, found nothing therein, whereat ſhe was greatly amazed, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhee truſted no body with the key thereof, but her owne ſelfe, and euermore carried it about her. But knowing not how to remedie this miſhap, ſhee acquainted the King therewith, who in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure came to her, ſaying. I meruaile Madam you haue kept ſo badly, the lewel which would haue ſo greatly honoured this time, conſidering vnder what condition it was left with vs. On my faith my Lord, quoth ſhe, I know not what to ſay, I found the Cofer faſt lockt, and none but my ſelfe hath kept the key of it. But in a dreame this laſt night, me thought a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell willed mee to ſhew it her, which I did: afterward ſhe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the key, and I gaue it her, when opening the Coffer, ſhee tooke forth the Mantle and the Crowne, locking it againe, and laying the key where I tooke it. This done, ſhe put the Mantle about her, and the Crowne on her head, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming her ſo well, as I receiued great pleaſure in beholding her, and thus ſhe ſpake. That her ſelfe, or ſhe from whom ſhe came, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fiue dayes, ſhould rule in the Countrie of a mighty King, who at this time laboured to defend it, and to conquer it from other. Hereupon I demanded what ſhee was, and ſhe anſwered: You ſhall know at the time I haue ſpoken of. So ſhe vaniſhed from me with the Crowne and the Mantle: but on my faith I know not if this viſion came to me ſleeping, or whether it be of truth. The King was now in greater meruaile then before, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her to diſſemble the matter, and not to reueale it to any body: then taking her by the hand, they left the chamber, comming among the knights and Ladies in the place appointed for the ceremonies of the Day, where ſitting down in the 2. chayres of ſtate, the King called his Knights about him, and the Queene her Ladies, with whom ſhe communed. Now had his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty giuen order, that neereſt his perſon ſhould be <hi>Amadis, Galaor, Agraies</hi> and <hi>Don Galuanes,</hi> and at his back King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Norwales,</hi> well armed, holding his Sword ready drawne, and two hundred Knights for his guard, then by a Herald hee commanded ſilence. But as the King began to ſpeake, there entred a moſt beautifull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vere richly attired, and with her twelue other Damoſells in like brauery: for in thoſe dayes, the great Lords and Ladies were wont to bring their people to ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, clothed according to their owne perſons, without any difference at all betweene them: this fayre Lady adreſſed her ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the King, deliuering them in forme following. My Lord, moſt humbly I beſeech you to grant me audience, and giue mee reaſon in a matter of difference, which I haue againſt the Knight that ſtandeth by your Maieſty, meaning <hi>Amadis.</hi> Long time haue I beene requeſted by <hi>Angriot d'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrauaus</hi> to be his wife, who I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured is in this royall preſence: hereto ſhe added how euery thing happened, the cauſe why hee kept the vale of the Pines, and how <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> trauailing that way, made him perforce to abandon Armes. Neuer theleſſe, quoth ſhe, they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7181:97"/>
departed friends, and <hi>Amadis</hi> ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely promiſed <hi>Angriote,</hi> that he ſhould enioy me as his Wife: whereof when I attained knowledg, I withdrew my ſelfe to a Caſtle of mine, where I kept ſuch a ſtrong guarde and cuſtome, as it was thought impoſſible for any ſtrange knight to enter there, without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: but that knight comming thither, vanquiſhed my guardants, and hath vtterly aboliſhed the drift I intended. Yet afterward of his owne good will he promiſed mee, to cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> recall his offer to <hi>Angriote:</hi> then chanced an vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py combat betweene him and this knight mine Vnckle, who being at the lateſt extremitie of his life, at my requeſt he was ſpared, on this condition: that on the firſt day your Maieſty held open Court, I ſhould here preſent my ſelfe, to grant a requeſt he muſt demand of me. To ſatisfie my promiſe I am come hither, and deſire to know what he will command me: At which words <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtepped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſaying. My Lord, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath told ye nothing but truth, concerning the ſeuerall promiſes at the Combats: therefore am I ready here to accompliſh, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> ſhall call back his word to <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

On my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, quoth ſhee, if you effect what you haue ſaid, you pleaſure me more then you can imagine: and to let you know I am ready to fulfill my offer, demand what you pleaſe, for if it be in my power you ſhall preuaile. I requeſt nothing elſe anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> but that you would accept <hi>Angriote</hi> as your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he louing you ſo deerely as he doth. Out alas, cryed the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what maner of demand is this? I wiſh Madame ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> that you would marry with ſuch a one, as is well worthy to haue ſo faire a Lady. In ſooth knight, quoth ſhee, this is not according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you made me. I promiſed nothing, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> but I will performe it: for if I ſtand bound to you, to cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> diſcharge his word to <hi>Angriote,</hi> herein I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it. I am <hi>Amadis,</hi> and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the promiſe I made him, wherein you muſt needes confeſſe your ſelfe ſatisfyed: hee gladly would enioy you as his Wife, and I ioyne with him in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, thus ſtand I free diſcharged to you both. May it be poſſible? quoth ſhe, that you are the man ſo highly renouned? Credit me Lady, anſwered the King, this is <hi>Amadis.</hi> Ah wretch that I am, ſaid ſhe, now do I wel perceiue, that art not cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can preuent what God hath appointed, for I haue done my vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt to eſcape <hi>Angriote,</hi> not onely for the euill I wiſh him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining his good and vertuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts: but carying this reſolution, that keeping my ſelfe chaſt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, I would not bring my liberty into ſubiection: and now when I thought to be furtheſt from him, I am come neerer then euer I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                  <p>Lady, quoth the King, you haue great occaſion to reioyce, for you being faire and rich, he is a yong and braue diſpoſed knight: as you are rich in goods and poſſeſſions, euen ſo is he in bounty and vertue, not onely in deedes of Armes, but in all other good qualities beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a knight, therefore your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage together is very requiſite, and I thinke all in this preſence are of mine opinion: heereupon, ſhee ſtepped to the Queene, ſaying. Madam, you are eſteemed one of the moſt vertuous Princeſſes in the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7181:98"/>
world, moſt humbly I deſire your councell what I ſhall do.</p>
                  <p>Faire friend, anſwered the Queene, according to the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Angrtote</hi> had gotten among the good, he well deſerueth, not onely to bee aboundant in riches, but to bee loued of any Lady he ſhall chuſe.</p>
                  <p>Why Lady? ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> think you not that by accident or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, my promiſe was made to <hi>Angriote,</hi> for had he compelled me to one of theſe twaine, then might you well haue condemned mee of folly: but making tryall of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and hardineſſe, yea, to mine owne coſt I dare aſſure ye, and knowing likewiſe his earneſt loue to you: me thinkes the iuſtice of the cauſe commands, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my ſelfe, but all ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, ought to labor in ſeeking remedy for you both: in him, the extreame paſſions hee endureth through your loue, in you, by making his reſtleſſe griefes known to you.</p>
                  <p>Now truſt me Sir, quoth ſhee, ſuch prayſe haue I heard of your v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to euery one, as I imagine you would not ſay (before ſuch an aſſembly) otherwiſe then truth: wherefore following your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, as alſo the pleaſure of the King and Queene, I will forget my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtubborne opinion, and am ready to accompliſh what you ſhall command mee. Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> taking her by the hand, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Angriote,</hi> and preſenting him his loue, ſaid: Sir <hi>Angriote,</hi> I promiſed to do my vttermoſt in this matter, ſay now, is this the Lady you would haue? Euen ſhe quoth <hi>Angriote,</hi> is the life and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of my Soule, and I am deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to none but her. Then here I giue her you, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> on this condition, that you ſhall be forth-with married together, and continue in honourable loue to her as ſhe deſerueth.</p>
                  <p>I thanke you my Lord, quoth he with all my heart, and will obſerue your gentle commandement. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the King called for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of <hi>Salerne,</hi> who conducted them to the Church, where they were eſpouſed in the preſence of many great Lords. Afterward they returned to the Citty, and there the wedding was ſolemnized with great ioy and Triumphs: wherefore wee may well ſay, that not men, but God appoynteth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, who perceiued the honeſt and continent loue, which <hi>Angriote</hi> euer-more bare to this ſelfe-willed Lady. For albeit hee had her in his cuſtodie, neuer did he meane diſhonorablie againſt her, but by vertuous cogitations bridled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull deſire: onely to expreſſe how intirely he loued her, and by obeying her ſeueere charge, loſt his life wel-neare when he combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Amadis.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the end of this mariage, which by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of opinions cauſed much talke, as commonly it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in ſuch caſes: the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſilence againe by his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld, when euery one being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to heare what he would ſay, he thus began. My friends, no one of you is ignorant of the heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour toward me, by appointing me the greateſt earthly Lord, that liueth this day in the Iſles of the. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean:</hi> Wherefore I thinke it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that as wee in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are the chiefe, ſo ſhould we be ſecond to no other Prince, in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring immortall thankes by good and vertuous workes, whereon we are now minded to determine. In this reſpect I intreate &amp; command albeit Kings are the heads of their Monarchies &amp; you the members, that you would altogether take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and giue mee counſell euen from your conſciences, what you thinke moſt expedient for mee to do, as well for the benefit of my Subiects, as alſo for our eſtate. And I aſſure ye, I am minded to beleeue your opinions, as proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loyall and ſaithfull ſubiects: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againe I deſire ye, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, each one would in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and generally aduiſe, what we ought to doe as matter moſt commendable. Herewith he held his peace, and <hi>Barſinan</hi> Lord of <hi>Sanſuegua</hi> was intreated by all the aſſiſtants to ſpeake his opinion, which they did for no other reaſon but becauſe the King would haue euery one honour him: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after many excuſes on his own behalfe, he aroſe from his ſeate; &amp; making humble reuerence, thus ſpake: ſeeing it liketh you, I ſhould firſt declare my cenſure, I deſire the King and this company to pardon my ignorance, being vnworthy of this honorable and gracious fauor. But me thinks (vnder ſubmiſſion to his pleaſure, and better aduiſe of al you my Lords) that wee ſhould with-draw our ſelues a while from the preſence of his Maieſty, where we may more freely conceiue our ſeuerall humors. This anſwer was generally well liked, wherefore the King and Queene left them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, walking into another of their Pauillions: then <hi>Seroloys</hi> the <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Countie of <hi>Clare,</hi> began in this manner. You haue all heard my Lords, the good zeale the King hath to the gouernement, not only of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth in his Realm, but particularly to the honorable encreaſe of Chiualry, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to continue in greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence then euer it hath beene. And therefore my Lords humbling my ſelfe to better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, I thinke it good (to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the intent of our King,) that wee all ought to counſell him, to ſtrengthen himſelfe with men and money: for they are the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of warre and peace, whereby, all Kings on the earth are maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their puiſſant authority. For it is moſt certaine, that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is for Souldiers and men

at armes, by whome Kings reigne, nor ought it for any cauſe to bee elſe-where diſpended, without committing of true ſacrilidge: for theſe affairts are termed holy, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſtate to liue in tranquility, and winne glorious conqueſts of ſuch as ſeeke to inuade them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to attaine the better thereto, his Maieſtie muſt ſeeke meanes to get all the knights he can heare of, as well ſtrangers as other: entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with liberality, to ſend his renowne on winges through the world, which will fetch from the furtheſt parts men to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, in hope of condigne recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to their labour.

I tearme it bought, by fauouring honoring, and diſtributing their treaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: that they may receiue no occaſion of diſlike, but with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable reſolution to purſue victorie. As he would haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in further perſwaſion, the greater part of the Lords ſeemed to allow of his opinion, afferffing that better conncell could not bee giuen: which when <hi>Barſinan</hi> heard, he requeſted audience for him-ſelfe, and hauing grant thereof, he intended to reuerſe this firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, becauſe he might very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elſe goe forward with his ſecret purpoſe: the ſilence being made, <hi>Barſinan</hi> thus begins. It ſeemeth by your countenance my Lords, that the County of <hi>Clares</hi> opinion is a grounded truth, for I ſee the moſt part of you auerre the ſame, not hauing heard any thing to the contrary: notwithſtanding, I hope to make it knowne to you all, and to the king himſelfe hereafter, how much I deſire to be friend him, you and the whole Realme. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Clare</hi> hath laid before you. that the King your maiſter ought to ſtrengthen himſelfe, by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude &amp; force of ſtrange knights, whom he would haue called from all parts of the world: in ſooth if his opinion were to bee credited, and you your ſelues bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, I am certaine in ſhort time their number would be ſuch, as your king, who is a good Prince and liberall: would not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate them with what he was wont to beſtow on you, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe take your owne from you, and giue to them, for naturaly, matter of nouelty and neuer ſeene before, is moſt pleaſing. Hereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that whatſoeuer ſeruice you performe, bee it of neuer ſo high eſteemation, yet ſhall you fall into his diſdaine and obliuion, and ſtrangers lift you from the ſeats, which now do promiſe your ſecureſt quiet. Therefore my Lords, before you conclude, this matter is of ſo great importance, as you all ought to bee aduiſed, by good and deſcreete delibera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ion in your graue iudgements. I hope there is no one in all this aſſembly, that will preſume I ſpeake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then reaſon and the good loue I beare yee doth admoniſh me, for I thanke God I am ſuch a one, as neede to regard the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Prince my neighbor, no more then he doth me: but conſidering I am in ſo noble compay, and haue here receiued ſuch fauour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I rather deſire (God is my witneſſe) I had neuer beene borne, then to flatter men with vaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions. You muſt therefore (my

Lords) diligently fore-ſee, leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward you repent with too much leyſure. And heere he pauſed, for the murmour was ſo great among them, as they hardly gaue him time to conclude, becauſe the moſt part of them that accorded to the firſt opinion, were now changed and helde with <hi>Barſinan,</hi> by meanes whereof, they could determine nothing, but it was appointed how the king ſhould bee acquainted with this controuerſie, that hee might ſet downe ſome better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and after it had againe beene debated in his preſence, hee thus ſpake vnto them all.</p>
                  <p>My honourable friends, I am ſure that the loue you beare me, &amp; your forward deſire in doing mee ſeruice, hath brought you into theſe intricate difficulties: and I thinke there is no one of you all, but hath ſpoken ſo neere to truth as is poſſible, whereby your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo ſound and good, as better cannot bee heard from any. Notwithſtanding, it is a thing moſt ſure and certaine, that the Kings of the earth are not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med great, by the number of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their poſſeſſion, but by the quantity and multitude of their people, ouer whom they rule and command. For what can one king alone do? it may be much leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſimpleſt of his ſubiects: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, it ſhal ſeem a matter aboue his power, to gouerne &amp; maintain his eſtate without people, let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in neuer ſo much wealth: nor can theſe tranſitorie gifts of fortune be better imployed, then diſtributed among ſuch as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them. Whereby I gather, how euery man of good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſay, that good counſell and ſtrength of men, is the very treaſure indeede. If yet you will haue better inſtance hereof, looke on the liues of great <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſtrong <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> gentle <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> and many other, whoſe names beare the title of immortality: they by the treaſure of men, and not mony, were made Kings, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours &amp; Monarchs, for they could bountifully diſtribute their coyne, to ſuch as they well knew had beſt deſerued it; and likewiſe would vſe them with gracious behauiour, as they might be termed Lords both in heart and hand, the only meane that made them be ſerued with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. Therefore my good friends, I deſire you all, euen in the moſt intire affection I can vſe, that you aſſiſt me to your vttermoſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of good Knights, either of our owne or ſtrangers: promiſing you by the faith and word of a king, ſo honorably to entreate and eſteeme of them, as both they and you ſhall remaine contented. Nor are you ignorant my noble<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> friends, that the better we bee accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more we ſhall be feared of our enemies, our ſtate in greater ſafety, and your ſelues more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely defended and loued. If then any vertue at all abide in vs, you may eaſily iudge, how new friends cannot make vs forgetfull of our olde: let none then differ from the requeſt I haue made, but rather yeelde and conſent thereto. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I entreat ye, and expreſſely command, that each of you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently name ſuch to me as you know, happely they being yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to me: to the end if any be in this Court, they may receiue ſuch fauour of vs, as the abſent may bee the better affected to our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; likewiſe we entreat them, not to depart our company, without giuing vs ſome aduertiſement. All which was preſently done, many

openly called, and their names ſet downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but becauſe the tables were couered for dinner, the King aroſe from his chaire, withdrawing him-ſelfe into the appointed Hall, where many Tables were proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which he commanded to bee well furniſhed with Knights. You may eaſily coniecture, that during the ſeruice, they diuerſly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, ſome on the kings deliberation, and other, of his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, vntill the Tables were with-drawne againe: when the King cauſed them all to be called, and thus ſpake. You ſee my good friends, how earneſtly I loue and deſire your company, wherefore you muſt grant me one requeſt, not to depart this Court without my leaue: for I would particularly know the ſeruice you haue done me, and you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſt ſuch reward of my treaſure, as may continue your loue to me. Hereupon they were ſeuerally called by name againe, and euery one confirmed the kings requeſt, except <hi>Amadis,</hi> becauſe he was the Queenes knight: and al this while was ſhe preſent at theſe matters, wherefore after the noiſe was ſomewhat appeaſed, ſhe fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her ſpeeches to the King in this manner. My Lord, ſeeing it hath pleaſed you ſo to fauour and honour your Knights, me thinks it were reaſonable that I ſhould doe the like to the Ladies and Gentle-women, of what part ſoeuer they be. Wherefore I humbly deſire one boone, with aſſurance like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if you conſent, theſe Gentle-men after you ſhall not deny mee: conſidering that in ſemblable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, good things deſerue to bee demanded and granted. Then the King looked on all the aſſiſtants, ſaying: What anſwer (my friends) ſhall we make the Queene? ſhall we agree to her demand? Yea Sir, if it be your pleaſure, anſwered they. What? ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> were it poſſible to deny a princeſſe ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous? Seeing you are all ſo well content, quoth the King, ſhe ſhall obtaine whatſoeuer ſhe asketh. At theſe words the Queene aroſe, and thanking her Lord, ſaid. Seeing it pleaſeth you to giue place and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to my requeſt, I deſire hence-forth you would doe ſuch honour to Ladies and Gentlewomen, as to take them into your protection and defence: maintayning their quarrells againſt all ſuch as would moleſt them any manner of way. Beſide, if you haue made promiſe of ſome ſuite to a man, and the like to any Lady or Gentlewoman: you firſt ſhall accompliſh the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans requeſt, as being the weakeſt perſon, and who hath moſt neede to be holpen. This granted, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they ſhall be better fauoured and defended then euer they were: for villaynes that are wont to do them iniurie, meeting them in the fields, and knowing they haue ſuch knights as you are for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect ours, dare no way wrong them. In ſooth Madame, ſaid the King, your requeſt is reaſonable, and I thinke none will gaine-ſay it: wee will haue it therefore regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and ſet downe as a law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable.</p>

My Lord, ech one is merry but my poore ſelfe, who am ſo croſſed with griefe and ſorrow, as death were the beſt friend could come to me: yet would your Maieſtie take compaſſion on me, I eaſily might recouer my ioy againe.

Not long after they meeting one day toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the knight vſed ſuch reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing tearmes of cowardiſe, as my Father and vncle could not indure the iniurie: but falling to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, the knight was ſlaine in the preſence of a Lady, named <hi>Galden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> who, as ſhe ſaid, procured his comming to maintain a difference, which ſhe had with a neighbour of hers, being her great enemy: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing him dead, ſhe cauſed the conquerors to be taken, &amp; put them into the moſt miſerable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world: albeit my father, and vncle often told her, that they would performe for her what the knight ſhould haue done. But ſhe anſwered, how ſhee well knew they were not ſufficient for the cauſe, &amp; therefore ſhould neuer be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, vntill they deliuered her two knights of like account, each of them valuing him in ſtrength who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had ſlaine, to finiſh the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt himſelfe was able to doe. Know you not Damoſell, ſaid the King, againſt whom they ſhoulde combat, or the place where it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed? No truely Sir, anſwered the Damoſell, but I haue ſeene my father and vncle cruelly put in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where their friends ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> compas no meanes to ſee them. Herewith ſhe began again to weep, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one pittied to behold her, which made the king aske her, if the place were far off: In fiue daies my Lord, quoth ſhe, it may eaſily be gone &amp; returned. Now truſt me, ſaid the king, you ſhall not want your ioy for two knights, wherefore looke among al theſe gallants, and chuſe ſuch as you beſt fancy. My Lord, replied the Damoſell, I am a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and know not any one in this Court: But if you pleaſe, I will i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7181:101"/>
and falling at the Queenes feete, proceeded thus. Madame, you are ſayde to bee one of the wiſeſt and moſt vertuous dames in the world, you vnderſtand the cauſe of my mourning, and the gracious offer the King hath made me: moſt humbly I beſeech ye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, to take co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion on a poore Gentlewoman, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell me which two knights I ſhall chuſe, that are beſt able to ſupport my want. Beleeue me Damoſell, anſwered the Queen, you demand a matter of great importance, yet in ſuch ſort doe I pittie your cauſe, as I am the more willing to giue you aduiſe: albeit I would be loth to forgoe them twaine, whome I could name in this company. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhee ſhewed her <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſaying: This is my knight. And pointing to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſayde. This other is the Kings, yet be they both bretheren, and the beſt Knights (as I haue heard) this day liuing. I deſire your Maieſtie, quoth the Damoſell, to tell me their names. The one, ſayd the Queene, is called <hi>Amadis,</hi> and the other <hi>Galaor.</hi> But by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, replied the Damoſell, is this <hi>Amadis,</hi> the knight ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed? I am very certaine, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, ſo ſoone as hee and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall arriue where I can bring them, my cauſe will be ſufficiently executed, therefore I deſire you to obtaine mee their company. Hereupon the Queen called them, ſaying: I beſeech yee both to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour this woman, who ſtandeth in neede of your aſſiſtance. <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſomewhat ſlow in anſwering, for he caſt his eye on the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> to note if ſhe would like of his departure: and ſhe who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pittied the womans cauſe, let fall her gloues, which was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſignall betweene them, and thereby he was certified of her conſent, wherefore hee thus ſpake to the Queene. I am at your diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, Madame, to do whatſoeuer you ſhall command me. Go then, in Gods name, quoth ſhe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne again with all poſſible ſpeed, without tarying for any thing that may happen. Hereto they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condeſcended, and taking leaue of her, <hi>Amadis</hi> fained hee would ſpeake to <hi>Mabila,</hi> when comming neere her and <hi>Oriana,</hi> hee ſayde to his Goddeſſe. Madame, well may I ſay that the faireſt Lady in the world, ſends mee to ſuccour the moſt wofull woman I euer did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde. Sweete friend, quoth <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> I repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that I gaue you ſo much libertie, becauſe my minde telleth me, this attempt will proue ſome-what dangerous to you, which I hope the heauens will powerfully defend. I am perſwaded Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> that as the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull worke-man of the world, hath enriched you with beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other women, he will not ſuffer you to feele diſpleaſure, by any miſ-fortune happening to mee: for being yours as I am, I imagine my ſelfe ſo happy, as I thinke no euill can chance to mee, if I continue in your gracious fauour. If it lay in my power, replied <hi>Oriana,</hi> I would reuoke your licence of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but ſeeing it may not bee, I will remaine in prayer for your proſperous ſucceſſe. So taking leaue of her, hee and <hi>Galaor</hi> went to arme them-ſelue, then doing their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty to the king, they rode away in company of the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. As thus they trauailed, about mid-day they entred the fortreſt, which commonly was called the <hi>vnfortunate Forreſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7181:101"/>
neuer any knight errant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it, that could eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome michiefe: and ſo theſe two bretheren deerely experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for ſuch miſhap befell them, as they verily thought to loſe their liues. Still rode they on without any aduenture, till the Mo one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to grace the euening, yet would not the Damoſell ſhew any ſigne of ſtay, which made <hi>Amadis</hi> aske this queſtion: Gentlewoman, ſhall we reſt out ſelues here awhile? Yea mary, quoth ſhee, here before wee ſhall finde tents ready prouided, and people in them who expect your comming: make then a little haſt I pray you, becauſe I will goe before to aduertiſe them. They were very well content therewith, and ſo the Damo ſell left them, till ſoone after they eſpied the tents, where they ſaw her among other Ladyes and knights, who bad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welcome at their arriuall: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alighted from their horſes, they were conducted into a Pauillion, hauing ſeruants ſtanding ready to take their armour, which they had no ſooner put off, but was caryed by them into another roome, where-upon <hi>Amadis</hi> demanded why they did ſo. Becauſe, replied the Damoſell, you muſt lodge where they haue caryed your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. He imagining ſhee ſayde true, made no further enquirie, but ſate downe with his brother on ſtooles that ſtood ready for them, attending the houre of ſupper. Not long had they ſitten there, but fiue knights well armed entred fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly vpon them, ſaying: Yeelde your ſelues, elſe you are ſlaine. When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard and ſaw their bad behauiour, he knew right well they were betraied, and ſtarting vp, ſaide to <hi>Galaor.</hi> By God bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wee are treacherouſly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

Ah villaines, you haue vs now at too much aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, deliuer vs our armes, and this quarrell ſhalbe otherwiſe decided.

So may you doe, ſayd <hi>Galaor,</hi> like traitours as you are, and I will maintaine my wordes againſt two or three of you, if you dare deliuer me mine armes. We need no ſuch proofe, replied the knights, but if you contend in further ſpeeches, you ſhall deerely buy them with the loſſe of your liues. Now truſt me, quoth <hi>Amades,</hi> wee rather will dye, then be priſoners to ſuch vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines as you are.

the Lady, but would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ye to yeeld your ſelues to mee. Whereto at length they accorded, ſeeing they could no way elſe ſaue their liues: yet knew ſhe not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their names, for the Damoſell that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them thither, would not tell her, becauſe if her Miſtreſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what they were, ſhe knew they might not eſcape the death. Wherefore ſhee was content to conceale them, in reſpect of the offence ſhe ſhould commit, by cauſing the death of two ſo good knights: beſide, ſhee repented her vnhonorable iourney, which now ſhe could no way remedie, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by keping their names vnknown. They being thus priſoners to the Lady, ſhe entred into theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Knights, you may ſee in what eſtate I hold ye, and there is no meane but one for deliuerance, which I will acquaint ye withall: mary if you doe not fulfill it, in ſteed of giuing you liberty, I will cauſe you to be incloſed in ſuch a dolorous priſon, as ſhall be worſe to you then death it ſelfe. Lady, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> the matter may be ſuch, that we ſhall eaſily conſent thereto: and in ſome ſort againe, we will rather die then obey you. I know not (quoth the Lady) how you may conceiue thereof, but I can aſſure ye, that if you promiſe mee not to forſake the ſeruice of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and to go tell him at your departure hence, how you do it by commandement of <hi>Madaſima</hi> Lady of <hi>Gantaſi,</hi> who enuies his welfare, becauſe he keepeth one in his court, that ſlew the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Knight <hi>Dardan:</hi> you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhale eſcape this mereileſſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity. Madame, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> if you do this, thinking thereby to offend king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> you much abuſe your ſelfe: for we are two poore knights, who haue no other riches then our Armour and Horſe, and hee hath ſuch ſtore of redoubted Seruants, as he will little care whether you impriſon vs or no: yet ſhall it bee ſuch a ſhame to vs, as you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer imagine the like, becauſe wee are vnable to do it. What? quoth ſhe, loue you better to ſpend your life time in a moſt miſerable priſon then to forſake the ſeruice of the moſt diſloyall king liuing? Now truſt me Madame, anſwered <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> but ill beſeems you theſe bad ſpeeches: for he is one of the beſt Princes in the World, and againſt any knight I will maintaine, that neuer was diſloyalty found in him. In luckleſſe time for thee, ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſima,</hi> haſt thou vttered thy loue: wherewith ſhee commanded their hands to be bound. That ſhall I do, replied a knight, and cut off their heads, if you pleaſe. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he laid hold on <hi>Amadis,</hi> who was ſo offended thereat, as he lifted his fiſt to giue him a blow on the eare: but the knight eſcaping, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> caught him about the middle, throwing him ſo violently againſt the ground, that he thought his heart was broken, for he lay ſtill and moued not. Now grew the Lady and her knights into ſuch anger with <hi>Amadis,</hi> as preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would haue ſlaine him, and he had not eſcaped, but that an ancient knight ſtepped before him with his Sword drawne, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch threatnings and other behauiour, as he cauſed them all to goe forth of the Pauillion: yet could he not defend him ſo well, but <hi>Amadis</hi> was wounded on the right ſhoulder. Then ſtepped the auncient knight to <hi>Madaſima,</hi> with theſe wordes. By God Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame you deale like a very vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Woman, cauſing your
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7181:102"/>
people in your preſence to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two knights, after they haue yeelded themſelues your priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Why Sir? quoth ſhe, did you not ſee their preſumptuous bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? eſpecially this varlet, who before my face hath ſo vſed this Man, as he is not able to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? Madame, replied <hi>Galaor,</hi> we rather chuſe to die, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but your ſelfe ſhall binde vs: for you by nature are gentle and courteous, and we as priſoners wil ſhew obeyſance to you. Seeing you ſay ſo, anſwered <hi>Madaſima,</hi> I will binde you my ſelfe: hereupon ſhe bound their hands with ſtrong cords, and preſently taking downe the Tents, they departed thence, <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Galaor</hi> being ſet on horſes without Saddles, and led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by two S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But <hi>Amadis</hi> was weary of his life, not ſo much for his hard vſage, in reſpect he could gouerne himſelfe with wonderfull patience: but for the matter <hi>Madaſima</hi> would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to, the refuſall whereof, gaue hope of no better vſage at her hand, but for euer to be depriued of his faire <hi>Oriana.</hi> And contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if he conſented, he ſhould in like manner be baniſhed from her preſence, being compelled to ſerue king <hi>Liſuart</hi> no longer: theſe two extremitys troubled his thoughts, which the ancient knight well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that ſaued their liues, yet he imagined the cauſe to proceede from his hurt, and was moued to pitty him, for the Damoſell had told him, that he was one of the beſt knights in the world.</p>
                  <p>Here you muſt obſerue, how the Damoſell was the ancient knights Daughter, and repented her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in deceiuing them, ſeeing how diſcourteouſly they were intreated which made her earneſtly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her father, to practiſe ſome meane for their ſafety: for, quoth ſhe, if they be put to death, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſhame will attend on my life.

Be of good cheere, Sir Knight, for I hope by (the helpe of God) ere long to deliuer you from this cruell Lady: and if your wound offend ye, I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her to let you haue ſome cure. When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard him ſpeake ſo friendly, knowing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it was the Man, who deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from them that would haue ſlaine him, hee thus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

Alas Sir, anſwered the Knight, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you will not conſider how neere your death is?

                  <p>Madame, you carry two priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with you, but you doe not know what they are.

What though he be your priſoner, it is not for any offence committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, but onely through the hatred you beare to another: all which you may yet redreſſe in much better ſort then you began, conſidering if he conceiued liking of you, you may thereby eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to loue, and vnder that ceremony, draw him to do what your ſelfe ſhall deſire.

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could not proceede, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Madaſima</hi> came and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted them, when calling him aſide, and faire day was diſplayed on the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his beautie and good grace ſo eſpecially contented her, as ſhe became ſurprized with his loue, which ſhe ſhaddowed vnder demanding how he fared. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> I fare worſe then you ſhould, were you in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer as I am in yours, for I would do you what ſeruice and pleaſure poſſible I could, and you vſe the contrarie to me, I hauing giuen no occaſion of offence: reaſon willeth I ſhould rather be your knight, to loue and honour you, then your priſoner thus vnkindelie bound as I am.</p>
                  <p>And ſurelie I cannot but mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile hereat, conſidering the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conqueſt you haue thereby: vſe then ſuch rigor to vs, as women ſo diuinelie adorned are wont to do. <hi>Madaſima</hi> hearing his gentle language, was more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with his loue, yet ſtriuing to diſſemble it, ſhe merrilie ſaid. Tell me faire Sir, if I chuſe you as my friend, and deliuer you from priſon, will you (for my ſake) leaue the ſeruice of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and afterward tell him how you did it by my meanes? With all my heart Lady, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, you ſhall haue what oath you pleaſe, both of mee and my companion, for he will doe no more then I requeſt him. Credit me, quoth <hi>Madaſima,</hi> if before this company you wil promiſe to obey me, preſentlie you ſhall enioy your libertie.</p>
                  <p>Behold me ready, replied <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor.</hi> Yet is not this enough, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Madaſima,</hi> for you ſhall ſweare it in the preſence of a Ladie where I am intended to lodge this night: In meane while you muſt aſſure me, not to depart my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. We will not on my faith Madame, quoth <hi>Galaor:</hi> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Amadis,</hi> cauſed him to affirme as much, whereupon they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound and ſet at libertie, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But <hi>Madaſima</hi> and <hi>Galaor</hi> ſtill continued their amorous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, till they arriued at a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle named <hi>Albies,</hi> the Lady where-of receiued them very honourably, in reſpect of great friendſhippe betweene <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her. Needeleſſe were it to tell you of their good cheere, it could not but be anſwerable to the time and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but after ſupper <hi>Madaſima</hi> demanded of <hi>Galaor,</hi> if he meant to keepe his promiſe he made her by the way. What elſe Madame?
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7181:104"/>
quoth he, prouided you be ſo good as your worde to me. Make no doubt thereof, replyed <hi>Madaſima:</hi> then framing her ſpeeches to the Lady of the Caſtle, and alſo to two knights that were her Sonnes, ſhe proceeded in this manner. My good friends, I pray you heare a couenant betweene me and theſe two Gentlemen, becauſe hereafter you may be my witneſſes. They are my priſoners, and vnder theſe conditions I haue releaſed them, that one of them ſhall continue my friend, and both of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the ſeruice of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> telling him: how for my ſake, and in deſpight of him they haue done it. Hereupon I intreate this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at your hands, as to meete me at the Court of that wretched King, on the day they muſt declare this meſſage, to ſee how conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly he will take it: But if they fullfill not their promiſe, hence-forth you ſhall publiſh in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the heynous offence by them committed, and ten dayes I giue them to execute this charge. I am well pleaſed, ſaid the Lady of the Caſtle, to doe a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you then this, if they as willingly conſent thereto. We pray you, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> not to faile herein, for we haue promiſed and will performe it. Receiue then your libertie, anſwered <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> yet muſt you not depart this night: Theſe words ſhe ſpake, becauſe ſhe intended to ſeale the bargaine with <hi>Galaor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the time came that ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned them to reſt, <hi>Amadis</hi> was conducted to one chamber, and <hi>Galaor</hi> to another, whither ſoone after <hi>Madaſima</hi> repaired, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young, beautifull, and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turouſly giuen: <hi>Galaor</hi> likewiſe, a man forward to ſuch fortunes, when Loue had erected his ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ladders to the walls, quickly got poſſeſſion of the Forte. And ſo well liked ſhee theſe amorous skirmiſhes, as afterward ſhe repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in many places, how ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taſted a more pleaſant night, and had ſhe not promiſed him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, hardly would ſhe haue let him goe ſo ſoone, nor did ſhee but in hope of his ſpeedie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>
                  <p>Thus was ſhe enclined to volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous deſire, as without care of her honour, ſhe often fell in this ſort. By theſe meanes eſcaped <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and <hi>Galaor,</hi> vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions you haue heard, which they hoped to preuent without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach, as hereafter ſhall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you.

                     <p>How King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was in danger of his perſon and his ſtate, by the vnlawfull promiſes he made too raſhly and vnaduiſedly.</p>
                  </argument>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oure dayes after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> &amp; <hi>Galaor</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Court, the ancient Knight came to the Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> who left the Crowne and the mantle with the Queene, as you haue heard: when falling on his knee before the King, he began in this manner. I marueil my Lord, that in a time of ſuch honor, you weare not the Crowne I left with you. And you Madame, quoth he to the Queene, is it poſſible you ſhould make ſo ſlender account of the ſumptuous mantle I gaue you in charge, not deigning as yet to proue it, or how it will become ye? When the King heard his words, knowing they were loſt, he ſate a good while without any anſwere, which made the knight thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin againe. On my faith I am glad you like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, for had you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to keepe them, you muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe haue granted my demand, and happely it would proue greater then you expect: otherwiſe, in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying your promiſe, you might procure the loſſe of my head. Moſt humbly therefore I beſeech ye my Lord, to will them be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me againe, becauſe I may tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no longer here.</p>
                  <p>At which words the King ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med much offended, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able any longer time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his hidden anger; earneſtly fixing his eyes vpon him (which were then ouer clouded with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented brow) he brake forth into theſe following ſpeeches. Know knight, that whatſoeuer promiſes, I haue made to thee, are (like thoſe decrees, which ſtand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the booke of Fate) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and thou ſhalt finde that I will keepe them inuiolable, Although I muſt confeſſe, (for the which I am heartily ſorry, not ſo much for my ſelfe; who am a partner with thee in the loſſe: as for thy ſake who committed them to my truſt) that both the Crowne and Mantle are vtterly loſt, how, or by what meanes I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, would heauens would pleaſe to be ſo propitious as to bring to light this deede of darkeneſſe; then ſhould my now troubled heart, finde comfort, and you, your wiſhed deſire: Which till then cannot reſt contented, my much perplexed minde would then bee at peace, which now is at ciuill Warres, and inteſtine contention within me. At which words, not being able any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his tongue (the hearts beſt interpreter both for ioy and griefe) to expreſſe himſelfe, he abruptly pauſed, partlie moued thereunto by the knight who gaue a loud ſhrike, ſaying.</p>
                  <p>Ah wretched and miſerable old man, now comes the time I ſo much feared, bringing with it, my lateſt and vnluckie exigent: haue I not long enough endured torments, but now muſt after all thoſe miſeries, finiſh mine olde age in the moſt ſore, cruell death

was euer heard of, hauing by no offence deſerued it? While thus he complained, the teares aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly trickled downe his white beard, which moued the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to pitty his griefe, and the King himſelf ouercom with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, returned this anſwere. Feare not (Knight) to ſpeede any thing the worſe for my loſſe, you muſt be ſatisfied whatſoeuer it coſt me, according as I faithfuly promiſed. At theſe words the Knight would haue kiſſed his feete, but the King reſtrained him, ſaying: Demand what thou wilt, for thou ſhalt haue it. I know my Lord, quoth the Knight, you remember your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to deliuer my Crowne and Mantle, or whatſoeuer I requeſted for them: God is my witneſſe, I intended not to deſire what now I muſt needes, by reaſon I haue no other meane whereby to bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, if I had, I would acquit you of the griefe I know you will endure, granting me the thing I muſt of neceſſitie demand: but now it may not be otherwiſe, except you infringe your faith &amp; loyaltie. Rather will I loſe my Kingdome, replied the King, then make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe and not fulfill it, ſay bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore thy minde. I thanke your Maieſty, quoth the knight, there now remaineth nothing, but to haue aſſurance from the Lords of your Court, that they ſeeke not to take from me the gift you muſt deliuer: otherwiſe your promiſe cannot be perform'd, or I ſatisfied, hauing a reward now, and taken from me anon. Great reaſon, ſaid the King, my word ſhall ſtand for their warrant. Seeing my Lord, quoth the knight, Fortune hath ſo permitted, that you haue loſt my Mantle and the Crowne, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſaue my head, except you giue me Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> your Daughter. Be therefore now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, either reſtore my Iewells, or giue me her, albeit I loue the one better then the other: for neuer can I haue ſo much good by her, as I ſuſtaine harme by your vnhappie loſſe. Now began all the Lords and Barons to murmur againſt the knight, perſwading the king to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his word: but he rather deſired death, he was ſuch a good and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Prince, and this anſwere hee made them. Be not offended my good friends, the loſſe of my Daughter will not be ſo preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to me, as the breach of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: for if the one be enuious, the other is iniurious, and to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euery way. The proofe is ready, if Subiects finde not their Prince faithfull, and his word inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable, what care will they haue of the loue and fidelitie they owe to him? much better vnborne then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch blemiſh: this knight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt haue my daughter, and I will deliuer her according to my promiſe. Hereupon he ſent for her but the Queene being preſent all this while, little thought the king would ſo forget his fatherlie loue: and when ſhe heard this rigorous ſentence pronounced againſt her Daughter, ſhee good Lady fell at the kings feete, when wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping (as a Mother for the loſſe of her Childe) ſhe ſaid. What will ye doe my My Lord? will ye bee more inhumane to your owne blood, then the bruite Beaſts are to their contraries? Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their brutiſh qualities, yet be they neuer ſo vnnatural to ſhew any violence to their young ones. May it then be thought reaſonable vnder ſhaddow of an accorded promiſe (without knowledg there-of) to commit ſo great wrong, not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7181:105"/>
onely againſt your ſelfe impitious father, or mee a woefull and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate mother, but likewiſe againſt the whole common weale of this Realme? Alas Sir, let my inceſſant teares perſwade you, to bethinke ſome other meane for your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and alſo to content the knight. Madame, quoth the King, my word is paſt, I pray you talke no more thereof to me. Thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the teares ſtreamed downe his cheekes, whereat the Lords were not a little agrieued, and that which moſt troubled him, was the acclamations of the Ladies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King commanded them to their chambers. The Queene ſeeing the might not preuaile, fell in a ſwoune, but by her Ladies ſhe was conueighed thence, the King giuing charge on paine of death, that no one ſhould ſeeke to alter his promiſe. My daughter, quoth hee, I commit to the pleaſure of God, but my promiſe ſhall not be broken if I can help it.</p>
                  <p>By this time the newes came to <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>a,</hi> how her Father had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her departure, whereat ſhee fell downe in ſuch a traunce, as they neuer expected life in her againe: when <hi>Mabila</hi> and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies reputing her dead indeede, thought beſt to acquaint the King therewith, yet by forced remedies ſhee reuiued againe, breathing forth many dolorous ſighes. Now the moſt of the women ſeueted themſelues, ſome neare, and ſome further from her, becauſe ſhee ſhould not heare their complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and ſuch compaſſion tooke they on her, as would haue conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſtony heart into teares, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when the Princeſſe recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the power of ſpeech, and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vttered theſe regreets. Full wel, quoth ſhee, doe I well beholde mine owne ruine.

When thou ſhalt heare of theſe rydings, I feare (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnable to endure them) thou wilt die immediately: yet this is the beſt hope, we ſhall not be long one after another. Ah death, the onely refuge to the vnfortunate, ſeeſt thou not me foremoſt in this ranke? why ſtayeſt thou? Fortune will triumph ouer thee, in dealing ſo extreamely as ſhee can with me, albeit I knowe thou art able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge thy ſelfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Adiew then ſweete friend, for neuer ſhall wee ſee each other more in this life: at theſe wordes ſhee fell in a ſwoune againe. When the King ſaw ſhee tarryed ſo long, hee ſent to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand her make more ſpeed: but the meſſenger found her in the deadly agony, and ſtaying till ſhe was recouered againe, as ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to renew her moanes, he thus ſpake to her. Madame, the King is offended becauſe you come not to him.</p>
                  <p>When ſhee heard this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſhee aroſe, hauing her heart ſo ſealed vp with griefe, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to enable her vitall forces, and being followed by none of her women, but the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> ſhee came before the King, and caſting her ſelfe at his feete, ſayde. My Lord and Father, what is your pleaſure with mee? Faire Daughter, quoth hee, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh my promiſe. Theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches prouoked her former paines.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7181:106"/>
when the King grieuing to behold the ſight therof, turned his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſaying to the knight. See my friend, here is the gift, you demand, and the onely thing in the world I moſt loue: but intend you to carry her hence alone? My Lord, ſayd the knight, ſhe ſhall be accompanied with two Gentlemen and their Squires, which were in my company when you made mee this promiſe at <hi>Windſore:</hi> &amp; more may I not allowe, vntill hee haue her, vnto whom I am conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to deliuer her. Yet let her haue the company of this Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſaide the King, for it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely, ſhe ſhould bee alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many men. Well, quoth the knight, for one woman it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not. So taking the Princeſſe in his armes, ſhee being ſcant reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from her ſwoune, he ſet her vp on horſe-backe, &amp; cauſed a Squire to ſit behind her on the horſe, who might hold her faſt leſt ſhe ſhould fall: and a very ſad countenance ſhewed the knight, ſaying, there was none in the Court more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull then himſelfe. After the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> was moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the King intreated her not to leaue his daughter whatſoeuer happened. And while they were thus preparing, the Princeſſe loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king woefully about her: a tall knight well armed came among them, who not taking off his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, or ſaluting the company, tooke <hi>Orianaes</hi> horſe by the bridle. This was <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the enchanter, and came in this ſort leſt he ſhould bee knowen: ſoone after he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Squire to ride away with her, which the Princeſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, and ſeeing there was no other remedy, deliuering a ſigh as if her heart would haue ſplit, ſhee ſayde. Ah my deere friend, in a happleſſe houre for you was the boone granted, becauſe it will bee both your death and mine. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhee meant <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom ſhee gaue leaue to depart with the Damoſell, yet the ſtanders by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it of her father and her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thus departed <hi>Oriana</hi> with them that conducted her, who rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace till they were entred the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt neere at hand: and the King himſelfe was mounted on horſe-backe, to conduct his daughter ſomewhat on the way, as alſo to forbid any rescue from following, according to his former promiſe. But the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila</hi> ſtanding at a windowe, to ſee this ſad and penſiue ſeparation, could come no nearer to <hi>Oriana,</hi> her heart was ſo ſurpriſed with griefe: yet by hap ſhee eſpyed <hi>Dardan</hi> the Dwarffe that ſerued <hi>Amadis,</hi> making ſpeed after the Princeſſe on horſe-backe, when calling him to her, ſhe ſaide. <hi>Dardan,</hi> if thou loue thy Maſter, ſtay not any where till thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with this mishappe: if now thou faile him, it may returne to thine owne daunger, for this is the time of greateſt neceſſity. By God Madame, anſwered the Dwarffe, I will with all diligence performe my duty. So giuing the ſpurres to his horſe, hee galloped the ſame way his Maſter rode with the Damoſell.</p>
                  <p>But leaue wee him poſting, and tell what now happened to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who accompanied his Daughter to the entrance of the Forreſt, cauſing all ſuch to returne as followed him. Euen in the houre of his trouble, a Damoſell came to him mounted on a ſwift Palfray, with a ſworde hanging about her neck, and a Launce richly painted, hauing the point gilded ouer: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

ſhee had ſaluted him, ſhe thus ſpake. My Lord, God increaſe your ioy, and make you willing to performe what you haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me at <hi>Windſore,</hi> in the preſence of all your worthy knights. At theſe wordes the King knew her, remembring it was ſhe that ſayde, how ſhe would prooue the vertue of his heart, whereupon hee thus anſwered. In good faith Damoſel, I haue now more neede of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oy then euer I had: notwithſtanding, I am readie to accompliſh any thing I promiſed you. It is the only thing my Lord, quoth ſhe, of my returne to you, being the moſt loyall King in the world, wherefore humbly I intreate yee, preſently to reuenge my cauſe on a knight that paſſed through this Forreſt, who not long ſince ſlew my father, by the moſt horrible treaſon that euer was heard of: yet not content there-with, the villaine violently tooke mee away, and perforce made me yeeld to his vnlawfull will. But in ſuch ſort is hee enchanted, as hee cannot bee done to death, except the moſt vertuous man in the Realme of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> giue him a wound with this Launce, and another with this ſword: both which he gaue in keeping to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, of whom hee had good hope to be loued, yet therein he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for ſhee hateth him aboue all others, for which cauſe ſhe gaue mee this ſword and Lance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might both be reuenged on him. Nor can it bee done but by you onely, who are the chiefe and moſt vertuous man in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: wherefore as you promiſed mee before ſo valiant men, may it pleaſe ye to execute this iuſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vengeance. And becauſe I haue often tolde him, that by this day I would bee prouided of a knight to combate with him, he is come alone into this Forreſt, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending onely for my Champion. It is likewiſe ordered, how you muſt haue no company but my ſelfe, for hee little thinketh that I haue the Sworde and Launce ſo hurtfull to him: and this is our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement together, if hee remaine conquerour, I muſt pardon him mine iniury, but if he be vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hee muſt doe what I command him. Preſently the King ſent a Gentleman for his Armour, which when hee had put on, he mounted on a braue Courſer, girding the Damoſels ſworde about him, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his owne that was one of the beſt in the world: then without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other company hee rode on with her, ſhee carrying his helmet. Not farre had they ridden, but ſhe cauſed him to forſake the high beaten way, conducting him by a little path among the ſhrubs, where not long before they had paſt that led away <hi>Oriana:</hi> then the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſhewed him a huge knight ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, mounted on a black Courſer, whereupon ſhe ſayde. My Lord, take your helmet, for this is he you muſt deale withall: which the King quickly did, &amp; approaching neare the knight, ſayd. Proud Traytour, defend thy ſelfe, and thy lawleſſe luſt. So couching their Launces, they encountred together, when the King perceiued how his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Launce brake like a ſtalke of hempe, hauing no ſtrength at all in it: which made him drawe his ſword to charge the knight, but at the firſt ſtrok, the blade broke cloſe to the hilt, whereby hee imagined himſelf betraied, for the knight did what he pleaſed to him. But as hee would haue killed his horſe, the King being quick &amp; nimble caught holde by his gorget, and in ſuch
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7181:107"/>
ſort they ſtrugled together, as they both fell to the ground, the knight vnderneath, and the King vpon him, by meanes whereof, hee got his ſword from him, and vnlacing his helmet to ſmite off his head, the Damoſell cryed out ſo loude as ſhee could: Sir <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> helpe your Coſen quickely, or elſe hee dies. When the King heard her name <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> hee looked vp, and ſawe ten braue knights come run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto him, the one of them v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe wordes: King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> ſpare the knight, otherwiſe thou ſhalt not reigne one houre. If I die, anſwered the King, ſo ſhall you all for mee, like traytours as you are. Then one of them gaue him ſuch a blowe with his Launce, as not onely ſore hurt him, but made him fall on his face to the ground: yet did hee recouer himſelfe very quickely, like one reſolued to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his life, albeit hee ſawe death preſent before his eyes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnable to reſiſt ſo many, at length they got ſure holde on him, when renting off his helmet &amp; his ſhield, they bound him faſt with a double chaine. Afterward they ſet him on a ſimple horſe, two knights ſtill holding the ends of the chain, and ſo leading him along, ſought where they might finde <hi>Arcalaus, Oriana,</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark:</hi> but the knight againſt whom the King firſt fought, rode before apace, and wauing his gauntlet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft to <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> ſayde, Beholde Coſen, kin <hi>Liſuart</hi> is ours. A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good prize, anſwered <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> henceforth ſhall his enemies haue no cauſe to dread him. Villaine, quoth the King, well know I thou waſt neuer other then a traytour, and though I am wounded, yet will I maintayne my words if thou dareſt combate with me. By God, ſayde <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> neuer ſhould I make reckoning of my ſelfe, to vanquiſh ſuch a Lord as thou art.</p>
                  <p>Thus contending as they rode, they came to a double way, where <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ſtayed, thus ſpeaking to his Page. Sirra, ride with all ſpeed to <hi>London,</hi> and ſay to Lord <hi>Barſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> that hee muſt execute what I willed him, for I haue begunne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, if hée can make an end as well. Gone is the Page toward the Citie, in meane while <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> deuiſed, to ſend the King one way, and <hi>Oriana</hi> another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſayde to his Coſen. Take tenne knights with you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct <hi>Liſuart</hi> to my priſon at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guanell:</hi> theſe other foure ſhall keepe mee companie, for I will leade <hi>Oriana</hi> to mount <hi>Aldin,</hi> where I will ſhew her ſtrange and wonderfull things. This mount <hi>Aldin</hi> was the place of his moſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall aboade, beeing one of the ſtrongeſt and faireſt in the worlde: thus the ten knights carryed away the King, and <hi>Arcalaus</hi> with the reſt had charge of the Princeſſe. But certainely, if heere wee conſider the properties of fortune, we may eaſily repute her as mutable, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more, towardes great Princes and Lords, then the meaner ſort: as well ſhee witneſſed by king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> euen in the time when hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended moſt honourably, to bee twharted with ſuch a contrary chance. For at one inſtant, hee ſawe himſelfe in the hands of his greateſt enemies, his Daughter (and heire to his kingdome) taken from him, and all his eſtate in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ruine. Hee that was wont to be honored of all, was now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriouſly deſpiſed, bound and led as a theefe, by a villainous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, a meane Gentleman, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7181:107"/>
out of any other hope then death. Is not this then a faire example for ſuch, as at this day are called to the greateſt honours in the world? wherewith oftentimes they are ſo blinded, that they forget both God and themſelues. King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> was a right good, vertuous, and wiſe Prince, yet the diuine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denance ſuffred him to fall in theſe dangers: to the end hee might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how al creatures remaine at his heauenly diſpoſition. This leſſon he taught him, for in ſhort time hee was brought ſo lowe as might be, and afterwarde reſtored againe, as you ſhall preſently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>

But by the way, they met <hi>Dardan</hi> the Dwarffe, ſo faſt as horſe could gallop, whereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> thus ſpake to <hi>Galaor.</hi> Brother, me thinks my ſeruant <hi>Dardan</hi> commeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, and doubtleſſe about ſome matter of importance, for do you not ſee what ſpeed he maketh? By this time <hi>Dardan</hi> brake off their talke, rehearſing euery thing that happened ſince their departure: but when hee tolde how the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> was carried from the Court againſt her will, and what ſorowfull lamentations ſhe made: <hi>Amadis</hi> entered into a deſpairing fury, demanding which way they went that had her in charge. In ſooth my Lord, anſwered <hi>Dardan,</hi> they rode thorough the Forreſt, which lieth on the otherſide of the City. Without more words <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> gaue the ſpurres to his horſe, galloping amaine toward <hi>London,</hi> ſo confounded with the terrour of theſe newes, as he could not ſpeake to his brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> who left him not but followed at hand. Thorow the City they ride not making any ſtay, enquiring which way they took that led away the Princeſſe, &amp; euery one ſhewed it him very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. As <hi>Gandalin</hi> came poſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Lord, it was his hap to paſſe by the Queenes lodging, where ſhee ſtanding at a window, ouer-come with griefe: eſpied <hi>Gandalin,</hi> whom ſhe called to her, and asked where he left his Maſter. Madame, quoth he, he is gone after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue away the Princeſſe. Stay a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I pray thee, ſaid the Queen: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſent ſhe for the Kings ſword, which was accounted one of the beſt in the world, ſaying.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7181:108"/>
his maiſter, whoſe impatience vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him to more haſt, then care of his iourney, made him ride ſo farre into a foule ſlough, as he was faine to alight ere hee could get foorth againe. And leading his horſe by the bridle to eſcape the mire, <hi>Galaor</hi> &amp; <hi>Gandalin</hi> ouer-took him, acquainting him with the Queenes meſſage, and deliuering the ſword ſhe ſent him. When hee heard how the King was likewiſe gone, his deſire of ſpeede encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to giue him ſuccour, but his horſe was ſo wearied with ſtriuing in the bogge, as hee was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take <hi>Gandalins:</hi> which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed much worſe then his owne, yet with the helpe of his ſpurres he made him goe. At length they found the tracke of horſes, and by good hap met with certaine poore labouring men, whom they asked if they met not any by the way. Yes my Lord, quoth one of them, wee met certaine men leading a knight and two Ladyes, albeit wee durſt not ſhew our ſelues, but kept vs hidden in the thickeſt of the wood, for doubtleſſe they beſome bad people: hereto they added ſuch a deſcription of the priſoners, as they eaſily gathered them to be the King and <hi>Oriana</hi> betraied. But tell me good friends, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> know you none of the other? for the priſoners are the King and his daughter. In ſooth, replied the poore man, wee are altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what they are, yet we heard one that led the horſe of the fairer Lady, often-times name <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> Now truſt mee, quoth <hi>Amadis</hi> to his brother, it is the villaine that enchanted me: Oh that it might be my hap to finde him. Gentle-men, ſaid the man, ten of them went this way on the right hand, with the Knight priſoner, and fiue more this way on the left hand, with the Ladyes. Brother, quoth <hi>Amadis</hi> to <hi>Galaor,</hi> I beſeech ye to follow the King, leaſt worſe befall him then we can remedy, and I will after the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana.</hi> So ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hands in equall reſolution, they parted the ſeuerall waies: but <hi>Amadis</hi> found his horſe ſo ouer labored, as he was able tohold out no longer. Being thus hindered, by chance he looked aſide, and ſawe where a Knight lay ſlaine, with a Squire ſtanding by holding his horſe: whereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtepped to him, demanding who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that murther. A traitour hath done it, anſwered the Squire, who is not yet gone very farre, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with him the faireſt Lady in the world: no other reaſon had he for my maiſters death, but becauſe he asked what the Lady was. What wilt thou do, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heere? I ſtay Sir, quoth he, till ſome one come, who may helpe me with my maiſters body to ſome buriall, and afterward I intend to ſeeke my fortune. If thou, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> wilt giue me the horſe thou holdeſt, I wil leaue thee mine, and my Squire to helpe thee, and one day will I giue thee two better beſide. The ſquire was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> mounting on the horſe, commanded <hi>Gandalin</hi> to help him bury his maiſters body, and after-ward to follow him the ſame way he rode.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Amadis</hi> hies ſo faſt as horſe can run, and eſpying an hermitage, went to ſee if any body were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: at his call, the hermit came foorth, of whom he asked, if he ſaw not fiue Knights paſſe by, leading two Ladyes. No verily, anſwered the olde father: but do you not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for a Caſtle, which is not far from this place? Why aske yee
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7181:108"/>
ſuch a queſtion? quoth <hi>Amadis.</hi> Becauſe a Nephew of mine tolde mee, ſaide the Hermit, how <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> the enchanter is going thither, and two Ladies with him, whom hee carryeth perforce. Ah Father, replyed <hi>Amadis,</hi> you name the traytour I looke for. Truſt me Sir, quoth the Hermit, hee hath done many miſchieues in this countrey, would God wee were either rid of him, or elſe his life amended: but haue you no bodie to helpe you? No body, but God and my ſelfe, anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> Why Sir? ſayd the Hermit, you tell mee they bee fiue in company, and you but one: beſide, <hi>Arcalaus</hi> is counted one of the beſt knights in the world, and with whom few or none dare med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Whatſoeuer hee bee, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> I am certaine hee is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall traytour, and they no leſſe that keep him company: what leſſe cauſe then haue I to feare him? for God is iuſt, in whom is onely my confidence. I pray you Sir, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Hermite, knowe you of whence the Ladies be? One of them, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> is the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> daughter and heire to the vertuous king <hi>Liſuart:</hi> the other is a Lady attending on her. The God of heauen, anſwered the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, further your intent, that ſo good a Princeſſe may not be long in ſuch a wretches cuſtody. If you haue any prouender Father, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> I deſire you giue my horſe a little. The Hermit brought forth ſuch as hee hee had, and while the horſe fed, <hi>Amadis</hi> demaunded, to whom the Caſtle belonged. To a knight called <hi>Grumen,</hi> ſayde the Hermit, Coſen germaine to proud <hi>Dardan,</hi> who was ſlaine at the Court of king <hi>Liſuart:</hi> which makes mee the rather coniecture, that he will lodge ſuch as are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to ſo good a Prince. Good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> I beſeech you haue minde of mee in your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and now ſhew me the neareſt way to the Caſtle. Which the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite did, when <hi>Amadis</hi> mounting on horſe-backe, tooke his leaue, following the way hee was direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Not long after he got a ſight of the Caſtle, which was compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſtrong Towers and high wals, wherefore ſo cloſely as hee could hee approached neare it, where hee heard what ioy they made for the arriuall of <hi>Arcalaus:</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marking how many gates of iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it had, hee found there was no more but one, wherefore tying his horſe, where he might not be ſeen, he hid himſelfe ſo conueniently, as none could paſſe in and out but he muſt needs ſee them: thus was hee glad to watch there all that night. At the breake of day, doubting leſt the watch of the Caſtle ſhould deſcry him, hee entered a little thicket, where long hee had not ſtaied, but hee ſawe a knight come forth on a little hill before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, looking all about if he could diſcerne any ambuſh: which done, hee went in againe, and very ſoon after, <hi>Arcalaus</hi> with his foure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions iſſued forth well armed, conducting the two Ladies, whom <hi>Amadis</hi> well knew ſo ſoone as hee ſawe them. Heereupon hee fell downe on his knee and prayed, that God would ſtrengthen him in this enterpriſe, then looking to the well guiding of his horſe, and that euery part of his Armour were as it ought to be, taking his Launce, hee mounted, tarrying till they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him. But becauſe this place was vnfit for the combate, hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſuffer them enter on the plaine neere at hand, ſtill keeping himſelfe in the thicket: and ſo neer
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7181:109"/>
did <hi>Arcalaus</hi> with his company paſſe by <hi>Amadis,</hi> as hee heard the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> thus complaine. Alas ſweet friend, quoth ſhe, great reaſon haue you to bid mee adiew, when I would permit you to goe ſuccour her, that ſeemed the moſt wofull woman in the world: for I feare this ſhall bee our laſt conge, and neuer may you ſee me againe, becauſe death giueth ſuch due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, as it is impoſſible for me to eſcape. Theſe words were of ſuch vertue, that albeit <hi>Amadis</hi> could not refraine from teares, yet did they ſo liuely inflame his heart, as ouer-reaching them ere they knew any thing, hee thus ſpake to them. You lye falſe traitours, for theſe Ladyes ſhall paſſe no further. The voyce of <hi>Amadis</hi> was quickly knowne by <hi>Oriana</hi> and the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> when imagining themſelues already reskewed, their mindes were ioyfully cheered, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to ſee their conductours ſo ſuddenly amated. But <hi>Arcalaus</hi> perceiuing how <hi>Amadis</hi> out-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his friends, approched more neere him, and <hi>Amadis</hi> well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing him from the reſt, met him ſo brauely, as hee ſent him headlong to the ground: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entring among the other foure, hee gaue ſuch a charge to <hi>Grumen,</hi> the Lord of the Caſtle where they lodged, that his Launce paſſed quite through his body, and breaking therein, he fell downe dead from his horſe. Now drew he the ſword the Queene ſent him, wherewith he laide ſo valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about him, as his enemies were cleane diſmaied in their hope, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they beheld <hi>Arcalaus</hi> not yet reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, whoſe power they reputed able to ouer-throw an armie. As hee continued the combate with them, the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> ſeeing the friends of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> fight ſo timorouſly, and himſelfe lie ſtill as one in a traunce, ſhe ſayd to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana.</hi> Madame, beholde how your <hi>Amadis</hi> honoureth your loue, ſee you not how he hath vſed <hi>Arcala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and our hoſte? in ſooth wee are already ſuccoured, for theſe other villaines can holde out no longer. Ah happy <hi>Amadis,</hi> quoth <hi>Oriana,</hi> the mirrour of all vertue and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie, heauen giue thee grace to finiſh our deliuerance, with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer theſe malicious traitours. When the Squire who had the charge of <hi>Oriana,</hi> as you heard, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that ſhee named <hi>Amadis,</hi> he was in ſuch feare, as preſently hee leaped from the horſe, ſaying. By my faith I might full well be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a foole, to tarry for ſuch blowes as my companions haue: and with theſe words he run away ſo faſt, that hee neuer looked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde if any purſued him. In this time <hi>Amadis</hi> had diſpatched three of the knights, and the fourth miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting like lot would fal to him, truſted to his horſe legges for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of himſelfe: but as <hi>Amadis</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, he heard the Princeſſe giue a loude crye, when looking backe, hee ſaw that <hi>Arcalaus</hi> had got her with him on horſe backe, and gallopped away ſo faſt as hee could. Hereupon hee let goe the knight, to helpe <hi>Oriana,</hi> ouer-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ere hee got much ground, and lifting his ſword to ſtrike at him, hee doubted leaſt he ſhould hurt the Princeſſe: but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the other ſide he gaue him ſuch a wound on the ſhoulder, as he was glad to let fall <hi>Oriana,</hi> that himſelfe might eſcape more light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for he knew if <hi>Amadis</hi> laid hold on him, al the treaſure in the world could not ſaue his life. When <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> ſaw himſelfe ſure of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hee ſtill purſued the cowardly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7181:109"/>
run-away, ſaying: Tarry <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> tarry, and thou ſhalt ſee if <hi>Amadis</hi> be dead, according as thou lyedſt not long agoe. But <hi>Arcalaus</hi> had no leaſure to anſwere, hee rather tooke his ſhield from his neck and threw it to the ground, becauſe nothing might hinder his horſe in running. At length as <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtrook at him, the blowe fell ſhort on the horſe buttock, and the beaſt feeling himſelfe wounded, made greater haſte away then he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leauing <hi>Amadis</hi> very farre behinde, who earneſtly deſired the death of <hi>Arcalaus:</hi> but ſeeing all his labour was in vaine, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting leaſt ſome harme might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to his Miſtreſſe, to loſe her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by negligence, hauing by hardy valour ſo well reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her: he turned back againe, and attayning the place where ſhe ſtayed for him, hee alighted from his horſe, then falling on his knee humbly kiſſed her hand, ſaying. Madame, heauen hath affoorded mee more grace, in ſtrengthening me to ſuccour you, then euer it did to any other knight, for I was out of hope to ſee you againe. But ſhe good Lady remained ſtill ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, in reſpect of her vngentle v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, as alſo affrighted with feare when <hi>Arcalaus</hi> let her fall: that ſhe could returne no anſwer, but gaue him thankes by many kind embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings. By this time, the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> came to them, and by the way found the ſword of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus,</hi> which ſhee bringing to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> thus ſpake. See heere (my Lord) a very faire ſword. Right ſoone did <hi>Amadis</hi> know it, to bee the ſame was found with him on the Sea, which <hi>Arcalaus</hi> took from him when he lay enchanted, being not a little glad hee had recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it.</p>
                  <p>While many affable ſpeeches paſſed betweene them, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtill comforting his diſmayed Miſtris, and ſhee reioycing in her louely friend: <hi>Gandalin</hi> arriued, who had ſought his Maſter all that night, and happily found him there with his Lady. Now minded they to tarry no longer in this place, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore making choyce of the knights horſes to their owne liking, they all mounted, <hi>Amadis</hi> leading <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianaes</hi> Palfray by the bridle, and ſhee rehearſing to him by the way, what iniury the dead knights had done her, as in her life time ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer endured the like: Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> much greater griefe haue I ſuffered by a liuing creature, yet leſſe to be feared then the dead, who can doe no harme: but beauty onely hath hazarded my life. Albeit <hi>Oriana</hi> well knew his meaning, yet ſhee demanded who was the cauſe thereof. Euen you Madame, quoth he, who hold mee in a life more irkeſome then death. My Lord, ſaid the Princeſſe, neuer with my conſent did you ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine any harme, and very ſorie would I be you ſhould thinke mee ſo vnkinde: for rather could I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord to eaſe your griefe, were it in my power to compaſſe the meane. Ah Madame, replyed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> as by you onely I took my hurt, ſo from you onely muſt I haue my help, and reaſon reputes it a matter of great inconuenience, that ſuch rare perfections ſhould cauſe ſo rough paſſions. But if you be indued with ſuch pitty, as the reſt of your excellencies do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe, you will not beholde that in me, which you grieue to ſee in your chiefeſt enemies: euen death, gentle Princeſſe, who in my torments awaiteth on me, forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſtrike, beeing conquered
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7181:110"/>
with this hope, that did opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and place ſerue, your paſſed promiſe ſhold eaſe your thoughts, and deliuer me from this weighty oppreſſion. But ſee how ſweete occaſion fauoureth vs, and fortune ſtands alooſe from hindering our content: doe not you then (good Madame) let ſlip this gracious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, when time and place challenge it at your hand, conſidering the argument is vrgent, and being now loytered, may hardly be againe ſo well recouered. <hi>Oriana</hi> (not ſo much for theſe reaſons, as becauſe her pain was equall with his, &amp; had not he begun the motion, her ſelfe would haue ſolicited the ſame) thus anſwered.

So pleaſe you Madame, in this place we may ſtay till the heate be gone, and you reſt in tarying for the cold euening: in meane ſpace I will ſend <hi>Gandalin</hi> to the Towne, to bring ſome viands to refreſh vs withall. Your reaſon is good, ſaide <hi>Oriana,</hi> but how ſhall hee come by meate? He ſhall leaue his horſe in pawne, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> and returne on foote. Yet I (quoth <hi>Oriana)</hi> haue a better helpe then that: hee ſhall ſell this ring, which can doe vs no better ſeruice then now in our neede. So pulling the ring from her finger, ſhe gaue it to <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who taking his leaue, as hee came by his Maiſter, ſaide: So good time loſt, will neuer bee had againe. <hi>Amadis</hi> knew his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning well enough, yet made he no ſhew thereof, but vnarmed him-ſelfe, and <hi>Oriana</hi> ſpreading the Damoſels mantle on the graſſe, laide her downe vpon it: the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell likewiſe went aſide into the wood, where ſhee fell ſoundly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe, by reaſon ſhe watched all the night before.

In the end, though his hands had beene ſlow in vnarming him, all his other members were in better ſtate, for not one of them but did his duty. The heart was rauiſhed in thoughts, the eye, in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of excellent beauty, the mouth, with ſweete kiſſes, the armes, with kinde embracings: and no one <hi>mal content</hi> in any poynt, except the eyes, which wiſhed themſelues in

In great paine were they likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were hindered from the pride of beauty, for the Princeſſe held her eyes cloſed, as well to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe her deſire of ſleepe, as alſo for the diſcreet ſhame conceiued by this pleaſure, ſo that ſhee durſt not boldly looke on him ſhe moſt loued. Hereupon, careleſly ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her armes abroad, as though ſhe ſlept in deed, and by reaſon of the exceeding heate, leauing her gorget open, two little alablaſter bowles liuely ſhewed themſelues in her boſome, ſo faire and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpiring, as Nature neuer ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed more curious workmanſhippe.

But ſhe being loth to mixe angry ſpeeches with amiable ſollace, or with frowning lookes to croſſe an equall content, thought it better to commend the controule of ſo kinde a louer, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued this pleaſing recreation, as neither party receiued occaſion of miſlike: rather with kiſſes (which are counted the ſeales of loue) they choſe to confirm their vnanimity, then otherwiſe to offend a reſolued patience. Ah, how many repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made <hi>Oriana,</hi> of the paines ſhe ſuffered in expectation of this day? confeſſing thoſe priuate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities, which none but ſhe &amp; her deſire were acquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.

Hereupon hee po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted after <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſtill exclaiming on him with hard words, weening he fled away for feare of him, and often times hee thought to ſmite him with his Launce, but the Prince euermore eſcaped his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: yet his horſe beeing ſore wearied, hindered him very much, when the knight ouer-taking him, thus ſpake. Infamous palliard, and without heart, of theſe three things chuſe the beſt, either to combate, returne or anſwere my demaund.

It may not be now, anſwered the other, till I haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the knight you ſee before, three dayes together: hereto bee added all the ſpeeches betweene <hi>Galaor</hi> and him. In ſooth, replied his Coſen, hee ſhould ſeeme (by your wordes) the greateſt coward in the world, elſe mindeth he ſome enterpriſe of higher conſequence: therefore I will adiourne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of mine iniury, and beare you company, to the ende I may beholde the ſum of your attempt. While thus they talked, <hi>Galaor</hi> had gotten very farre before, which cauſed them make the more haſte after him: till at length the Prince eſpied the ten knights that condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the King, they riding vppe a narrow ſtraite, fiue before him, &amp; fiue behinde. Now did he fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to die, or purchaſe his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for hee was ſo offended to ſee the King bound with chaines, as hee imagined himſelfe able to conquer them all, &amp; as many more if they had been there, whereupon he thus cryed to them: Traytours, durſt you vnreuerently lay hand on the beſt King in the world? With theſe wordes he met one of them ſo directly, as his Launce paſſing through his body, hee fell downe dead beſide his horſe. When the other foure ſaw their companion ſlaine, they willed the for moſt fiue to guard the King, for they would reuenge his death ſufficiently: but they found themſelues very much deceiued, for though the Princes horſe (by reaſon of his ſore trauell) often ſtumbled, and thereby put him in danger of falling, yet laide hee ſuch loade vpon his enemies, as two more of them accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt, and the other twaine were brought into hard extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then came the other fiue with a freſh charge vpon him, when <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> perceiuing his owne danger, intended to reuenge his death and the Kings together, entring coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly among the thickeſt, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt rare and haughty chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When the two Coſens that followed him beheld his behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, confounded with maruell, the one ſayd to the other.

Reſolued thus to ſuccour him, they valiantly thruſt themſelues into the skirmiſh, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering ſuch friendly blowes on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſide, that <hi>Galaor</hi> ſoone felt himſelfe well aſſiſted: becauſe his enemies were ſomewhat more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and hee had leaſure to take a little breathing, but wondering whence this aide ſhould proceed, hee fell to worke againe, giuing them good cauſe to miſdoubt their liues. When the Coſen to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> ſawe how his ſide decayed, and his knights diſhartened, ſlaine and ſore wounded: hee purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to kill the King: who by this time found the meanes to vnbinde himſelfe, and alighting from his horſe, got one of the ſlaine knightes ſwordes, where-with

hee reſiſted his enemies brauely. As the coſin to <hi>Arcalaus</hi> followed his intent, the king gaue his horſe ſuch a blow ouer the face, as by rearing vp, hee fell downe back-ward; yet the Knight recouered himſelfe, and <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing one fight with the king, came to aſſiſt him, when ſnatching off his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, hee would haue ſmitten his head from his ſhoulders: but the king would not ſuffer him, ſaying, hee ſhould liue and dye a theefe.

And thither <hi>Barſinan</hi> now prepared, hoping to take the Queen as hee had done the tower: but he met with ſtronger reſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he expected, and the skirmiſhes proceeding on either ſide, <hi>Barſinan</hi> took a priſoner, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, how king <hi>Arba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> wold with-ſtand him euen to the death. Now began hee to deuiſe, how by faire ſpeech and falſhood he might take the king, crauing a parle with him, whereto king <hi>Arban</hi> willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and ſilence being made on both ſides, <hi>Barſinan</hi> began in this manner.</p>
                  <p>I euer thought til now, my Lord, that you were one of the beſt adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed knights in the world, but by proofe I perceiue a man may finde the contrary: yet this I think with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that what you doe, is for the ſafetie of your honor. Herein you appeare of ſimple iudgement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering in the end, it will bee but the loſſe of you and your men: in reſpect king <hi>Liſuart</hi> your late Lord is dead, for proofe whereof, euen he that ſlew him will ere long ſend me his head. Sith fortune then hath dealt ſo hardly with him, and I at this inſtant am the greateſt Lord in this countrey: dare you denie to make me king? Alas, you abuſe your ſelfe! the beſt will be for you, to yeelde your ſelfe louingly, and I ſhall entreate you ſo well as any Prince in my Realm: ſuffering you ſtill to enioy the countrey of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales,</hi> and particularly beſide will ſo honor you, as you ſhall haue great reaſon to be content. Auaunt villaine, anſwered king <hi>Arban,</hi> full wel dooſt thou manifeſt thy horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſon: for beſide thy treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in compacting the death of my Lord, thou wouldeſt haue mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a traitour to his friends, as thou thy ſelfe haſt prooued. Thou art deceiued, doe the worſt thou canſt: thy villainie onely will take vengeance on thee according to deſert, with ſuch good helpe as we will put thereto. What? ſaid <hi>Barſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> think'ſt thou to hinder me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſitting as king in <hi>London?</hi> Neuer ſhall traitour, replied <hi>Arban,</hi> bee king of <hi>London,</hi> by Gods leaue, while the moſt honourable king of the world liueth. I called for thee, quoth <hi>Barſinan,</hi> in reſpect of thine owne good, becauſe I fauoured thee more then any other, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thou wert of ſound diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but (as I haue ſaid) I finde my ſelfe deceiued, wherefore reaſon requireth, that thy ouer-weening ſhould fall, and (in deſpite of thee) I will reigne king in great <hi>Brittain.</hi> Aſſure thy ſelfe, anſwered <hi>Arban,</hi> I will keepe thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch climbing, as if the king my maiſter were here perſonally preſent. Then began the aſſault afreſh, king <hi>Arban</hi> with-drawing himſelfe to harden his men, being maruailouſly offended at <hi>Barſinans</hi> words. Now though he were very ſharpely aſſailed, yet
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7181:113"/>
ſtood hee brauely on his defence, many being ſlaine and ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: neuertheleſſe, he was euer-more formoſt in the fight, and laſt in the retreits which was cauſed by the night enſuing. Nor neede wee doubt, conſidering the puiſſance of <hi>Barſinan,</hi> and they fewe on the contrary ſide, but king <hi>Arban</hi> would take his aduantage in reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by compelling them to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtreets, where foure on a ſide could hardly deal together, which turned to the great diſaduantage of <hi>Barſinan,</hi> becauſe <hi>Arban</hi> well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified euery place in good order, and with reſh ſupply ſtill encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his men.</p>
                  <p>The retreit being founded, and either ſide with-drawne, King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> ſeeing his ſouldiers ſore wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, by the hotte skirmiſhes they had endured: as is the office of a good Captaine indeede hee came and comforted them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. My louing companions and friends, this day haue you worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fought, as none of you but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth eſtimation, among the moſt forward men in the world, and hauing begun ſo well, I hope you will proceede better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Remember the cauſe of your fight, not onely to maintaine your good king, but your owne liberty: againſt a tirant, traitour, and what worſe? who would buy his vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in this Kingdome, with the blood of you, your wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Saw y ou not how he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them hee tooke in the Tower? Beholde you not the end of his purpoſe? which is to ruinate this noble Realme, that hath (by diuine prouidence) beene ſo long time preſerued, and euer-more conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in reputation, flouriſhing with loyal ſubiects to their Prince? Heard you not the flattering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, which the Rebell vſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſault, thinking to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vs by his golden tongue? In vaine is his labour, I am right well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that no one of you but will die a thouſand deathes, before he ſhall conceiue any other minde in you, I ſee by your reſolued countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if I ſhould thinke or ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I were a monſtrous offender<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if he haue more men then wee, wee haue more hearts of courage then he, which forbiddeth all acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of diſmaying, ſetting before your eyes, the famous account you ſhal liue in hereafter. By their looks you might diſerne at their retire, how vnwillingly they wil be to trie you againe: and reſpect not the traiterous words of <hi>Barſinan,</hi> our king liueth, and will right ſpeedily come to ſuccout vs. In meane while I intreat as my friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, let nothing diſmay your hope, but continue as you haue begun: with famous reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is more honourable to die for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, then to enioy a life by thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſlauerie, vnder a wicked, iniurous, and traiterous Prince. When the king had ended his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was no one in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, how ſore hurt ſoeuer he was, but would couragiouſly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Barſinans</hi> power, and bid him brauely good-morrow next day in the Tower: wherewith the king not a little contented, returned to the Queenes lodging his face couered with ſweate, and his armour all bloody, by reaſon of fiue woundes he receiued in fight. The Ladyes ſeeing him in ſuch pittious plight, were maruailouſly abaſhed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Queene, who well neere dead with griefe and fear together then as a woman in middeſt of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, ſhe ſaid: Alas deer Nephew, what ſhall wee doe? wee are all but
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7181:114"/>
dead. Madame, anſwered king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> all will go well if God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in vaine doe you thus diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your ſelfe, for I hope to heare good tydings of the King: and his traytours that ſeeke to vſurpe the kingdome, by your good and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſubiects ſhall receiue deſerued puniſhment. God grant it, quoth ſhe, but you are ſo wounded, as I thinke it impoſſible for you to bee at the battell, if <hi>Barſinan</hi> come to morrow againe, nor can our men doe anything without you. Be not you troubled therewith Madame, replyed king <hi>Arban,</hi> for while my ſoule ſucks her ſpirit from the ayre, I will not forſake my charge. So bidding her good night, hee went to haue his wounds dreſſed, and afterward turned to his ſouldiers, merrily paſſing the night among them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Barſinan</hi> on the other ſide, got into the Tower of <hi>London</hi> which he had wonne, and numbring his men, found that his power was greatly weakened: yet would hee make no ſhew thereof for diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt, but ſhewing a diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling countenance, thus ſpake to them. My friends, it ſufficeth that I haue ſhewen mine enemies what you are, and they (if I think good) to ſtand at my mercy: wherfore I am determined (without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſſe of you) to reſt our ſelues fiue or ſixe dayes, till <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ſend me the head of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and then the ſight therof, wil make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not dare to reſiſt mee any longer, but in hope of fauour, will yeeld themſelues. Each of you therefore reioyce and be of good cheere, for when I am King, right richly will I reward you all. So went they to reſt till the next morning, when <hi>Barſinan</hi> (being armed) mounted on horſe-backe, with twenty knights in his company, and came to a Port which one of king <hi>Arbans</hi> knights kept, who ſeeing this troupe, preſently ſounded an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme. But <hi>Barſinan</hi> ſent him word how hee came to parle onely, and deſired truce beſide for ſix houres: whereof king <hi>Arban</hi> was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly aduertiſed, who granted the truce <hi>Barſinan</hi> required, &amp; likewiſe for fiue dayes. Conditionally, that he ſhould offer no violence to any houſe in the City, or practiſe any entrance during the limited time: beſide, if the King returned in that ſpace, the difference ſhould bee left to his diſpoſition. <hi>Barſinan</hi> was contented with theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe hee accounted king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> death certaine, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee ſaide to <hi>Arban.</hi> I hope this little truce, will be an entrance into a perpetuall peace betweene vs: for I dare aſſure yee, king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> is dead, and his daughter muſt be my wife, as within theſe fiue dayes enſuing you ſhall euidently ſee. What? quoth king <hi>Arban,</hi> thou haſt then put him to death: and couldſt thou deale ſo treate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with him, that gaue thee ſuch honourable entertainement in his Court? rather will I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die, then continue one houre of peace with thee, get thee gone therefore quickly, or I will ſend thee hence in peeces. Is it true? quoth <hi>Barſinan,</hi> well mayeſt thou threaten me, but it is in me to make thee repent it. Thus returned hee to his ſouldiers, acquainting them with his honeſt offers to king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> and the audacious anſwere he returned for them.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>How <hi>Amadis</hi> came to the ſuccour of the City of <hi>London,</hi> when it was in this diſtreſſe.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot long agoe we left <hi>Amadis</hi> in the wood, familiarly deuiſing with the Princeſſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> thinking on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their ſweete contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and among other diſcourſe, <hi>Amadis</hi> intreated her to tell him, what ſpeeches <hi>Arcalaus</hi> had with her by the way. On my faith Sir, quoth ſhe, he confounded my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with perſwading mee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, ſaying. Before fiue dayes were expired, I ſhould raigne as Queene in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Barſinan</hi> to my husband: him-ſelfe likewiſe ſhould be chiefe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour and Maiſter of his houſe, in recompence of the ſeruices hee did for him, in giuing him my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers head, and mee to be his wife. Ah heauens, ſayde <hi>Amadis,</hi> what treaſon is this in <hi>Barſinan,</hi> who ſhewed himſelfe ſuch a friend to the king? God ſhield hee doe no wrong to the Queene. In ſooth, I greatly doubt it, replyed <hi>Oriana,</hi> it were good therefore wee haſted to ſee. With all my heart, quoth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis:</hi> ſo mounting on horſe-backe, they rode toward <hi>London,</hi> meeting many knights by the way that followed the King, whom ſtill hee directed in their courſe, certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them that <hi>Galaor</hi> was gone likewiſe in his ſearch. Within a while after, <hi>Oriana</hi> eſpied <hi>Don Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi> an auncient knight of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Queene, and twenty knights more with him, who all that night had ſearched the Forreſt for the king: but when hee ſawe her, the teares ſtoode in his eyes with ioy, deſiring to heare ſome newes of the King her father. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit mee Sir, quoth ſhee, not farre from the Citie were we ſundered, when God ordayned ſo well for me, that <hi>Amadis</hi> deliuered me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the villaines, and ranſomed mee with the price of their liues. They were vnwiſe to reſiſt, ſaide <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> when you had ſo good a Champion: but I pray you my Lord, what is become of your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Euen in the ſame place, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> where they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the father from the daughter: we ſeuered our ſelues, hee poſting after the King, and I followed <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus,</hi> who led away Madame <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana.</hi> The better hope haue I of his ſuccour, quoth <hi>Grumedan,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo good a knight hath taken it in hand.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, <hi>Amadis</hi> tolde him the horrible treaſon of <hi>Arcalans</hi> and <hi>Barſinan:</hi> Let me therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate yee, quoth hee, to conduct the Princeſſe leaſurably after, while I make haſte before leaſt the Queen be diſtreſſed, becauſe I doubt the traytor will her offer iniury. I think it likewiſe expedient, that you cauſe all the knights to returne you meete withall: for if the King ſhould bee reskewed by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of men, there is enow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore already, and more then needs. So leauing his Lady with <hi>Don Grumedan,</hi> hee made all the haſte hee could towarde <hi>London,</hi> ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Squire by the way that came from the king, who told him all the newes of his deliuerance, which was no little ioy to <hi>Amadis,</hi>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:7181:115"/>
hearing the fortunate ſucceſſe of his brother <hi>Galaor.</hi> There met hee with another likewiſe, who made report of <hi>Barſinans</hi> dealings at <hi>London,</hi> wherefore entring the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſo couertly as hee might, the firſt hee met withall was king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> of whom hee was louingly embraced and welcommed, with requeſt of what newes he brought. None but good, anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and ſuch as you are deſirous to heare: but becauſe I doubt the Queene is ſcant merry, let vs goe ſee her, for happely ſhee will bee glad of our comming. So rode they to the Court together, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſtill keeping the Squire with him that came from the king, and when they entered the Queenes preſence, <hi>Amadis</hi> falling on his knee, beganne in this manner. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, this Gentleman left the King well this morning, and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, whereof his Maieſty certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth you by him: my ſelfe likewiſe (not long ſince) left your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with <hi>Don Grumedan,</hi> and very ſhortly they will be with you. But becauſe I vnderſtand that <hi>Barſinan</hi> moleſteth you with trechery, ſuffer vs I pray you to goe ſee what hee can doe. When the Queen heard theſe ioyfull tydings, her inwarde content tooke away the liberty of of her ſpeech, nor could ſhe doe any thing but lift her hands &amp; eyes to heauen, applauding his name from whence this good procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and by geſtures deliuering ſome ſigne of thankes to <hi>Amadis.</hi> At length hauing ouercome this delightfull paſſion, and intending to queſtion further concerning theſe newes: the allarme was ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wherefore king <hi>Arban</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> hyed to the barres, where they found <hi>Barſinans</hi> men giuing an eager charge, as hoping to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the contrarie part. But <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> thruſting himſelfe for-moſt, cauſed the bars to be taken down, and accompanied with king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> brake in couragiouſly vpon the enemy, a noble preſident to their ſouldiers, who beeing chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this onſet, tooke heart and followed. Now wexed the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to be hot indeed, ſo that on both ſides very many were ſlaine, which <hi>Barſinan</hi> perceiuing, &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in his multitude to ſuppreſſe the weaker part, came formoſt himſelfe in perſon, thinking (now hee ſaw the barres open) to driue his aduerſaries backe againe into the Citie. When <hi>Amadis</hi> noted his forwardneſſe he ſtepped backe, &amp; changed his Creaſt and Shield with a ſimple mercinary ſouldier: yet reſeruing his Launce, which with a ſtrong carreer pierced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his Armour, and wounding <hi>Barſinan,</hi> brake in peeces in his fleſh. Then drawing his ſword, he gaue him ſuch a ſtroke on the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, as hee was aſtonied therewith, and redoubling his blowe, cut his right arme quite from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: when <hi>Barſinan</hi> (feeling himſelf ſo wounded) would haue retyred backe, to ſaue himſelfe by the ſpeed of his horſe, but hee fell to the ground as depriued of his ſences. Wherefore <hi>Amadis</hi> left him, and ſet vpon the reſt, who beeing vnable to endure theſe hotte aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, likewiſe beholding their Lord diſmounted: took the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to flight for ſafety of their liues, yet were they ſo cloſely followed, as the moſt part of them were ſlain in the field, and ſome few of them eſcaped into the Tower, cauſing the bridge to be quickly drawen vp after them.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> returned where he left <hi>Barſinan</hi> &amp; becauſe he
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7181:115"/>
was not yet dead, commanded he ſhould be carried to the Queenes lodging, there to bee kept till the Kings returne: and as hee would haue put vp his ſword, hee ſawe it ſoyled with blood, wherefore in wiping it, hee ſaide: Thou truſtie ſworde, in a happy houre was the knight born to whom thou belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt: and as thou art one of the beſt in the world, ſo is thy Maſter the moſt vertuous Prince liuing. He vſed theſe words, becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and was ſent him from the Queene by <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> as you heard before: but now returnes hee with king <hi>Arban</hi> to the Queenes lodging, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her with newes of happie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                  <p>All this while the King is haſting toward <hi>London,</hi> giuing order to returne all the knights hee met by the way, among whom were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies, Galuanes, Soliuan, Galda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Dinada<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s</hi> was one of the beſt knights of the kings linage, and well eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men of account, as well in reſpect of his vertues, as alſo his braue behauiour in chiualry: ſo according to the kings command, he rode away preſently very braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied.</p>
                  <p>The king likewiſe followed an indifferent pace, left his Nephew ſhould ſtand in need of helpe, and by the way he ouertooke <hi>Don Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi> with his daughter <hi>Oriana.</hi> How ioyfull this meeting was, you may eaſily conceiue, that the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was not ſo grieuous, but this was as gladſome. <hi>Grumedan</hi> told his Maieſty, how <hi>Amadis</hi> left the Princeſſe with him, while hee rode before to aſſiſt the Queene: thus with repetition of many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they beguiled the time till they arriued at <hi>London,</hi> where hee vnderſtoode the ſucceſſe of <hi>Barſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans</hi> enterpriſe, and how valiantly King <hi>Arban</hi> had reſiſted him, not forgetting the worthy behauiour of <hi>Amadis,</hi> in taking him priſoner and diſcomfiting his men, except a few that ſaued themſelues in the Tower.</p>
                  <p>Here would it aske a worlde of time, to report the ioy, pleaſure, and contentment betweene the King and Queen at their meeting, likewiſe the mothers comfort ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing recouered her daughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: but as your iudgements can better conceiue then I ſet downe, matter aboue the reach of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon capacity, ſo doe I leaue it to you, and proceed to the King. Who to terrifie the traytours thus gotten into holde, beſieged them ſeuerally, and to diſhearten them the more, brought <hi>Barſinan</hi> &amp; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> Nephew before the walles, where before all the people they confeſſed their treaſon. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, a great fire was made, wherein they were aliue conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but when they in the Tower beheld this ſpectacle, and that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7181:116"/>
they were in great want of victals, they yeelded themſelues to the Kings mercy, the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being (for examples ſake) hanged on the battlements, and the reſt ſet at liberty vpon humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Yet this matter bred very great trouble afterward, betweene them of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> &amp; <hi>Sanſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua:</hi> for the ſonne of <hi>Barſinan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good knight, vexed king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> with contagious warre, as in the Hiſtory hereafter at large is mentioned.</p>
                  <p>After the King had eſcaped theſe misfortunes, the former ioyes and paſtimes beganne againe: during which time, the Lady and her two ſonnes (the meſſengers of <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> who were witneſſes when <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> promiſed to forſake king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> ſeruice) arriued at the Court. When the two Princes were aduertiſed thereof, they went and friendly entertained her, ſhee ſaying: Gentlemen you know the cauſe of my comming, are you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to keepe your promiſe? We are, quoth they, and will not breake our couenant with <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> but preſently will performe it before the King. Entring the great Hall, the Lady fell on her knees before his Maieſty, deliuering theſe ſpeeches. My Lord, I am come to your Court, to ſee if theſe two knights will obſerue a couenant, which in my preſence they made to a Lady. What was it? anſwered the King. A matter that will ſcant like you, quoth the Lady, or any ſuch as beare you affection: and thereto ſhee added the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. Wherat the King wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat offended, told <hi>Galaor</hi> that hee had very much wronged him. My Lord, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> it was better to do ſo, then be treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſlaine, for had wee beene knowne, neither you, nor all the world could haue ſaued our liues: but let not your Maieſty be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the remedy ſhall be more ready then you expect. In accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing my promiſe to <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> of <hi>Gantaſi,</hi> my Lord I take my leaue of you, departing altogether from your ſeruice: certifying you that it is her will to doe you this diſpleaſure, and worſe if ſhe ſhould compaſſe it, for the extreame mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice ſhe beareth to you. <hi>Amadis</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed what his brother had done, then <hi>Galaor</hi> turning to the Lady &amp; her two ſonnes, ſayd. Haue we not now accompliſh our promiſe? Yes truely, quoth the Lady, wee muſt needs auouch ſo much. You may then returne when you pleaſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> but tell <hi>Madaſima,</hi> ſhe did not ſo much as ſhe weened, as you may perceiue by the preſent effect. Now my Lord, quoth he to the King, we haue fulfilled our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and becauſe in graunting her earneſt deſire, the time was not limited how long we ſhould leaue your ſeruice: we may enter thereinto againe when you pleaſe to command, ſo that we are yours as faithfull as before. When the King and all that were preſent heard what had paſt, they reioyced exceedingly, eſteeming <hi>Galaor</hi> &amp; <hi>Amadis</hi> well aduiſed herein: where-upon the King thus ſpake to the Lady. According to her great treaſon vnder ſhaddowe of good meaning, they are bound to no more then they haue accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for to deceiue the deceiuer is no deceit. And ſay to <hi>Madaſima;</hi> ſeeing ſhe hateth me ſo vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſhe once had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in her power, who might haue grieued me all my life time: but God hauing in other places deliuer'd me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many perils wil not ſuffer me to periſh by ſo bad

woman as ſhe is. I deſire yee my Lord, quoth ſhe, to tell mee their names. The one is <hi>Amadis,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King, and the other his brother <hi>Galaor.</hi> May it be poſſible, ſayde the Lady, that <hi>Madaſima</hi> had <hi>Amadis</hi> in her power? Credit me, quoth the King, I haue tolde yee truth. Their fortune was good, replyed the Lady, for they might not haue eſcaped if ſhe had known them: and in ſooth the deede might bee reckoned ominous, if two ſuch worthy perſons had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. Yet when ſhe ſhall knowe hereof, ſayd the King, I thinke ſhe will forbeare to wrong me any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. With that the Lady tooke her leaue, ſhaping her courſe the ſame way ſhe came.</p>

                     <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſpeaking for all the reſt, ſayd. My Lord, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Briſtoia</hi> hath threatened and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all knights errant, we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to anſwere his challenge. In good faith, anſwered the King, if it bee ſo, hee hath attempted an ouer fond warre, for I thinke there is no knight in the worlde ſo puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, that will bee induced to ſuch an entetpriſe. But forbeare at this time, and offer him no iniury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is heere to receiue iuſtice: which ſhall be done, according to the counſell of the Princes and Lords preſent, without fauouring any one. Then <hi>Oliuas</hi> falling on his knee before the King, beganne in this manner. My Lord, the Duke who ſtandeth before your Maieſty, hath ſlaine a Coſen germaine of mine, hee neuer giuing him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offence: wherefore I will iuſtifie him to bee a villaine and a traytour, and will make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it with his owne mouth, elſe ſhall I kill him and caſt him forth of the field. The Duke tolde him hee lyed, and hee was ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what the King and his Court ſhould ordaine: wherupon it was determined, that this emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould bee decided by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which the Duke accepted, deſiring the King to permit him &amp; his two Nephewes in this cauſe, againſt <hi>Oliuas</hi> and two other knights. This being granted, the Duke was very glad thereof, for he made ſuch account of his kinſmen, as hee thought <hi>Oliuas</hi> could not bring the like: notwithſtanding, all was deferred till the morrowe following.</p>
                  <p>In meane while, <hi>Don Galuanes</hi> asked his Nephew <hi>Agraies,</hi> if hee wold aſſiſt <hi>Oliuas</hi> againſt the Duke, and hee conſenting thereto, <hi>Galua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> came to <hi>Oliuas,</hi> ſaying. Sir <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuas,</hi> ſeeing the Duke is deſirous to fight three againſt three, my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew and I are determined to take your part: which when the Duke heard, hee remembred that he had defied them in his owne houſe, when <hi>Agraies</hi> combated with the Dwarffes champion, at what time the Damoſell ſhould haue beene burned: wherefore hee became ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry penſiue, in reſpect though he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed his Nephewes approued good knights, yet he repented his wilfull offer, &amp; gladly would haue excuſed the matter if hee could, being ſo well acquainted with the behauiour of <hi>Galuanes</hi> &amp; <hi>Agraies.</hi> But conſidering his promiſe paſt before the King, and ſo many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonages there preſent, hee muſt of neceſſity ſtand thereto: wherefore the next morning hee entered the Liſtes with his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, and <hi>Oliuas</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with his copartners. Now were the Ladies ſtanding at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, to beholde the iſſue of this quarrell, and among the reſt ſtood <hi>Oliuia</hi> the faire friend to <hi>Agraies,</hi> who ſeeing him ready to enter ſuch perill, was ſo diſmayed, as ſhe could ſcant tell what countenance to vſe. By her ſtood <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſhee being in no leſſe griefe for her Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and brother together: likewiſe the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> louing them both, in reſpect of the reaſons heretofore declared, accompanied the two Ladies in ſorrowe, fearing their danger: but the knights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to the combate, the King by a Herald commanded the Champions to doe their deuoyre. Heereupon with a braue carreer they encountred together, <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> vnhorſing the two Nephewes, and albeit <hi>Oliuas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a wound on the ſtomacke, yet had not the Duke caught
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7181:117"/>
hold about his horſe neck, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had proued as had as his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drawing their ſwords, they ſmote ſo violently againſt ech other, as the ſtanders by wondered at their fiercenes: beholding their ſhields defaced, their armour bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred &amp; coullered with their blood, that the victorie hung a long time in ſuſpence. For <hi>Agrates</hi> horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaine vnder him, brought his life in maruailous hazard, becauſe the Duke and one of his Nephews ſtroue to keep him downe, ſeeking to thruſt their ſwords into his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or elſe to ſmite his head from his ſhoulders: but he was ſo well armed, and of ſuch courage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as hee held them both play, though with exceeding perill. Well may you thinke, that his friends grieued to ſee him in this diſtreſſe, eſpecially the three La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, of whom we ſpake ſo lately, whoſe cheekes were bedewed with whole fountaines of teares, and wofull <hi>Oliuia</hi> ſeemed rather dead then liuing. But had he long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this extreamity, her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt houer muſt needes haue enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet at length he recouered him-ſelfe, charging the Duke and his Nephewes with ſuch puiſſant ſtrokes, as well declared his hardy courage. <hi>Oliuas</hi> all this while was in ſuch caſe, by reaſon of the ſore wound the Duke gaue him, that he could hardly defend himſelfe: which the Duke perceiuing, hee left his Nephew with <hi>Agraies,</hi> and aſſailing <hi>Oliuas</hi> very roughly, made him fall downe in a great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But as he would haue ſlaine him, <hi>Agraies</hi> ſtepped betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (hauing diſpatched his enemie of his head) and hindred the Duke from his determination, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him in many places on his body, that he could ſcant tel which way to turne him. <hi>Don Galuanes</hi> likewiſe hauing ſlaine the other Nephew, came to aſſiſt <hi>Agraies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke, who ſeeing his life at the lateſt exigent, turned his horſe to eſcape away: but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> gaue him ſuch a ſtroke on the helmet, as hee fell beſide his ſaddle, with one of his feete han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the ſtirrop, when the horſe being at libertie, feeling his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then hang on the one ſide, ranne flinging vp and downe, none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to reskew the Duke, till his necke was broken with drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging along. Hereupon <hi>Agraies</hi> left him, returning to his vncle to know how he fared. Very well I thanke God, anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> but it grieueth mee that <hi>Oliuas</hi> is dead, for hee lieth ſtill and moueth not. Right ſorry likewiſe was <hi>Agraies</hi> to heare theſe words, wherefore commanding the Duke and his Nephewes bodyes to be throwne foorth of the field, they came both to <hi>Oliuas,</hi> and finding him aliue, as alſo his wounds not to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, they bound them vp ſo well as they could, ſaying. Friend <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uas,</hi> be of good cheere, for though you haue loſt very much blood, yet doubt wee not of your health, becauſe wee finde little danger in your hurts, Alas my Lords, quoth <hi>Oliuas,</hi> my heart fainteth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I haue beene heeretofore wounded, yet neuer was I in ſuch debilitie. Then the King deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to knowe whether hee were dead or no, and when it was tolde him, how hee wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſpeedy cure: hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to bee honourably caryed into the Citie, and his own cirurgions to attend on his health, euen as it were his owne perſon: which he did, promiſing, to deliuer him well againe within few daies.</p>

Thus euery one returned, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diuerſly on the end of the Combat, and according to their particular affections, ſo that ſoone after, the Queene (who was one of the beſt Ladies in the world) was aduiſed to ſend for the wife to the deceaſed Duke, that in the Court ſhee might weare away the cauſe of her melancholly, and to diſpatch this buſineſſe, ſhee ſent <hi>Don Grumedan</hi> to her requeſting ſhe would bring her, Neece <hi>Aldena</hi> with her, whereof <hi>Galuanes</hi> was not a little glad, eſpecially <hi>Don Guilan,</hi> who was the friend and beloued of the Dutcheſſe.

                  <p>By this time the Dwarffe ouer-tooke <hi>Amadis</hi> and the reſt, when they began to ride ſomwhat faſter, <hi>Amadis</hi> not requiring any thing of him, nor he reciting what he tolde the Princeſſe, but ſhewed him the peeces of the Sworde he brought. Not farre had they ridden, but they met a Damoſell, who after ſhe had ſaluted them, demanded whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they trauailed, ſaying, ſhee would aduiſe them to forſake that way. Wherefore? anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> Becauſe, quoth ſhe, for the ſpace of fifteene dayes, no Knight errant paſſed this way, but he hath beene eyther wounded or ſlaine. And who hath done them ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure? ſaid <hi>Amadis.</hi> A Knight, anſwered the Damoſell, the moſt valiant man at Armes that euer was ſeene. I pray ye Damoſell, quoth <hi>Agraies,</hi> bring vs where wee may ſee him. You cannot ride far in this Forreſt, ſaid ſhe, but he will quickly ſhew himſelfe. So trauail they on with the Damoſell, and long time they neyther heard nor ſaw any one, which made them thinke ſhee ſpake theſe words to feare them: yet ſooreafter, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> eſpyed the Knight, who ſeemed a man of goodly ſtature, and ready prepared for the combat. As hee and his companions ſtood behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, they heard him ſpeak to a ſquire, who reared foure Launces againſt a Tree, and afterward came to them, ſaying. Gentlemen, my Maiſter giueth you to vnderſtand, how during the ſpace of fifteene dayes, hee hath vndertaken the guard of this Forreſt, in all which time his fortune hath beene, not to be vanquiſhed by any one: And though it be a day and a halfe ſince his intended tearme is expired, yet ſtayeth hee here till now for the pleaſure he hath in Iouſting. And as he was departing hence, he eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you comming: wherefore hee letteth you know, that if each of you will breake a Launce, he careth not to try his fortune with you, prouided, that the combat at the Sword be ſpared, becauſe hee ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome proceedeth ſo farre without doing more harme then willingly he would.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Agraies</hi> heard this meſſage, hee tooke his Armes, returning this anſwere. Friend, goe tell thy Maiſter I am content to try the louſt with him. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he gaue the ſpurres to his horſe, and the knight ſeeing him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gaue forth to meete him, their Launces being broken in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: But <hi>Agraies</hi> was eaſily caſt from his Horſe, of which foyle he could not but be aſhamed.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7181:119"/>
                     <hi>Galaor</hi> beholding his Cozin dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, determined to reuenge his wrong, bidding the knight to prepare himſelfe, who taking ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Launce, ran againſt <hi>Galaor</hi> with ſuch furie, as after their ſtaues were broken, their bodies met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo vehemently, that <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe being more feeble then the other, fell downe with his Maſter on bis back, but the Prince not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering himſelfe, was left on the ground, when the horſearoſe, and ran about the field, as the other of <hi>Agraies</hi> did. <hi>Amadis</hi> abaſhed at theſe accidents preparing himſelf, ſaid to the Knight. I know not what thou art, but thou maiſt vant, that thou haſt diſmounted two ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued good Knights. So coutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Launce, proceeded for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but <hi>Galaor</hi> ſtayed him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Knight to the combat, which made <hi>Amadis</hi> thus to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Brother, finde not your ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e agrieued with him, becauſe he ſent vs word before the Iouſt, that he would not combat with the Sword: but I hope to take reuenge for all.</p>
                  <p>Herewith they encountred valiantly together, breaking their Launces ſo couragiouſly, and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with their bodies ſo violently, as <hi>Amadis</hi> was thrown to the earth his horſes ſhoulder being broken in the fall: in like manner was the Knight diſmounted, bat keeping the reynes of his bridle in his hand, he quickly mounted on horſe back againe, when <hi>Amadis,</hi> thus ſpake to him. We muſt trie one courſe more, if thou wilt haue the honor, for as yet it is not won, becauſe we both were vnhorſed. I will not now Iouſt any more, anſwered the Knight. Then you do me wrong, replied <hi>Amadis.</hi> Redreſſe it if you can ſaid the Knight: for according to my order before the Iouſt, I am bound to no more then what I haue done. After theſe words, he gallopped away through the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſo faſt as he could: which when <hi>Amadis,</hi> and his companions ſaw, they being all on foote, they ſtood as men aſhamed, for they could not imagine what he was that thus intreated them, whereupon <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> mounted on <hi>Gandalins</hi> horſe, ſaying to his friends: Follow me if you pleaſe, for it would grieue me not to know the name of this Knight. In ſooth, anſwered the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, it were the greateſt folly in you, aboue all the knights belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to thinke you can finde him in one whole yeere, vnleſſe you be directly gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Faire Damoſell, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> it may be you know what he is, and the place where he abideth. On my faith, quoth ſhe, if I know any thing thereof, I meane not to tell it you: for neuer will I iniurie ſo good a Knight. Damoſell, replied <hi>Galaor,</hi> by the affection you beare to the thing you moſt loue in the World, tell vs I pray ye what you know in this matter. You coniure me in vaine, quoth ſhe, for neuer will I diſcouer his affaires, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you deliuer me ſome good preſent.</p>
                  <p>Demand what you will anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> and you ſhall haue it, on condition you helpe vs to finde the knight. I am content, replyed the Damoſell, if firſt you will tell mee your names, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward each of you grant me a boone, at what time I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them of you: With all our hearts, quoth <hi>Amadis:</hi> as for our names, the one is <hi>Galaor,</hi> the other <hi>Agraies,</hi> and my ſelfe am <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> When the Damoſell heard this, ſhee was very glad, ſaying:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7181:120"/>
Certes my Lord, my iourney is ſhortned, for I ſeeke you. Then you haue now found me, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> what is your will with me? That you ſhall know, quoth ſhee, when time ſerueth: but do you not remember the combate, which you promiſed to performe for the king of <hi>Sobradiſaes</hi> daughter, when ſhee ſuccoured you by meanes of the Lyons? Yes that I doe, ſayde <hi>Amadis,</hi> and now am I riding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her. Would you then, quoth the Damoſell, follow a knight ſo hard to be found, and the time for the combate beeing neerer then you weene? She ſaith very well my Lord, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> doe you therefore and <hi>Agraies</hi> proceede on your iourney, and I will ſeeke the knight with this Damoſell: for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhal I reſt til I haue found him: &amp; if it be poſſible, I will be with you before you deale with <hi>Abiſeos.</hi> Be it ſo, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> but ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vs to tell his name, &amp; where we may find him. His name, quoth the Damoſell, I cannot tell ye, for I know it not my ſelfe, and yet I haue beene a moneth with him, in which time I haue ſeene him doe ſuch deedes of armes, as without fight thereof I would neuer haue credited: but where he is now, I can conduct him thither that will goe with me. It is all I requeſt, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor.</hi> Follow mee then, quoth ſhe: ſo taking their leaue, they ſeperated themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> hold on their way, arriuing within fewe dayes after at the Caſtle of <hi>Torin,</hi> where they ſound the faire <hi>Brtola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> with the ancient Lady: but when <hi>Amadis</hi> beheld her, he found her maruailouſly changed, for if ſhee were faire when hee firſt ſawe her, ſhe now ſeemed of ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perfection, 25 (except <hi>Oriana,)</hi> he reputed her the moſt beautifull creature in the world, whereupon he ſayde to <hi>Agraies.</hi> If nature was deſirous to expreſſe her cunning in a creature, in this Lady ſhe hath moſt ſufficiently accompliſhed it. My Lord, quoth ſhe, full long haue we expected your comming, for in you conſiſteth our onely hope. Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> by the helpe of God, I truſt you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer your loſſe, and we will doe our vttermoſt therein. As thus they deuiſed, they entred a faire chamber, where mantles were brought to wrap about them, and <hi>Briolania</hi> holp to vnarme <hi>Amadis,</hi> for ſhe could not be ſatisfied with beholding him, becauſe ſhe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him the faireſt knight that euer was ſeene, being now but twenty yeeres of age. And ſo pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly did hee regard her, as long time after ſhe waved amourous, ſo that when ſhe had recouered her Kingdome, ſhe wiſhed him ſole Lord of her and her countrye together, as ſhall heereafter be declared. But <hi>Amadis</hi> was elſe-where addicted, and gaue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe to her, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame anguiſhes hee endured for his <hi>Oriana,</hi> were manifeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of his ſtedfaſtloyalty. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, the young Lord of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi> pitrying faire <hi>Brtolania,</hi> would diſguiſe this hiſtorie in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other manner, deſcribing farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the loue of her &amp; <hi>Amadis,</hi> which report is worthy of no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. For he ſaith, that <hi>Brtolania</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored into her Kingdome, prouiding for the health of <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Agraics,</hi> who were wounded, ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing euermore amorous of <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſeeing by no means ſhee could winne him to bee her friend, tooke aſide the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to whome <hi>Amadis, Galaor</hi>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:7181:120"/>
and <hi>Agraies</hi> made the ſeuerall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, at what time ſhe conducted <hi>Galaor</hi> to the knight that iouſted with them in the Forreſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering the chiefeſt ſecrets of her Heart to her, with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teares and affectionate ſighes, requeſted her counſell and remedy in theſe amorous paſſions. The Damoſell compaſſionate on her Ladies ſickneſſe, promiſed to giue her redreſſe for it, whereupon ſhe ſaid to <hi>Amadis,</hi> that the boone ſhe would deſire of him, was his entrance into the Tower, from whence he ſhould not depart, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had begotten of <hi>Briolania</hi> a Sonne or a Daughter. <hi>Amadis</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to keepe promiſe with the Damoſel, yeelded therto, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any will to touch <hi>Briolania:</hi> whereby he grew into ſuch melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, as he refuſed all bodily ſuſtenance, and fell into ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his perſon, as euery houre he expected death. Which being heard in the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> as alſo his deadly dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamitie: <hi>Oriana</hi> (loth to loſe him) ſent him word and licence, that he ſhould do what the Lady reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Whereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering hee might no way elſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, and his gracious Miſtreſſe pittyed him ſo much, he begat a Sonne and a daughter of <hi>Briolania,</hi> whereof ſhe was deliuered of at one labour: but this Hiſtory is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together falſe and faigned. It might be that <hi>Amadis</hi> was priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Tower, and <hi>Briolania</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his daily pining away: but ſhe deſired the Damoſell to remit him this boone, on condition he ſhould not depart till his brother <hi>Galaor</hi> returned, as willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her ſelfe with the ſight of him, while ſhe attended his brothers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall: for <hi>Galaor</hi> eſpouſed her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, as you ſhall reade in the fourth booke of this Hiſtory. Let it then ſuffice at this time, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> ſoiourne certain daies in the Caſtle, while all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things were ready for their combat.</p>

                     <p>How <hi>Galaor</hi> went with the Damoſell after the Knight that diſmounted him and his companions in the Forreſt, whom when he found, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated together, and afterward in the ſharpeſt point of their combat, they knew each other.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>our daies together, rode <hi>Galaor</hi> with the Damoſell, ſeeking the Knight that vnhorſed him in the Forreſt, for which he was ſo ouercome with anger, as euery knight hee met withall deerely felt it, becauſe in combat many receiued their death. Then eſpying a faire Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle on the top of a high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the Damoſell told him, there was no other place neere where they might lodge that night: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being glad to accept there-of, they came to the Caſtle, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many Gentlemen and Ladies ſporting together, among whom was a Knight aged about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeares, who taking <hi>Galaor</hi> by the hand, did him all the honour might be deuiſed. My Lord, quoth, <hi>Galaor,</hi> your courteſie to vs is ſo great, that albeit we were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7181:121"/>
to paſſe further on our way, yet for your ſake we are content to ſtay with you this night. Then the knight conducted <hi>Galaor,</hi> into a faire Chamber, leauing the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell among the other Ladies; and after the Prince was vnarmed, the knight ſpake to him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Here Sir may you reſt and take your eaſe, calling for any thing you ſtand in neede of: for God knows I haue vſed ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement not onely to you, but to all knights errant that paſſed this way, becauſe ſome time I haue beene as now you are. Yet hath nature giuen mee two Sonnes, whoſe onely delight is in ſearch of aduentures, but now they lie ſicke in their beds, beeing cruelly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Knight, who with one Launce caſt them both from their Saddles. But they were ſo aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at this foyle, as they mounted againe and purſued the knight, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaking him as hee entred a Barque to paſſe the water, where my Sonnes ſaid to him, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he had iouſted ſo well, they would trie his fortune in combat with the Sword: but the knight made anſwere he could not now intend it, yet would they needes preſſe him ſo farre, as to hinder his entrance into the Barque. Where upon a Lady being in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſaid, they wronged her ouer much to ſtay her Knight: but they were not to depart, til he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with them at the Sword. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it will be no otherwiſe replied the Lady, he ſhall enter ſight with the better of you both, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if he be conqueror, the other do forbeare the Combat. They anſwered, if the one were vanquiſhed, the other would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his foyle, which when the Knight heard, he was ſo angry, as he bad them both come together, in reſpect they were importunate and would not reſt contented. In the triall, one of my ſons ſuſtained the worſt, wherefore his brother ſeeing him in ſuch perill, ſtroue to reskue him from death: yet all was in vaine, for the knight handled them ſo roughly, as he left them like dead men in the field, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward paſſed away in the Barque. No ſooner heard I of this miſhap, but I ſent for my Sonnes, &amp; home were they brought in this daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous plight: but that you may giue credit to my words, behold here their Armour cut and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, as I thinke the like ſtroakes neuer came from any mans hand. <hi>Galaor</hi> maruailing at this diſcourſe, demanded what Armes the conquering knight bare: when he was anſwered, his Shield to be of vermilion colour, with two black Lions figured therein: By theſe tokens <hi>Galaor</hi> knew him, that it was the ſame man he trauailed to finde, which made him demand of his friendly hoſt, if he had no further knowledge of the Knight. No verily Sir, quoth the auncient Gentleman. For this night, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> let vs take our reſt, and to morrow I intend to ſeeke the man you talke of. For already I haue trauiled foure daies in his ſearch: but if I meete with him, I hope to reuenge the iniuries of your Sonnes, and other likewiſe whom he hath offended, or elſe it will coſt the price of my life. I could rather wiſh ſaid the Knight, that leauing this perillous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, you would take ſome other courſe, ſeeing my two Sonnes haue beene ſo hardly intreated, their own wilfull folly being cauſe thereof. So breaking off talke, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> took his reſt till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7181:121"/>
when taking leaue of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient knight, he rode away with the Damoſell, who brought him to the place of paſſage in the Barque: where croſſing the water to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, they came to a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Caſtle, whither the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel rode before, aduiſing the Prince to ſtay her returne. She taryed not long, but comming back againe, brought another Damoſel with her of excellent beauty, and ten men beſide all on horſe-back: after the faire Gentlewoman had ſaluted <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhe ſaid. Sir, this Damoſell that came in your company, telleth me, how you ſeeke a knight, who beareth two black Lyons in a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million ſhield, and are deſirous to know his name: this is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that you nor any other can finde him for three yeeres ſpace, but onely by force of armes, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not ſo eaſie to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by you, for perſwade your ſelfe, his like is not to be found in all the Iſles of great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> yet will I not giue ouer his ſearch, although hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale him ſelfe in this ſort: and if I meete with him, it ſhall like mee better to combate with him, then to know my demand by any other way. Seeing then, anſwered the Damoſell, your deſire is ſuch, I will ſhew you him within three dayes enſuing, for this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſake, being my coſin, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her promiſe hath ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreated me. <hi>Galaor</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with many thankes, and ſo they trauailed on, arriuing in the euening at an arme of the Sea, where they found a Barque ready for paſſage to a little Iſland, and certaine mariners in it, who made them all ſweare, if they had any more then one knight in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. No, credit me, replied the Damoſell: hereupon they ſet ſayle and away. Then <hi>Galaor</hi> demanded of the Damoſell, the reaſon why they tooke ſuch an oath. Becauſe, quoth ſhe, the Lady of the Iſle whither we goe, hath ſo ordained it, that they ſhall let paſſe but one knight at one time: and no other muſt they bring till his returne, or credible intelligence of his death. What is hee, ſaide <hi>Galaor,</hi> that vanquiſheth or killeth them? The ſelfe ſame knight you ſeeke, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Damoſell, whom the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath kept with her more then halfe a yeere, intirely louing him: and the cauſe of this affection proceedeth from a Tourney, which not long ſince hee maintained in this countrey, for the loue of her and another faire Lady, whom the knight (being a ſtanger here) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, defending her cauſe with whome he now is, and euer ſince ſhee bare him ſuch affection, as without grant of his loue ſhe wold haue dyed. Sometime hee is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſeeke after ſtrange aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but then the Lady to detaine him ſtill in this place, cauſeth ſuch knights as come hither to paſſe one after another againſt whom he combateth, and not one hath yet returned vnuanquiſhed: ſuch as die in fight are there interred, and the foyled ſent back againe, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyled of their horſe and armes, which the knight preſenteth to his Lady, ſhee being one of the faireſt creatures in the world, named <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſanda,</hi> and the Iſle <hi>Brauiſande.</hi> Know you not the cauſe, ſaid <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> wherefore the knight went not many dayes ſince, to a Forreſt where I found him, and kept the paſſage there fifteene dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt all ſuch as trauailed that way? Yes mary, quoth the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel, he promiſed a boone to a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7181:122"/>
Lady before he came hither, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe intreated him to keep the Forreſt for the ſpace of fifteene dayes: yet hardly hee got licence of his faire Miſtreſſe, who allowed him but a moneth to ſtay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>
                  <p>By this time they were landed, and come before a goodly Caſtle, where ſtood a pillar or Marble, with a horne hanging on it, which the Damoſell bad him winde, and the Knight would come forth at the ſound thereof. After he had giuen a good blaſt, certaine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges came forth of the Caſtle, who ſet vp a Pauilion in the middeſt of the field, and ſix Ladies (ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) came walking forth one of them ſeeming by her geſture and countenance, to be commander of the reſt, taking her place accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in the Tent. I maruaile, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> the knight tarryeth ſo long, I deſire one of you to will the Lady ſend for him, becauſe buſines elſe-where of great importance, forbiddeth me to trifle time here in vaine. One of the Damoſells ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his requeſt. What? anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> maketh he ſo ſmall account of our Knight? thinketh hee ſo eaſily to eſcape from him? hath he ſuch mind of other affaires before hee ſee the end of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? indeede I thinke he ſhall returne ſooner then he expecteth, but with ſlender aduantage for him to bragge of: then calling a Page, ſhe ſaid. Goe and bid the ſtrange Knight come forth. The Page quickly did his meſſage, and ſoone after, the Knight came forth on foote, being all armed except with his Helmet, which was brought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him with his Launce, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Page leading his Courſer when he came before his Lady, ſhe ſaid. Behold Sir, here is a braue Knight, who thinketh lightly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome you, &amp; accounteth him-ſelfe aſſured of the victory: I pray you let him know the price of his folly. After theſe wordes ſhe kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and embraced him, but <hi>Galaor</hi> noting all theſe miſteries, thought he tarried too long from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: at length the Knight being mounted, they prepared themſelus to the cariere, and breaking their Launces in the encounter, were both wounded. <hi>Galaor</hi> preſently drew his Sword, but the knight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to Iouſt once more. With all my heart, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> yet I am ſory my horſe is not ſo good as yours, for if it were: I could be content not to giue ouer till one of vs lay along on the ground, or all theſe Launces bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in peeces. The Knight made him no anſwere, but commanded a ſquire to bring them other ſtaues, and meeting together, <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe was almoſt down: the knight likewiſe loſt his ſtirrops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad to catch holde by the mane of his horſe, whereat as one ſomewhat aſhamed, he ſaid to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor.</hi> You are deſirous to combat with the Sword, which I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, not for any doubt of my ſelfe, but onely to ſpare you, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, we muſt needs now try the iſſue thereof.</p>
                  <p>Do what you can anſwered <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> I meane to bee reuenged for your kindneſſe in the Forreſt: theſe words made the Knight ſoone to remember him, ſaying: You muſt do no more then you can, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily before you depart hence, you may ſuſtaine a foyle worſe then the firſt. Hereupon they fell to the combat, which began and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with ſuch fury, as the Ladies, were driuen into wonderfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, yea, themſelues were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7181:122"/>
that they held out ſo long, hauing their Armour mangled, their Shields defaced, their Bodies ſore wounded, and the blood ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming downe vpon their horſes: <hi>Galaor</hi> neuer being in ſuch daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, but when hee fought with his brother <hi>Amadis,</hi> which made him carry better opinion of the Knight, and both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad to breath a while, <hi>Galaor</hi> entred into theſe ſpeeches. You ſee Sir I haue the better of the combat, let me therfore know your name, and why you conceale your ſelfe ſo cloſely: wherein you ſhall doe me very great pleaſure, and wee may continue friends, elſe worſe will enſue then you imagin. Be wel aſſured anſwered the knight our ſtrife ſhall not be ended ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, nor am I to bee ouercome ſo lightly as you weene, beſide, I was neuer more deſirous to prolong a combat, then I am at this inſtant, becauſe I neuer met with the knight that tryed me ſo well: but to you nor any other will I bee knowne, except one Knight who hath power to command me. Be not ſo opinitiue, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> for I ſweare to you by the faith I owe to God, neuer to leaue you till I know what you are, and why you conceale your ſelfe ſo ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And I ſweare to you, quoth the knight, while breath is in my body you ſhall not know it by me, and rather would I preſently die, then any but two ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I am: yet I know not them, but they may and ſhall haue knowledge of me. And what are they, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> you eſteeme ſo much? Neither will I diſeloſe them to you, anſwered the knight. Both them and my former demaund, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> I will know, elſe one of vs ſhall die, or both together. I am well pleaſed therewith, replyed the Knight.</p>
                  <p>So began they to charge each other a freſh, as if they had not fought together before at all: but the ſtrange knight receiued many cruell wounds, which made his ſtrength more and more to faile: and the Lady ſeeing the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, would ſuffer him to endure no longer perill, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſaid. Forbeare ſir Knight, would God the Barque and Mariners had ſunke, before they brought you hither. Lady, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> you ought not to blame me in doing my deuoire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this knight, who hath outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me, &amp; many beſide, for which I meane to bee reuenged this day. Forbeare, ſaid the Lady, to wrong him any more, otherwiſe you may fall into an extremity without any mercy.</p>
                  <p>It matters not what may happen anſwered <hi>Galiaor:</hi> but nothing ſhall make me giue ouer, vntill he haue ſatisfied my demand. And what is that? quoth ſhe. He muſt tell me his name, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> and why ſo cloſely hee concealeth himſelfe, likewiſe what the two Knights are of whom he told mee but euen now. Proceede no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in combat ſaid the Lady, and I will ſatisfie your demand. This Gentleman is named <hi>Don Floreſtan,</hi> concealing himſelfe in this ſecret manner to finde his two brethren, who are in this country accounted ſuch men at Armes, that albeit hee hath well tried himſelfe with you, yet will hee not bee commonly knowne, till he haue accompliſhed ſuch deedes in chiualrie, as ma de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to equall him with them, who are at this time in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, one of them being named <hi>Amadis,</hi> the other <hi>Galaor,</hi> and all
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7181:123"/>
three the Sonnes to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule.</hi> Alas, what haue I done? quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> heere brother take my Sword, and therewithall the honor of the fight, for I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended ouer much. What? ſaid the knight am I then your brother? According to this Ladies ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> you are, and I am your brother <hi>Galaor. Floreſtan</hi> amazed at this accident, fell on his knee, ſaying. My Lord, I deſire you to pardon me, for this offence in combatting vnknown with you, was cauſed by no other reaſon: but that I durſt not name my ſelfe your brother, till I had made ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations of your noble vertues, <hi>Galaor</hi> courteouſly embraced him in his armes, the teares ſtreaming from his eyes with ioy, and greeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee him ſo ſore wounded, doubting leaſt his life was in great danger: but when the Lady ſaw them ſo good friends, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity conuerted into ſuch Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as one right glad thereof, ſhee ſaid to <hi>Galaor.</hi> Worthy Sir, though firſt you gaue me occaſion of great heauineſſe, yet now with ſufficient ioy you haue recompenced me. So taking each of them by the hand, ſhe walked with them into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where they being lodged in two ſumptuous beds, her ſelfe (skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Chirurgerie) cured their wounds. Thus remained the two brethren with the rich and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lady <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> who deſired their health as her owne wel-fare.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T what time King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> ſought after ſtrange Aduentures, he ariued in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Almaigne,</hi> where he ſoiourned the ſpace of two yeares, accompliſhing many braue deedes of Armes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne whereof continueth to this day. And as he returned toward <hi>Gaule</hi> hee lodged in the Counties houſe of <hi>Zealand,</hi> where he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained very royally, as well in reſpect of his owne reputation, as alſo becauſe the County himſelfe had ſometime beene a Knight er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which made him loue all ſuch as followed Armes. After ſupper, the King was conducted to his Chamber, where being in bed, and ſomewhat wearie with trauaile, he ſell a ſleepe ſoundly: but to ſhake off this heauineſſe, he felt himſelfe embraced and kiſſed he knew not by whom, when ſtarting vp to ariſe, he was ſo held down that he could not. Why Sir? quoth ſhe that thus maſtred him, take you no pleaſure in me who am alone with you? the king looking on her, by meanes of the light which ſtill burned in his Chamber, he diſcerned her to be a moſt beautifull Lady, wherefore he thus anſwered. I pray you faire friend, tell me what you are. What ſoeuer Iam, quoth ſhe, I loue you exceedingly, as one that freely giues her ſelfe to you. In ſooth, replyed the King, I very gladly would know your name. You trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me, ſaid the Lady, with this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, yet can I vſe no other continence the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſee but it were neceſſary quoth the king, I ſhould
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7181:123"/>
know your name, if you meane to be my friend. Seeing you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine me thereto, anſwered the Lady, know that I am the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Daughter, who hath ſo friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained you. Now truſt me Madam, replyed the King, you muſt hold me excuſed, for I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, then abuſe the man I am ſo much beholding to. Will you then refuſe me? quoth ſhe, well may you bee tearmed the worſt nurtured Prince in the world, in denying the conqueſt, which all your life time you might haue fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of. You may ſpeake your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, anſwered the King, but I will do what is conuenient for your honour and mine, and not offend in ſo foule a manner. I ſhall, quoth ſhe, cauſe my Father to thinke himſelfe more iniuried by you, then if you grant what I deſire. So ſtarting from the bed, ſhe tooke the Kings Sword (euen the ſame which was afterward found with <hi>Amadis,</hi> when he was taken vp on the Sea) and drawing it forth, ſhe ſet the point againſt her heart, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now ſhall my Fathers life be ſhortned by my death, whereof you are the onely cauſe. As ſhe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered theſe words, ſhe offered to ſtab her ſelfe with the Sword: when the king ſuddenly ſtaying her hand and meruailing at her impatient loue, thus replyed. Hurt not your ſelfe Madam, for I am content to ſatisfie your will. Hereupon hee kindely embraced and kiſſed her, paſſing the night with her in ſuch ſort, as her hot deſire was quallifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at that inſtant ſhe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with childe: the King little thinking thereon, for the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he tooke his leaue of her, and the Countie, returning with all ſpeede he could into <hi>Gaule.</hi> But the time of deliuerance drawing on, and ſhe (deſirous to couer her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) determined to goe viſit an Aunt of hers, whoſe dwelling was not paſt two or three miles off, and many times ſhe reſorted thither for her pleaſure. So taking no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company with her but a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, as ſhee rode through the Forreſt, the payne of trauaile made her alight from her Palfrey, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon after deliuered of a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne. The Damoſell that was with her, ſeeing what had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, bringing the childe to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid. Madam, as your heart ſerued you to commit the offence, ſo muſt it now practiſe ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent remedy, while I returne from your Aunt againe. Then get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on horſeback, ſhe rode apace to her Ladies Aunt, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with the whole matter: which cauſed the old woman to be very ſorrowfull, yet ſhe prouided ſuccour for her Niece, ſending a Litter with all conuenient ſpeede, wherein the Lady and her childe were brought to her Caſtle ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, euery thing being ſo cunningly handled, as the Countie neuer knew his Daughters fault. After ſuch time as theſe matters require, the Lady returned home to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leauing her Sonne in her Aunts cuſtody, where he was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed till the age of eighteene yeeres, hauing Squires and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen attending on him, who daily inſtructed him in managing Armes, and all braue qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a man of value. He being growne of goodly ſtature, the old Lady brought him one day to the Countie his Grand-father, who gaue him his knight-hood, not knowing what he was: &amp; returning againe with his motherly Nurſe, by the way ſhe brake with him in this manner. My Sonne, I am
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7181:124"/>
certaine you are ignorant of your parenatge, but credit my words, you are the ſon to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> begotten on his daughtr that gaue you your order of knight-hood: endeuour your ſelfe therefore to follow your fathers ſteps, who is one of the moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med knights in the world. Madam, quoth <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> oftentimes haue I heard great fame of King <hi>Perion,</hi> but neuer imagined my ſelfe to be his ſon: wherefore I vow to you, being my long and carefull nurſe, that I will trauaile to fiude my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not make my ſelfe known to any one, till my deedes declare me worthy to be his ſon. Not long after, hee departed from the olde Ladie, and accompanied with two ſquires, iournied to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which at that time was greatly vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with warre, where he remained the ſpace of foure yeeres, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſuch haughty deedes of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie, as he was counted the beſt knight in all thoſe parts. When he perceiued himſelfe in ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he intended to viſit <hi>Gaule,</hi> and make himſelfe knowne to the king his father: but comming into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> hee heard the fame of <hi>Amadis</hi> to be maruailous, which was the cauſe of his ſtay there, to win ſome report by armes, as his bretheren had done, whom he lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to acquaint himſelfe withall. At length he met with them both in the forreſt, as you heard, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward combated with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Galaor,</hi> which cauſed their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad at the Caſtle of <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> vntill ſuch time as their wounds were healed.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs returne to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Agraies,</hi> who ſtaied with faire <hi>Briolania</hi> fiue daies together, preparing their armour and euery thing in order: which being done, they ſet forward on their way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Briolania,</hi> her Aunt, certaine waiting Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſquires to doe them ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice by the way. When they drew neere the Realme of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> they came to the Caſtle of an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Lady named <hi>Galumba,</hi> who ſometime liued in <hi>Briolanias</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court, and there they were welcomed very honouarbly: yet whether <hi>Briolania</hi> trauailed thus accompanied, the olde Lady <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumba</hi> could not chuſe but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, which made her requeſt to be ſatisfied therein. <hi>Briolanias</hi> Aunt tolde her, how <hi>Amadis</hi> was one of the beſt knights in the world, and had promiſed to reuenge the murthered kings death: likewiſe how hee diſcomfited them that guarded the Chariot, and after-ward ouercame the reſt in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, at what time the Lions eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, as you haue heard. <hi>Galumba</hi> wondering at ſuch ſinguler prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe, anſwered. If he be ſuch a one as you make report, his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needes be of ſome eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and well may they bring your enterpriſe to end, conſidering the truth and iuſtice of the cauſe: but take heede leaſt the traiterous king worke ſome treaſon againſt them. That is the chcefeſt pointe of my fear, ianſwered <hi>Briolania,</hi> wherfore wee came to craue your aduiſe herein. Heereupon ſhee wrote a letter, and ſealed it with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ſeale at Armes, then caling a Damoſell, after ſhee had giuen her inſtructions, ſhe bad her make haſt in deliuering the letter. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went the Damoſell to horſe-back, and trauailed ſo ſpeedily that ſhe arriued at the great Cittie of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> which the whole Realme tooke this name by. There was <hi>Abiſeos</hi> and his Sonnes, <hi>Dariſon</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:7181:124"/>
and <hi>Dramis,</hi> and theſe three muſt the Combat be waged withall: for <hi>Abiſeos</hi> ſlew the Father of <hi>Briola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> by couetous deſire he had to the Crowne, which he euer ſince vſurped and held, more by tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then any conſent in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. The Damoſell entred the Palace on horſ-back, when diuerſe knights came to her, requeſting her to alight: but ſhe made anſwere ſhe would not, til ſhe ſaw the king, and that hee commanded her to leaue her Palfrey. Soone after came the king; accompanied with his two Sonnes and many great Lords, and after ſhee had ſaluted him, hee boldly bad her ſay what ſhe would. My Lord, quoth ſhe, I ſhall fulfill your command, on condition I may abide in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and receiue no iniurie for any thing I ſay. By my Crowne, ſaid the king, I warrant your ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: whereupon the Damoſell thus began. Sir, my Lady and Miſtreſſe <hi>Briolania,</hi> diſinherited by you, greetes you with this letter, which may openly bee read before this royall company, and I afterward receiue anſwere for my diſcharge: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king heard openly the na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of <hi>Briolania,</hi> remorſe of conſcience touched him with the wrong hee did her: yet was the letter openly read, which was to giue credit to the Damoſells words. The moſt of the Lords there preſent, who ſometime were ſubiects to the ſlaughtered king, ſeeing the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of their lawfull Queene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: pittyed ſhe was ſo vniuſtly diſinherited, and in their hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of God, to plague the treaſon done to her Father: Proceede Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, quoth the king, and let vs heare your meſſage. My Lord, ſaid ſhe, by treaſon you murdred my Ladies Father, and vniuſtly keepe her from her inheritance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to your former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which you haue not once but often times made, that you with your two Sons would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by Armes, the right you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to haue in this Realme: ſhee ſends you word by me, if ſtill you ſtand vpon ſuch triall, ſhee will bring two knights hither, who ſhal in combat maintaine her cauſe, making you know your diſloyalty and treaſon committed. <hi>Dariſon</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Sonne to the king, hearing his Father menaced in this ſort, grew into great choller, and as one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with deſpight, he aroſe, when (without the kings conſent) hee thus ſpake. Damoſell, if your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe <hi>Briolania</hi> haue two knights with her, men reſolued to ſight on her behalfe: here do I accept the combat for my father and Brother, and if I faile, I promiſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all theſe Lords, to ſend her my head in requitall of her fathers, whoſe death was not accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed without great reaſon. In ſooth Sir <hi>Dariſon,</hi> anſwered the Damoſell, you ſpeake as a knight of haughtie mind, yet may I doubt theſe words to proceed from chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, becauſe I diſcerne an alteration in your countenance: but if you will requeſt the king to confirme your ſpeeches, I ſhall thinke your proffer came from a heart of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
                  <p>This anſwere Damoſell, quoth he, may you boldly make her that ſent you hither. Cauſe then his Maieſty, ſaid the Damoſell, to giue my Ladies knights aſſurance, that for any miſhap you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the Combat, they ſhall ſuſtaine no iniurie, nor be medled withall but by you three: And if you purchaſe them ſuch a ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, they ſhall bee here within
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7181:125"/>
three dayes at the vttermoſt, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon</hi> falling on his knee before the King, ſaid. You heare (my Lord) the Damoſells demaund, and the promiſe I haue made before your Maieſty, in the preſence of all theſe great Princes and Lords: humbly therefore I beſeech you, ſeeing my honor is yours, that both you and all the reſt will confirme her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, otherwiſe, to our great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage, the preſuming knights, who dare aduenture in the cauſe of fooliſh <hi>Briolania,</hi> will imagine themſelues conquerors, and vs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide faint-hearted Cowards: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing openly publiſhed, that if any one will touch your illuſtrious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne for matters paſt, by the combat of vs three you intend to be purged. And albe it you would make them no ſuch promiſe, yet ought not we to refuſe them, for as I vnderſtand, they be ſome fooliſh knights of King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, who by their ouer-weening and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring thoughts, make high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ompt of their owne deedes in the contempt of others. The King who loued <hi>Dariſon</hi> as himſelfe, though the death of his brother condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him culpable, and thereby made him feare the combat: gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ſafe conduit, according as the Damoſell requeſted for the two knights, and ſuch as came in their company. Here is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the period of this trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours Fortune was now limited, and the iuſt auenger of all wrongs, pointed out rewarde for the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him acd his Sonnes, as in this diſcourſe may bee euidently ſeene.</p>
                  <p>The Damoſel ſeeing her meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage had taken ſuch effect as ſhee deſired, ſaid vnto them: Make your ſelues ready, for to morrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fayle ſhall this difference bee deſided. So mounting on her Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, ſhe returned to the Caſtle of <hi>Galumba,</hi> where being arriued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the knights and Ladies, ſhe reported her anſwere: but when ſhe told them, that <hi>Dariſon</hi> reputed them fooliſh knights of king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarts</hi> Court, they were ſo offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as <hi>Amadis</hi> entred into theſe ſpeeches. By God, there are ſuch in company of that good king, as can eaſily abate the pride of <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and humble his head ſo low as they liſt: but I thinke his choller o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-maſtred him, when he vttered words of ſuch great indiſcrerion. Truſt me my Lord, anſwered <hi>Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania,</hi> you cannot ſay or doe ſo much againſt theſe traytours, as they iuſtly deſerue. You know what vilanie they did to the king my Father, and how long time they haue diſinherited me · let pitty then preuaile on my behalfe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God and you I haue repoſed my ſelfe, with aſſured hope of ſufficient reuenge. <hi>Amadis</hi> whoſe heart was ſubmiſſe to vertue and all gentleneſſe, moued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Madam, if God be ſo pleaſed, ere to morrow at night, your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſadneſſe, ſhall be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into pleaſure and content: her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they concluded, to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward very early the next morning, which made them depart to their chambers, except <hi>Briolania,</hi> who ſat conferring with <hi>Amadis</hi> on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters, when often times ſhe thought to motion marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and her: but ſuſpecting by his continuall ſighs, as alſo the teares ſtreaming from his eys, that ſome other Lady was cauſe of theſe paſſions, ſhe kept ſilence, and taking her leaue bad him good night.

Cittie of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> their arriuall was very welcome to many, who ſeeing the Daughter of their late ſoueraigne Lord, and knowing the monſtrous treacherie of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they inſtantly deſired her proſperous ſucceſſe, becauſe they bare her ſinguler affection, <hi>Abiſeos</hi> remembring the wrong hee had done her, and his bloody treaſon ſo vnnaturally committed, ſeemed terrified in countenance, becauſe the worme of conſcience reuiued his heinous offence: yet hauing beene ſo long abſtinate and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his ſinne, thought fortune would now aſſure his quietnes, and confirme his eſtate to continue in tranquility. But when he ſaw how the people flocked about her, not ſhewing any reuerence to him and his ſonnes, albeit they were royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompained with Lords, hee exclamed on them in this manner. Ah wretched and bad minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I ſee what comfort you take by the preſence of this Girle, and how your ſences are caryed away with her: now may I well iudge, you rather could except her as your ſoueraigne, ſhe beeing a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man not capable of ſuch an office, then I that am a hardy knight. Her weakneſſe you may note, becauſe ſhee hath in ſo long time gotten but two knights, who are come to receiue an ignominious death, which in ſooth I cannot chuſe but pittie. When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard theſe taunting words, he was ſo enraged, as if the blood would haue guſhed from his eyes, and raiſing himſelfe on his ſtirrops, that euery one might heare him, hee thus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Abiſeos,</hi> it may bee eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that the arriuall of the Princeſſe is ſcant pleaſing to thee, in reſpect of thy horrible treaſon committed, murdering her father thy eldeſt brother: but if thou haue any feeling of vertue, &amp; art repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant for thy foule miſ-deed, yeeld to her what thou haſt vniuſtly vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, ſo ſhall I diſcharge thee of the combate: prouided, thou aske God forgiuenſſe, and vſe ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as beſeemeth a ſin ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that by loſing honour in this world, thou mayſt ſeeke the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy ſoule hereafter. <hi>Dariſon</hi> prouoked to anger by theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, aduanced himſelfe, &amp; before his father had leiſure to reply, hee preuented him in this manner. Thou fooliſh Knight of King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarts</hi> Court, hardly can I endure thy iniurous words to my father in my preſence: but I am content to defer them, till we proceede to the effect of thy demand, then ſhall I take ſuch vengeance for them as I deſire, for when thy heart ſhal faint in time of neede, weening to ſaue thy life by flight: if thou make not good haſt I will ſo chaſtife thee, as each one ſhall pittie thy miſerable eſtate. This is too long a proceſſe, ſaid <hi>Agraies,</hi> to defend thy fathers treaſon withall, goe arme thy ſelfe, and come to the combate as thou didſt promiſe, then ſhalt thou ſee if fortune bee ſo fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to giue thee the victory which thou reckoneſt aſſured: if ſhe doe otherwiſe, perſwade thy ſelfe, both thou and thine ſhal haue the meed of your wicked derſeruing. Say what thou wilt, anſwered <hi>Dariſon,</hi> ere long thy iniurious tongue puld from thy head, ſhall be ſent to the court of thy maiſter king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> that ſuch as behold thy worthy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, may be afraid to hazard the like by their liberall language. So calling for their armour, the king and his two ſons were quickly armed, then mounting on horſe-backe, they went to the place
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7181:126"/>
appointed for Combats. Where-upon, <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> lacing their Helmets, tooke their Shields and Launces, and afterward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the field. Then <hi>Dramis</hi> (who was the youngeſt brother, yet a Knight ſo valiant, as two of the beſt in that Countrey durſt not deale with him in Combat) ſaid to his Father. My Lord, where your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty and my brother are preſent, wel may I be excuſed from ſpeech, but now effects muſt ſhew it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by ſuch ſtrength as Heauen hath enabled me withall: therefore I deſire to try my Fortune with the Knight who hath ſo wronged you, and if I kill him not at the firſt taint of the Launce, neuer ſhall Armor come on my back againe: but if I meete him not ſo right as I deſire, he ſhall haue but little reſpite of life, for at the firſt ſtroake of my Sword, I will diſpatch him. Many heard the words of young <hi>Dramis,</hi> and eſteemed highly of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, nor did they greatly doubt the performance, conſidering what deedes of Armes they had ſeene him accompliſh. Now place they their Launces in their reſts, and <hi>Dramis</hi> prepared himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> who met him ſo full in the cariere, as his heart brake in his belly, and he fell to the ground ſo waightily, as if it had beene the fall of an Oxe. Get thee to all the Diuels, ſaid <hi>Dardan</hi> the Dwarffe, my maſter is very well rid of thee: but me thinks his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath lighted on himſelfe, which commonly falls out ſo with ſuch great crakers. <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Dariſon</hi> brake their Launces in the encounter, but no other harme happened betweene them as yet.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Abiſeos</hi> ſaw his Son <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> was dead, he was meruailouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed, and intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his death on <hi>Amadis,</hi> where-upon he gaue forth to meete him, and piercing his Launce thorow the Princes ſhield, gaue him a ſore hurt on the Arme, which made the beholders doubt, that <hi>Amadis</hi> could hold out no longer. If then the young Princeſſe <hi>Briolania</hi> was diſmaide, it were in vaine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the queſtion: for now her heart dreaded further miſhap: but he who could not be daunted with common wounds, drew the ſword which he recouered from <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> giuing <hi>Abiſeos</hi> ſuch a ſound gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therwith on the head, as made him coutch his neck to his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the Sword ſliding downe vpon his right arme, gaue him a wound to the very bone, by means whereof <hi>Abiſeos</hi> found himſelfe ſo diſtreſſed and amazed, that hee fell down from his horſe as it were in a Trance. Now did the people meruaile not a little, to ſee <hi>Amadis</hi> at two ſtroakes ouerthrow two ſuch puiſſant Knights, eſteemed amongſt them the beſt in the World: but <hi>Amadis</hi> beholding no other reſiſtance, returned to <hi>Dariſon</hi> who fought with <hi>Agraies,</hi> they behauing themſelues ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt each other, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thought they neuer ſaw a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer combat.</p>
                  <p>At length <hi>Abiſeos</hi> recouered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſeeing his Sonne <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in danger of his life, came to aſſiſt him, giuing <hi>Agraies</hi> ſuch a wound in the throate, as his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin thought he had beene ſlayne outright: But ſoone did hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite <hi>Abiſeos</hi> for it, by ſeperating his wounded Arme from his body, euen the ſame Arme wherewith he killed the King his Brother, which made him fall downe dead to the ground, whereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> called to him, ſaying. <hi>Abiſeos,</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:7181:126"/>
this is puniſhment in member, whereby thou didſt thruſt thy ſelfe into the Crowne, and now haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued death according to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. Then hee turned about to helpe <hi>Agraies,</hi> but he met him with the head of <hi>Dariſon</hi> in his hand: whereat all the people gaue a great ſhoute, and humbled themſelues to <hi>Briolania</hi> as their lawfull Queen. This was the end of the wretched Father and his Sonnes, ſeruing at this day for an example to ſuch as ſhamefully vſurpe the right of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: which though they enioy for a ſmall ſeaſon, yet when the God of power letteth looſe his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows againſt them, they fall into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and deteſted ruine. Let euery man therfore ſet before his eys that no euill remaineth vnpuniſhed, and the end concludeth theſe two principles, the eternall beatitude of the celeſtiall Soules, and the mercileſſe excruciaments of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable damned creatures.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſee you what lot fell to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſeos</hi> and his children, vſurping the kingdome by homicide and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany, euen by the death of his own naturall brother: therefore heauen repayed him with a miſerable end, by the conquering Sword of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Agraies,</hi> who dragged them along out of the field, demanding if any other would withſtand the right of <hi>Briolania.</hi> By one of the chiefeſt Lords in the Country na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Goman,</hi> they were anſwered, ſhe had no more enimies to gaine-ſay her, which he teſtified with an hundred knights of his owne kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: All the people being there ready to receiue their Queen <hi>Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania,</hi> and do her homage as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed faithfull Subiects. Here-upon <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the new Queene to the Palace Royall, where they were preſently vnarmed, and Chirurgeons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to attend their wounds: in meane while <hi>Briolania</hi> was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the regiment, by a generall oath of the Subiects taken to their Soueraigne, with ſuch ioy, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was the like in <hi>Sobradiſa.</hi> But becauſe the two knights were very ſore wounded, and their hurts found to be ſomewhat dangerous, all ſports and paſtims accuſtomed at ſuch ſolemnity, were referred til the time of their recouery: which to compaſſe the ſooner, their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings were appointed in ſeuerall chambers, that none might trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them with tedious talking, leſt a continuall feuer ſhould come v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. Notwithſtanding, <hi>Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania,</hi> as one not ingratefull for the good ſhe receiued by them, would not depart from them eyther day or night, but onely at the time of repaſt: ſo that by her kinde and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent attendance, the danger of their ſickneſſe was expelled the ſooner. See here the true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hiſtory, for what is ſaid more concerning the loue of <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; this Princeſſe, hath been inuented and falſely faigned, according as I haue ſaid before: therefore we will ceaſe, ſeeing here it goes no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill the contrary may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly be knowne, as in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory following is declared.</p>

                     </gap>t, although <hi>Floreſtan</hi> aſſured her of his ſpeedy returne. Notwithſtanding all theſe mones, forward they ſet to the Realme of <hi>Sobradiſa: Floreſtan</hi> crauing a boon of his brother by the way, to wit: that he would not combate on the way for any thing which might happen, vntill he were able to hold out no longer. With much a doe he obtained his requeſt, &amp; ſo rode they on foure dayes together, not meeting with any aduenture wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the rehearſall: but toward Sun ſetting they met a knight hard by a Tower, who intreated them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to lodge there that night, which gentle offer they accepted, and entring with the knight, they conferred on many matters till ſupper was ready. The knight was of comely ſtature, &amp; well ſpoken, but his countenance was ſo ſad &amp; melancholly, as <hi>Galaor</hi> began thus to queſtion with him. Me thinkes Sir you are not ſo merry as you ſhould be, but if wee may any way help your penſiueneſſe, tell vs, and you ſhall finde vs willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. I beleeue aſſuredly, quoth their hoſt, that like good knights you would doe as you ſay, but my ſadneſſe is cauſed through extream loue, a matter not to be reuealed, and therefore the rather to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. So ſate they downe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which beeing ended, <hi>Galaor,</hi> and his brother were condcted to their chamber, where they repoſed themſelues till the next morning: when mounting on horſe-backe, their hoſt would accompany them a little on the way, and calling for his Iennet, but putting on no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, hee rideth with them: this did hee to ſee what ſhould happen to them, becauſe in the way hee guided them, he hoped to ſee ſome proofe of their manhood, when if they were vanquiſhed or ſlaine, he might the more eaſily eſcape from them.</p>
                  <p>Not farre had they trauelled, but they came to a place called the fountaine of Oliues, becauſe in the midſt of the water grew three high Oliue trees. Heereby they eſpyed three beautifull Damoſels, and a Dwarffe ſitting aloft in one of the trees: whereupon <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them very curteouſly, as one not to learne his behauior toward Ladies, then one of the Damoſels requiting his ſalutation, ſayd. Sir knight, if heauen haue endued you with as great bounty as comely perfection, no doubt but you are ſufficiently enriched. Faire Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell anſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> if my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance doth pleaſe you, my inward vertue you may try if you haue any need. You ſpeake ſo kindely, quoth the, that I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make proofe of your valour, to ſee if you can carry mee hence from this place. In ſooth Lady, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> if of your ſelfe you
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7181:127"/>
be willing to goe, I know no reaſon to the contrary why you ſhould not. Herewith he commanded the ſquire to ſet her on a palfray, which was tied (ready furniſhed) at one of the oliue trees: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dwarfe behelde it, hee cryed out aloude. Come forth ſir knight, come forth, for here is one will cary away your friend. Preſently came out of a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley a knight brauely prauncing, &amp; well armed, who ſaid to <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> What moues you ſir to touch my Lady? I cannot think ſhe is yours, anſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> ſeeing ſhee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth mee to cary her hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Albeit ſhee would, quoth the knight, yet I thinke it not at this time ſo conuenient, becauſe I haue defended her from better then you are. I know not how well you haue defended, replied <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> but ſhe ſhall goe with me if I can helpe it. By God ſir, anſwered the other, you muſt firſt talk with the knights of this valley, and feele how ſafely they can keepe ſuch as they loue. So placing their Lances in their reſts, they ran couragiouſly againſt each other, the knight breaking his ſtaffe: but <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſmot his ſhield ſo ſtrongly againſt his helmet, as the lace brake, and his head was bare, but worſt of all, he fel ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily vpon his ſword, that with his weight brake in two pieces. <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> finiſhed his carrire, hauing his Launce whole and ſound, when turning againe to the knight, hee ſaw that he moued neither hand or foote, wherefore punching him with his Lance vpon the ſtomack, ſaid: Pillard, thou art dead, if thou yeeld not. The knight being reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his traunce, &amp; beholding the preſent danger of his life, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mercy: which <hi>Floreſtan</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo he would freely reſigne the Damoſell. She is at your pleaſure, replied the knight, but curſed bee the houre when firſt I ſaw her. For by her folleys ſhe hath oftentimes endangered my life, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, came to the Damoſell, ſaying: Faire Lady, now you are mine. You haue ſo nobly won me, quoth ſhe, as I remaine at your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. As they were departing thence, one of the other Damoſels thus ſpake: Alas ſir, will you ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſo good company? it is a yeere and more ſince wee haue liued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and we would be loth now to depart in this manner. If you pleaſe to accompany her, anſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> I can be content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you together: and more I hope you will not requeſt, becauſe I meane not to leaue my conqueſt. I thinke not my ſelfe ſo foule, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the other damoſel, but ſome good knight may enterpriſe as great an aduenture for me: mary it is to be doubted, whether ſuch hardineſſe remaine in you or no. Why Lady? quoth <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> thinke you that feare can make me leaue ye? I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you on my faith, but that I would not forcibly cary you away, you ſhould preſently goe with me: but if your will be ſo good, let my ſquire helpe you vp on your hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Which ſhe did, &amp; the dwarfe cryed againe as he did for the firſt, whereupon another knight came immediatly foorth, and alter him a ſquire bearing two Launces, the knight vſing theſe words to <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan.</hi> You haue (ſir) already won one Lady, and (not c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ontent with her) you ſeeke for another: but now in one inſtant you muſt looſe them both, and your head I doubt to keepe them company, becauſe you beeing of no better race, are vnworthy a Lady of ſo high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Thou vaunteſt very much, anſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> yet haue I two
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7181:128"/>
knights of my linage, whom thou, nor three ſuch as thou art, may bee thought worthy to ſerue. Thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations extend very far, ſayde the knight, yet am I to meddle with none but thee, who haſt got a Lady from him that could not defend her: but ſhe muſt be mine if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer thee, elſe by vanquiſhing me, thou ſhalt be maiſter of them both together. Now thou ſpeakeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, quoth <hi>Floreſtan:</hi> defend thy Lady well, or without doubt ſhee will fall to my ſhare. So giuing the ſpurres to their horſes, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this controuerſie to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lance, when though the Prince failed in the race, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brake his ſtaffe very manfully: yet (being angry at his miſ-hap) at the ſecond courſe he ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the knight ſo violently to the ground, as hee thought euery bone of him was broken in pieces. Thus was he ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed of the ſecond Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and very loth hee was to leaue the third there alone, but ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their hoſt that conducted them thither, ſpake to him in this manner. My friend, I would aduiſe ye to bee gone, becauſe you know theſe two knights cannot reſiſt him will preſently come: then if you be taken, you are ſure to dy the death. Beleeue mee Lady, quoth hee, I meane now to ſee the end of all, for my horſe is quick of pace, and my tower ſtrong enough to defend me from him. Well, looke to your ſelues, ſaid the Damoſell, you bee but three, and one of you vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but if he were, it might not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile him. When <hi>Floreſtan</hi> heard how ſhee praiſed him that was to come, he was more deſirous to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her away then before, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee would haue a fight of him, and therefore bad his Squire to ſet her on horſe-backe as he did the other, when the Dwarffe in the oliue tree deliuered theſe wordes. Beleeue me Sir knight, in an euill houre came this boldneſſe on you, for preſently commeth one who will reuenge his companions. Foorth of the valley came a knight in gilt armour, mounted on a luſty bay courſer, the man reſembling a Giant in proportion, and reputed to be of incredible ſtrength. After him followed two Squires armed, each of them carying a hatchet in his hand, and ſo ſoone as he came neere <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> he thus ſpake. Stay knight &amp; fly not, for by flight thou art not able to ſaue thy life, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it for thee to dye like a good knight then a coward, eſpecially when by cowardiſe thou ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt not eſcape. <hi>Floreſtan</hi> hearing ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces of death, contemning like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a man of no value, incenced with anger, hee returned this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Monſter, Beaſt, Diuell, or whatſoeuer thou art, reaſon I ſee thou wanteſt: ſo little do I eſteeme thy prodigall words, that I thinke thou haſt no better weapons to fight withall. I greeue, ſaide the Knight, that I cannot haue my fill in reuenge on thee, but I would foure of the beſt of thy linage were here with thee, for mee to ſlice off their heads as I wil do thine. Look to thine owne thou wert beſt, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> for I hope I am ſufficient to excuſe them, and bee their Lieutenant in this matter on thee. Thus ſundring themſelues, in rage and fury they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the beating of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hoous made the earth to groan and the breach of their Launces made a terrible noiſe: but the great knight loſt his ſtirrops, and had fallen to the ground, if by catching hold about his horſe necke hee had not eſcaped. As <hi>Floreſtan</hi> helde on
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7181:128"/>
his courſe, hee caught a hatchet from one of the ſquires, wherewith he ſmote him quite beſide his horſe: and by time he returned; the Knight had recouered his ſeate againe, and the hatchet which the other Squire held. Now begins a dreadfull combat betweene them, ſuch cruell ſtrokes being giuen at each other with their hatchets, as though their helmets were of right truſty ſteele, yet they cut and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled them very pittifully. Many times was <hi>Floreſtan</hi> enforced to ſtaggering, by the mighty blowes of his monſtrous enemy, yet at length the Prince ſmote at him ſo furiouſly as he was faine to lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vpon his horſe neck, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling his ſtroake betweene the helmet and the brigandine he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his head from his ſhoulders. Being thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queror of all the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſells, and they not a little mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing at this ſtrange victory, the Knight who had beene their hoſt the night before, ſpake to <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> My Lord, this Damoſell haue I long time loued, and ſhe me with like affection, but for the ſpace of this yeare &amp; more, the great knight (whom laſt you ſlue) hath forcibly detained her yet beeing now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by your worthy proweſſe, I beſeech ye Sir, I may enioy her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If it be ſo as you ſay, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> my pains haue ſtood you in ſome ſteede at this time, but againſt her will, neither you or any other can get her from me. Alas my Lord, quoth the Damoſell, no one but he hath right to my loue, then ſunder not them that ſhould liue together. Nor will I ſaid <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> you are, Lady at your owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and may depart with your friend when you pleaſe. They both requited him with manifold thanks then taking leaue of <hi>Galaor</hi> &amp; <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan,</hi> the knight rides home ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with his new conquered La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The other two Damoſells deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Princes to accompany the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their Ants houſe which was not far off, <hi>Galaor</hi> queſtioning with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the way, why they were kept in ſuch ſort at the Fountaine, where-to one of the Damoſells thus repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Vnderſtand my Lord, that the great Knight who was ſlaine in the combat, loued the Lady which your hoſt carried away with him, but ſhe deſpiſed him aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, fancying no other then him who now enioys her. But in reſpect this knight was ſo puiſſant, as none in this country durſt contend with him, he kept her violently whether ſhe would or no, yet offering her no iniury, becauſe he loued her deerely, and one day among other he thus ſpake to her: faire Miſtreſſe, to the end I may compaſſe your gentle affection, and be eſteemed of you the only knight in the world liſten what I will do for your ſake. There is a Knight named <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> accounted the onely man for valour this day liuing, who ſlew a Cozin of mine in the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> a knight of great fame called <hi>Dardan</hi> the proud: him (for your ſake) will I ſeeke, and by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his head, conuert all his glory to mine owne commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But till I compaſſe what I haue ſaid, theſe two Ladies (meaning vs) and theſe two knights of my linage ſhall attend on you, and each day conduct you to the fountaine of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues, which is the only paſſage for knights errant through this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: if any dare be ſo bold to cary you thence, there ſhall you ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny braue combats, &amp; what the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of your loue can make me do, to cauſe the like opinion in you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, as your diuine prfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7181:129"/>
haue wrought in me to you. Thus were wee taken and giuen to the two Knights who were firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and with them we haue abode the ſpace of one whole yere, in which time many combats they fought for vs, yet neuer conquered till this preſent. In ſooth Lady, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> the knights intent was too high for him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, becauſe he could not deale with <hi>Amadis,</hi> and eſcape the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune now fallen vpon him: but how was he named? He called himſelfe <hi>Alimias,</hi> quoth ſhe, and had not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-weening pride too much ruled him, he was a moſt gentle &amp; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Knight. By this time were they come to their Aunts Caſtle, where <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> found gracious entertainement, the old Lady being very glad to ſee her Neeces, as alſo to vnderſtand the death of <hi>Alimias.</hi> After they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leaue of the friendly Ladies, they iourney toward the Realme of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> where they heard before they entred the Citty, how <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> had ſlaine <hi>Abiſeos</hi> and his Sonnes, by meanes whereof, <hi>Briolania</hi> ruled as a peaceable Queene, which news highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented them, &amp; made them reioyce for their happy fortune. To the palace they come vnknown of any, till they were brought to <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; <hi>Agraies,</hi> whoſe wounds were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy indifferently recured, and they deuiſing with the Queene at her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall. Here you muſt note, how the Damoſell that conducted <hi>Galaor</hi> to finde <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> left them after the combat, and comming before to her Miſtreſſe, told her and <hi>Amadis,</hi> how <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> knew each other, and what iſſue their combat had: which made <hi>Amadis</hi> very kindely to embrace them both, and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> offered on his knee to kiſſe his hand, which <hi>Amadis</hi> would not permit, but cauſing him to ariſe, ſate downe &amp; communed of their aduentures paſt. But one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other, the new enſtalled Queen <hi>Briolania,</hi> after many hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable feaſtings ſhe had made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing theſe foure knights deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to depart, conſidering the good ſhe had receiued by <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Agraies,</hi> &amp; that ſhe (being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a diſinherited Princeſſe) was by their meanes reſtored to her Kingdome: beholding likewiſe the wheele of fortune turned, and how ſuch perſonages were not alone to aide and defend her Countrey, but puiſſant enough of themſelues to be Kings and mighty Lords: falling on her knees before them, firſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thankes to God, who had done her ſuch grace as to regard her in pitty, continuing her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſhe ſaid. Thinke my Lords, theſe mutations are the meruailes of the Almighty, which are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to vs &amp; held of great accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but to him they are (in manner) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Let vs ſee if it be good then to ſhun Signories &amp; riches, which to obtaine we take ſuch paine and trauaile, and to keepe, endure innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable anguiſhes and diſtreſſe: as ſuperfluous therefore vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect them, becauſe they are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of body &amp; ſoule, vncertaine and haue no permanence. As for my ſelfe, I ſay no, but affirme, that they being lawfully begotten, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly vſed, &amp; according to Gods appointment: they are in this world, reſt, pleaſure and ioy, and the way to bring vs to eternall glory.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was a King in <hi>Greece,</hi> who was married vnto the Emperours daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantinople,</hi> by whom hee had two ſonnes, excelling in all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both of body and minde. Eſpecially the eldeſt (named <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidon)</hi> who was ſo well brought vp and conditioned, that hee found not his equall in any vertuous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity wherein he exerciſed himſelfe. This <hi>Apolidon</hi> ſtudied all ſciences, wherein he profited ſo much, that hee was not onely counted one of the beſt knights in the world, but alſo ſurpaſſed all men of his time for wiſedome: excelling them in learning, as farre as the moone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the ſtarres in light, and chiefly in the art of Nigromancy, by the which he brought to paſſe many great matters, which ſeemed beyond the capacity of men. Now was the King (father of theſe two young Princes) moſt mighty in lands, and wealthy in treaſure: but very weake in body by reaſon of his age. Wherefore knowing the end of his daies to approach, he would before his death, make partition of all his goods vnto his children, becauſe no contention or debate ſhould happen betweene them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deceaſe. And for that end he appointed the kingdome to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polidon,</hi> being his eldeſt ſonne and heire, the other he inueſted with all his riches, and moueable goods, among which there was many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent bookes, of ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. Yet the youngeſt nothing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this partition, bewayled his eſtate vnto the King, beſeeching him moſt humbly to conſider, that his patrimony being ſo ſmall, hee was not onely left poore, but in a manner diſinherited. Then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged father perceiuing the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of his ſonne (being the thing hee moſt feared) was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſorrowfull, but yet would he not alter that which hee had done, without the conſent of <hi>Apolidon:</hi> who beeing aduertiſed thereof,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7181:134"/>
came vnto him, and in the preſence of his brother ſaide thus. It may pleaſe your Maieſtie, I heard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few dayes that my brother is not content with that portion, which it hath pleaſed you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point vnto him: and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I knowe how grieuous the ſame is vnto you, ſeeing the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue betwixt him and mee likely to be broken: I moſt humbly beſeech your highneſſe, to take all that againe which it hath pleaſed you to giue vnto mee, and diſpoſe therof as it ſhal ſeeme beſt to your owne minde, for I ſhall thinke my ſelfe thriſe fortunate, to doe any thing that may breede your ſoules felicity, and very well apaid, with that which to him was appointed.</p>
                  <p>When the King behelde the bounty of his ſonne <hi>Apolidon,</hi> and the obedience hee ſhewed vnto him, hee was therewithall ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and exceeding ioyfull, that his ſoule (knowing it, could not leaue his body in greater contentment) fled vp into heauen: leauing his two ſonnes in ſuch friendſhip as he deſired. Notwithſtanding, after the body was buried, and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed funerall rights ended, <hi>Apolidon</hi> cauſed certaine ſhippes to he rigged and furniſhed for the ſea, wherein being embarked, with diuerſe Gentlemen of his friends, ſeeing the winde and weather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour them, he commanded the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to bee waied, and the ſailes to be let fall: the which were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently filled with ſo ſtiffe a gale, as in leſſe then one houre they were paſt the countrey of Greece. And yet <hi>Apolidon</hi> had not derter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to bend his courſe vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certaine coaſt: but following his fortune, driuen by the winde, he diſcouered the Countrey of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, whereunto approching, he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a certaine port thereof. The Emperour <hi>Sindan</hi> beeing aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his landing, ſent many great Lords vnto him, to requeſt him to come to Rome: where hee ſhould be as royally entertained as might be deuiſed. To which requeſt <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidon</hi> willingly condiſcended, and beeing there already arriued, the Emperour receiued him with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, yet although at his comming hee determined to ſoiourne no more then eight daies with him, hee changed his purpoſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there a longer ſeaſon: in which time he accompliſhed ſuch haughty deedes of armes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himſelfe ſo worthily, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Romans he gained the reputation of the beſt knight in the world: and obtained the loue of a young Princeſſe, the onelie ſiſter to the Emperour, named <hi>Grimane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> the faireſt Lady then liuing. And although that their loue was alike, yet was this faire Lady ſo ſtreightly looked vnto, that neither could her affection bee ſatisfied, nor the common deſire of them both bee performed. Wherefore one day conſulting more priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then they euer yet before had done, loue wrought ſuch a conſent in them, as they agreede to depart vnto ſuch a place, where they might without controle, enioy the fulneſſe of their content: ſo as what they ſecretly intended, they as ſuddenly executed. For euen as they had appointed it, ſo the faire <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> came forth one night to meete her loue <hi>Apolidon,</hi> who ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her at the water-ſide, hauing prepared ſhippes ready for their flight, and wherein they preſently embarqued themſelues. Then by force of the winde, they were in few dayes driuen to arriue at the foote of the Firme-Iſland, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7181:134"/>
was then inhabited by a mighty Giant, whereof <hi>Apolidon</hi> and thoſe in the ſhip were ignorant. Where-upon thinking they were in a place of ſafety, came on ſhoare, and tents and Pauilions were ſet vp, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might refreſh them: for <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> (who was not vſed to trauaile by ſea) was as wearie as might be. But at that inſtant when they thought themſelues moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, the Giant which had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them, took them ſo ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Apolidon</hi> had ſcant ſo much leiſure, as to arme himſelfe: where-with <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> was ſo amazed, that ſhe was ready to die for feare: for the Giant taking her by the hand, ſaid vnto <hi>Apolido<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Baſe ſlaue, although I am not accuſtomed to be kind vnto any, yet am I content for this once, to ſuffer thee to fight againſt me alone, on this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if thou be ouercome, this faire Lady ſhall be mine, and then afterwards I ſhall cauſe thee to bee hanged vpon the pole of this tent. When <hi>Apolidon</hi> heard that by figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with ſuch a monſter, he might both ſaue himſelfe &amp; his miſtreſſe: his hart was ſo great, as he thought it a very eaſie matter to ouercome him: and eſteemed himſelfe happy, that fortune had offered him ſo fit an occaſion, as to make known vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> how much was his courage, and how great was his Knight-hood. Wherefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out longer delay the combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan betweene them, the which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted but a while, for the Giant was purſued ſo valiantly, as hee fell downe back-ward. Then <hi>Apolidon</hi> ſtreight ſtepped ouer him and cut off his head. Which the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Iſle vnderſtanding, they all came and offered them-ſelues vnto him; becheeching him to remaine with them, and to bee their Lord and protector. Vnto this their requeſt he condiſcended: wherefore they conducted him with great triumph to the cheefe Fortreſſes of the Countrey, all which he found ſo well fortified, and furniſhed, as from that time forward hee nothing feared the power of the Emperor, if he ſhold attempt war againſt him for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of his ſiſter. Afterwards by the perſwaſion of <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> he cauſed to be builded in that place, one of the faireſt places that was to be found in all the Iſles of the Oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: the which he beautified ſo gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly, and furniſhed ſo righly, that the greateſt monarch of the earth would haue found it a very difficult matter to haue builded the like. But it chaunced that fifteene daies after his there arriuall, the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (his vnckle) died without heirs of his body; by meanes whereof, they of the Countrey diſpatched Embaſſadors vnto <hi>Apolidon,</hi> to beſeech him to take vpon him the Empire, the which hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted, being (as moſt men are) neuer contented with their eſtate, but ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of change, eſpecially of a pettie Iſland, for an Empire. Yet <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> ſorrie to leaue ſo pleaſant an Iſland, did moſt inſtantly entreat her Lord, that before their departure, (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the pleaſure which they had enioyed in this Palace, the firſt witneſſe of the full fruition of their loues) hee would worke ſuch a meanes by his Art and great knowledge, that from thence forth, none might bee Lord thereof, except hee were as good a Knight as he, and as true in loue as hee was. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Madame, anſwered <hi>Apolidon,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:7181:135"/>
I will doe more for your loue then ſo: for not onely no man ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this Pallace except he be ſuch a one as you haue ſayde, but further, no Lady, nor Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlewoman ſhall ſet her foote therein, vnleſſe ſhe be as faire, and excellent in all perfections as your ſelfe. Then at the entrie of an Orchard (planted with diuerſe ſorts of trees) he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a vault to bee made: ouer the which hee placed the image of a man made of copper, holding a horne, as though hee would winde it: and vpon the gate of this Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace he ſet vp his owne and <hi>Grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſa</hi> her picture, ſo artificially wrought that they ſeemed verie liuely: right ouer againſt which, he planted an high ſtone of Iaſper, and about half a bow ſhoot off, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the garden hee ſet a piller of iron fiue cubits high.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things beeing in this ſort framed, hee asked <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> if ſhe knew what hee had done. No ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, anſwered ſhee. I will tell you then preſently ſayde <hi>Apolidon:</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelfe Madame, that no man nor woman which hath falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their firſt loue, ſhall paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this vault: for if they aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to enter the ſame, the image which you ſee, ſhall blowe ſuch a terrible blaſt, &amp; ſhall caſt through this horne, ſuch a flame, &amp; ſtench, that it ſhall be impoſſible for them to paſſe on further: moreouer, they ſhall bee caſt forth with ſuch force, that they ſhall bee throwne downe and remayne in a ſwound before the vault. But if it chance that any loyall louer, man, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, doe aſſay this aduenture, the image ſhall ſound a tune ſo melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, as it ſhall greatly delight the hearers: &amp; there may ſuch faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full louers paſſe, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pechment. Furthermore, they may beholde our portraytures, &amp; their own names writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this Iaſper, yet ſhall they not know by whom they were ingrauen. For tryall whereof if it pleaſe you, wee will proue the ſame forthwith. Then hee tooke <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> by the hand, and paſſing vnder the arch, the Image of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per beganne to ſound marueilous ſweetly, but when they came to the Iaſper ſtone, they beheld their names newly ingrauen therein, which greatly pleaſed <hi>Grimaneſa.</hi> And to beholde what would be the ſucceſſe of ſuch as followed them, they called certaine Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen to make tryall of the aduenture: but as they thought to haue paſſed thorough the vault, the Image blew ſuch a hideous blaſt, and caſt forth fire, ſmoake and flame ſo horrible, that they all fell downe in a ſwound, &amp; were throwne foorth moſt rudely. Wherewith <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> began to laugh, knowing that they were in more dread then danger, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Apolidon</hi> moſt heartily for that which hee had done for her ſake. But yet my Lord, ſayde ſhe, what ſhall become of this rich chamber, in which you and I haue enioyed ſuch great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment? You ſhall knowe by and by, ſaid hee. Then cauſed hee two other pillers to bee brought: one was of Marble, which hee had placed within fiue paces of the chamber: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Braſſe, was ſet fiue paces before that. Afterwards he ſaid to <hi>Grimaneſa:</hi> Madame, henceforth there ſhall neither man nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man enter into this chamber, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that hee who ſhall ſurpaſſe mee in proweſſe, and knight-hood, or ſhe which ſhall excell you in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bee firſt entered into the ſame: but when fortune ſhall bring hither thoſe which ſhall be worthy of a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7181:135"/>
place ſo excellent, all men after-wards, without any let may therein enter. Then he wrote vpon the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Braſſe, theſe words: Euery knight which ſhall make proofe of this aduenture, ſhall paſſe ſome further then other, according as they excell each other in chiualrie &amp; courage. Vpon the Marble piller thus: Let no man aduenture to paſſe this piller to enter the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, except hee paſſe <hi>Apolidon</hi> in knighthood. And ouer the entry of the chamber: Hee which ſhall enter herein, ſhall exceed <hi>Apolidon</hi> in armes, and ſhall ſucceed him as Lord of this countrey.</p>
                  <p>Before any man could come neere the chamber, hee muſt of force touch the two pillers, &amp; there trie his manhood. He likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned that they ſhould bee diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which hereafter ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to paſſe vnder the arch of faithfull louers, if they receiued the repulſe: and that all ſuch ſhould bee driuen forth of the Iſland, as falſe and diſloyall men: but ſuch as were faithfull, ſhould bee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned with all honour and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that might be deuiſed. Such as aduentured to paſſe the pillers to enter the forbidden chamber, if they did not paſſe the Braſen pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, they ſhould bee vſed neither better nor worſe then thoſe which were falſe in loue. If by chance they went beyond it, becauſe there ſhould bee a difference betweene them and the others, their ſwordes onely ſhould bee taken from them. And if there came any better knight which attayned not vnto the Marble piller, hee ſhould loſe but his ſhield: yet if hee paſſed on further, and entered not the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, his ſpurres onely ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his heeles.</p>
                  <p>And touching the Ladies and Gentlewomen, married or vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, which ſhould proue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of conſtant louers, if they were repulſed, hee willed that they ſhould be conſtrayned to tell their names, that they might be written vp at the entry of the vault, with the iuſt number of paces that each of them had entred forward in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>When the time is come (ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polidon)</hi> that this Iſle ſhall recouer ſuch a Lord as is promiſed vnto it, theſe enchantments ſhall no more be hurtfull vnto any, and the place ſhall be free for all men: but yet it ſhall not bee ſo for women, vntill the faireſt Lady ſhall firſt be entred into it, who ſhall free the paſſage for all others. Then did hee eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Gouernour to receiue the reuenue of the countrey, vntill he ſhould come that deſerued it. And ſhortly after, hauing taken order for all his affaires, his ſhips being ready, they imbarqued, and had ſo faire a winde, that within fewe dayes they arriued in <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> where they were moſt royally receiued.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe my meaning at this preſent is onely to continue the deeds of <hi>Amadis,</hi> I will leaue <hi>Apolidon</hi> to gouerne his Empire, to declare vnto you what happened vnto the ſame <hi>Amadis,</hi> and vnto them which followed him at his departure from the Citiy of <hi>Sobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſa.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the end of the firſt Book you haue heard how <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> remained a while in the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> vntill their wounds were healed that they receiued in the battell againſt <hi>Abiſeos</hi> and his two ſonnes: moreouer how <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> &amp; <hi>Don Floreſtan</hi> came thither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, &amp; with what entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they were receiued. Now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our Hiſtory you muſt know, That not all the hurts which <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> had, nor any dangers which hee doubted, no nor all the kinde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainements of <hi>Briolania,</hi> were once able to expell the continuall remembrance of the beautifull Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> forth of his mind: but as her rare perfections ſeemed continually to ſhine before his eyes, ſo did his deſire to beholde her againe, dayly increaſe. Thus hee endured an exceeding tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the more he thought to hide, the more it appeared: yet was the cauſe thereof vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, for euery one iudged diuerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereof, as a paſſion finely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, proceeding from ſome excellent thing, the which hee could well ſuſtaine but better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale. In the end not being able to ſupporte this long abſence, which depriued him from the ſight of her, that wrought this his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie torment, hee with his friends tooke leaue of the Queene of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bradiſa,</hi> with an intent to returne to the Court of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Notwithſtanding they had not rode farre on their way, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune offered them an occaſion of longer ſtay, as you ſhall heare. It happened that by chaunce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere vnto an Hermitage, they perceiued a Gentlewoman (accompanied with other women, &amp; foure Eſquires) comming forth of a Church. Wherefore <hi>Amadis</hi> and his fellowes being deſirous to knowe what ſhee was, rode before and ſaluted her moſt curteouſly: and ſhee which was the chiefeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluted them, and demanded whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were going, Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> wee are going to the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if it pleaſe you, ſo that it be not out of your way) wee will beare you company. I thanke you heartily ſayde the Gentlewoman, my iourney is another way. But becauſe I thinke you be wandring knight, who commoly ſearch for great aduentures, I deſire to know if any of you will go to the Firme-Iſland, to behold ſuch ſtrange and maruailous things as there are to be ſeene. For I am the daughter of him that is Gouernour there-of, vnto whom I am preſently go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

By my faith ſayd ſhee, you neede not bee ſo ſory for your ſlackneſſe: for there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7181:136"/>
hath beene a number ſuch as you, who haue had the like deſire to aduenture themſelues, yet did they not thinke their comming thither ſo ſweete, as they found their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture thence ſowre. I make no doubt thereof replyed <hi>Amadis,</hi> becauſe I haue heard ſo much: but tell mee, ſhall wee goe out of our way any thing farre, if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe you?

You ſay true ſayd ſhe, and you may alſo there behold many other ſights more ſtrange.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Agraies</hi> enflamed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee ſuch rare things, ſayd vnto his fellowes: My maiſters I know not what you meane to doe, but ſure I intend to accompany this Gentlewoman, if it pleaſe her, and I will prooue the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which ſhee hath tolde vs of. If you bee ſo loyall ſayde ſhee, that you may paſſe vnder the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted arch, you ſhall finde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſame, both many nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which will greatly pleaſe you, and alſo you ſhall beholde the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and <hi>Grimaneſa,</hi> who built that wonderfull place: and that (which more is) you ſhall ſee your owne name written vpon a Iaſper ſtone, without perceiuing by whom it is done. All the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſayde <hi>Agraies,</hi> I will if I can make the third that there hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Amadis</hi> vnderſtood the determination of his Coſen, hee was deſirous to follow him, for he knew his loyalty to bee firme both in deed and thought, which by all likelihood did promiſe him the maiſtry of the adueneure, before all others. But yet hee diſſembled his intention, and ſayde vnto his brethren, My friends although we are not amourous, as is my Lord <hi>Agraies,</hi> yet me thinkes we ſhould for this once doe as hee doth, and keepe him companie. Let vs goe ſayd <hi>Galaor,</hi> and I hope that all will fall out as wee deſire, to our glory and our honour: heereupon they followed the Gentlewoman. Then <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> who had neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard what the Firme-Iſland was, beeing alone with <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſayde vnto him. My Lord, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you know all the wonders of this place, whereunto wee are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof I neuer heard any ſpeech, although I haue trauailed many farre countries. Truely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> that which I know, I learned of a young Prince, my very good friend, named <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Norwales,</hi> who hath prooued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrange aduentures, and chiefly theſe of the Firme-Iſland, which he could not atchieue, but was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to returne with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. This Gentlewoman dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the place, of whom you may vnderſtand as much as you deſire to knowe. Wherefore <hi>Don Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> came vnto her, and intreated her very earneſtly, that ſeeing the length of their way miniſtered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion of conference together, ſhee would bee pleaſed to recite vnto him, all that which ſhe knew of the Iſland. I will very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare vnto you (ſayde ſhee) that which I haue learned of ſuch, as by their owne reports were well acquainted with the place, and the wonders thereof. Then ſhee rehearſed the particularities of all that which hath beene before declared: whereat the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7181:137"/>
more they admired, the more were they encouraged to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the enterpriſe of thoſe ſtrange things, wherein ſo many valiant men had receiued the foyle. Thus together they rode ſo long, that night comming, they were in doubt to go aſtray, vntill the moon began to ſhine: and then they knew that they were in a great meddow, in which they beheld ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pauillions ſet vp, and people ſporting all about them. Then ſaid the Gentlewoman vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> Sir, becauſe I ſee my father, you may if it pleaſe you, come faire and ſoftly, and I will goe before to aduertiſe him of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, that he may do you that honour as you deſerue. So ſaying, ſhee gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopped her horſe, vntill ſhee came vnto the tents, where ſhe alighted. Then ſhee tolde her father, how theſe foure knights had followed her, hauing a deſire to trie the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures of the Firme Iſland, which he vnderſtanding, came to meete them, and receiued them very courteouſly: afterwards hee led them vnto one of the Pauillions, where they reſted vntill their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was ready. When they were ſet downe, the gouerner of the Iſle diſcourſed vnto them the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſuch Knights and Ladyes, which had proued the arch of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all louers, and the other nouelties thereof, vntill it was time to goe to reſt. Whereupon they all with-drew themſelues, and when day appeared, they mounting all on horſe-back, rode ſo long, that they came to a place which was in breadth no more then a bow ſhoot of firme ground, and all the reſt was water. And they went on in this ſtraight, vntill they came into the entrie of the Iſland, the which was onely fiue leagues in breadth, and ſeuen in length. There might they ſee the ſumptuous Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> whoſe gates were open: and as they drew neerer, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued more then an hundred tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets or ſhields, placed in three rankes, the moſt parte leaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two poſtes, and tenne other nailed a little ouer them. But there were three which were very high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the reſt, faſtned vpon another poſt which ſtood forwarder then the firſt, yet did they likewiſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in height, for the higheſt was a faddom aboue the middle-moſt, and the middlemoſt was a cubit ouer the loweſt. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> demanded, why they were thus ranked. Truely, anſwered the gouernour, according to the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and knight-hood of thoſe which would haue entred the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden chamber, their ſhields are honoured: and theſe which you ſee neereſt the ground, belonged to ſuch Knights which could not come neere the braſen piller; but theſe tenne that are higher came vnto it, &amp; they which ought theſe two other ſhields, which you ſee ſeperated and placed aboue the reſt, haue done more: for they haue paſſed the piller, yet could they not come neere the other of marble, as the other hath done, whoſe ſhield is therfore placed aboue theſe two, which are ſo much eſteemed. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> approched more neere to ſee if he might know any of them, for there was none of them, but had written vpon them the names of ſuch as heretofore did owe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and he caſt his eye vpon the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt of the three, which hung by themſelues ouer the other tenne: which had in a field <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> a Lyon <hi>Or,</hi> fanged and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Argent,</hi> with a Cheife <hi>Gules:</hi> this hee knewe to boe the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7181:137"/>
ſhield of <hi>Arcalaus.</hi> Then hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the two vppermoſt, the lower bearing in a field Azure, a knight Argent, cutting off the head of a Gyant, the which hee remembred to bee the ſhield of king <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who prooued this aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, two yeares before that <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> did kill him in <hi>Gaule.</hi> The third which was aboue all the reſt, had a fielde Azure, three Flowers, or which he could not know without reading the ſuperſcription, which ſayd, This is the ſhield of <hi>Don Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant</hi> brother to king <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the which was ſet ouer all the others within theſe twelue dayes. For <hi>Quedragant</hi> behaued himſelfe ſo valiantly, that he came vnto the Marble piller, whereunto none other had before approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. He by chance paſſed by the Firme-Iſland, in ſeeking for <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> with an intent to fight with him, and to reuenge the death of King <hi>Abies</hi> his brother.</p>
                  <p>Much amazed was <hi>Amadis</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhields of ſo many good Knights, which had all fayled in their purpoſed enterpriſe, and hee greatly feared leaſt hee might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme as little as they. For this cauſe, hee and his company with-drew themſelues, to goe towarde the arch of loyall louers, the which was ſhewed vnto them. <hi>Agraies</hi> ſuddenly alighted, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere the forbidden place, hee with an indifferent high voice thus ſpake, Loue if e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er I haue beene conſtant, let mee now be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. This ſayde, hee paſſed on, and entred vnder the arch. Then the copper Image began to ſound ſo ſweetely, as it greatly reioyced the hearers: and <hi>Agraies</hi> ſtayed not, but went on vntill hee came vnto the Pallace where the pictures of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> were, which ſeemed vnto him, as if they had been aliue. And he came neer vnto the Iaſper piller, wherein he beheld two lines written. The firſt contayned <hi>Madanil</hi> ſonne to the Duke of <hi>Burgoine,</hi> hath paſſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the arch of loyall louers, and ended that aduenture. The other was the name of <hi>Don Bruneo de bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne mer,</hi> or of the lucky Sea, ſonne to <hi>Vaillades,</hi> Marques of <hi>Troques.</hi> Scant had he read the laſt line, but he beheld a third, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained: This is the name of <hi>Agraies</hi> ſon to <hi>Languines</hi> King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This <hi>Madanil</hi> loued <hi>Aquinda</hi> Counteſſe of <hi>Flanders:</hi> &amp; <hi>Don Bruneo, Melicia</hi> daughter to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule.</hi> When <hi>Amadis</hi> did ſee that his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen was entred without any let at all, hee ſayde vnto his brethren. Will not you proue the aduenture as hee hath done? No, anſwered they, for we are not ſo much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto this paſſion, that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to make tryall of our loyalty. Seeing then that you bee twaine, keepe you one another company, and I will accompany Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> if I can. Then he boldly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vnder the arch, and as hee paſſed, the copper Image ſounded vpon his horne another ſound, far more melodious then hee yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had done. Moreouer, in ſtead of fire and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But for all this <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſtayed not, but paſſed on euen hard vnto the Images of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polidon</hi> and <hi>Grimaneſa,</hi> the which ſeemed vnto him ſo well formed, as they wanted nothing but ſpeech. When <hi>Agraies</hi> which was entered before, perceiued him, he came to him and ſayde, My Lord
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7181:138"/>
and Coſen, me thinkes we ſhould not hence-forth hide our loues from one another. But <hi>Amadis</hi> without any anſwere, tooke him by the hand, and walking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they beganne to diſcourſe of the excellency of the place. In the meane ſeaſon <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> diſpleaſed with ſtaying ſo long for them, did intreate <hi>Iſania</hi> (the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the Iſle) to ſhew them vnto the forbidden chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which he did.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Galaor,</hi> my Lord, are you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to try yourſelfe? No, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered hee, for I neuer deſired to prooue ſuch enchantments. I pray you then ſayde <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> to ſport you whileſt I haue tryed this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture. Then commending him-ſelfe to God, with his ſhield vpon his arme, &amp; his ſword in his hand, hee marched right towardes the forbidden place. But he went not farre forward, when hee felt him-ſelfe layd at ſo ſore, and ſo often ouercharged with the ſtroakes of Launces and ſwords, as hee verily beleeued that no man was able long to ſuffer them: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bearing his head lowe (mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger all the reſiſtance) he marched forward, laying about him heere and there, but knewe not vpon whom. Yet he thought that which hee did hit, were ſo well armed, as his ſworde could in no ſort hurt them, and hee paſſed the piller of Braſſe, euen hard vnto the other of Marble, againſt the which hee fell downe, not being any longer able to ſtand vp: for hee felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo wearie, and bruiſed with the forcible blowes which hee had ſuffered, that he thought he ſhould die. And in the ſame inſtant he was ſo rudely lifted forth of the place, that hee loſt all his vnderſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewith <hi>Galaor</hi> was ſo diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he thought himſelfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of blame if he did not reuenge his wrong. And therefore hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke him to his armes, and ranne right vnto the forbidden chamber: yet his haſte was not ſo great, but that hee was as ſuddenly reſiſted &amp; ſmitten,, and ſo violently layde at, as very hardly hee came vnto the Marble piller, againſt the which hee leaned, thinking to take breath. Notwithſtanding the ſtroakes which on all partes lighted vpon him, were ſo many and ſo waighty, that hee was inflamed with rage in ſuch ſort as hee went on ſomewhat further, hoping yet to withſtand them. Then did he imagine his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to bee ſo many, that for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one blowe hee had before, he now thought that hee receiued twaine, ſo as his ſtrength quite fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and hee fell downe on the ground a great deale more weake then <hi>Floreſtan</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>All this while <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> beholding the pleaſantneſſe of the place wherein they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, perceiued a new writing in the Iaſper piller, which contained: This is <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant louer, ſonne to King <hi>Perion.</hi> At the ſame inſtant was <hi>Galaor</hi> throwne foorth from the pillars, wherewith the Dwarffe began to cry: Out alas, my Lord <hi>Galaor</hi> is dead. This voyce was heard of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> and <hi>Agraies,</hi> who preſently came forth to ſee what the matter was, and they asked the Dwarffe what moued him to cry ſo loud. My Lord anſwered hee, I beleeue your two brethren are dead, in prouing the aduenture of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden chamber: for they haue beene ſo rudely repulſed, as ſee where they lie without moouing hand or foot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:7181:138"/>
Truſt mee ſaide <hi>Amadis</hi> worſe could not haue happened to thee. Then he went vnto them, and hee found them ſo ſorely bruiſed, that they lay ſpeechleſſe. But <hi>Agraies</hi> (thinking becauſe fortune had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured him vnder the arch of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all louers, that ſhee would bee as fauourable vnto him againſt the perill of the chamber) without ſtaying to beholde his Coſens any longer, hauing his ſhield vpon his arme, and his ſworde naked in his hand, bearing his head lowe, hee ran right to the braſen piller, yet had hee not marched farre beyond it, when hee felt ſo many blowes, that hardly could hee reſiſt them. But his heart was ſo great, as mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger all lets, he paſſed euen vnto the marble piller, and there was hee conſtrained to ſtay, hauing no power at all to ſtand any longer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his feet, being ſo aſtonied that hee loſt his remembrance, and hee was as rudely caſt out as his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens had beene before, the which <hi>Amadis</hi> perceiuing, beeing much diſpleaſed, hee began to curſe the houre of that their fond enterpriſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and approaching vnto <hi>Galaor,</hi> who was now come to himſelfe, he ſaid. In troth brother I perceiue I muſt of force followe, though I ſhould die therein. Ah my Lord, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galaor,</hi> it ſhould ſuffice you to take warning by our example, I beſeech you flie ſuch diueliſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries, for nothing but miſchiefe can come from them. Come what will, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> accurſed may I be, if I faint in the matter. Then drawing his ſword, hee well coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with his ſhield, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt made his deuout prayers vnto God, hee cryed, O my deare Lady <hi>Oriana,</hi> from you onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth all the ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that euer I had: I beſeech you now not to forget him, who ſo conſtantly craueth your ayde and good aſſiſtance. Which ſayd, hee ranne ſo lightly towards the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as in ſpight of all impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hee came without taking breath, euen vnto the firſt piller, althought hee felt ſo many ſtrokes light vpon him, that hee did thinke hee fought with more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand knights together: yet his courage ſo much increaſed with the onely remembrance of <hi>Oriana,</hi> that there were neuer any knight before which could come neere him. Then was there heard the voyces of an infinite number, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If this knight do not end this aduenture, neuer may any knight performe the ſame. But for all theſe things hee left not to purſue his fortune, for the further he went, the more encreaſed his deſire to approach the chamber: ſo as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the force of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, or inuiſible company which gaue him many ſore and heauy ſtrokes, hee gained the entry of the chamber, from whence he beheld a hand and an arme couered with green woſted to come forth, which drew him in. And preſently there was heard another voyce, which ſayde: Welcome is the gentle knight that exceedeth him in armes, which eſtabliſhed ſo many maruailes in this place, who in his time was ſecond to none, but this ſurpaſſeth him, and therefore the ſigniory of this Iſland of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to him, hauing aboue all other deſerued it. He which had ſeene this hand, would haue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it to haue beene the hand of a very ancient ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was ſo withered: the which va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed away ſo ſoon as <hi>Amadis</hi> was entred into the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he felt himſelfe ſo freſh, and in ſo good eſtate, as if he had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7181:139"/>
receiued neither blow nor trauell in comming thither. Wherefore hee tooke his ſhield from his neck, ſheathed his ſword, and to <hi>Oriana</hi> he aſcribed the glory, for the great honour which he had gotten: for hee imagined that all his ſtrength proceeded onely from her, and no other. The moſt part of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in the Iſle, with many other ſtrangers had ſeene the proweſſe he had ſhowne, and how the hand brought him into the chamber: eſpecially hauing heard by the words of the voyce, the ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the countrey was attributed to him, for which cauſe they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced very greatly. But none were ſo ioyfull as <hi>Galaor</hi> and his fellows, who in ſtead of emulation, (where-with they might wrongfully haue beene ſuſpected) they were all ſo glad of the good and honour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> as if the like had chanced particularly to euery one of them: and they cauſed themſelues to bee carried to him in the chamber, where they were thoroughly and preſently healed by the vertue of the place. Thither likewiſe came <hi>Iſania</hi> Gouernour of the countrey, accompanied with many of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who all did their duty vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> as to their new Lord, vnder whom they hoped not onely to liue in peace and reſt, but alſo hereafter to ſtretch their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons euen ouer their bordering neighbours and further. Then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one might view the rare deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this palace: amongſt which there was a wardrobe (whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polidon</hi> &amp; his Lady did moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly withdrawe themſelues) ſo beautifull and ſumptuous, as it was not onely impoſſible to make the like, but alſo it was thought very ſtrange and wonderfull, how any man might imagine that hee could build ſo rare a peece of worke: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they which were within, might ſee what any man did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very eaſily, but they which were without could not perceiue any thing that was within the ſame. Thus was the firme Iſland conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Amadis,</hi> which had beene a thouſand yeeres and more without a Lord, ſince <hi>Apolidon</hi> had there ſet vp his inchantments: and the next day the people came from all parts of the Iſland to offer their dutie and homage vnto their new Lord, who receiued them curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. I leaue you then to imagine whether <hi>Amadis</hi> had occaſion to be glad and content or no. They which haue oftentimes bin croſſed with aduerſitie may better iudge therof the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any others can: for they know how to beare, and when to bewaile their misfortunes, more orderly then ſuch who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed with all proſperity &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. Neuertheleſſe I know not whether of theſe two extreamities are more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable: for the one commonly draweth vnto it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable vaine glory, and pride moſt damnable: the other a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual care fraught with deſperation, very dangerous. Therefore euery wiſe man (conſidering there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing parmanent) will neither bee proud with the proſperity that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth him, nor appaled for any aduerſitie that befalleth him: but he will ſwim vprightly as in a calm Sea betweene them both, without abuſing the one, or affrighted with the other. The which <hi>Amadis</hi> could not doe, when inconſtant fortune made him taſte theſe poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which for him ſhee prepared, euen in the midſt (as hee thought) of all his proſperities. And euen as ſhee beyond all meaſure fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, (holding him vp by the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7181:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
chinne) in all chances that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him, without croſſing him in any thing whatſoeuer: in like ſort did ſhee turne her face from him, and brought him into ſuch perplexity and ſorrow, that neither force of armes, the continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Lady, nor the magnanimitie of his heart were once ſufficient to procure him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: but onely the grace, and mery of our Lord God (who in pittie regarded him) after hee had ſometime remained in the rocke of aduerſitie in ſorrow and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou, as you may vnderſtand: from the which hee deliuered him, and placed him in greater eaſe, and contentment then before, as by the ſequel of this hiſtorie you ſhall perceiue.</p>
                  <p>You haue heard in the firſt booke of <hi>Amadis,</hi> in what anguiſh the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> was, for the falſe report of <hi>Ardan</hi> the Dwarffe, at ſuch time as hee returned backe from his maiſter, to fetch the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſword, which <hi>Gandalin</hi> had forgotten behinde him at his departure from the Court: and how ſhe ſoſtered vp in her minde the hate, which ſhe had conceiued againſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> not being able to accept any councell either from <hi>Mabila</hi> or the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> wrongfully ſuſpected him of falſhood, who thought on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but only how he might ſerue and honour her with all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now it reſteth to ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you what happened thereof. Know you then that from the day, wherein this ielouſie was firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in her, it increaſed in ſuch ſort, as it wholly made her forget her accuſtomed manner of life, thinking thence forth on nothing ſo much, as how ſhe might ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reuenge her on <hi>Amadis,</hi> who had (as ſhe thought) ſo grieuouſly offended her. And hereupon ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee was abſent, and that ſhee could not declare vnto him by word of mouth, the anguiſh of her ſoule, ſhee determined to let him vnderſtand it by writing. So as one day amongſt others, beeing alone in her chamber, ſhee tooke pen in hand and writ this letter which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Durin</hi> had at large vnderſtood the will of the Princeſſe, he mounted on horſe backe, and haſted him ſo well that the tenth day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee arriued in the great City of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> where hee found the new Queene <hi>Briolania,</hi> whom hee thought to be the faireſt Lady that euer he had ſeene, except the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Oriana.</hi> Then did he tell her how he was come to ſeek <hi>Amadis,</hi> but ſhee tolde him, that now two whole dayes were paſſed ſince hee and his fellowes were departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſince which time, ſhe heard that they had taken their way vnto the Firme-Iſland. Whereupon <hi>Durin</hi> without any longer ſtay, tooke leaue of her, and rode ſo long, that he arriued in the Iſland the ſame houre that <hi>Amadis</hi> entred vnder the arch of Loyall louers, where hee beheld how the Image had done more for him, then for any other knight that euer entered the ſame before, as it was tolde him. Now as <hi>Amadis</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Agraies</hi> returned to the ſuccour of his brethren, <hi>Durin</hi> thought to haue ſpoken with him, but <hi>Gandalin</hi> entreated him to ſtay vntill he had tred the perill of the forbiden chamber, beeing aſſured that he brought Letters to him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Oriana,</hi> the which perchance might haue been a meane (as he thought) to cauſe him either to forſlow or to faile in the achieuing of ſo great an enterpriſe: for <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Princeſſe, as hee would not only haue left off the conqueſt of the Firme-Iſland, but alſo of the whole world beſide, if ſhe had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Wherefore after hee had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7181:140"/>
finiſhed al the ſtrange aduentures, and the inhabitants of the Iſle had receiued him for their Lord, <hi>Durin</hi> came before him. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, what newes was in the Court of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> My Lord, anſwered <hi>Durin,</hi> I left it euen in the ſame eſtate that it was in at your departure. And as he would haue proceeded in his ſpeech, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> tooke him by the hand, and went with him alone into a very pleaſant Orchard, where they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together: then he demanded how he came to the Firme-Iſland. My Lord, ſaid he, my Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> ſent me vnto you, for ſuch affaires as in this letter you ſhal vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the which he gaue vnto him. <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> tooke it, and without changing his cheere, he turned his face from <hi>Durin,</hi> becauſe hee ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde his colour alter, for his heart began to leap with great ioy, ſo as he knew not wel how to ſet his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. But this ſudden mutation was as ſoone changed into a great deſpare, becauſe, that reading theſe rigorous lines, which pronounced his baniſhment, it ſtroke ſo great ſorrow to his heart, as hee was no longer able to diſſemble his griefe, but burſt out into ſuch vehement weeping, that hee was all drowned in teares. Then <hi>Durin</hi> repented that euer hee was the bringer of ſuch heauie letters, for although the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thereof were vnknown vnto him, yet becauſe he knew not how to remedy it, hee durſt not come neere <hi>Amadis,</hi> who was ſo confounded, as hee fell proſtrate on the ground, and in falling, the letters which hee helde, did fall foorth of his hand. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he preſently tooke them vp, and began to reade them againe: for the beginning had ſogreatly troubled him, that he had not yet ſeene the end. But caſting his eye vpon the ſuperſcritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe words. <hi>She who forreth not to die, but onely becauſe then art her murtherer.</hi> Hee then fetched ſo deepe a ſigh, as if his ſoule had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his body, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fell downe back-ward. Where-with <hi>Durin</hi> was greatly amazed, &amp; ran ſpeedily to helpe him, but hee found him to moue no more then a dead man. Wherefore fearing ſome greate inconuenience, hee thought to haue called <hi>Galaor,</hi> or ſome other, yet fearing that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might be blamed, he ſtaed, &amp; comming vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> lifted him vp, who cryed. Oh heauens, why do you thus ſuffer mee to die, and haue not deſerued it? Alas Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, what recompence dooſt thou offer thoſe that neuer offended thee, now I ſee my ſelfe forſaken of her, for whoſe ſake I would rather ſuffer a thouſand deathes, then one of her commandements by mee ſhould be diſobeied. Then pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looking vpon the letter, which he had in his hand, he ſayde Ah happy letter, becauſe thou wert written by the excellenteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage this day liuing, and yet moſt vnhappy, in that thou procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the cruell death of the trueſt louer that euer ſerued Lady, which death that it may bee the ſooner, I will neuer forſake thee, but will place thee in the neereſt &amp; deereſt place that I haue. So hee put it in his boſome, and asked <hi>Durin</hi> if hee had ought elſe to ſay? No, anſwered he. Well then, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> thou ſhalt preſently returne with my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. In good ſooth my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Durin,</hi> ſhee hath expreſly forbidden me to receiue any. And what, did not <hi>Mabila</hi> nor thy ſiſter wil thee to ſay any thing to me? No my Lord, anſwered he, for they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7181:141"/>
knew not of my departure, becauſe my Lady ſtrictly charged mee to acquaint no body therewith. Ah God, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> I ſee well now, that my miſery is voyd of remedy. Then he roſe vp and went to a riuer which paſſed along by the garden, where hee waſhed his eyes, which done, he willed <hi>Durin</hi> to call <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> and that hee ſhould come back againe with him alone, which hee did: but at their returne they found him in a ſwound againe, yet recouering incontinent, and ſeeing <hi>Gandalin,</hi> he ſaid. Friend I am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, therefore go ſeeke out <hi>Iſania</hi> the Gouernour of this Iſle &amp; bring him hither alone. Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> ran for him and ſtaied not long vn till they returned together: who being come, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaid vnto him, <hi>Iſania</hi> you know the oath you haue ſworne vnto me, &amp; the duty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you are vnto mee bound, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I pray you yet to promiſe me as you are true knight, to keep ſecret whatſoeuer you ſhal ſee me doe, vntill to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after my brethren haue heard diuine ſeruice, and then ſecretly goe thou and cauſe the gate of this Caſtle to be opened, which being done, let <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalin</hi> bring thither my horſe &amp; armour, but take heed that none perceiue it, and I will follow ſtraight after thee: they were no ſooner departed from him, but he began to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber a dream which he had the night before, wherein he thought that being armed, and ſet vpon his horſe hee was on the higheſt part of a peece of land en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with diuerſe ſorts of trees, and that round about him were many perſons ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing the greateſt ioy in the world, then one of them preſented him with a box, ſaying. Sir taſte of that which is herein: which he did, and hee thought hee did eate of a moſt bitter meat. And as hee caſt it from him, the raines of his horſe did breake, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the horſe ran vp and downe ſo that he was not in any ſort able for to ſtay him. When he ſaw he was ſo farre from this merry company, he looked backe, and hee thought that hee beheld their great mirth changed into ſuch exceeding mone, as it greatly pitttied him, &amp; willingly would he haue retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe to aſſawage their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if hee could haue maſtered his horſe, who at that inſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a tuft of trees, where hee found a rocke enuironed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, againſt the which the horſe ſtayed. Then hee alighted for the great deſire he had to reſt him, and vnarmed himſelfe: herewithall he beheld a very aged man clothed with a religious habit, who tooke him by the hand as if he had pittied his trauaile, &amp; ſpake to him certain words in a ſtrange language which he did not vnderſtand: &amp; being in this trouble he awaked. Vpon this dreame <hi>Amadis</hi> muſed a great while, thinking that oftentimes they foreſhow ſome thing that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, becauſe he did ſee part of that which hee had dreamed to fall out. Thus hee came to the gate where <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Iſania</hi> ſtayed his with furniture, &amp; there armed himſelfe: afterwards he mounted vpon his horſe, keeping neither way nor path vntill he came neere vnt an Hermitage, then he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Iſania</hi> what place that was: My Lord anſwered hee, this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is dedicated to the Vrgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> wherein oftentimes are diuerſe ſtrange miracles wrought. For which cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> allighted from his horſe, entred into the Church, and kneeling downe with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, hee made his prayers to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7181:141"/>
God. The which being ended, hee roſe vp, &amp; called <hi>Gandalin</hi> to him, whom he held a long time embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his armes, not being able to ſpeake one word, yet in the end he thus ſaid vnto him. My deere <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> thou and I haue beene foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp with one milke, and alwaies brought vp together, and I neuer felt any paine or ſorrow, wherein thou haſt not had thy part: Thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tok me vp in the ſea, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was yet but a ſmall thing, beeing but newly borne the very night before, afterward he cauſed thy mother to cheriſh mee as tenderly as if I had their deerieſt childe. Now haue I oftentimes tried thy loyalty, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very wel what ſeruice thou haſt done for me, the which I did hope in time with the fauour of God to haue recompenſed, but this great miſ-fortune is fallen vpon me, the which I feele more ſharpe and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell then death it ſelfe, eſpecially ſeeing I am conſtrained to forſake thee, hauing no other thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon thee, but the Iſle which I haue newly conquered, which I do giue thee, commanding <hi>Iſania,</hi> with my other ſubiects (vpon that faith and homage which they haue ſworne vnto me) to receiue thee as their Lord, ſo ſoone as they ſhall be aſſured of my death. Yet is it my wil that thy father and mother ſhal enioy the ſame, during their liues, and afterwards it ſhall remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: which is in recompence of the good I haue receiued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom I thought to haue better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, according to their deſerts and my deſire. And as for you, Lord <hi>Iſania,</hi> I pray you that of the fruits and reuenues of this Iſle, which of long time you haue had in your keeping, you ſhould build here in this place a Moneſtarie, in the honor of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to endow it with ſo much liuing, as thirtie religious men may hence-forth liue vpon the ſame. Ah my Lord, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> I neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke you for any trauaile or perill which hitherto you haue ſuffered, neither yet will I leaue you if God be pleaſed: and if you dye, I will not liue after you, neither for all the world will I loſe you. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may (if it pleaſe you) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe this gift vpon my Lords your brethren, ſeeing I will not haue it, neither do I deſire it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort. Holde thy peace, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> let me heare theſe words no more, vnleſſe thou deſireſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe me: but do as I would haue thee: for my bretheren may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide far greater liuings for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and their friends, then this ſmall thing which I doe giue vnto thee. But touching you, my deere friend <hi>Iſania,</hi> it very greatly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me that I haue not the means to gratulate you according to your deſerts: notwithſtanding, I leaue you amongſt ſo many of my good friends, as they ſhall ſupply that which I cannot. I pray you my Lord, anſwered hee, ſuffer mee onely to accompany you, that I may be partaker of any wealth or woe that ſhall happen to you: Wherein you ſhall fully ſhew mee your loue, and I reſt ſatisfied to my liking. My deere friend, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> I doubt not but that you would follow with a good will, notwithſtanding my miſeric is ſo exceſſiue, as beſides my maker, none can eaſe it: whome onely I humbly beſeech to bee my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour, for I will haue no other companion. And therefore <hi>Gandalin</hi> if thou deſireſt Knight-hood, holde take it preſently with my armour, which I doe giue thee, for ſince thou haſt heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7181:142"/>
ſo well kept them, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſhould now ſerue thee, conſidering how little I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after need them: if not, thou maieſt receiue this honour of my brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> vnto whom my Lord <hi>Iſania</hi> here, ſhall in my behalfe make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to the ſame ende: and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate thee to ſerue him, euen as faithfully as thou haſt ſerued mee. For my loue vnto him is ſo great, as amongſt all my moſt afflictions I ſhall bewaile his abſence, becauſe I haue euermore fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble obedient &amp; a louing brother. You ſhall further requeſt him, to take into his ſeruice <hi>Ardan</hi> my Dwarffe whom I recommend vnto him, &amp; to the Dwarffe ſay, that I will him to ſerue my brother dilligently. This ſayd, both hee and thoſe to whom he ſpake burſt forth into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of teares, &amp; comming vnto them he embraced them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Now my friends, ſeeing I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hope to ſee you any more, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you to pray to God for mee, and vpon your liues, I charge you that none of you doe follow mee. Then hee got vpon his horſe, ſet ſpurres to his ſides, and galloped from them, remembring not at his departure to take either Launce, ſhield, or helmet with him. Thus he entred into a deſert place at the foot of a mountaine, taking no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way but whither his horſe would carry him, and ſo long hee rode vntill the moſt parte of the night was now ſpent, when the horſe entred into a little brook en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with many trees, where he would haue drunken. But as hee paſſed on further, <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſtrucken on the face with certaine branches of trees, ſo rudely as it wakened him out of his ſtudy, and therewithall looking vp, hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that hee was in a couert and ſolitary place, beſet with ſtore of thick buſhes, which greatly reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, becauſe hee thought hee ſhould very hardly bee found out in this thicket. There he alighted, tyed his horſe, and ſate him downe vpon the graſſe, the better to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate vpon his melancholy: but hee had wept ſo long, and his braines were ſo light, that at the laſt hee fell aſleepe.</p>

When his horſe ſented

Then he ſuddenly ſtarted vp as if hee had been frighted. At that inſtant was the Moon withdrawne by the daies approach, yet ſate hee ſtill on the graſſe, beginning his moane in a moſt ſtrange and pittifull manner, and bitterly weeping, he burſt out into theſe words. Alas fortune too inconſtant &amp; ſickle, why haſt thou firſt aduanced mee, and afterwards ouerthrowne me. Now I well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, thou canſt doe more hurt in one houre, then thou wilt do good in a thouſand yeares, for if hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſte giuen me any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or ioy, thou haſt now in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cruelly robbed me of all, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me in bitter torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts far worſe then death: and ſeeing thou waſt minded ſo to ſerue mee, why haſt thou not at the leaſt made the one equal with the other? becauſe thou knoweſt that if heeretofore thou didſt beſtow vpon me any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet was it euermore mingled with great ſorrowe. In like ſort ſhouldſt thou reſerue for me ſome ſparke of hope, with this cruelty wherewith thou now tormenteſt me, executing vpon me an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible thing, in the thought of thoſe whom thou fauoureſt: who becauſe they feele not this miſchiefe, doe thinke thoſe riches, glories, and honours which vnto them thou lendeſt, to bee euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. But they forget, that beſides the troubleſom trauels which their bodies doe ſuffer for the keeping thereof, how their ſoules are in danger to periſh therefore. For by thy flatteries &amp; wanton intiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, thou vtterly ouerthroweſt them, &amp; in the end compelleſt them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the labyrinth of all deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from whence they are neuer able to depart. And quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are thy aduerſities, for ſo much as if a man doe reſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> patiently, flying greedy couetouſnes, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ambition, he is lifted out of this vilde place into perpetuall glory. Notwithſtanding I beeing moſt vnfortunate, could not chuſe this good, ſeeing that if all the world were mine, and ſhould bee taken from me by thee, yet hauing only the good grace of my Miſtris, it ſhould be ſufficient to make me as mighty as the greateſt monark, the which I alſo lacking, how is it poſſible for me in any ſort to liue? Therefore in fauour and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of my loyalty, I beſeech thee not to giue mee a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death: but if thou art appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ende my dayes, doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, taking compaſſion of him, whoſe longer life thou art ignorant how irkeſome it is.

Then within a while after hee cryed, Ah louely <hi>Oriana,</hi> you haue wounded me deadly, in baniſhing me diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteouſly, for I will neuer tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, what danger ſoeuer may happen mee, ſeeing that if therein I failed, my life alſo were thereby finiſhed: notwithſtanding for as much as I wrongfully receiue my death, the more extream is my dolor. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that with my end you ſhall reſt ſatisfied, I neuer eſteemed my life at ſo high a price, but I wold, if it were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7181:143"/>
poſſible, change it into a thouſand deaths, to afford you neuer ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſure. In like ſort ſince it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you to execute your anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, I am very well content, if for my affliction you may hence-forth liue at your eaſe, for whether ſoeuer my Soule flyeth, it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue moſt quiet when it ſhal know that you remaine contented. And vntill mine innocencie ſhall bee known vnto you, I will endeauor to finiſh the reſt of my ſorrowfull daies in all bitterneſſe and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and being dead, my ſpirit ſhal lament the griefe which wil happen vnto you for the wrong which you haue done to me, ſpecialy wanting power to ſuccour you. O king <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> my Lord and father, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle occaſion ſhall you haue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my death, when you ſhall neither know the ſame nor the cauſe thereof? But becauſe that knowing the ſame, it would bee to you a griefe intollerable, and yet it could be no mittigation of my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I pray, that my misfortune may to you neuer be manifeſt, leaſt the ſame ſhould abridge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of your dayes, which yet are not determined. Then after a ſmall pauſe he cryed, O my ſecond father <hi>Galuanes,</hi> truely I do greatly grieue that my aduerſe Fortune doth not permit me to diſcharge that great bond in which to you I am bound, for if my father gaue me life, you preſerued the ſame, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering me from the danger of the Sea, being launched forth into his mercileſſe waues, euen when I had but newly left my mothers womb, and afterwardes I was by you as carefully cheriſhed, as if I had beene your deereſt childe. I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured good King <hi>Arban</hi> that you will greatly bewaile my ſorrowfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ah good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Mabila,</hi> what haue I deſerued of you, or of the Damoſel of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> that by you I am abandoned when I haue moſt neede of your ayde? Haue you ſo many times preſerued my life, &amp; doe you now (without deſert) make me pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute for my receiued pleaſure, in conſenting to my miſerable death? Beleeue mee, if need were, deare friends, for your ſakes would I bee ſacrificed: and yet you make no conſcience to forſake mee, which maketh mee verily to beleeue, that you haue denied mee your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, heauen and earth haue deſired my confuſion, which ſhall the leſſe grieue me in that I ſee no remedy. <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Durin</hi> hearing theſe lamentations of <hi>Amadis,</hi> the were ſo much agrieued therewith, that they wept as bitterly as hee, yet durſt they not ſhew themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had ſo ſtraitly charged them not to follow him.

Hauing ended his ſong hee alighted vnder a tuſted tree planted by the high way ſide, thinking there to paſſe the reſt of the night: but worſe happened to him then he hoped, for <hi>Gandalin</hi> which had heard what hee ſayde of <hi>Oriana,</hi> (doubting that <hi>Amadis</hi> had not marked it, becauſe his minde was otherwiſe occupied) ſayde vnto <hi>Durin,</hi> It were beſt for mee to goe to my Maſter to know what hee intendeth to doe. Then came hee forth of the buſh where he was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, &amp; beheld <hi>Amadis</hi> that ſought for his horſe to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, who as he looked here &amp; there he eſpied <hi>Gandalin:</hi> When not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at the firſt, he cryed. Who art thou that commeſt to ſurpriſe me? ſpeake and hide thy ſelfe no longer. My Lord, anſwered he, I an <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who will helpe you to finde your horſe, if ſo it pleaſe you. When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard this, Ah ſaid hee, how durſt you perſume to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, hauing ſo expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>you? beleeue mee thou haſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed mee, let mee ſee thee no more but depart, or elſe be ſure thou ſhalt die. My Lord, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> mee thinkes you ſhould forget this manner of behauiour, and bethinke you how to reuenge the fooliſh ſpeeches which euen now were vttered by a knight, who is not yet far from you, for they are greatly to your diſaduantage. This ſayde <hi>Gandalin</hi> to pacifie his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure towardes him, that hee might bee the more incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other. I did heare him as well as you (ſayd he) and therefore am I content to ſeeke reſt elſe-where, and to depart from hence where all misfortune doth follow me. What ſayd <hi>Gandalin,</hi> is this all that you are determined to doe? What wouldſt thou more? ſaid he. That you fight with him anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> to make him confeſſe his preſumption. I beleeue ſayd hee thou wouldeſt ſay otherwiſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou knoweſt very well that I neither haue ſpirit, heart, not any force, hauing loſt all in loſing her who gaue me life, ſo as now I am no better then a dead man, neither is there in Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> any knight ſo cowardly, that could not eaſily ouercome mee if I ſhould combate with him, ſo hapleſſe and hopelſſe am I. Truſt me anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> you are in a great errour thus to ſuffer your heart to ſaint &amp; to let your courage faile, euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould moſt ſerue you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the honour of her, who ſo neerely toucheth you. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port will <hi>Durin</hi> make here of thinke you, who hath heard and ſeene all, and is greatly abſhed, that now you behaue your ſelfe no better. How (ſayd <hi>Amadis)</hi> is <hi>Durin</hi> here? I truely ſayd <hi>Gandalin,</hi> wee came both together: and I beleeue hee followeth you thus, to declare your manner of behauiour vnto her that ſent him vnto you. Get thee gone ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> thou vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt mee too much. Yet when hee thought that <hi>Durin</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>Oriana,</hi> his heart was ſo inflamed, that hee called for his armes, and mounting on his horſe he went toward the knight, whom hee found layd vnder the tree, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his horſe by the bridle. Then <hi>Amadis,</hi> in a great rage ſayde vnto him, Sir knight who ſo greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolleſt thy fortune in loue, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that againſt all right thou haſt receined that good that loue hath doue for thee (if good it may be tearmed) and that thou neuer deſeruedſt it, the which I wil proue with the loſſe of thy head. What art thou anſwered the other, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7181:144"/>
ſpeakeſt ſo audaciouſly? doſt thou think that I am fauoured of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Lady in the worlde for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe but onely for my valour and high knighthood? wherewith I will make thee preſently confeſſe that loue hath reaſon to fauour me, and that it is not for thee to ſpeake thereof. It is but thy opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſayde <hi>Amadis:</hi> but thou muſt knowe that in deſpight of thee, I am hee who hath leaſt occaſion to praiſe loue, becauſe hee hath ſo vildely deceiued me, that I wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dayes in my life put any truſt in him, knowing how falſely and treacherouſly he commonly vſeth thoſe that moſt faithfully do ſerue him. And becauſe I haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prooued it, I will maintaine that he can neuer be ſo faithfull, as I haue found him falſe. That it is ſo, let vs ſee whether hee hath gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more in thee then he hath loſt in me. Then the knight mounted on his horſe, and beeing ready to fight, he anſwered, Vnhappy knight depriued of all good, and baniſht iuſtly from loue, beeing vnworthy of his fauor, get thee from my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, for I ſhould commit a moſt horrible fact, to lay my hands vpon ſuch a vild &amp; miſerable fellow. So ſaying, he turned his horſe to haue fled away, if <hi>Amadis</hi> had not ſtaied him in calling him. Villaine, wilt thou then defend thy loue which ſo highly thou priſeſt onely with thy countenance, and ſo get thee gone becauſe thou wouldeſt fly the combat. Truſt me anſwered the other thou art in a right opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it is true that I haue no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to proue my ſelfe againſt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo ſmall deſert, but ſeeing thou wouldeſt that I ſhould breake thy head, I am content, and if thy heart will ſerue, defend it if thou canſt. Herewithall they ran one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other with ſuch force, as their Lances flew to ſhiuers, pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their ſhields quite thorough, neuertheleſſe their armour being good &amp; ſtrong ſtaied the ſtroke, yet the knight fell to the ground car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the raines of his horſe with him, wherefore he roſe again light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The which <hi>Amadis</hi> beholding, he ſaid vnto him, Truely knight if the right which you pretend in ſo faire a friend bee not better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with your ſword then it hath beene with your ſtaffe, Loue hath made but a bad choyce of you for a valiant champion, &amp; your Lady a far worſer match in lighting vpon ſuch a carpet knight. He made no account at all of theſe reproaches, but boldly drew out his ſword, and comming neere to <hi>Amadis</hi> laid at him ſo luſtily, that hee had beene wounded if with his ſhield hee had not well warded himſelfe, wherein his ſword was ſo farre entred, that he could not pul it forth again, but was forced to let go his holde, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it ſticking faſt in the ſhield of <hi>Amadis.</hi> Who lifted himſelfe vp in his ſtirrops hitting him ſo ſound a blow vpon his head-peece, that it pearced euen vnto the quick: &amp; the blow gliding downe, it lighted vpon his horſe neck, wounded him to the death, falling downe in the place and his maſter vnder him all aſtonied. But <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing him ariſe ſaid vnto him, Gentle lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I am of the minde that <hi>Cupid</hi> henceforth ſhould erect a trophie for the high proweſſe which you haue ſhewed in his ſeruice: &amp; that as long as you liue you ſhould not ceaſe to ſing his praiſes, &amp; declare thoſe benefits which vpon you hee hath beſtowed: As for mee I will goe ſecke my fortune elſe where. So he ſet ſpurres to his horſe, &amp; as he departed, he beheld <hi>Gandalin</hi> &amp;

                     <hi>Durin,</hi> when co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming neere them, he tooke <hi>Durin</hi> by the hand, and ſayd vnto him: Friend <hi>Durin,</hi> I ſee my misfortune ſo ſtrange, and my ſorrow ſo intollerable, as of force I muſt die, which God grant it may be without delay: for death onely will giue reſt and eaſe to this torture which vexeth mee. Salute from me the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila,</hi> and thy good ſiſter, the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> vnto whom thou mayſt declare my cruel death, which I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer with as great wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as euer any knight ſuffered. Before the which, I would to God I had the meanes to doe them any ſeruice, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the duty I doe owe them for all the good they haue done, and the fauours they haue purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for mee. Then hee beganne his moane, weeping ſo bitterly as <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> therewith had his heart ſo ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with woe, that hee was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to anſwer one word: Wherfore <hi>Amadis</hi> embraced him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to God. At that inſtant began the day to appeare, when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Gandalin</hi> followed him, hee ſayd vnto him: if thou determineſt to come with me, take heede vpon thy life that thou turne me not from any thing which I ſhall ſay or doe, otherwiſe I pray thee forthwith to turne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way that I may ſee thee no more. Beleeue me Sir, ſayd <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> I wil do whatſoeuer ſhal pleaſe you.

And as hee gaue her to vnderſtand what feruency and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee endured in ouer-louing her, ſhe anſwered him: My Lord, I aſſuredly beleeue that which you tell mee, and the better to witneſſe the ſame, I let you know that there is no prince liuing for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I would do more then for you, nor whom I would more willingly take for huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: becauſe I know your good parts, and the high knight-hood where withall you are ſo famouſed. Theſe ſpeeches bred ſo great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in the heart of <hi>Patin,</hi> as beſides that hee was by nature one of the proudeſt Gentlemen in the world, hee entred into ſuch glory, that he anſwered her: Madame, I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7181:145"/>
haue heard that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> hath a daughter eſteemed the faireſt Princeſſe in the worlde, but for the loue of you I will goe into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> there to mainteine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all men, that her beauty is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable to yours: the which I alone will prooue in combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two of the beſt knights that dare ſay the contrary: whom if I cannot ouercome, I will that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> doe cauſe my head to bee cut off. In good faith my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Queene, I am of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion: for if the Princeſſe haue any beauty in her, it nothing impaireth that which God hath beſtowed vpon mee, if any beauty there bee: and me thinks that you haue other means more fit to make known your proweſſe in all places. Hap what may hap anſwered hee, I will doe it for your loue, to the end that euery one may knowe that as you are the faireſt Lady in the world, ſo you are beloued of the valianteſt Knight aliue. Hereupon continuing in this minde, within a while after hee tooke leaue of the Queene, and paſſed into Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> accompanied onely with two Eſquires. Then hee enquired where he might find King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> vnto whoſe Court he ſhortly after came: and becauſe hee was more richly armed then wandering knights were accuſtomed to bee, the King thought him to be ſome great perſonage: For this cauſe hee receiued him moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, appointing him into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſhift himſelfe. When he was vnarmed hee returned to the King who ſtayed for him, marching with ſuch grauity, as thoſe that beheld (ſeeing his comely ſtature) iudged him to bee of great courage. But the King tooke him by the hand, and conferring together hee ſayde vnto him, gentle friend, I pray you thinke it not ſtrange, if I deſire to know who you are, becauſe I may the more honor you in my Court. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Patin,</hi> I am not come into this countrey, to hide mee, but rather to make my ſelfe knowne as well vnto your Highneſſe as vnto all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: I am that <hi>Patin</hi> brother to the Emperour which humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth you to enquire no further of my affaire, vntill I haue ſeen my Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> your daughter. When the King heard that, he embraced him, and in excuſing his ignorance he ſayd to him. My good Coſen, I am maruailous glad of the honour that you haue done me, In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thus to viſit me in my owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, aſſuring you that ſince you are deſirous to ſee my daughter, ſhe ſhall not onely be ſhewed vnto you, but likewiſe the Queene, and all her trayne. And ſo long they continued their talke, vntill they had couered for ſupper. Then the King cauſed him to ſit next vnto him, where hee found himſelfe compaſſed with ſo great a number of knights, as hee much marualled thereat: and began to deſpiſe the Court of the Emperour his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as alſo of all other Princes in reſpect of this which hee ſaw. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the tables were taken vp, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time to goe to reſt, the King co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded <hi>Don Grumedan</hi> to bring <hi>Patin</hi> to his lodging and to ſhew him all the honor and good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment hee could. So for that night they departed, vntill the next morning that hee came and found the King hearing diuine ſeruice, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the which hee was conducted to the Ladies, who receiued him curteouſly: for at his comming the Queen took him by the hand, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſit betweene her, &amp; her
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7181:145"/>
daughter <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he beheld with ſuch an eye, as the loue which before he did beare vnto the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> was wholly changed vnto her, beeing captiuated with her excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodly grace. You may iudge then how he would haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed her if he had ſeene her in the time of her perfect health, which was now much decaied by reaſon of this new iealouſie which ſhe had conceiued againſt <hi>Amadis</hi> which made her looke leane, pale, and wan: but theſe defaults could nothing quench the heate of the fire already kindled in the heart of <hi>Patin,</hi> who was ſo far beſide him-ſelfe, that hee determined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the king to beſtow her vpon him in mariage: making account that it would be eaſily granted, conſidering his birth and high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Hereupon he tooke leaue of the Ladies, and returned towards the King, who was ready to ſit downe to dinner, the which being ended hee went aſide towards a window, and calling <hi>Patin</hi> vnto him, they talked long together. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards falling from one matter to another, <hi>Patin</hi> ſaid vnto him. It may pleaſe your maieſty, yeſter-day I promiſed to tel you (ſo ſoone as I had ſeene my Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> your daughter) what moued me to come from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Great-Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> I beſeech you not to bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended if I haue taken ſo far a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to come in perſon to require her of you in mariage. I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen her as wel to haue your alliance as alſo for the beauty and good grace which remaineth in her. I am ſure you are not ignorant (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the place from whence I am deſcended, &amp; the great meanes which cannot faile me, as one day to be Emperor of <hi>Rome)</hi> that if I would elſe where ſet my liking, there is no Prince this day liuing, which would not be very glad to receiue mee for his ſonne in law. Good coſin, anſwered the king, I thanke you for the kindneſſe and honour you do offer me, but the Queene hath alwaies promiſed <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> that ſhe ſhal neuer be maried againſt her will, wherefore before wee grant you any thing, we muſt know of her how ſhe will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therewith: this the King ſayd becauſe he would not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Patin,</hi> for he was not minded to beſtowe his daughter vpon any Prince or Lord that ſhould carry her forth of the land. <hi>Patin</hi> was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with theſe wordes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſome other anſwere of the King, hee ſtayed fiue dayes at the Court, yet the king neuer ſpake to <hi>Oriana</hi> thereof, although he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him that hee had done as much as he could, to cauſe her conſent thereto, but he could in no ſort preuaile with her. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore win her your ſelfe if you can, ſaid he, and pray her to doe that which I ſhall command her. Then <hi>Patin</hi> came vnto her and ſaid. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame I am to deſire a requeſt of you, that ſhall be both honorable and profitable for you, the which I pray you not to deny me. My Lord (anſwered the princeſſe) there is no reaſon to refuſe the grant, being ſuch a reaſonable requeſt as you aſſure me it is, therefore if it pleaſe you, defer not to declare it vnto me. I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Patin,</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey whatſoeuer the king your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall command you. <hi>Oriana</hi> (who vnderſtood not his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) anſwered him. You may bee aſſured Sir, that I ſhould be very ſorry to do otherwiſe. This anſwere wonderfully contented <hi>Patin,</hi> for he now aſſuredly thought <hi>Oriana</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:7181:146"/>
to be his, and ſaid vnto her, Madam I haue determined to go thorough this countrie to ſeeke ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures, and I hope to performe ſo high deeds of Arms, as you ſhall ſhortly heare news of my prowes, ſo much to mine aduantage, as very eaſily you will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſcend vnto that which the king will command you for the loue of me. Herewithall he tooke leaue of her, manifeſting at this time his intention vnto her no farther, and returned vnto the king vnto whom he declared the anſwer of <hi>Oriana,</hi> together with the deſire he had to proue himſelfe againſt al wandring Knights. Do as it pleaſe you, anſwered the king, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I would aduiſe you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from ſuch an enterpriſe: for you ſhall finde many ſtrange and very dangerous aduentures, with a great number of knights well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in armes, who may happily in ſome ſort diſpleaſe you. If they be valiant and hardy, ſaid he, I hope they ſhall not finde any faintnes or cowardlines in me, as my deedes hereafter may witnes. Wel, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the king. Do what you ſhall thinke beſt. Thus <hi>Patin</hi> departed in the hope which he had to enioy <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> for the loue of whom he had framed this ſong, which he ſung when fortune brought him neere the place where <hi>Amadis</hi> made his mone, who vſed him as you haue heard. But now we will leaue him, and recount vnto you what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Durin,</hi> who hauing left <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> returned the next way paſſing by the place where <hi>Patin</hi> lay woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who had taken off his Helmet for the grief of his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready loſt ſuch ſtore of blood, that his face and armour was all ſtained and couered therewith. He behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Durin,</hi> ſaid to him, Gentle-man, my friend, tell me where I may finde a place to cure my wounds. Truly anſwered hee, I know no place but one, and thoſe whom you ſhall finde there, are ſo ſorrowfull, that I beleeue they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke vnto you. Wherefore? ſaid <hi>Patin.</hi> For a Knight (quoth <hi>Durin)</hi> who newly hath wonne the place that I tell you of, and ſeen the images of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and his Lady, which till then no other might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: ſince when he is departed thence ſecretly in ſuch melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as his death is greatly feared Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſaid <hi>Patin,</hi> you ſpeake of the Firme-Iſland. True (quoth <hi>Durin.)</hi> What ſaid <hi>Patin,</hi> is it conquered already? certes, I am heartily ſorry, for I was going thither, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to proue my ſelfe, hoping to haue won the ſame. <hi>Durin</hi> ſmiled, and anſwered him, Truely knight if there be no more proweſſe hidden within you, then that which you haue now manifeſted, I thinke in ſtead of honour, you might there haue gotten ſhame and infamy. <hi>Patin</hi> thinking himſelfe iniuried roſe vp, and thought to haue taken hold of the ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the day following, when the Lords were ready to ſit downe at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they perceiued that <hi>Amadis</hi> was abſent: and enquiring for him, <hi>Iſania</hi> told them that they ſhould know after dinner where hee was become. Thereupon they ſat down thinking that he was gone ſomwhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his pleaſure. After the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were taken vp, <hi>Iſania</hi> ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. My lords the misfortune of my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> is far worſe then you thinke it is, as I ſhall preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you. Then he recited in what order he deparded from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the great ſorrow wherein hee was, and what he had commanded him to ſay vnto them, eſpecially how he had diſpoſed of the Iſland, and he earneſtly intreated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, ſeeing that he hoped for no remedy of his miſery: For his death was not to bee preuented. When they heard theſe pittifull news, there was not any of them whoſe eyes were not filled with teares, and they began to make a moſt ſorrowfull lamentation. But <hi>Galaor</hi> made the greateſt moane of all, ſaying. If I may releeue him from diſtreſſe, the beſt knight in the world ſhall not in this ſort die. Although he hath commanded vs to ſtay, yet ſhall he not be obeyed for me at this time: but I will ſeeke vntil I ſhal haue found him, &amp; wil know who hath wronged him, that I may eyther reuenge it, or die in the quarell. Beleeue me anſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> we will not be far behinde you: and if we cannot remedy his misfortune by force of courage, or counſell, yet at the leaſt we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together die with him for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

As for me, I thinke that without longer delay we ſhould all to horſeback, making as great ſpeede as we may to finde him, then we may know if there be any meanes to cure his malady: for the time paſſeth, his ſorrow increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and he ſtill goeth farther from vs. The Lord <hi>Iſania</hi> (as he ſaith) hath brought him ſome part of his way, he may ſhew vs then which path he hath taken, but if we ſhall longer tarry, wee may loſe him, without hope euer to ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Therefore my Lords I pray you let vs make haſt to follow him. Vnto the which they all agreed, &amp; cauſed their horſes to be preſently brought. Then <hi>Iſania</hi> conducted them to the place where <hi>Amadis</hi> had left him, and from thence they rode till they came whereas <hi>Patin</hi> lay wounded, whom they beheld lying vpon the ground, whileſt his two eſquires did cut down boughs and poles, to make him a litter: for he was ſo feeble with the loſſe of his blood, that he could not ſit on horſeback, nor anſwere one onely word vnto the knights who ſaluted him, and enquired of him, what he was that had done him ſuch out-rage: but he made a ſigne that his Squires ſhould tell them. Where-upon <hi>Galaor</hi> came, and demanded the matter of them, they anſwered him that he had iouſted againſt a knight which came from the Firme Iſland, by whom hee was ouer-throwne at the firſt encounter, and how that afterwards thinking to reuenge him with his Sworde, he ſped ſo illas they might per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Notwithſtanding we do think that we did meete him in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither, and he did ride ouer the forreſt ſo faſt as his horſe could run, hauing none following him but one Squire, who wept bitterly carrying after him his Armour and ſhield, vpon the which were 2. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſables, in a field Ore. In faith ſaid <hi>Floreſtan</hi> it is he whom we doe ſeeke. Shew vs therefore what way he tooke, the which they did. Then the knights went after him, and ſo long they rode, vntill they came to a croſſe way, where they ſtaid to aduiſe what was beſt to be done: for there was not any body that might tell them any newes of that which they ſought: and therefore they determined to ſeparate them-ſelues, promiſing one vnto another to meete at the Court of king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohns</hi> day next enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but if by that time they heard no news of <hi>Amadis,</hi> then they would determine further what to do in the matter, thus taking leaue of each other, they departed with weeping: and afterward they did what they might, but it was all in vaine, although they had ridden through many ſtrange countries in which they found many great accidents &amp; perilous aduentures. But you muſt know, that ſo ſoone as <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſent <hi>Durin</hi> away, he ſet ſpurres vnto his horſe, neyther caring, nor determining what way he ſhould take, &amp; he went euen as fortune guided him: in the end hee came to the bottom of an obſcure valley, ful of vnderwood &amp; buſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to hide himſelfe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found out of any that might follow him. Here did he alight, letting his horſe goe where hee would, but vnbridled him not: then he ſate down by the ſide of a brook, which deſcended from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and tooke a little water to refreſh him withall. By this time <hi>Gandalin</hi> had ouertaken him, who had ſtayed behinde to deliuer <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> his Sword, who finding <hi>Amadis</hi> laid all along vpon the graſſe, ſo ſtill that he heard not one word to proceede from him: hee durſt not ſay any thing to him, but ſate downe hard by him, and within a while after <hi>Amadis</hi> roſe vp, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding <hi>Gandalin</hi> laide vpon the ground by him, hee puſhed him with his foote ſaying, ſleepeſt thou <hi>Gandalin?</hi> By my faith ſir no, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, for inſtead of ſleeping, I thought vpon two things which concerne you greatly, the which (if it pleaſe you) I will declare, if not, I will hold my peace. Go to riſe ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> and take our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for I will get me gone, becauſe I ſhould be very ſory to be found of thoſe (who it may be) do follow me. Truly anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> me thinks you are farre enough out of the way: beſides your horſe is ſo wearie, as if you let him not reſt a little, it is impoſſible for him to beare you any longer. I pray thee ſaid he, (in weeping) do what thou ſhalt thinke beſt, for whether I ſtay or goe, my ſorrows are remediles. Eate then a little of this bread which I haue brought for your ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> but he refuſed it. What will you then do ſaid he, ſhall I tell you whereupon I ſtudied euen now? It is all one to me anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I thinke on nothing ſo much as my death. Then hearken vnto me if it pleaſe you, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> I haue long time muſed vpon the letter which <hi>Oriana</hi> ſent vnto you, as alſo vpon the words which the knight vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt whom you did fight, and ſo conſequently vpon the lightneſſe and inconſtancy where-with women are endued: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe hath changed her loue and your ſelfe for a ſtranger, ſhee witneſſeth very well what truſt a man ſhould repoſe in ſuch as ſhe is: and on the other ſide, when I conſider her vertues, I thinke it in a manner impoſſible, that ſhe ſhould ſo farre forget her ſelfe. But it may be that in your abſence, ſome falſe report of you, hath been made vnto her, whereby ſhe hath conceiued this diſpleaſure againſt you, the concealing whereof ſo much the more increaſed her grief. Notwithſtanding, ſeeing you are aſſured that you neuer offended her, although ſhe haue beene too credulous, yet in the end the truth will be knowne, and thereby your innocency the more apparant, it ſeemeth vnto me that you ſhould not thus deſpaire, ſeeing that ſhee may repent her folly, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the wrong which ſhe hath done vnto you, in ſuch ſort as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring pardon for her miſconceit, ſhe may make you amends with more ioy &amp; contentment then you euer yet enioyed together: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inforce your ſelfe to eate, that you may be able hereafter to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue your life, but if you do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffer the ſame thus to be loſt, you ſhall alſo looſe all the good &amp; honor that euer you may or can hope for in this world. Hold thy peace ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> for thou haſt ſo ſhamefully and wickedly lied, as I know no man which would not be diſpleaſed to heare thee thus to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her, becauſe that ſo wiſe a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7181:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Princeſſe neuer did amiſſe at any time: and if I die, I haue well deſerued it, ſeeing that ſhe ſhall be obeied and ſatisfied euen vntill my death. And be thou aſſured, if I did not thinke that thou ſpeakeſt this, onely with intent thereby to aſſwage my ſorrow: I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtrike thy head from thy ſhoulders, for the offence which thou haſt done vnto me, and take heed that henceforth you commit not the like fault.</p>
                  <p>When he had ſo ſaid, he aroſe vp in a great rage, and walked vp along the riuer, ſo penſiue that he knew not what way he ſhould take. Which <hi>Gandalin</hi> perceiuing, (fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his anger, and thinking alſo that he would not goe farre) he let him alone and laid him downe to ſleepe, his eyes beeing very heauie with watching. When <hi>Amadis</hi> was returned vnto him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him ſo ſound aſleepe, hee would not wake him, but took his owne horſe and ſadled him, then did he hide the bridle and harneſſe of <hi>Gandalins</hi> horſe in the buſhes, to the end when he awaked he might not follow him. Then he armed himſelfe and mounted on horſe-backe, coaſting ouer the top of the mountaine. Thus without any ſtay at all, hee rode till it was within foure houres of the ſun ſetting, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending then into a great plaine, where there were two high trees, and vnder them a faire fountaine, commonly called, The fountaine of the plaine field: to which hee went to water his horſe. And as he approched neere the fountaine, he beheld a religious man clothed poorly in a garment made of gotes haire, hauing his beard and head all white, who was watering his Aſſe. <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaluted him, asking him if he were a Prieſt. Truely, ſaid the olde man, it is more then forty yeeres ſince I firſt ſaid Maſſe. The gladder am I thereof, ſaid <hi>Amadis.</hi> Then he alighted &amp; took his ſaddle and bridle from his horſe, who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe at liberty, began to run towards the Forreſt, <hi>Amadis</hi> minding not to follow him, but threw off all his armour, which done, he kneeled at the olde mans feete, who taking him vp by the hand, made him ſit downe by him: &amp; beholding him well, he thought him to bee the faireſt Gentleman that euer he ſaw, although hee was pale and wan, hauing his face all bedewed with teares: whereat the Hermit was moued with ſo great compaſſion, that hee ſayde vnto him. Knight, you ſeeme to bee full of ſorrow, and if your griefe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the repentance of any ſinne that you haue committed, In truth my ſon you are very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: and if it bee for any temporall loſſe, then I thinke (ſeeing your youth, and the eſtate wherein you haue liued vnto this preſent, you ſhold not thus ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>xe your ſelfe, but pray for forgiueneſſe. Then hee gaue him his bleſſing, ſaying. Goe too, now confeſſe your ſins. Here-upon <hi>Amadis</hi> began to tell the whole diſcourſe of his life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting any thing paſſe. Truely, ſaide the holy man, ſeeing that you are diſcended of ſo high a birth, you ought to bee the more vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: yet you muſt not diſpaire for any tribulation that may happen vnto you, cheefely, for this that proceedeth from the occaſion of a woman, who is as eaſily won as ſhe is lightly loſt. Wherefore my ſon, I councell you to forget ſuch vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and henceforth to baniſh the thought of ſuch a miſerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life from you, for it will not onely be yrkeſome vnto you, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7181:148"/>
alſo euery vertuous perſon will condemne you for it. Ah father, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I am now in ſuch extreamitie, that it is impoſſible I ſhould liue any long time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly pray you to receiue mee into your company, and to comfort my poore ſoule, for that little time which it hath to remain in this vnhappy body. When the good olde man heard him ſpeake with ſuch affection, he ſayde vnto him, I promiſe you my friend, it is ill done of you, who are a knight, yet young and of a comely ſtature, to fall into ſuch deſparie, ſeeing that women cannot continue their loue, but by preſence of thoſe whome they loue: for by nature they are quickly forgetfull, and light of beleefe, eſpecially where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing is reported vnto them of ſuch as haue fondly yeelded them-ſelues to them, who when they think to haue nothing but ioy and contentment, do finde themſelues plunged in all ſorrow and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you now feele by experience. Wherefore I pray you henceforth to be more vertuous and conſtant: and ſeeing you are borne a Kings ſon, and likely to gouerne a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, returne to the world, for it ſhould be a great hurt to looſe you in this ſort: and I cannot preſume what ſhe might bee that brought you into this extreamitie, ſeeing that although ſhee were a woman ſo requiſit as ſhee could not bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled, yet for her ſuch a man as you are to be caſt away. Father, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I aske not your counſell herein, for I now neede it not, but for my ſoules ſake I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you henceforth to receiue mee into your company, which if you refuſe to do, I ſee no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for me, but to die amongſt the beaſts of this forreſt. The old man ſeeing him ſo reſolute, had ſuch compaſſion of him, as the teares fell down his long white beard, and anſwered him: Alas my ſon, my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in a deſert place, and I liue a life too ſtrickt for you, my Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage is at the leaſt ſeuen leagues within the ſea, vpon the top of a poore Rock: vnto the which no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature can come vnleſſe it bee at the beginning of the ſpring time. Notwithſtanding, I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remained thirty yeeres there, exempted from all worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, liuing onely vpon ſuch ſmall almes, which ſome people of this Countrey doe beſtow vpon me. I promiſe you father, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> it is the life which I deſire, and I once intreat you, that you would giue me leaue to go with you. The which the Hermit at the laſt gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, notwithſtanding, that he had a long time denied him. Heere-withall <hi>Amadis</hi> kiſſed his feete, ſaying: father command whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you ſhall pleaſe, for to my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer I will euer obay you. Then the Hermit ſaide his euening ſeruice, after the which (becauſe hee had eaten nothing all day) hee tooke out of his wallet a little bread, and fiſh dried in the ſun, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him: and willed <hi>Amadis</hi> to eate with him, but he refuſed it, although he had beene three daies without taſting any ſuſtenance. Wherefore the hermit ſaide vnto him: My ſonne you haue promiſed to obey me, doe this then which I command you, and eat, for if you ſhould die in this obſtinacie, your ſoule ſhould be in very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For this cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> durſt not denie him, but did eat a very little, for hee ſighed continually, not being able to forget the great ſorrow wherein he remained. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had taken this ſmall refrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7181:149"/>
the good old man ſpread his cloake abroad and laid him downe thereon, and <hi>Amadis</hi> at his feete, who was a great while before hee could take any reſt, tumbling and toſſing himſelfe as a perſon ill at eaſe, neuertheleſſe in the end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heauie with long watching, he fell aſleepe: and hee dreamed that hee was locked in a chamber ſo darke, that he could ſee no light at all, neyther could he finde any way to come out thereof, wherewith he greatly lamented: moreouer hee thought that his Cozin <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> came vnto him, hauing before them a beame of the Sun, which gaue a great light in ſo darke a place: they taking him by the hand ſaid vnto him, My Lord, come forth from hence, if it pleaſe you, and follow vs into the palace, the which he did. But at his comming forth, he thought that he did ſee <hi>Oriana</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with a great flame of fire, which made him ſo afraid, that hee cried out helpe, helpe, my Lady <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> burneth: and there withall he leaped into the fire to ſaue her. Then he tooke her in his armes, comming through the flame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine without any hurt at all: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hee carried her into a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the greeneſt and pleaſanteſt that he had ſeene. At the lowde cry which <hi>Amadis</hi> did make, the good Hermit awaked, and taking him by the hand, hee asked him, what he ailed? Father, anſwered he, I haue euen now in my ſleepe felt ſuch exceeding paine, that I meruaile I am not dead. Your cry hath witneſſed the ſame, ſaid hee, but let vs riſe, for it is time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Then he got vpon his Aſſe, and tooke the way toward the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, and <hi>Amadis</hi> followed him a foote, talking together of many things, at the laſt he prayed him to giue him one gift, which ſhould not bee hurtfull vnto him, the which the old man granted, I pray you then ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> that ſo long as we are together, you would not tell any man who I am: and hence-forth to giue mee another name, ſuch as it ſhall pleaſe you: then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death you may tell my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of me, that they may come fetch my body, and carry it into <hi>Gaule.</hi> Your life and death, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the hermit, are in the hands of God, therefore ſpeake no more thereof, for therein you offend him very grieuouſly: and therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you know him, loue him, and ſerue him as you are bound to do, he wil ſuccour and helpe you: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what other name wil you haue? Such as it ſhall pleaſe you to giue me, ſaid <hi>Amadis.</hi> And as they talked together, the olde man had his eye continually vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and the more he looked on him, the fayrer he thought him to be: but he did ſee him ſo full of griefe as he determined to giue him a name conformable to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and agreeable to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. Whereupon he ſaid vnto him: my Sonne you are yong and of a faire complexion, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your life is obſcure, by reaſon of your ſorrow, therefore my will is that you bee called the <hi>Faire Forlorne.</hi> Wherewith <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> was contented, liking very well of the Hermet his deuiſe, who not without great occaſion had impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that name vpon him. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as they were ouertaken with the night, they came vnto the Sea ſide, where they found a little boat which the day before was come to ſeeke the Hermet at his hermitage, wherin they imbarked, and within a ſmall time after tooke landing at
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7181:149"/>
the poore Rock, ſo called becauſe of the barrenneſſe of the place, as the old man had declared to him. Who continuing his diſcourſe, ſaid, Sonne I haue heretofore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the world as you haue done, and my name was <hi>Andahod,</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you that during my young yeeres, I ſtudied many vaine ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the end being wearie thereof, I withdrew my ſelfe into this poore place, where I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remained thirty yeeres and more, and neuer departed thence vntill yeeſterday, that I was at the buriall of my ſiſter, who died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few dayes. When the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> came into this Solitary place, he was exceeding glad: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that in a very ſhort time his ſadneſſe and his life would both end at once. Thus he remained in the company of the hermit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming his youth with weeping and continuall lamentations, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at naught all worldly honours, eſpecially the glory which he had gotten in fighting with <hi>Galpan, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> King of <hi>Ireland, Dardan</hi> the proud, and many others whom he had ouercome, and he began to deſpiſe in himſelfe all vanities, conſidering the variableneſſe of Fortune. who not long before had ſo highly aduanced him, that hee had entred into the forbidden Chamber of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Hiſtory hath beene mentioned. But if he had beene demanded what moued him ſo to do, what would hee (thinke you) haue anſwered? no other thing (as I gueſſe) but that the diſpleaſure of a weake woman, had brought him to this extremity: he would haue tried to colour his fault by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the ſtrong and valiant <hi>Hercules, Sampſon,</hi> the wiſe <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Virgill,</hi> and an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other great and vertuous perſonages which haue all faln in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like miſery, being no more able to reſiſt the ſame then he. And <hi>Amadis</hi> would haue thought their misfortunes ſufficient to ſhaddow his miſerie, and yet it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for their example might haue warned him to haue ſhunned the like folly. Was it likely then that Fortune would bring him out of his calamity, he being thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome for ſo ſmall a cauſe, and to beſtow vpon him afterwards more fauours and victories then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhe had done before? me think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſhe ſhould not: neither yet had ſhe done it, if thoſe things by her executed againſt him, had not turned to the profit of the perſons whom ſhe would fauour, whoſe liues depended vpon <hi>Amadis</hi> his ſafety, whom ſhe tormented in ſuch ſort, as it ſeemed ſhe had more compaſſion vpon them, then care of him, as your ſelfe may iudge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Amadis</hi> being as it were brought vnto the period of his life, (when he leaſt hoped of remedie) euen then was he reſtored vnto his former eſtate by ſuch meanes, as ſhal be hereafter recited vnto you. But to the end that we ſtray not too farre from the order of our hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, you muſt firſt vnderſtand that which happened to <hi>Gandalin</hi> after he awaked and found neither <hi>Amadis</hi> nor his horſe: who riſing vp in a fright, miſdoubted that which was happened, and looked in all places thereabout, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he could ſee nothing but Trees and Buſhes. By meanes whereof he began to cry and call, yet no body anſwered him but the Eccho which reſounded thorow the valley: whereby he knew well that <hi>Amadis</hi> was departed. For this cauſe he began to make a moſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7181:150"/>
ſorrowfull lamentations, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to follow him, and to doe what he could to find him againe, which that he might the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh; hee returned where hee had left his horſe, the which hee found, hauing neither ſaddle nor bridle vpon him, which made him almoſt beſide himſelfe. But as hee fretted and ſought from one place to another, in the middeſt of the buſhes hee eſpied the harneſſe of his horſe, which he ſought, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore incontinently he ſadled him, and mounted vpon him, gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping through the forreſt not knowing which way to take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in this frenſie he rode fiue daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without any ſtay at all, but at the ſide of the villages, where he onely taried to enquire after <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> Notwithſtanding, he could heare no newes of him till the ſixt day, that he entred into a meddow wherein was a fountaine, hard by the which <hi>Amadis</hi> had left his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. There he beheld a Pauillion ſet vp, and two Gentlewomen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom hee came, asking them if they had ſeene a knight paſſe by, bearing in his ſhield two Lions <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> in a field <hi>Or.</hi> Wee haue not ſeene the knight which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand after, anſwered they, but we did finde his ſhield and the reſt of his armour vpon the brinke of this fountaine. When <hi>Gandalin</hi> heard this, hee cryed out mainely, and bearing his haire, he ſaid weeping, Ay me, is he dead. Alas what miſ-fortune is hapned, the beſt knight in the world, is he loſt? heerewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all did hee encreaſe his laments ſo ſtrangely, as both the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had great compaſſion vpon his miſerie: Alas my Lord, ſayde hee, how badly haue I kept you: truely I am worthy to bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt wicked eſquire that liueth on the earth, hauing ſo lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſaken you, and you who were wont to be the defence and refuge of all diſtreſſed perſons, haue now nor cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of any liuing wight, no not of me caitife as I am, that through my great fault and ſluggiſhneſſe, haue left you in your greateſt neede, euen when I ought beſt to haue ſerued you. No ſoner had he ſaid theſe words, but that hee fell downe in a ſwound: which when the Gentlewomen behelde, they cryed: Alas this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquire is dead, and therewithall they ran vnto him, but hee moued not in any ſort. Neuertheleſſe, they beſtirred them ſo well, as they brought him againe to himſelfe, &amp; afterwards they ſayd vnto him: my friend, you are to blame thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire for a thing whereof you are yet vncertaine. It were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for you to goe ſeeke your maiſter, ſeeing that the vertuous (as you ought to bee) do encreaſe their ſtrength, euen when aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie moſt aſſaileth them. <hi>Gandalin</hi> knew that they ſayde true, and for the ſame cauſe he determined (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their counſell) to trauaile ſo long from place to place, vntill he had newes of <hi>Amadis.</hi> But I pray you Gentlewomen, anſwered hee, tell me where you haue found his armour? That will wee willingly, ſaid they: Wee were of late in the company of <hi>Don Guillan</hi> the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, who within theſe few dayes paſt, deliuered vs from the priſon of <hi>Gandinas</hi> the malicious, with more then twentie other Ladies and Gentlewomen, behauing him-ſelfe ſo valliantly, that he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the wicked cuſtome of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and conſtrained the Lord thereof to ſweare, neuer more to maintaine the ſame. And becauſe euerie one had liberty to goe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7181:150"/>
they would, my fellow and I haue followed him vnto this place, and wee haue already ſtayed here this foure daies, becauſe that when we came hither firſt, <hi>Guillan</hi> knew the armour of him whom you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after, which were left vpon the ſide of the fountaine. And I promiſe you that neuer knight was more ſorrowful then he for as ſoon as he beheld them, hee alighted from his horſe ſaying. Beleeue me this place is farre vnworthy to hold the ſhield of the beſt Knight in the world. Then did hee take it vp from the ground, and hanged it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Tree. Which done hee mounted againe vpon his horſe, commanding vs expreſſely that we ſhould keepe it vntill hee had found the Knight to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained: And to that end we did ſet vp theſe Pauilions which you ſee. Notwithſtanding after we had kept the ſame three whole dayes, he returned, and arriued but yeſterday very late hauing no news of him at all, and very early this morning he commanded his Eſquires to take the reſt of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which were here found, and he tooke off his owne ſhield, to hang about his necke, the other which we did keepe. In the doing whereof he wept bitterly and ſaid. Truly ſhield thou makeſt a bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of thy Maſter, for me: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he told vs that he went to the Court of king <hi>Liſuart</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoſe ſpoyles vnto Queene <hi>Briſena,</hi> being aſſured that ſhee would be no leſſe ſorrowfull then he, for the ſad miſchance, and wee likewiſe do follow after him, to thanke the Queene for the good which <hi>Guillan</hi> hath done for vs, for her ſake, as he hath commanded vs to do. Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> bid them farewell, aſſuring them, that hee would finde him, vpon whom his death or life depended, or elſe hee would end his daies in the ſeeking of him.</p>

                  <p>Then <hi>Durin</hi> beeing on his knees before her, ſhee ſaid vnto him: <hi>Durin</hi> my friend, by the faith thou oweſt vnto mee, tell mee in what eſtate thou diddeſt finde <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> what was his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance whileſt hee red my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and what thou thinkeſt of the Queene <hi>Briolania?</hi> Madam anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he, by my faith I wil tell you the very truth, although I am ſure

that vnto you and others it will ſeeme in a manner incredible. At my departure from hence (as it pleaſed you to command mee) I went without any ſtay, vnto the Citty of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> where I found the Queene <hi>Briolania,</hi> who (in my opinion) next vnto you, is the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt princeſſe of the world, and of the beſt grace.

And although at that inſtant <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> would haue ſeemed for to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the pleaſure which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of theſe news, yet could ſhe not ſo cunningly do the ſame, but that with extreame ioy her ſudden bluſhing did increaſe her beautie, for the aſſurance ſhee had in the loyaltie of <hi>Amadis.</hi> But <hi>Durin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his diſcourſe, ſaid vnto her Madam, he hath yet done greater things, for after hee had finiſhed this ſo ſtrange aduenture, he heard news that my Lords <hi>Galaor, Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> thinking to winne the forbidden Chamber, were ſo rudely repulſed from the marble Pillar, that their liues were in great perill, by meanes whereof my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> deſirous to reuenge their wrongs, with an inuincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage he paſſed through all the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded places, and maugre all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, hee entred into the Chamber, yet was it not without great danger and trauaile. Thus did he win the Signory of the firm Iſland, and al the inhabitants there-of haue already ſworne vnto him homage, and fealty, according to the cuſtome of the Country, which is one of the faireſt and ſtrongeſt places in the world. And I aſſure you Madame, that it is more then an hundred yeeres ſince any liuing creature hath paſſed the pillars, but onely my Lord <hi>Amadis:</hi> by whoſe force and ſtrength we haue ſeene all the ſingular things and riches of the pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentrous Chamber, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned thorow all the parts of the Earth. During this diſcourſe of his, <hi>Oriana</hi> was almoſt rauiſhed with the great eaſe, and pleaſure that ſhe conceiued in the hope that one day ſhe ſhould bee Lady and owner of ſuch ſinguler things, to her owne and her louers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and ſaid vnto <hi>Durin.</hi> Truly <hi>Durin</hi> fortune hath beene very fauourable vnto him. Ah Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame anſwered he, nay rather too rigorous, ſo as I would to God ſome other had carried him that vnhappy Letter which you writ, &amp; I deliuered: how ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> I pray thee tell me, what countenance he ſhewed in reading it? Madame I wil tel you ſince it pleaſeth you, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, although I am ſure that you will bee very ſort when you ſhal vnderſtand what conſequence it turned vnto, and the miſchiefe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7181:151"/>
it brought vnto the beſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt knight in the world. In what ſort, ſaid ſhe. You are the cauſe of his death, anſwered <hi>Durin.</hi> Out Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> what is it thou tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt mee? You haue forged the ſword that hath wounded him to death, and I carried it to him, ſo as we are both his murtherers. Then declared hee the whole circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and manner how he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the letter, and the deſpaire hee entred into after he had read it: ſo as, ſaid <hi>Durin,</hi> he did ſhortly after that, ſecretly departe from the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> with <hi>Gandalin, Iſania</hi> the Gouernour of the Iſle, and me, and we brought him vnto an hermitage, where hee charged vs ſteightly to follow him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then hee mounted on horſe-back, and taking with him neither Helmet, Shield, nor Lance, he fled ouer a mountaine like vnto a mad man. Afterward hee reherſed vnto her all the talke which particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had vſed vnto them, in taking his leaue of them, and <hi>Durin</hi> made this diſcourſe with ſo many teares, as it was very hard to iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee or <hi>Oriana</hi> had the more ſorrowfull heart. And know you Madame, ſaide hee, that after his departure (notwithſtanding his command to the contrary) <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> and I followed him, and found him aſleepe by the ſide of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, yet his ſleepe was not long: for ſuddainly hee awaked, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe vp, he began to make the greateſt lamentation in the world, bewaling King <hi>Perion</hi> his father, then <hi>Mabila,</hi> and others his friends. All this while <hi>Gandalin</hi> and I had our ſelues for feare of his furie, by meanes whereof without any impeachment of vs, he paſſed the moſt part of the night in the like lamentations, vntill about the breake of day, that there chaunced a knight to come ſinging a ſong, which he had made for the loue of you, the which <hi>Durin</hi> recited vnto her, as alſo that which happened vnto <hi>Patin,</hi> which ſo ouer-char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the heart of <hi>Oriana,</hi> that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in a ſwound, looking like one that were dead. The which <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> fearing, he called the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila,</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> vnto whom he ſaide. Goe helpe my Lady, who is in a greate perplexitie for a thing which is now too late to be remedied: and if ſhee hath miſ-done, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of due vnto her. Herewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he departed, leauing the women much amazed, for they knew not the cauſe of this inconuenience, much leſſe how they might reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the ſame: neuertheleſſe, they vſed her in ſuch ſort, that ſhee came againe vnto her ſelfe, and caſting forth a ſigh, ſhe ſaide with a feeble and low voice: Ah wicked woman that I am, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſo great wrong I haue depriued him of life, whom in this world I moſt loued. And ſeeing it is out of my power now to reuoke that miſchiefe, whereof I am the repentant cauſer, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you (friend) to take my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſatisfaction of the hurt which I haue purchaſed vnto you, with the ſacrifice which I ſhall make of mine owne life to follow you vnto the death: ſo the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which I haue committed againſt your loyaltie, ſhall bee manifeſted, your ſelfe reuenged, and I puniſhed. And as ſhee thought to haue proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her ſpeech failed her againe, wherewith <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Gentle-woman were more abaſhed then before, ſo that they called <hi>Durin</hi> to know what heauie newes hee had brought vnto <hi>Oriana,</hi> who wholly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7181:152"/>
declared it vnto them. Let me alone the ſaid <hi>Mabila,</hi> for I know wel how to remedy this matter. Hereupon they vnlaced her, and beſtirreth them ſo well, that ſhe brought her to life againe: then <hi>Mabila</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of her how ſhe did. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle friend (anſwered ſhe) farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I deſire: So as I rather deſire death then life, for now I do nought elſe but languiſh. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Madame, ſaid <hi>Mabila:</hi> do you thinke my Coſin ſo inconſtant, that hee will not willingly excuſe the iniurie that you haue done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, knowing that extreame loue rather then any other thing conſtrained you thereunto? And if he be gone, as <hi>Durin</hi> hath tolde you, it is but to paſſe away part of his melancholy, tarrying vntill his innocency bee knowne vnto you: But I am certaine, if it pleaſed you to call him back againe, that he is as ready to obey you as euer he was And behold what you ſhall doe: intreate him by a Letter, that hee take no regard vnto that which you did command him by <hi>Durin,</hi> and that which you did, was ſuddenly after a falſe report made vnto you of him: and therefore will him to come vnto you to <hi>Mireflure,</hi> where you ſtay for him to amend your fault at his diſcretion. Ah my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> do you think that he will euer vouchſafe, either to reſpect me, or make one ſteppe for me? But do you thinke, ſaide <hi>Mabila,</hi> that the loue he beareth to you, is of ſo little force, that he will not bee farre more glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer your good fauour, then he hath beene ſorry to be by you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken? I am verily aſſured, that to die he will not diſpleaſe you. And to accompliſh this matter well, it behoueth the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> to vndertake the charge to finde him out, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her, and putteth his truſt in her. Well, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be aduiſed by you. So ſhee tooke paper and inke, and as they had determined ſhe did write vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> afterwards the Letter was giuen to the Damoſel of <hi>Denmark,</hi> with expreſſe commandement to paſſe firſt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> thinking that he might be there with <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other place. And the better to colour their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, they aduiſed the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to tell the Queene, that <hi>Mabila</hi> ſent her towards the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> her Mother, to vnderſtand ſome news from her: With the which the Queen was well pleaſed, and gaue her a Letter and tokens to preſent vnto her. Thus was the Gentlewoman diſpatched, who departed with <hi>Durin</hi> her brother, and <hi>Enil</hi> the Coſin of <hi>Gandales.</hi> And ſo long they rode till they came vnto a port towne called <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill,</hi> which ſeparateth great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> from the Realme of <hi>Scotland.</hi> There they tooke ſhipping, and they had the winde ſo faire, that the ſixt day following they landed in the Citty of <hi>Poligez.</hi> Then tooke they their way toward the Knight <hi>Gandales,</hi> whom they met a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: but when he beheld the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> (knowing that ſhe was a ſtranger) he ſtayed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of her what ſhe did ſeek in that Countrey. Your ſelfe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe, towards whom, two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes your friends haue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to come, to preſent from them certain preſents, which I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto the Queene of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid he, may it pleaſe you to tell me their names: yea wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſir ſaid ſhe, the one is my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Oriana</hi> daughter to the mighty king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> &amp; the other the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7181:152"/>
                     <hi>Mabila</hi> whom you know well enough. Ha ſaid <hi>Gandales,</hi> you are moſt luckily here arriued: and they haue reaſon to accompt me their moſt humble ſeruant, for ſo I am, &amp; I pray you moſt heartily to come and alight at my houſe, then to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow we will go together to ſee the Queene: in the meane while doe mee this pleaſure, as to tell me how <hi>Amadis</hi> doth. The Gentle-woman was herewith much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſeeing that ſhe had miſſed of her purpoſe: notwithſtanding diſſembling her ſorrow, ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Gandales:</hi> that he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Court ſince he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence to reuenge <hi>Briolania:</hi> and it is thought that he is come into theſe parts with his coſin <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> to ſee the Scottiſh Queene his Aunt, and you alſo: for this cauſe the Queene and other Ladies of his kindred and deere friends, gaue me in charge to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him a Letter, which will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry welcome vnto him I am ſure. And the Gentlewoman ſaid thus much, becauſe ſhe knew certainly, that although <hi>Amadis</hi> would hide him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (knowing that ſhe brought him news from <hi>Oriana)</hi> others, yet hee would change his minde to ſpeake with her. I would ſaid <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> that he were here, for I haue a long time greatly deſired to ſee him. Thus talking together at the laſt they arriued at the Caſtle of <hi>Gandales,</hi> where hee feaſted the Gentlewoman three dayes: and the fourth day following, hee condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted her vnto the Court, where ſhe deliuered to the Scottiſh Queene the Letters and preſents which the Queene <hi>Briſena</hi> had ſent vnto her.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that <hi>Don Guillan</hi> the Penſif was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine where he found <hi>Amadis</hi> his Armour, he rode ſix daies before he ariued in the Court of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> And he ordinarily carried the ſhield of <hi>Amadis</hi> about his necke, and neuer tooke it off, except when hee was conſtrained to fight: then he tooke his owne, fearing to deface the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And as he rode he met with two knights, Coſins to <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> who incontinently knew the ſhield of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and they thought <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> to be he. Wherefore they (who hated him to the death) determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to aſſaile him, and ſaid one to another: euen now will we carrie the head of this villaine vnto our vncle <hi>Arcalaus.</hi> This they ſpake ſo lowd that <hi>Guillan</hi> heard it, where-with being throughly chafed he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them. Palliards you reckon without your hoſt, for neuer did traitor affright me, no more ſhall you, ſeeing I know you for kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> and as wicked as himſelf: then pulled he downe the viſor of his Helmet, couched his launce and ran vpon them. Now they were yong and ſtrong, ſo that they defended themſelues ſtoutly: notwithſtanding at the laſt they could not long reſiſt him that had
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7181:153"/>
charged them. Who after hee had ſome ſmal time fought with them, thruſt his ſword in the throat of the eldeſt, and the other fled vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top of the mountaine, who was not long purſued by <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> becauſe hee was a little woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whereupon he let him go and followed on his way, along the which he rode ſo far, vntill he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at a Caſtle, belonging vnto a knight of his acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, where hee lodged for that night, beeing then very late. But the next day (as hee would haue departed from his lodging) his hoſt ſeeing him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Launce gaue him one, from thence hee rode ſo long, that hee came neere a riuer named <hi>Guinon,</hi> ouer the which there was a bridge no broder then for two horſes to paſſe ouer afront. And approching more neere thereunto, he beheld a knight entering vpon the ſame, whoſe ſhield was vert, a bent <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi> This he knew to bee his coſin <hi>Ladaſin;</hi> and on the other ſide hee ſaw another knight ready to fight, who forbad <hi>Ladaſin</hi> from paſſing ouer, except hee would breake a Lance with him, but <hi>Ladaſin</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that he would not ſtay for ſo ſmall a thing, and herewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all couering him with his ſhield, he ſet ſpurres vnto his horſe. As much did hee that kept the paſſage, who was mounted vpon a great bay courſer, and did beare in his ſhield <hi>Argent</hi> a Lion <hi>Sables,</hi> and his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met all blacke. Their encounter was ſo ſtrong, that <hi>Ladaſin</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, where without doubt he had beene drowned (as well for the weight of his armour, as alſo for the high of the place from whence he fell) if he had not taken holde of certaine willowes, by meanes whereof hee got vnto the banck ſide. In the meane ſeaſon he that had ouer-throwne him retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned faire and ſoftly from whence he was departed. Then <hi>Guillan</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his coſin in ſuch danger, ranne ſpeedily to helpe him, and cauſed him to be pulled vp by his ſquires, and afterwards he ſaide vnto him: truſt me coſin without the helpe of theſe boughes you had beene in great danger, and therefore all ſtrange knights ſhould feare to iuſt vpon ſuch bridges: for thoſe which do keepe ſuch paſſages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue their horſes no ſmall time experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the purpoſe, with whome (more then by their owne prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe) they gaine the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ouer a number of better knights then themſelues are. And as for me, I would rather turne out of the way a dayes iourney, then put my ſelfe in ſuch hazard, were it not to reuenge you if I can. Now the horſe of <hi>Ladaſin</hi> had not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his maiſter, but was paſſed ouer to the other ſide of the riuer, and the knight of the bridge his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquires were there ready to take him, who caried him into a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſtrong tower, ſeated in the middeſt of the water. Wherefore <hi>Guillan</hi> tooke his ſhield, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his Lance, he called vnto the knight of the bridge, that he ſhould take heede of him, who ran againſt him, and they met together with a moſt ſtrong encounter: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it fell out ſo well for <hi>Guillan,</hi> that he ouerthrew his enemy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his horſe into the riuer, and himſelfe had ſped little better, for he was vnhorſed as well as the other, if in falling his horſe had not ſlipped by the one ſide of him, and he taken hold of certaine ſtakes, by the which he got vpon the bridge again, from whence he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the knight in the riuer, who hauing cought hold by the taile of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7181:153"/>
the horſe of <hi>Guillan,</hi> was brought to ſhoare on the one ſide, and his horſe came to the other ſide, where the Squires of <hi>Ladaſin</hi> were ready to take hold of him. Thus againſt their willes the two knights made exchange of their horſes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Guillan</hi> ſent vnto the knight to tel him, that if he would reſtore his horſe and his fellowes, that they would ſend ouer his which their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquires had taken, and then they would depart. What anſwered the knight vnto him that brought the meſſage, thinke they to eſcape ſo lightly from my hands? yea truely ſaid the other, for they haue done as much as the cuſtome of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage requireth. Not yet anſwered the knight, becauſe wee were both ouerthrowne: and therefore they muſt win the bridge by the ſword, if they will paſſe ouer. Will you then ſaid the other, compell them to fight? I thinke you ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this iniurie which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready you haue done vnto them, ſeeing that all bridges ought to be free for euery paſſenger. I care not anſwered the knight, go tell them, they muſt feele (will they nil they) how my ſword cutteth: then hee leaped vpon his horſe moſt lightly without any helpe of his ſtirrop, afterwards comming neere vnto <hi>Guilla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> he ſaid vnto him very fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and boldly: knight your embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour hath beene ouer tedious in deliuering his meſſage, but before you eſcape me, you muſt of force tell me, whether you be any of the ſubiects to a king called <hi>Liſuart,</hi> or any of his houſhould. Wherefore? anſwered <hi>Guillan,</hi> I would it were my luck, ſaid the other, to haue him no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When <hi>Guillan</hi> heard him ſay ſo, none could be more angry then he was, &amp; therefore anſwered him: in good faith knight, if king <hi>Liſuart</hi> my Lord were in my roome, I am very ſure, that he would eaſily make thee acknowledge this thy great preſumption: but ſince he is abſent, and that I know the hurt that thou wouldſt doe vnto him, I haue a greater deſire to fight againſt thee, then euer I had againſt any other knight. And if I can (being his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and a knight of his houſe) I will chaſtiſe thee in ſuch ſort, that ſo good a Prince ſhall be hence-forth free from all thy malice. I doe not beleeue that ſaid the other: for before it be noone, I will make thee glad to carry a meſſage vnto him notwithſtanding before thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueſt thy deſert, my will is, thou ſhalt know both who I am, and what preſents I will ſend vnto him by thee, <hi>Guillan</hi> was very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the knights words, &amp; hardly would he haue deferred the combat ſo long, had it not beene that hee promiſed to tell him his name, wherefore he ſtayed a while to heare what he would ſay. Know thou then ſaid the Knight, that I am <hi>Gandalod</hi> ſonne to <hi>Barſinan,</hi> late Lord of <hi>Sanſuega,</hi> whom King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> moſt treacherouſly did put to death in the Citty of <hi>London.</hi> The preſents which I will ſend vnto him by thee, ſhall be the heads of foure knights of his Court whom I keep piſoners (and one of them is <hi>Gion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> his nephew) together with thy right hand alſo, which I will hang about thy necke, after I haue ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it from thy arme. Vild traitor anſwered <hi>Guillan,</hi> if thou canſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that thou braggeſt of, it were a great deale, but I beleeue thou ſhalt proue thy ſelfe a lier, and ſo ſaying h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7181:154"/>
withoot any breathing, they laid at each other ſo fiercely, that <hi>Ladaſin</hi> and his eſquires who were preſent, did not thinke that any of them could eſcape the death. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they behaued themſelues ſo valiantly, that one could not iudge who had the beſt: for they were expert knights, hardy, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in armes, ſo that knowing how to defend themſelues, few blowes could hurt them to the quicke. Now when their battaile was at the hotteſt, they heard the winding of a horne from the top of the tower, wherewithall <hi>Guillan</hi> was abaſhed. thinking it to be ſome new ſupply come to his enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, <hi>Gandalod</hi> ſuſpected it to bee ſome reuolt of the captiues which he had in his priſons. And therefore either of them did their beſt to vanquiſh his enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the ſuccours ſhould come: ſo that ſuddainnly <hi>Gandalod</hi> ruſhed vpon <hi>Guillan</hi> thinking to vnhorſe him, but <hi>Guillan</hi> embraced him ſo hard, that they both fell to the ground tumbling one ouer another, yet holding their ſwords faſt in their hands, but it happened ſo well for <hi>Guillan,</hi> that he had his enemy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. By meanes whereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other could riſe, hee gaue him fiue or ſix great blowes with his ſword, which in ſuch ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed him, that from thenceforth he waxed more feeble. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, getting vp vpon his feet, hee both well defended himſelfe, and better aſſailed his aduerſary, giuing ſufficient knowledge of the little good will he wiſhed vnto his enemy: who ſo ſorely oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon him, that hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to recoile and turne his back. Therefore <hi>Guillan</hi> marking where he was worſt armed, did hit him ſuch a blow with his ſword vpon the arme, that hee quite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it from his ſhoulder. So as with the extreame griefe thereof he caſt forth a loude crie, flying towards the tower: but <hi>Guillan</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertooke him, and laide ſo faſt holde vpon his helmet, that hee pulled it from his head. Then ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ſword to his throat, hee ſaide vnto him. Beleeue mee Sir, you ſhall now goe to the king to preſent him with other heads then you determined, but if you will not obey me, your owne ſhall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie me. Alas, anſwered <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lod,</hi> I had rather yeelde my ſelfe to the mercy of the King, then to die preſently. Whereupon after hee had giuen his faith vnto <hi>Guillan,</hi> they mounted on horſeback, and <hi>Ladaſin</hi> with them. At that inſtant, they heard a great tumult within the tower, and beheld one of the warders running away, whome they ſtaied to know what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was: who told them that the priſoners had found the meanes to vnbinde themſelues, and to come forth of the dungeon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were kept, afterwards how they were armed, and had already ſlaine the moſt part of his fellowes. Hee had no ſooner ended his ſpeech, when hee behelde ſome of thoſe, which he ſpake of, ouer the gate of the tower, and three or foure others which purſued a knight, and ſeuen halberders, that fled towards a wood hard by, and when thoſe which had gained their liberty, perceiued <hi>Guillan</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſin,</hi> they cryed vnto them that they ſhould kill thoſe tratours that had ſcaped fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Guillan</hi> &amp; his coſin ran before and ſlew foure of them: the reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with their lightnes, excepting onely the knight who was taken. Then came the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7181:154"/>
to ſalute <hi>Guillan,</hi> whom they all knew, &amp; after ſome talke which they had together, <hi>Guillan</hi> ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: my Lords, I cannot tarry long with you, for I am conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to goe forthwith to King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> but my coſin <hi>Ladaſin</hi> ſhal bear you company vntill you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed you, and afterwards I pray you to come vnto the Court, &amp; to bring with you theſe two knights, whom I deliuer into your keeping, vntill king <hi>Liſuart</hi> haue taken ſuch order for them, as to his Maieſtie ſhall ſeeme beſt: and let one of you remaine here for the guard of this place, vntil I haue otherwiſe proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it. The which they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to performe, thus taking leaue of them hee tooke his ſhield from his neck, and gaue it vnto his eſquires, and taking the ſhield of <hi>Amadis</hi> (as he was accuſtomed) the teares ſtood in his eyes. Where-withal the others being much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, demanded of him, what moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him thus to take his ſhield fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his neck, and place another in ſteed thereof with ſo great ſorrow. Ah, anſwered he, this ſhield belongeth to the beſt knight in the world, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he reherſed vnto them the manner how hee had found it, with the reſt of the armor of <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom he had ſince ſearched for through all the countrey, without hearing any newes of him: wherewithall euery one of them were very ſorry, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt ſome great miſ-fortune had happened him. Thus <hi>Guillan</hi> followed on his way, and rode ſo long that (without any further trouble) hee ariued in the Court of king <hi>Liſuart:</hi> where it was already known how <hi>Amadis</hi> had ended the aduentures of the Firme-Iſland, &amp; gained the ſignorie thereof: in like ſorte how hee was departed from thence ſecretly, in great anguiſh. Neuertheleſſe they knew nothing of the cauſe thereof, except thoſe whom I before haue tolde you of. Thus <hi>Guillan</hi> entred into the hall, hauing about his neck the ſhield of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who was preſently known of all the aſſembly, wherefore they flocked about him to heare what he would ſay, but the king was for-moſt, who demanded what newes hee had of <hi>Amadis.</hi> It may pleaſe your maieſtie, anſwered <hi>Guillan,</hi> I knowe none: neuertheleſſe, if it pleaſe you I will before the Queen recite how I did finde his armour, ſword, and his ſhield which heere you may ſee. Truely ſaid the king, I am very well pleaſed, for ſince hee was her knight, it is reaſon that ſhe firſt know what is become of him. Saying ſo hee tooke <hi>Guillan</hi> by the hand, &amp; led him where the Queen was. Then <hi>Guillan</hi> kneeling down, ſaid vnto her weeping. Madame, not many daies ſince I found al the armour of <hi>Amadis,</hi> with his ſhield left all alone hard by a fountaine, which is called the fountain of the plaine fielde: wherewithall I was ſo ſorrowful, that euen at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant I faſtned the ſhield vpon a tree, leauing in it the keeping of two Gentlewomen, that were in my company, vntil that I had gone through the countrey, to enquire where hee was become. But I was neither ſo fortunate to finde him, nor ſo happy to heare any newes of him, wherefore knowing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of ſo good a knight, who had neuer any deſire, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelfe to doe you ſeruice, I determined ſeeing I could not bring him to you, to bring you his armes, as witneſſe of the duty which I doe owe both to your Maieſtie, and alſo to him: the which you may command (if you pleaſe) to bee ſet in an open
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7181:155"/>
place, where euery one may ſee them, as well to heare news of him, by ſuch ſtrangers as ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire vnto his Court, as alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all ſuch as follow armes, to take example by him that was owner of them: who by his high knight-hood, hath gained the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt reputation amongſt all thoſe that euer buckled cuiraſſe on their backs. When the Queene vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſuch news of <hi>Amadis,</hi> neuer was any Lady more ſorrowful, and anſwered <hi>Guillan:</hi> It is great pitty for the loſſe of ſo good a Knight: for I am ſure that many at this day do liue, which will be ſorry for his loſſe: and I giue you moſt hearty thankes for that which you haue done for him and me together: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring you, that thoſe which will put themſelus forward to find him ſhall giue me and all other Ladies cauſe to wiſh them wel for his ſake, which was ſo much at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. But if the Queene for theſe newes was any whit ſorry, the king and thoſe of his company were no leſſe ſad: yet was it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the griefe which <hi>Oriana</hi> ſuſtained. For if before ſhe was vexed for the great fault which ſhe had committed, at that inſtant her paine redoubled with ſo great a melancholy, that it was impoſſible for her to ſtay there any longer, but ſhe withdrew her ſelfe into her chamber. And caſting her downe vpon her bed ſhe began to cry: Ah wicked woman that I am, I may now well ſay, that all the felicity that euer I had is but a plaine dreame, and my torment is a very certaine truth, ſeeing that if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any contentment, It is onely by the dreames which do nightly ſolicit me, for when I awake all froward Fortune afflicteth my poore ſpirit, ſo as if the day be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me a grieuous martyrdome, the darkeneſſe only bringeth me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and comfort, becauſe in my ſleepe I thinke that I am before my ſweete friend, but being awake and quite depriued of that great ioy, maketh me too much to feele his abſence. Ah my eyes, no more eies but floods of teares, you are much abuſed, ſeeing that being ſhut you onely behold him that contenteth you: and no ſooner opened, but all the torment in the world commeth at once to blinde them: at the leaſt this death which I feele ſo neere at hand ſhall deliuer me from this care: and you ſweete friend ſhall be reuenged of the moſt ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full woman that euer was borne. Then like a furious woman ſhee roſe vp, determining to throw her ſelfe headlong from the window downe to the ground: but <hi>Mabila</hi> who had followed her preuenting ſuch an inconuenience ſtayed her, ſetting before her the infamy which ſhe might get, if it were but known that ſhe were ſo minded: and more-ouer ſhe did aſſure her that <hi>Amadis</hi> would ſhortly returne, ſaying vnto her: How now Madam? where is the conſtancy of a Kings daughter, and that wiſedome for which you are ſo much renowned? Haue you already forgotten the miſchiefe that was likely to haue happened vnto you, by meanes of the falſe newes that <hi>Arcalaus</hi> brought vnto the Court this laſt yeare? And now becauſe <hi>Guillan</hi> hath found my Coſins armes, is it therefore likely that he ſhould be dead? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, you ſhall ſee him againe ſhortly, &amp; he wil come vnto you ſo ſoone as hee hath ſeene your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>This Counſell was authoriſed with ſuch perſwaſine reaſons, that <hi>Oriana</hi> apeaſed part of her torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7181:155"/>
But yet theſe newes ſo greately troubled her minde, that had it not beene for the wiſedome of <hi>Mabila</hi> (who often times perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her to be quiet) there had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a merueilous inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nenience: but in the end ſhee knew ſo well how to preuaile with her, that ſhe reſolued vpon this, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of <hi>Denmark</hi> would bring him againe. And as they were in theſe tearmes, one came to tell them that the knights and Gentle-women which <hi>Guillan</hi> had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from priſon were arriued, wherefore <hi>Mabila</hi> ſeeking to with-draw <hi>Oriana</hi> from fancies, brought her where the Queene was, vnto whom the two Gentlewomen (that had kept the ſhield of <hi>Amadis)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the lamentation which they had ſeene an Eſquire make, when he knew the Armour and Shielde that <hi>Guillan</hi> had found vpon the ſide of the Fountaine of the plaine field. The King was likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in whoſe eyes ſtood a floud of Teares, thinking aſſuredly that <hi>Amadis</hi> was dead. Then <hi>Ladaſin</hi> and his fellows were ſeene to come in, who brought with them <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalod</hi> priſoner, together with the other knight, whom they preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the king on the behalfe of <hi>Guillan,</hi> declaring vnto him both the manner of the Combat, the talke that paſſed betweene <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lod</hi> and <hi>Guillan,</hi> and alſo how that during their incounter, the knights that were in the deepe dungeon of his tower had found the meanes to deliuer themſelues. Is this true ſaid he to <hi>Gandalod,</hi> I cauſed not long ſince thy father to be burned in this citty, for his great treaſon, and thou ſhalt likewiſe be there hanged with thy companion, becauſe thou hadſt conſpired my death. Then forthwith he commanded them to bee hanged ouer the Citty wales right ouer againſt the place where <hi>Barſinan</hi> was burned as it hath been recited vnto you.</p>

True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father anſwered he, I will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly tell it you, and I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech you likewiſe to let mee vnderſtand, be it for good, or bad, what you thinke thereof.

The darke chamber in the which you thought your ſelfe to be, out of which you were not able to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forth,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7181:156"/>
ſignifieth this great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein you now are. The Gentlewomen which afterwardes opened the doore vnto you, are ſome of your friends that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſolicit your cauſe vnto the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whom you ſo feruently loue, with whom they haue ſo much preuailed, that they ſhall withdraw you from this place. The Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beame which went before them, are Letters of reconciliation that ſhe ſendeth vnto you: by meanes whereof you ſhall leaue me. The fire that inuironed this lady, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the great loue, together with the ſad laments that ſhe maketh for your abſence, as well as you doe for hers. And by the faire garden whereunto you did beare her, drawing her forth of the flame, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the great pleaſure which you ſhall both haue at your mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Truely my Son, I know that ſeeing the habit and eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I am called, ſuch ſpeeches as theſe become me not at all: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe knowing that it is for your good, I am ſure that I doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in this counſelling a perſon ſo comfortleſſe as you are. Here-with all the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> fell vpon the ground to kiſſe his feete, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that he had happened into the company of a perſon ſo holy, that knew how to comfort him ſo well in his aduerſity, deſiring very hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, that whatſoeuer the holy man had told him, might ſo come to paſſe, and he ſaid vnto the Hermit, my Father ſeeing it hath pleaſed you to do me ſo much good, as to expound this dreame, I pray you likewiſe to tell me the meaning of one other, which I dreamed the night before I came from the firm-Iſland.</p>
                  <p>Then did hee recite it word by word vnto him. Whereupon the aged man anſwered him. My ſon, by this you may plainely ſee that which already is happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, for I aſſure you that the place ouer ſhaddowed with trees, where you thought that you were, &amp; the great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of people which at the firſt made ſuch great ioy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you ſignifieth the firm Iſland which you haue conquered, to the great pleaſure of al the inhabitants thereof. But the man which came vnto you with a boxe full of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is the meſſenger of the Lady that gaue you the letter: and your ſelfe doth know better then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether he brought you bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe or no, by the diſcourſe which he had with you. The ſorrow which afterwards you did behold in the perſons which before were ſo ioyfull, are they of the Iſle, who at this preſent are very heauy for your abſence. The apparell which you threw off, are the teares which you haue ſhed. The ſtony place wherin you entred inuironed with water, this rock witneſſeth to you what it is. The religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that did ſpeake vnto you in an vnknown la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is my ſelfe, who do inſtruct you in holy writ, which you neither vnderſtand, nor can comprehend. Father anſwered the <hi>Fair-Forlorn.</hi> I know verily that you ſay the truth which giueth me great hope of that which you haue declared of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but the continuall griefe and melancholie wherein I liue, hath already ouer-maſtered mee, that I beleeue if the good which you promiſe vnto me do not the ſooner caſe my care, death will firſt ſeize vpon my ſorrowfull corps.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the Hermit knew how to perſwade him ſo wel, that from thenceforth he ſhewed a little merrier countenance then before he had done, and began to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7181:156"/>
turne his ſorrow to ſome ſolace, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to angle for fiſh with two Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phwes of the olde man, that kept him company. Neuertheleſſe, the moſt part of the time he with-drew himſelfe into a ſecret place hard by the ſea ſide, which was ouer-ſhadowed with diuerſe ſorts of trees: and there oftentimes he caſt his ſight vnto the Firme-Iſland, which put him in remembrance of thoſe fauours whereunto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had called him, &amp; the wrong that <hi>Oriana</hi> did vnto him, hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neuer offended. Alas, ſaide he, haue I deſerued this entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be baniſhed, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing offended ſo much as in thought? Truely deere friend, if my death were agrieable vnto you, you haue meane enough to giue it me more ſpeedily, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mee thus to liue in langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing. The onely deniall of your good grace, the very firſt day that you accepted me for your knight, had beene ſufficient at that time to haue made me die a thouſand deathes. Many other lamentations did the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> euery day make, in this ſolitary place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he tooke ſo great pleaſure, that oftentimes hee there paſſed away both the day and the night: ſo as one time finding himſelfe more frollick in his minde, then of a long time he had beene, hee made this ſong following.</p>

                  <p>Thus the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> paſſed away the time, waiting vntill fate or better fortune ſhould bring him forth of this miſerie. But it happened that one night lying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the trees (as hee was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) about the breake of day hee heard very nigh him the ſound of a moſt ſweete inſtrument, wherein he tooke ſo great pleaſure, that he gaue attentiue eare thereunto a good while, amazed notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from whence it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede. Knowing the place to bee ſolitary that no other there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but the hermit, his two Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, and himſelfe: wherefore he roſe vp, without making any noyſe at all, and approched more neere to ſee what it might be. Then he beheld two young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſitting by a fountaine, who (tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their voyſes to the ſound of a lute) did ſing a moſt pleaſant ſong: neuertheleſſe fearing to trouble their mirth, hee ſtood ſtill a great while without being by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Afterwards he came forth and diſcloſed himſelfe, ſaying vnto them: Truely Gentlewomen your muſicke hath made me this day to looſe Matins, for the which I am very ſorry. When theſe women heard him ſpeake (hauing not ſeen him at all vntill that time) they were much afraide. Norwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, one of them more bold then her fellow, anſwered him: My friend, we did not thinke to offend you with this our mirth, but ſeeing we haue ſo luckily found you, tell vs (if it pleaſe you) who you are, and how this deſert place is called. In truth faire Gentlewomen, ſaide the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> this place is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the poore Rock: wherein there liueth an Hermit, vpon the top thereof in his little hermitage. As for me, I am a poore man that keep him company, doing great and hard penance for the ſin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe which I haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Gentle friend, anſwered they,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7181:157"/>
may we finde in this place (for two or three dayes onely) any houſe wherein we may place at eaſe a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy both rich &amp; mighty, ſo tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with loue, that ſhe is euen at deaths dore therewith. Truſt me ſaid he, there is no other lodging in this Rock, but the little cabinet wherein the Hermit doth lie, and one other that I do ſleepe in ſome-time: but if the Hermit will lend you mine, I am content (to do you a pleaſure) to lie in the meane time abroad in the fields, as I common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe to do. The Gentlewoman gaue him hearty thankes, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him good morrow they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted towards a Pauilion: within the which the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> beheld a moſt beautifull Lady vpon a bed. Wherupon he knew that the ſame was ſhee of whom they told him. But looking farder off, he did ſee foure armed men walking by the Sea ſide, who ſcouted abroad, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt fiue others did take their reſt, and he alſo perceiued a ſhippe at Anchor well appointed. The Sun was already vp, when he heard the Hermitage bell to ring, which made him go vp thither. Where he found the Hermit making him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to goe to ſeruice: vnto whom he tolde that there were people newly arriued in the Rock, and that if it were his pleaſure, hee would willingly goe call them to heare Mattins. Goe then anſwered the Hermit, and I will ſtay for them. And as he went downe the Rocke, he met the Lady, whom the knights carried toward the hermitage: wherefore he returned, to helpe to make ready the Hermit, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lady was come, began ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Then the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> being amongſt the women, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the time when he was in the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and of the pleaſure hee was wont o haue with the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> there-withall he began to weepe ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, that the Gentlewomen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, and did very much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereat. Notwithſtanding they thought that it was for the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſinnes, and ſeeing him young, fayre, and comely, they could not thinke what to preſume thereof. When the Hermit had made an end of ſeruice, they came to ſalute him, praying him for Gods ſake, to lend them ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle chamber for their Lady (who was wearie of the Sea, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely ſicke) wherein ſhe might take her reſt, for a day or twaine. In truth faire Ladies, anſwered he, there are here no more then two ſmall Cabinets, in one of them I remaine (and if I can ſo long as I liue, neuer woman ſhall come ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) and the other is for this poore man, which doth ſuch great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, wherein ſometimes he ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, and I would be very ſory that he ſhould bee put out thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will. Father ſaid the <hi>Fare Forlorne,</hi> do not let for me to doe them a pleaſure, for I am very well content for this time to haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lodging then vnder the Trees. Well ſaid the hermit, let it be ſo a Gods name. Then the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> conducted them vnto his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, where the Gentlewomen ſet vp a rich bed for their Miſtreſſe, who was forthwith carried thither. And becauſe it was told the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> that her ſickneſſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of extreame loue, he tooke more heede to her behauiour then to any of the reſt: and he perceiued that her eyes were ſtill full of Teares, and her ſighs were at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: Wherefore hee drew the two Gentlewomen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, whom in the morning hee
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7181:157"/>
had found playing on the Lute, &amp; earneſtly entreated them to tell the occaſion of the great ſickneſſe that their Miſtreſſe ſuſtained. Friend an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered they, if you marke her well you ſhall find that ſhe is very faire, although that now her diſeaſe hath abated a great part of her beauty: for ſhee hath neither comfort nor ioy by reaſon of the abſence of a knight that ſhee goeth to ſeeke in the houſe of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> whom ſhe ſo feruently loueth, that if ſhort time doe not graunt ſome eaſe to her paſſion, it is impoſſible that her life ſhould continue long. When the <hi>Faire Forlorn</hi> heard king <hi>Liſuart</hi> named, hee could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from teares, and hee had a greater de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Alas my faire gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman ſayd hee, for Gods ſake name him vnto me, and the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom you ſo much extoll. Truely anſwered they, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, vpon this condition, that firſt when wee haue done, you doe tell vs whether you bee a knight or not, and afterward your name. I am content therewith, ſayde the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> ſo great is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to knowe that which I demand of you. Then one of them ſayd vnto him: the knight which this Lady loueth, is called <hi>Don Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> brother to the good Knight <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and to <hi>Don Galaor,</hi> and hee is the ſonne of King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and of the Counteſſe of <hi>Salandria.</hi> You ſay true anſwered hee, and I verily beleeue that you cannot ſay ſo much good of him as hee deſerueth. What? ſayde the Gentlewomen, doe you know him then? It is not long ſayd he, ſince I did ſee him in the houſe of Queen <hi>Briolania,</hi> for whom his brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and his Coſen <hi>Agraies</hi> did fight againſt <hi>Abiſeas</hi> and his two ſonnes, and thither hee with his brother <hi>Galaor</hi> arriued ſome fewe dayes after the combate: and I thinke him to be one of the faireſt knights in the worlde. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his proweſſe, I haue many times heard <hi>Don Galaor</hi> himſelfe ſpeake thereof, who fought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with him as hee ſayde. This combate ſayde ſhee, was the cauſe that hee left my Lady in the ſelfe ſame place, where they firſt knew one another. I thinke then anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> that ſhee is called <hi>Coriſanda.</hi> You ſay true ſayd the Gentlewomen. In truth anſwered he, I am no leſſe ſory for her ſickneſſe then before, for I knowe <hi>Floreſtan</hi> to bee ſo wiſe, and of ſo good behauiour, that I am ſure hee will doe all that which ſhe ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand him. God grant it ſayd ſhee, but ſeeing wee haue ſatisfied you, acquite you of your promiſe and tell vs who you are. Gentlewoman anſwered the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> I am a knight who haue heretofore had more pleaſure in the vanities of the worlde then now I haue, for the which I heere abide ſharpe penance, my name is the <hi>Faire Forlorne.</hi> By my truth ſaid one of them, you haue taken a good courſe, if you are able there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to continue. And becauſe there is no reaſon now to leaue our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe all alone in this her great melancholy, wee bid you farewell, and doe goe vnto her to paſſe away the time with ſuch muſicke as you did heare this morning.</p>

                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:7181:158"/>
Then the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but hee was preſently called backe againe, for as ſoone as the gentlewomen had played two or three ſongs, they rehearſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Coriſanda</hi> all that hee had ſaide of <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and that the poore man which did penance, had ſeen him not many dayes before. Wherefore ſhe ſent to pray him to come vnto her, and in the meane while ſhee ſayde vnto her women: aſſure you this Hermit that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> muſt needs be ſome great perſonage diſguiſed. At the ſame inſtant the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> was come, and ſhe ſayd vnto him: my friend, my women tell me that you know <hi>Don Floreſtan,</hi> and that you doe very well loue him, I pray you (by the holy order that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) to tell me what acquaintance you haue had with him, and where you did laſt ſee him. Then the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> told her more of him then hee had tolde vnto the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and how hee knew very well, that he and his brethren, with their Coſen <hi>Agraies,</hi> had beene in the Firme-Iſland: for he had there left them, and neuer ſince had ſeene them. Ah ſayd ſhe, I beleeue that you are ſomething a kinne vnto him, ſeeing the great good you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him. Madame, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> I loue him intirely, as well for his valour, as alſo for that his father made me knight, which maketh me the more bounden vnto his children: and I am very ſory for the newes that I haue hard of <hi>Amadis</hi> before I did come vnto this deſert. What are they ſayd <hi>Coriſanda.</hi> Truely anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hee, comming hither I met with a Gentlewoman at the entry of a Forreſt which ſung a pleaſant ſong for the tune, but very pittifull by reaſon of the matter that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned. Then I enquired of her who made it, and ſhee anſwered me, that it was a knight, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God (if it bee his pleaſure) ſend more ioy then hee had when hee made it, for his ſong doth very wel witneſſe, that his griefe proceeded from too extreame loue. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I liked it wel, I remained with the Gentlewoman ſo long vntill I had learned it: moreouer ſhe did aſſure me that <hi>Amadis</hi> did make it, and that he did ſhew her the ſong at that time when by his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly hee was moſt maiſtered. I pray you ſayde <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> teach it vnto theſe two Gentlewomen, for by that which you ſay, loue held him then in as great bondage as he now holdeth me. I will doe it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered hee, both for the honour of him and alſo of you, althought it be a thing farre vnſeemely for me to do. Herewithall he withdrew the Gentlewomen a part, and taught them the ſong with the tune there-of, wherein they tooke great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> did ſing it with a lamentable and ſoft voyce, which yeelded more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and aptneſſe, both to the tune and the matter, then he could if hee had beene at more liberty in body and minde: and the Gentle-women learned it ſo cunningly, that many times after they did ſing it before their Miſtris, who tarried foure dayes in the poore Rocke, &amp; the fift ſhee embarqued. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe departed, ſhee demanded of the <hi>Faire forlorne,</hi> whether hee would remaine any long time in that place. Madame, anſwered he, nothing but my death ſhall drawe me from hence. I doe much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile ſayde <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> what moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you to doe ſo: yet ſeeing that you are in ſuch a minde, I will in no ſorte diſſwade yon from it:

ſo ſaying, ſhe entred into her ſhip with her companie, bidding the Hermit farewel. Then ſetting ſaile, the winde was ſo fauourable, that in fewe dayes after they landed in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and arriued in the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> where at that time King <hi>Liſuart</hi> remayned.

Coſen ſayde the Queene, wee haue at this time no other newes, of him, but that hee is gone in ſearch of his brother <hi>Amadis,</hi> who of late is loſt, we not knowing the cauſe thereof. Then ſhee tolde her how hee had wonne the Firme Iſland, and that after-wardes hee departed ſecretly from his fellowes: eſpecially the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how <hi>Don Guillan</hi> did finde his armour, and what diligence hee had vſed to vnderſtand what was become of him. When <hi>Coriſanda</hi> did ſee that ſhee was fruſtrate of her intention, and vnderſtood the loſſe of <hi>Amadis,</hi> the teares ſtood in her eyes, ſaying: Alas what wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my Lord and friend <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> I am ſure (conſidering the loue that he beareth vnto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that if hee cannot finde him, he will loſe himſelfe, ſo that I ſhall neuer while I liue ſee him any more: the Queene comforted her ſo well, that ſhee receiued ſome hope to heare news from him very ſhortly. Now <hi>Oriana</hi> was by, who had heard all this talke, and the loue that <hi>Coriſanda</hi> did beare vnto <hi>Don Floreſtan,</hi> brother to <hi>Amadis:</hi> for which cauſe ſhee had the more deſire to doe her honour, ſo as ſhe and <hi>Mabila</hi> did ordinarily keepe her company, taking great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to heare her recite the loue that paſſed betwixt her and hee friend, the cauſe of their parting, and the trauell which afterwardes ſhee had endured in hope to finde him. And as ſhee made this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſhe remembred her of the time when ſhee remayned in the poore Rocke, where ſhee found a knight doing penance, who during her abode there, taught a ſong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her women: which <hi>Amadis</hi> had made being in great melancholy, as the companion of the Hermit had aſſured her.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>En whole dayes did the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> remaine with the Queene of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not ſo much for her pleaſure, nor for to reſt herſelfe from the ſtormes of the Sea, as for the deſire ſhee had to learne ſome newes of <hi>Amadis,</hi> in the countrey wherein ſhee thought aſſuredly to finde him: being aſſured that if ſhe ſhould returne vnto her Miſtreſſe, without bringing her ſome newes, that ſhe could not afterwards liue one houre, knowing in what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſhe had left her. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, not being able at that inſtant to take any better courſe in her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, after ſhe had vſed all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence therein that poſſibly ſhee could, ſhee determined to returne into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſo ſorrowfull as might be. Then ſhee cauſed a ſhip to be ready, wherein ſhee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued: but the deſtinies pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two perſons, would in this matter make manifeſt how much they could performe, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing worldlings to vnderſtand, that no man (how valiant or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet ſoeuer) can helpe themſelues without their diuine ayde. For as ſoon as the Mariners had weighed their anchors &amp; hoyſed their ſailes, hoping to ſet their courſe for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the winde and tempeſt rayſed ſuch a ſtorme, that without any ſtorage at all, the ſhippe was toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſo great rage, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners and all the reſt deſpairing of health, expected no other buriall but in the fiſhes bellies. And thus they remayned two dayes and two nights, not knowing where they were, much leſſe what they ſhould doe. In the end, the Sea being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and the ſtorme paſt, about the breake of day they diſcouered the poore Rocke, where they took landing: and becauſe ſome of the Mariners (who knew the place) did tell the Damoſell of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that <hi>Andahod</hi> the deuout Hermit had there his reſidence, ſhee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to goe heare diuine ſeruice, &amp; to giue God thankes for the good that hee had done for them in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering them from ſuch perill: and without longer ſtay ſhee began to goe vp the Rocke, accompanied with <hi>Durin</hi> and <hi>Enil.</hi> At the ſame time the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> (who by chance had paſſed that night vnder the trees, as hee was accuſtomed) perceiued them, and ſeeing that they came towards him, becauſe hee would not be ſeene hee turned another way, and got to the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage before them, where hee found the Hermit ready to ſay ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. But hee tolde him that there were people newly arriued, who were comming vp the Rocke, and therefore it were good to ſtay, if he pleaſed, vnto the which the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite willingly agreed. At the ſame time was the <hi>Faire Forlorn</hi> ſo leane, wanne, and ſo tanned with the heat of the Sunne, that hee could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be knowen for <hi>Amadis,</hi> for his continuall weeping made ſuch ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes in his face, that there was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7181:160"/>
nothing to bee diſcerned but skin and bone. And as the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her company entred into the Chappell, hee was vpon his knees lifting vp his eyes to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and praying that either by his ſpeedy death his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whileſt he was thus praying, the Hermit beganne his ſeruice, during which time the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> did not once looke vp, to beholde any of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r riued vntill it was ended, who caſting his eyes vpon them, hee knew the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> &amp; the reſt. Therewithall hee felt ſuch a motion that (both by reaſon of his great weakeneſſe, as alſo by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her that put him in minde of all his martyrdome) he fell downe all along vpon the ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hermit thinking that hee had beene dead, cryed out: Ay me is he gone? then God haue mercy vpon his ſoule. Saying ſo, a flood of teares fell from his eyes downe vpon his long hoary beard. Then he ſayd vnto the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke:</hi> I pray you Gentlewoman for charity ſake, command your Eſquires that they may helpe mee to beare my fellow into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for ſo farre as I ſee it ſhall bee the laſt good that wee can doe for him. Whereupon <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>il</hi> and <hi>Durin</hi> tooke him vp, neither of them knowing him. But the Damoſel of <hi>Denmarke</hi> demanded of the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what he was. Truely anſwered hee, it is a knight which liueth here in penance. Truſt me ſayd the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, hee hath choſen a very au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere life, and in a very deſert place. Hee hath done it, anſwered the Hermit, to ſeparate himſelfe from the vanities of the world. Verily ſayde the Gentlewoman, ſeeing you aſſure me that he is a knight, I will ſee him before I depart: and if there be any thing within the ſhip, which may ſerue his turne, I will cauſe it to bee left for him. It ſhall be well done anſwered hee, but ſo farre as I ſee, he is ſo neare his end, that I beleeue hee will eaſe you of that labour. Herewithall the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell entred into the little cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> was layd, who ſeeing her ſo neere vnto him, knew not what he ſhould do: for hee thought that making him-ſelfe to be known, he ſhould tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the commandement of his <hi>Oriana,</hi> and alſo if ſhee departed, and he not diſcouered, hee ſhould remaine voyde of all hope. In the end he concluded that it were leſſe hurtfull for him to die, then his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſhould be diſpleaſed, therefore hee determined for reſolution not to manifeſt himſelfe in any ſort vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> who ſayd vnto him. My friend I haue been enformed by the Hermit that you are a knight, and becauſe all Gentlewomen are greatly bound vnto good knights, for the benefits and pleaſures that they commonly receiue at their hands in defending them, and deliuering them from many and great dangers, I had a great deſire before I departed to ſee you, to giue vnto you ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions as are in my ſhip, that ſhall be neceſſarie for your health. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he anſwered her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither did hee any other thing but lament and ſigh: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in that little Cell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee remayned, there was little light, the Gentlewoman did not know whether hee were a dying or no. Whereupon ſhe was ware of a window, which ſhe opened, by the light whereof ſhee might behold him more at eaſe: but all the while
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7181:160"/>
that ſhe beheld him, hee neuer caſt his eyes off from her, neuertheleſſe hee ſpake not one word, but ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ceaſing, like vnto a wight, whoſe heart was ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with woe, which moued the Damoſel to exceeding pittie. And comforting him in the beſt ſorte ſhe could, by chance ſhee eſpied a ſcarre which he had vpon his face, with a blow that <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter had giuen him, when hee reſcued <hi>Oriana,</hi> as hath beene reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the firſt Booke. Wherefore ſhee thought in her minde that without doubt this was <hi>Amadis</hi> whom ſhee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought, and at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhee did know that he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſame, &amp; for the ſame cauſe ſhee being grealy amaſed, cryed out, Alas what do I ſee? My Lord you are he that hath made me haue many a weary iourney to find you: this ſayd, ſhe embraced him. Alas my Lord ſayd ſhee, it is now high time to extend both pitty and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don vnto her, who (procured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by ſome ſiniſter report, hath brought you to this great extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie) beleeue me, doth now iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endure a life worſe then death: then did ſhe deliuer him the Letter that <hi>Oriana</hi> had written vnto him. Hold ſayd ſhe, your Lady ſendeth you this, and commandeth you by me, that if you be the ſame <hi>Amadis</hi> that you were wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here withall was the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> ſo greatly rauiſhed, that it was a long time before hee could anſwer one word, but hee tooke the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which hee kiſſed without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and afterwards put it next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O poore heart ſo long time paſſioned, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſt thou beene able to reſiſt ſuch a tempeſt, notwithſtanding the abundance of teares, which thou ſo continually haſt diſtilled, that it hath almoſt brought thee euen to the point of death, receiue now this medicine, the which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is conuenient for thy health, and come forth of this darknes, which ſo long hath blinded thee, taking thy ſtrength againe vnto thee, to ſerue her that of her owne free grace cauſeth thee to reuiue.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> before his departure, declared vnto the Hermit, how the Gentlewoman had ſo long ſought for him, that now they were heere caſually met together, onely by meere chance, and the ſtorme which had brought her vnto the poore Rock. And for this cauſe my father, ſaide he, I am conſtrained to leaue you and to follow her, aſſuring you that ſo long as I liue, I ſhall neuer forget the good which you haue done for mee, for without your good help, I had periſhed both body and ſoule.

then if behooueth you to doe the like for him, for if you doe loſe him in this ſort, it ſhall not onely bee the loſſe of the moſt gentle knight in the world, but of the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt kinſman that you haue, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and beſides, it will be vnto you a great blemiſh. Therefore my Lords I beſeech you, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the duty of a brother, a friend, and a companion, to begin his ſearch a freſh, without ſparing therein at all either time or toile. This perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did <hi>Gandalin</hi> make, in weeping ſo extreamly, that it greatly putied the three knights to behold him, ſo as they concluded, after they had beene in the Court (if they heard not news of <hi>Amadis)</hi> to begin a new purſuit, &amp; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the whole world about till they had found him: and vpon this determination (after they had heard diuine ſeruice) they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the hermitage, and tooke the way towards <hi>London.</hi> But as they approched nere vnto the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they were ware of the King, who was already in the fields ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many noble men, and valiant knights: for hee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated that day with all magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, becauſe that vpon the ſame he was crowned peaceable king of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall occaſion that many knights came to ſerue him.

Moreouer mine eyes are ouerſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len with much weeping, and (that which worſe is) it is impoſſible for to behold thoſe, whom I did neuer ſee but in the company of your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, whom I haue ſo highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Heerewithall her heart was likely to haue left her ſorrowfull body, and ſhe cryed. My God how doe you permit mee wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to liue, being ſo worthy of death? Ah my deere loue, I doe now feele a double griefe for your abſence, ſeeing <hi>Galaor</hi> &amp; the reſt to returne without you, whome you loued as deere as your ſelfe, who knowing the iniury and wicked act that I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt you, ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to procure my ruine, whereunto I conſent with a good will, ſeeing that ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly I haue beene the meanes of your loſſe. Herewithall ſhe had fallen downe all along, if <hi>Mabila</hi> who ſtreight eſpied it, had not ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her vp, ſaying vnto her: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, will you alwaies continue theſe ſtrange paſſions? I know well that in the end, you will publiſh that to your ſhame, which we doe moſt deſire ſhould be kept ſecret. Is this the conſtancy which you ought to haue, eſpecially ſeeing that day by day we expect to heare good newes by the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke?</hi> Alas, anſwered ſhee, you ſpeake at your pleaſure, is it poſſible that ſhee may finde him, hauing the charge but to ſeek him onely in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſeeing that his brethren haue in a manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed all the Weſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any newes at all of him? You abuſe your ſelfe, ſaide <hi>Mabila,</hi> it may bee that they had found him, but that hee kept himſelfe ſecret from them, the which he wil neuer do fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your Gentlewoman, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe is priuie to both your loues. And therefore be of good cheere vntill her returne, and then doe as you ſhall thinke good: and for this time, let vs goe if it pleaſe you towards the Queene who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth for you. Well, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Oriana,</hi> I am content to doe what you will. Then ſhee dried her eyes, and went in the Queenes chamber, into the which the three knights were already entred: who ſeeing her comming did their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vnto her: at the ſame time the King held <hi>Galaor</hi> by the hand, vnto whom he ſaid: behold I pray you, how your good friend <hi>Oriana</hi> is impaired, ſince you did laſt ſee her. In good faith, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> your Maieſtie ſaith true, and I would with all my heart, that I might doe her any pleaſure, that might purchaſe her former health.

deere a brother <hi>Amadis</hi> was vnto you. And I would that the trauell which you haue taken to ſeeke him in farre countries, had brought ſome fruit, as well for the good of you and yours, as alſo for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the King my father, vnto the which hee was wholly adicted. Madame anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> I truſt that wee ſhall very ſhortly heare ſome newes of him, becauſe he is the knight that I haue euermore ſeene moſt valiantly to reſiſt all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. God grant it ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> but I pray you cauſe <hi>Don Floreſtan</hi> to come neere vnto vs, that I may more plainely beholde him, for I haue beene tolde that hee is the knight that doth moſt reſemble your brother <hi>Amadis.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Galaor</hi> called him, and he came &amp; ſaluted <hi>Oriana,</hi> who tooke him by the hand, &amp; they three ſate downe together. Then the Princeſſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that ſhe did verily beholde him, who beeing abſent from her, ſhee had day and night before her eyes, and therefore ſhee began to bluſh and change her colour. Now had <hi>Mabila</hi> in like fort withdrawn her ſelfe, together with <hi>Olinda,</hi> to giue a better occaſion vnto her brother <hi>Agraies</hi> more priuately to ſpeake vnto her: and there withall hee ſeeing them in a place ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, came and ſaluted them, then at their requeſt he ſate downe betweene them, in taking <hi>Olinda</hi> ſecretly by the hand. And ſhe who did languiſh for his loue, was the gladdeſt that might be, being ſure of his conſtancy, by the proofe which he had made paſſing vnder the arch of loyall louers in the Firme-Iſland, in recompence whereof ſhe would willingly haue giuen him better intertainement, if ſhe durſt.

                  <p>When <hi>Oriana</hi> heard theſe words, eſpecially how that <hi>Gandalin</hi> was returned without <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhe was in ſuch a perplexity, that ſhee was likely to haue ſwouned betweene <hi>Floreſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Therefore I am determined to withdrawe my ſelfe for a certaine time vnto my Caſtle of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> for my heart telleth me that in changing the ayre, I ſhall alſo change my afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that my troubled ſpirit ſhall there finde reſt. Madame, anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> I am of the ſame opinion, to the end that when the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, you may more priuately ſpeake with her, and pleaſure him that ſhee (I hope) ſhall bring with her, the which would be very hard, yea almoſt impoſſible to doe in this place. As you loue mee then ſayd <hi>Oriana,</hi> let vs not tarry any longer: for I am ſure the King and Queene will very willingly giue vs leaue.</p>
                  <p>Now you muſt vnderſtand, that this place of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> was a little Caſtle moſt pleaſantly ſeated two leagues from <hi>London,</hi> built vpon the ſide of a hill, and compaſſed vpon the one ſide with the Forreſt, and vpon the other with many Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, full of all ſorts of trees and pleaſant flowers: moreouer it was inuironed with many great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, which watered it on all parts. And becauſe that once the King (being there on hunting with the Queene) ſeeing that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tooke great pleaſure in the place, hee beſtowed it vpon her, and afterwards ſhe cauſed a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie to bee builded within a bow ſhot thereof, whereunto ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times went to recreate her ſelfe. But that I may not degreſſe ouer farre from my firſt diſcourſe, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>a</hi> according as ſhe had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, came and demanded leaue of the King and Queene for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, the which was eaſily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her: and therefore ſhee purpoſed to depart the next day very earely in the morning. And becauſe that <hi>Galaor</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts would in like ſort returne to make a new ſearch for <hi>Amadis,</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the King at leaſure, they ſayd vnto him: If it pleaſe your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, wee were greatly to be blamed if wee ſhould any longer deferre the ſeeking of <hi>Amadis,</hi> becauſe my fellowes and I haue ſworne neuer to reſt in any place, before wee haue heard of him, therefore it may pleaſe your grace to giue vs leaue to depart to morrowe, to doe our endeauours. My friends anſwered the King. I pray you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre your departure yet a fewe daies longer, in the meane ſeaſon I will cauſe thirty knights to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from hence, who ſhall goe &amp; begin this voyage: for I haue great neede of ſuch knights as you are, for an enterpriſe which is happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto me, the which importeth me greatly both in goods and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, it is a battaile which I haue appointed againſt King <hi>Cildadan</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who is a ſtrong and mighty Prince. And to let you vnderſtand the cauſe of this warre, <hi>Cildadan</hi> hath married one of the daughters of King <hi>Abies,</hi> whom <hi>Amadis</hi> ſlew in <hi>Gaule.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though time out of minde, the realme of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath euer beene tributarie vnto the King of Great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> neuertheleſſe to haue an occaſion of quarrell this <hi>Cilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> refuſeth the payment thereof, and ſendeth me word that he will put one hundred of his knights in battaile againſt the like number
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7181:164"/>
of mine, vpon this condition, that if he be ouercome he will redouble the tribute which I doe demand of him, otherwiſe he will hence-forth remaine free and acquitted, the which I haue condiſcended vnto. So my friends, I doe moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreat you, euen as you loue mee, not to forſake mee in this my greateſt neede, knowing aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that my enemies are ſtrong, and determined to worke my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, but by your good helpe and the right that we haue, we ſhal eaſily ouercome them, then ſhall you goe ſeeke out <hi>Amadis,</hi> as you haue determined, and you ſhall take as many of my knights with you as you pleaſe. When they heard this requeſt which the King did make vnto them, there was not any amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to obey him, ſeeing his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſo great, although that thereby the queſt of <hi>Amadis</hi> was delaied: and at the ſame inſtant they promiſed not to forſake him. During this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference, <hi>Mabila</hi> ſent to ſeeke <hi>Gandalin,</hi> for ſhee would ſpeake with him before ſhee went to <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> who came vnto her: and as ſoone as hee did ſee her, he could not poſſibly refraine from weeping, nor ſhe likewiſe. Afterwards hauing ſome-what eaſed their hearts with their exceeding teares, <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſpake firſt, ſaying vnto <hi>Mabila:</hi> Alas Madame, what wrong hath <hi>Oriana</hi> offered, not onely to you, hut vnto all your lignage together, cauſing you to loſe the beſt Knight in the world. Ah, how ingratefull hath ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelfe vnto you for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which you haue done vnto her? and that which is yet worſt of all, ſhe hath wronged him that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer offended her either in word or thought: wherefore I may well ſay, that God hath very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon her that great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and other excellent gifts where-with he hath endued her, ſeeing they are gouerned and ouer-ruled with ſo great treaſon: and yet I am well aſſured that none hath loſt more then ſhe. <hi>Gandalin</hi> my friend anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> I pray thee put that thought forth of thy minde, for thou art ouer-much deceiued, ſeeing that all which my Lady <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> hath done, hath beene for the griefe and diſpleaſure that ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for one word which was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-lightly reported vnto her, through which ſhe hath conceiued ſome occaſion of iélouſie, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that thy maiſter had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten her, and that the affection which he did beare vnto her, was turned and beſtowed vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Notwithſtanding, ſhe did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer imagine, that her letter (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in choller) ſhould haue beene of ſuch conſequence, nor that ſo much hurt ſhould haue proceeded thereof: but ſhee committed this fault as one that was caryed away with too extreame loue, which fault is the more pardonable in her, for the repentance which ſhe hath endured euer ſince.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7181:165"/>
anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> (thinking to ſpeake for the aduantage of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis)</hi> was the occaſion of all this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. Then ſhe recited vnto him at large, the whole diſcourſe of the three peeces of the ſword, as you haue heard in the firſt booke. And aſſure thee <hi>Gandalin,</hi> ſaid ſhe, that neither the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> nor I, were euer able to driue it from the fantaſie of <hi>Oriana,</hi> but that ſhe was forſaken by him, ſo as ſhee ſtill perceiuing that ſhee was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traried by the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> and me, did hide her ſelfe from vs, and vnawares to vs both ſhe wrot vnto him, that vnhappy letter which <hi>Durin</hi> did bring him, by the which is ſprung the whole ſourſe of this miſchiefe. Whereof ſhee hath ſince that time, often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough repented her: for from the firſt houre that ſhe did heare of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> his loſſe, ſhee hath receiued ſo great ſorrow and griefe, that it is impoſſible to receiue any more: and neuertheleſſe, we haue been in a manner very glad of her puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing that ſhe hath not yet feared to procure his diſpleaſure, that of her hath ſo well deſerued. All this diſcourſe did <hi>Oriana</hi> heare, who was in her wardrobe: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that they had changed then talke, ſhee came forth as if ſhe had heard nothing at all. And as ſhee would haue ſpoken vnto <hi>Gandalin,</hi> the teares diſtilled from her eyes, and ſhe began to tremble ſo extreamely, that ſhe fell downe all along vpon the floore, crying. Gentle <hi>Gandalin,</hi> if thou art the ſame that thou ſhouldeſt be vnto thy maiſter, reuenge vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me forth-with, the greate miſerie which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly he endureth. Madam, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hee, what would you haue mee to do? I pray thee, ſaid ſhe, kill me: and ſince I haue moſt iniuriouſly cauſed his death, thou oughteſt not in reaſon to defer the reuenge thereof, for I am ſure he wold haue done more for thee. Saying ſo her ſpeech failed, and ſhee ſwouned as though ſhe had bin departed. But <hi>Mabila</hi> accuſtomed to ſuch qualms, did releeue her with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and fit remedy, that when ſhe came to her ſelfe againe, ſhe cried wringing her hands. Ah <hi>Gandalin,</hi> thou doeſt mee great wrong, thus long to defer my end: I would to God that thy father were in thy place, I am ſure that hee would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir himſelfe better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou doeſt: Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> God defend me from ſuch diſloyalty, I ſhould truely play the part of the notableſt villaine in the world, if I ſhould but onely thinke ſuch a thought, much more if I ſhould commit two ſo great treaſons, one againſt you, and the other againſt my Lord, who cannot liue one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houre after you. And I would neuer haue thought that ſo wicked cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell ſhould haue had any place within your ſpirit, for the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that you haue of my maiſter his death, who could haue hardly endured this wrong which you now in theſe words haue offered him, without endangering his life, for death commeth not but at the will and pleaſure of God: who hath not beſtowed theſe fauours vpon him euer ſince his natiuitie, that for any iniurie that you haue done vnto him, he will permit that he ſhould yet die. Many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and perſwaſions did <hi>Gandalin</hi> vſe to <hi>Oriana</hi> which gaue great eaſe to her matirdom, by means where-of ſhe ſaid vnto him: <hi>Gandalin</hi> my friend, I am determined to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning to depart vnto <hi>Mire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleur,</hi> to expect either life or death, according to the newes which the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7181:165"/>
Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> ſhall bring vnto me. And becauſe I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there ſome long time, I pray thee vnder the colour of ſeeing <hi>Mabila,</hi> to come and viſit vs often-times, for me thinkes my ſorrow decreaſeth when I doe ſee thee. Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> I am ready to obey you in whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe you to command mee. This ſaid, he tooke his leaue of her, and as he departed from thence, he paſſed by where the Queene was, who cauſed him to be called, and then ſhee ſaide vnto him. <hi>Gandalin</hi> my friend, wherfore didſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thy maiſter? Madame, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he, it was ſore againſt my will, and to my great griefe. Then hee reherſed the manner how hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the hermitage, and the complaints and lamentations that he made, eſpecially he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what his manner and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was, when he found him in the bottom of the valley, which moued the Queene vnto ſuch pittie, that ſhee ſhed luke warme teares there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. Whereunto <hi>Gandalin</hi> taking good heed, ſaid vnto her. Madam, your highneſſe hath reaſon to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loſſe of my Lord, for hee was your graces moſt humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. Nay rather my good friend and protector, anſwered ſhe, and I would it were the Lords pleaſure, that wee might heare ſuch ſpeedy newes from him, as might giue vs cauſe to reioyce. And as they tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together, <hi>Gandalin</hi> caſt his eye vpon <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> who was talking with <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> whome <hi>Gandalin</hi> knew not: but hee thought her to be one of the faireſt Ladies that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he had ſeene, therefore hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched the Queen to tell him who ſhee was, the which ſhee did, and the occaſion wherefore ſhee was come into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> as alſo the loue which ſhe did beare vnto <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> for whoſe ſake ſhe ſtaied at the Court: if ſhe doe loue him, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> ſhee may well vaunt that her loue is imployed vpon him, in whome all bounty remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and he is ſuch a one, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may his equal be found in all the world: and moreouer Madame, I aſſure you, that if your grace did know him ſo well as I, you would not eſteeme any knight more then he, for he is of a moſt valiant heart and high reſolution. He ſeemeth to be ſuch a one, anſwered the Queen, further-more hee is of ſo good a grace, and alied to ſo many good knights, that it is impoſſible but that hee ſhould bee ſuch a gentle knight as thou haſt reported him to be. In the meane ſeaſon <hi>Floreſtan</hi> entertained his Lady and Miſtris, whom he loued moſt feruently, &amp; not without a cauſe: for ſhee was paſſing faire, a rich Lady, and alied to the nobleſt houſes in all great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> Who hauing remained yet ſome few dayes in the Court after his returne, ſhee determined to depart, and taking her leaue of the king and Queene, ſhe took her iourney toward her own countrey. Two whole daies together did <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan</hi> accompany her, who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her that ſo ſoone as he heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny newes of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and that the battaile was paſt betwixt the two Kings, <hi>Liſuart</hi> and <hi>Cildadan,</hi> (if he remained aliue) hee would come vnto her to tarry with her a long time: then taking his leaue of her, hee returned vnto the Court. But you muſt vnderſtand, that <hi>Oriana</hi> who had not forgotten her deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of going to <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> departed the next morning with her traine, where ſhee had not long remained, but that ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the amendment of her
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7181:166"/>
health, and with the ſame, her hope increaſed to ſee him, whom ſhee ſo greatly deſired. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the king had appointed, that during her aboade in that place of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> the gate ſhould continually bee kept, and that no body ſhould enter thereinn: <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> foreſeeing (for the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhee had that it ſhould be ſo) the comming of <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhee ſent to tell the Abbeſſe, that ſhee ſhould ſend vnto her the keyes of the Nunnerie gardens, to walke thither ſometimes for her recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the which ſhee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, which were hard adioyning to the Caſtle, but yet incloſed with very high walles. And one day as <hi>Oriana</hi> walked there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied onely with <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſeeing the place fauourable and fit for her purpoſe, as if <hi>Amadis</hi> were returned, ſhe began to thinke of him in ſuch ſort, and vpon the pleaſure ſhe ſhould receiue by his preſence, that in ſpeaking to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhe ſayd: Ah my onely hope, my ſollace and my intire refuge, wherefore art thou not beere with mee, ſeeing at this preſent I haue the meanes both to giue vnto thee, and alſo to receiue of thee, ſuch caſe and contentment as we haue ſo oftentimes deſired to receiue one of another? At the leaſt I wil not depart from hence vntil I haue wholy ſatisfied the hurt which by my ouer-great folly I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured vnto you, but I will here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your comming. And if Fates or fortune doe permit mee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde you here ſhortly, I promiſe you, ſweete loue, to giue you the ſure contentment that your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent loue hath promiſed vnto you a long time: but if my misfortune ſhall bee an hinderance vnto your ſpeedy returne, your only abſence ſhall bee the meanes to haſten my end: wherefore I beſeech you to take pitty on this my weakeneſſe, and to ſuccour mee, for I liue and yet languiſh in extreame bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And ſeeing that euer hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you haue beene obedient vnto mee, without contradicting me in any ſort, now the neceſſity beeing ſuch, I pray you by that power which you haue giuen mee ouer you, that you would come to deliuer mee from death (which I feele to approach) and tarry not: otherwiſe your delay will cauſe you ouer late to repent my vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py end. In this ſort did ſhe ſpeak as if <hi>Amadis</hi> had beene preſent, when <hi>Mabila</hi> brake off her thought, and <hi>Oriana</hi> changing her talke, ſayd to her: Coſen, ſeeing that wee haue the keyes of this place, it were beſt that <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſhould make ſome other like vnto them, to the ende that your Coſen beeing returned, may goe and come hither when &amp; as often as hee ſhall pleaſe. It is wel aduiſed anſwered <hi>Mabila.</hi> And as they were conſulting, there was one of the Porters ſayd to <hi>Mabila:</hi> Madam, <hi>Gandalin</hi> is without, who deſireth to ſpeake with you. Let him come in anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> for he hath beene brought vp with vs a long time: and alſo he is foſter brother vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom God preſerue. God ſo doe ſayde the Porter, it were a great damage that ſo good &amp; vertuous a knight ſhould ſuſtaine any hurt. Then went he forth to goe ſeeke <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and in the meane time <hi>Oriana</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Mabila,</hi> I pray you ſee how your Coſen is beloued and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of all men, yea euen of the baſeſt ſort of people, that are in a manner, voyde of all vertue, it is true anſwered <hi>Mabila.</hi> Then <hi>Oriana</hi> ſayde, what would you
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7181:166"/>
haue mee doe but die? hauing beene the onely cauſe of the ruine of him who is more worth, then all the men in the world, and who did better loue me, then his owne ſelfe? Ah accurſed be the houre wherein I was borne, ſeeing that by my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and light ſuſpition, I haue done vnto him ſo great and ſo much wrong: Madame, anſwered <hi>Mabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> I pray you forget theſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and onely arme you with hope, for all this which you both ſay and doe, ſerueth in no ſort to eaſe your dolour. Herewithall <hi>Gandalin</hi> entred in, whom <hi>Oriana</hi> cauſed to ſit downe by her: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome conference which they had together, ſhe recited how ſhe had ſent the Damoſell of <hi>Denmark</hi> to ſeeke <hi>Amadis:</hi> vnto whom ſhee had written a Letter containing that which you haue heard, and what words alſo ſhe had giuen her in charge to ſay vnto him, therefore ſaid the Princeſſe, in thy opinion doeſt thou thinke that he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me? Madame, anſwered <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> Me thinks you are little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his heart, for I am ſure for the leaſt word that is in the letter, hee will teare himſelfe into an hundreth peeces for you, if you do but onely command him: by more likelyhood may you imagin whether he will be glad to come ſee you, yea or no. And be you aſſured that ſeeing the Damoſel of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> hath vndertaken the charge to finde him, that ſhe will ſooner accompliſh the ſame, then all the perſons in the world beſide: for I do not thinke (ſeeing hee did hide himſelfe from me that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer poſſible for any other but ſhee to finde him out. For this cauſe Madam, you ought henceforth to liue in good hope, and to reioyce more then euer you did, to the end, that when he returneth he may not finde your beauty in ſuch ſort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed. What ſaiſt thou <hi>Gandalin?</hi> anſwered ſhe laughing, doeſt thou thinke me now ſo vgly? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Madame, what do you thinke of your ſelfe, that in this ſort you doe hide you from the ſight of all men. I do it to this end, ſaid <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that when thy Maſter commeth if he would flie me for my deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I might in this place ſtay him as my priſoner. I would ſaid he, that he were here already, and free from that other priſon, wherein hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for your loue. Well ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> we haue now other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in hand, his Coſin and I haue done ſo much, that wee haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the keyes of theſe gardens, by the which at his returne, he may come in hither to ſee vs, at al times and as often as he will, and thou muſt do ſo much, to cauſe two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keyes like theſe to bee made, the which he ſhall keepe. In good faith, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> it is well and wiſely aduiſed. Then the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe deliuered him the keyes, and without any longer ſtaying in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refleur</hi> he returned to <hi>London,</hi> where he executed his commiſſion ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, that the next morning he came vnto <hi>Mabila,</hi> vnto whom he deliuered the counterfeit keyes, who ſhewed them ſtraight vnto <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> ſaying vnto her: behold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a good beginning, for the recompencing of the hurt which you procured vnto your <hi>Amadis.</hi> Mine? anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> I would to God he were here. I then might well call him mine, whether hee would or no, Go to, go to, let vs not come out of Gods bleſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a warme Sun, ſaid <hi>Mabila,</hi> but let vs ſee this night if <hi>Gandalin</hi> haue performed his taske well, and whether the keyes will open the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7181:167"/>
dores or not. I pray you let vs, ſaid <hi>Oriana.</hi> And for that preſent they made an end of their talke, waiting a conuenient time to finiſh their enterpriſe: and according to their appointment, about mid-night (when euery one were ſound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe) they ſecretly roſe vp, and came down into the Court, it was then in the time of the moones waining, and for that cauſe the darknes did beare the more ſway: wherefore <hi>Oriana</hi> began to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and ſaid vnto <hi>Mabila:</hi> I pray thee hold me by the hand, for I am almoſt dead with feare. No, no, I will defend you well enough, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhee, am not I coſin to the moſt valiant knight in the world? But although <hi>Oriana</hi> did tremble, yet could ſhee not refraine from laughter, &amp; ſaid vnto her. Let vs go then garded: for I will henceforth thinke me ſafe being to be garded by you, who are ſo valiant in deeds of armes. Seeing that you knowe me ſo well, anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> let vs march on boldly, and you ſhall ſee how I will finiſh this aduenture: wherein if I faile, I ſweare that for one whole yeere, I will neither hang ſhield about my necke, nor ſtrike one ſtroke with the Launce. Heerewithall they began to laugh ſo loude, that they might haue bin heard very eaſily, and at the ſame inſtant they came vnto the dore, where they tried the firſt key, which they found maruailous fit, and the ſecond alſo, wherefore they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them without any difficultie, and entered into the Orchard. Then ſayde <hi>Oriana</hi> vnto <hi>Mabila:</hi> Coſin all that wee haue done is to no end, except ſome-what more be done: how may your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin returne when wee once haue brought him into the place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the height of the wals? I haue already thought vpon that, anſwered ſhe, it ſhall be very eaſie for him by the corner of this wall, againſt the which wee will ſet by this peece of timber, and with the ſame and our helpe together, hee may eaſily mount vp to the top thereof: but it behooueth that the chiefeſt helpe come from you, for you onely reape the commoditie thereof. Wee ſhall ſee what will happen, ſayde <hi>Oriana,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this time let vs depart, and goe to ſleepe, the which they did. And as they laid them downe in their bed, <hi>Mabila</hi> on bracing <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> ſaide vnto her. Madame, I would that the knight for whome you attempt ſo many fair enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, were now in my place, vpon this condition, that I did goe to ſleepe elſe-where, becauſe I would heare none of your complaints, for the harme that hee might doe vnto you. Gentle coſin, anſwerrd ſhe, if he were here, I would endure very much before I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of it. And ſo long they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued this pleaſant diſcourſe, that loue ſtinged them ſo vehemently, as euery amorous Reader may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine what they wanted, to cauſe them ſleep till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they went to hear diuine ſeruice: and at their returne they found that <hi>Gandalin</hi> was already come from <hi>London,</hi> whom they led with them into the garden, where they told him how they had tryed the keyes, and what words <hi>Mabila</hi> had vſed in the proouing of them. By my faith Madame, anſwered he, you do now put me in minde of ſome iniurious ſpeech that I vſed of you vnto my Lord, thinking thereby to haue comforted him, but therewithall he had thought to haue taken my head fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſhortly after I did abide

Wherefore ſeeing that he was loſt, and that he had left mee, for the words that I had ſpoken of you, I was driuen into ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, that I had ſlaine my ſelfe if I had had a ſword to do it: friend, <hi>Gandalin,</hi> anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> thou needeſt not to excuſe him, I kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And to the end that you may the better know me, I am his brother <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> who doe offer vnto you the combat vpon this condition, that if I can ouercome, you ſhall be bound to giue ouer the quarrel that you haue againſt him, and if you ouercome mee, reuenge part of your anger on mee.

Who ſhortly after entered in with the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a perſon more pleaſant then penſiue: and after her duty done vnto <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſhee preſented her with a Letter from <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſaying vnto her: Madame, my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> recommendeth him muſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly vnto your good grace, whom I haue found, as this Letter (written with his owne hand) will aſſure you. <hi>Oriana</hi> receiued the Letter, and as ſhe thought to haue opened it, her ſpirit was ſo raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with exceeding ioy, as all the parts of her body remained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any power, or ability once to moue or ſtirre, becauſe they would ſupply no other office, but to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate in this moſt happy newes: ſo that <hi>Oriana</hi> therewithall fell down in the place where ſhe ſtood. But very ſuddenly ſhee was raiſed vp againe, &amp; ſhe opened the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein ſhee found the ring that ſhe ſent vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> by <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> at the ſame time that hee fought with <hi>Dardan</hi> at <hi>Winſore,</hi> which ſhe preſently knew. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in kiſſing it ſhee ſayd ſo loud that ſhe might eaſily be heard: O ring diuinely kept, bleſſed be hee, that euer did make thee ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, giuing from hand to hand all the pleaſure that may bee deſired, then put ſhe it vpon her finger, and beganne to reade the Letter. And when ſhe beheld the ſweet words that <hi>Amadis</hi> vſed, &amp; the the thanks that he did yeeld vnto her, for the careful remembrance that ſhe had of him, by the which he was raiſed from death to life, there was neuer any woman more ioyfull, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting her eyes vp to heauen, ſhee ſaid: O God of heauen and earth, creator of all things, praiſed be thy holy name, becauſe thou haſt vouchſaſed in mercy to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon mee, by the diligence of this Gentlewoman. Herewithall ſhee withdrew her ſelfe apart and tooke the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> by the hand, ſaying vnto her: I pray you faire Lady tel me how you did find him, how long you haue bin toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the place where you haue left him. By my faith Madam anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red the Damoſell, after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from you, I ariued in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where I remained certaine dayes without hearing any news of him, by meanes whereof (beeing as it were voide of hope to ſatisfie your deſire) I tooke ſhipping intending to returne vnto you: but wee had ſo ſore a tempeſt vpon the Sea, that mauger all our Mariners, the ſhip was driuen vnto the poore Rocke, where my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remained. Whom at the firſt ſight we did not know, for he was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in name, habite, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and hee was likely to haue died in our preſence, when in a manner hee was not ſuccoured by any of vs. Notwithſtanding in the end I was ware of a wound that he had vpon the face, the which was heretofore giuen vnto him by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus,</hi> wherby I ſtill ſuſpected that it ſhould be he, and in the end hee manifeſted himſelfe vnto me. And continuing her diſcourſe, ſhee recited wholly all that which you haue heard in the beginning of this Hiſtory. Then loue &amp; pitty aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the heart of the Princeſſe, in ſo ſtrange a manner, that ſhe entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Gentlewoman to ſpeake no more of the troubles of <hi>Amadis:</hi> but onely to tell her how hee did at that preſent. Madame, anſwered ſhee, I haue left him in the Forreſt, ſtaying to heare ſome newes from you. And how may wee ſecretly ſend vnto him, ſaide <hi>Oriana:</hi> for if you returne vnto him ſo ſuddainly, there might ſome matter bee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. For the ſame occaſion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the damoſel, I haue brought with me <hi>Durin,</hi> whome I will ſend back when it ſhall pleaſe you, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that I haue forgot parte of the preſents that I brought vnto <hi>Mabila.</hi> It is very well aduiſed, ſaid the Princeſſe. Afterwards ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto her, how <hi>Coriſanda</hi> gaue vnto them the firſt hope that <hi>Amadis</hi> was not dead, and that hee it was that named himſelfe the <hi>Faire Forlorne.</hi> It is true, anſwered the Damoſell, and hee is yet ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, neither is hee determined to change his name, vntill hee haue firſt ſeene you, except you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him the contrary. That ſhall then be very ſhortly, ſaide <hi>Oriana,</hi> for his coſin and I haue taken ſuch order, that hee may come hither when it ſhal pleaſe him and not be perceiued by any body. We haue the key of this garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (by the which the way ſhal be eaſie and ſecret for him) the which wee will ſend vnto him by <hi>Durin,</hi> therefore call him vnto vs, to tell him what <hi>Amadis</hi> muſt doe at his hither arriuall. Hereupon <hi>Durin</hi> came vnto them, &amp; <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhewing him the garden, ſaid vnto him. <hi>Durin</hi> doeſt thou ſee this orchard, <hi>Amadis</hi> muſt enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ouer the corner of this wall, &amp; when hee is once in, heere are the keyes of the dore thorow which he muſt come vnto vs, the which thou ſhalt carry vnto him, and ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduertiſe him, whatſoeuer thy ſiſter ſhall tell thee in my behalfe. Which ſaid, ſhe departed leauing them together, and as ſoone as ſhe was entred into a great Hall, ſhee forthwith ſent vnto the Damoſell, willing her to bring thoſe preſents which the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queene had ſent vnto her &amp; <hi>Mabila,</hi> the which ſhe did.

Alas Madam, I haue left the tokens that were ſent vnto <hi>Mabila,</hi> there as we did lie the laſt night, and if <hi>Durin</hi> do not ſpeedily returne, they may be in dangar to be loſt: now <hi>Durin</hi> knew the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter well enough, and therefore hee made as though hee were vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and on the other ſide, <hi>Mabila</hi> faining to be very angry, ſaid vnto him: <hi>Durin</hi> my good friend, will you do me this pleaſure, to returne and fetch that which your ſiſter hath forgotten? Madam, anſwered he, I will do whatſoeuer you ſhall pleaſe, but by my faith, I could bee very well content, that it would pleaſe you to appoint ſome other to doe it, becauſe of the toyle that we haue indured in our weariſome iourney. My friend, ſaid ſhe, I pray thee do ſo much for me, &amp; be thou ſure that I wil reward thee: in good ſooth, ſaide <hi>Oriana,</hi> it were greate reaſon ſo to doe, I vnderſtand you well enough, anſwered <hi>Durin,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you mocke mee.

                     <hi>Oriana</hi> had ſent vnto him by <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin:</hi> and hee greatly feared ſuch a let, knowing that <hi>Quedragant</hi> was one of the beſt knights in the world: neuertheleſſe hee made himſelfe ready for the Iouſt.

                  <p>The <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> was ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enflamed with rage to heare him thus to menace, eſpecially the King and all his Knights, that hee anſwered <hi>Quedragant:</hi> You then are one of them that haue defied that good King?

As for mee I am no ſubiect but rather a ſtraunger vnto the King againſt whom your quarrell is: yet haue I alwaies had a deſire to doe him what ſeruice I could, and therefore you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count mee of the number of thoſe whom you doe defie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with mee if you liſt, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe followe on your way. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue mee ſayde <hi>Quedragant,</hi> I thinke the little experience you haue of mee, maketh you to vtter theſe braues: notwithſtanding I would very willingly know your name. I am called anſwered hee, the <hi>Faire Forlorne:</hi> but I thinke for the ſmall renowne that yet is blaſed abroade of mee, you doe now knowe mee as well as you did before. And although I am a ſtraunger, yet haue I heard that you doe ſeeke <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule:</hi> neuertheleſſe I beleeue it were moſt for your profit, not to meete with him, conſidering but what I haue heard reported of him. What ſayd <hi>Quedragant,</hi> doſt thou thinke better of him (vnto whom I doe wiſh ſo much hurt) then of mee? Truſt mee thou ſhalt repent it, therefore defend thee if thy heart will ſuffer thee. Although (anſwered the <hi>Faire Forlorne)</hi> that againſt another I would haue bin content for this time to haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed mee from the combate, yet will I very gladly vndertake it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, for the threatnings &amp; preſumptions that you doe offer vnto me.</p>
                  <p>This ſayd, they ran one againſt the other with ſo great force that the horſe of the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> was likely to haue liſt the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with his noſe, &amp; himſelfe was wounded

Neuertheleſſe I am in good hope that the wrong which you haue done both to him and mee ſhall redound vpon your owne head. <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> anſwered him not one word, but couering him with his ſhield, he came and layd at the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> who in a ſhort time made him feele how well hee could repay whatſoeuer was lent vnto him: and to heare them fight, one would haue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that more then tenne knights had been fighting together. Then ioyned they ſo cloſe that they left their weapons, and fell to wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, endeauouring to throw one another downe, but that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them: wherefore they let goe their holde, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any breathing, they betooke them againe to their blades, and layd loade one vpon the other ſo couragiouſly, that their Eſquires beholding that cruell combate, did thinke it impoſſible but that they ſhould both twaine die by the hands of each other.</p>
                  <p>And thus they continued from three of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone vntill it grewe towardes night, without either reſting them or ſpeaking together: but euen at the ſame inſtant <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> was ſo wearie and faint, that his heart failed him, and he fell downe in this place. By meanes where-of the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> ſtepped vnto him, &amp; as hee pulled off his helme to ſtrike off his head, <hi>Quedragant</hi> taking ayre beganne to breath: the which the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (although hee was ready to performe with his arme, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge that he meant to take of his enemy) hee ſtayed his blow, the ſworde being ready to lop off any limme vpon the which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe it might chaunce to light: and hee ſayde vnto <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi> it is hight time for thee to think vpon the health of thy ſoule, for thou art but a dead man. Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Quedragant</hi> perceiued that he was in ſuch daunger, hee was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that hee anſwered vnto the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> Alas if I muſt die, yet at the leaſt let mee firſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt liue any longer ſaid the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> yeelde thy ſelfe vanquiſhed, and promiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all that I ſhall commaund thee. I will willingly fulfill what-ſoeuer ſhall pleaſe you, anſwered <hi>Don Quedragant,</hi> although I am not vanquiſned: for hee is not ouercome that without ſhewing one iot of cowardiſe, hath defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his quarrell euen with the loſſe of his breath, and vntill that he did fall at his enemies feet: but he onely is ouercome, that for want of heart, feareth to doe what he may. Truely ſaid the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> you ſpeake the very truth, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7181:173"/>
I am very glad that I haue learned ſo much of you. Goe to, ſweare to me the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obey my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement. The which <hi>Quedragant</hi> did. But the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> called his Eſquires to witneſſe, and then ſayd: I will that at your departure from hence, you goe vnto the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> from whence you ſhal not depart, vntill the ſame <hi>Amadis</hi> (that you ſeeke bee there arriued. Then you ſhall yeelde your ſelfe vnto his mercy, pardoning him for the death of your brother King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for that as I haue heard, they both of their owne free will challenged each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had Combate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as this reuenge ought not to bee purſued. Moreouer I will that you giue ouer the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that you haue made againſt the King, and thoſe that ſerue him, without bearing armes heereafter againſt any one of them. All which conditions <hi>Quedragant</hi> promiſed to performe, although it was to his great griefe. Then he commanded his Eſquires to prepare a litter for him, to carry him vnto <hi>London,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe. In like ſort the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> hauing ſeazed vpon the horſe of <hi>Quedragant,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of his owne that was dead, deliuered his ſhield vnto <hi>Enil,</hi> and followed on his way: vpon the which hee behelde foure young Gentlewomen that were flying with a Marlin, who had both ſeene the Combate, and heard all the talke of the two Knights: and for the ſame cauſe, they ſpake vnto the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> earneſtly entreating to come and lodge in their Caſtle, where hee ſhould bee entertained with all the honor that might bee deuiſed, for King <hi>Liſuart</hi> his ſake, vnto whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice hee had ſhewed himſelfe ſo affectionate. The which offer of theirs hee refuſed not, for hee was weary with the great trauail he had ſuſtained al the day. And as ſoon as he was come into his lodging, they themſelues vnarmed him, to ſee if hee were in any ſort dangerouſly wounded: but hee had no other hurt then that vpon his breſt, which was a matter of nothing. Three whole daies together did the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> tarry there, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, riding all day long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding any aduenture, and the night following he lodged in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Inne that ſtood on the way, from whence he departed the next morning very early, and about mid-day hee came vnto the top of a ſmall hill, from whence he might behold the citty of <hi>London,</hi> and the caſtle of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> where his Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> remained.</p>
                  <p>Heere withall he was ſurpriſed with exceeding ioy. neuertheleſſe, hee fained as though he knew not the Countrey where hee remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and demanded of <hi>Enil</hi> if he did know it. Yea very well, my Lord, anſwered <hi>Enil,</hi> beholde yonder is the citie of <hi>London</hi> where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> at this preſent remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. In faith, ſaide the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> I would be very ſorry that either he or any other ſhould know mee, vntill my deedes deſerue it, and that by my deedes of Armes I might be thought worthy to be in ſuch an aſſembly. Therefore goe thou to ſee the Eſquire <hi>Gandalin,</hi> from whom <hi>Durin</hi> did of late bring the commendations: and ſee that thou doeſt wiſely enquire what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ſaith of me, as lſo when the battaile of King <hi>Cildadan</hi> ſhall be performed. What? anſwered <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nil,</hi> ſhall I leaue you all alone? Care not thou for that, ſayd he, I haue beene many times accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7181:173"/>
to go in that ſort: yet before that thou doeſt depart, let vs eſpy together a fit place where thou maiſt find meat thy returne. Then they rode on a little further, when vpon a ſudden they beheld cloſe by the ſide of a riuer two pauilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons armed, &amp; in the midſt of them a moſt faire tent. Before the which were many knights &amp; Ladies ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ten other knights armed for their guard: and there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a pauillion that had not fiue ſhields hanged vp, and as many Lances ſtanding before it. Here-withall the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> fearing to bee diſturbed of his enterpriſe, would auoid the combate &amp; took his way vpon the left hand. The which the knights perceiuing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto him, ſaying, that he muſt needes giue one ſtroke with the Launce for the loue of the Ladies. But he anſwered them that at that inſtant hee had no deſire thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For ſayd he, you are freſh and many, and I alone, and very wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Beleeue me ſayd one of them, I thinke rather that you feare to loſe your horſe. And why ſhould I loſe him ſayd the <hi>Faire Forlorne.</hi> Becauſe ſayd the knight, hee muſt haue him that doth throwe you downe, &amp; I am ſure that your loſſe were more certaine then the gaine that you ſhould get vpon vs. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo, anſwered hee, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depart, then come into any ſuch danger, which ſaid, he paſſed on. Truly ſayd the knights, in our iudgements your armes are defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more with faire wordes then valiant deeds, ſo that they may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee ſound enough to place o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your Tombe when you are dead, yea although you ſhould liue one hundred yeares and more. You may thinke of mee what you pleaſe anſwered the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> yet cannot that in any ſort demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my reputation. I would it were your pleaſure, ſayd one that ſtepped ſomewhat before his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that you would breake one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one ſtaffe with mee, I would be accounted a traytor, or not in one whole yeare to mount vpon a horſe, if you departed not by and by to ſeeke your lodging without yours. Sir anſwered hee, it is that which I doe feare, and which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mee to turue out of the high way. At this they all began to laugh, and to ſcoffe him ſaying, behold the valiant champion, that ſpareth himſelfe againſt a battaile: yet for all this the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> made no account, but followed on his way vntill he came vnto a riuer ſide, but as hee would haue paſſed ouer, he heard a voyce that cryed: ſtay knight, ſtay.

ſhould finde him at his returne from <hi>London.</hi> And as they were in this ſorte diſcourſing together, they perceiued vpon the ſame way a cart which was drawne with twelue horſes and guided by two Dwarffes, within the which were many armed knights inchained, their ſhields were hanged all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſides thereof, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them were Ladies &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen that cryed out, &amp; wept moſt pitifully: before whom mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a Gyant armed with plates of fine ſteele, hauing vpon his head a marueilous bright ſhining helme. But hee ſeemed to bee ſo great, that it would haue feared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to behold him, &amp; he rode vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mighty black horſe, holding in his right hand a Bore-ſpeare, the head whereof was more then a cubit in length, and there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (behinde the cart) another Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant farre more monſtrous then the firſt, of whom the Damoſels of the fountaine were ſo much afraid, as they fled to hide them amongſt the buſhes. At the ſame inſtant the Gyant which marched before (ſeeing how the Ladies that were in the cart did teare the hairs from their heads, for it ſeemed by their furious behauiours, that they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly would haue procured their owne death) ſayde vnto the Dwarffes, If you cauſe not theſe girles to hold their peace, by loue you villaines, I will make a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand peeces of your entrails, for I would haue them charily kept, to ſacrifice them vnto the God that I adore. When the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> heard him, hee preſently knewe that it was <hi>Famongomad,</hi> who was wont to cut off the heads of all thoſe that hee might take, and to ſhed their blood before an Idoll that hee had in the burning lake, by whoſe counſell hee was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all his affaires, &amp; although hee then had no deſire to fight, as well becauſe he would not faile to be at <hi>Mirefleur</hi> (according as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> had willed him) as alſo becauſe he was wearie, and tyred with the encounter that he had had againſt the ten knights, yet knowing the perſons that were in the cart, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom was <hi>Leonor</hi> the Kings daughter, her Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the ten knights that hee had ouerthrowne, hee determined either to die or deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what grief the loſſe of her ſiſter would be vnto <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongomad</hi> and his ſonne did take at vnawares, and all the reſt of her traine, in a manner as ſoone as the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> had left them, and in this ſort they had bound and fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them in the cart, that they might afterwards moſt cruelly put them to death. For this cauſe hee willed <hi>Enil</hi> to giue him his armes. My Lord ſayd he, doe you not ſee theſe diuels that are comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs? For Gods ſake let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone and hide vs from them, then may you arme your ſelfe at eaſe, for I would not tarry their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for all the wealth in <hi>London.</hi> I will doe better if I may, ſayd the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> I will firſt try my fortune, and although thou doeſt thinke them diuels) thou ſhalt ſee them ſlaine by one onely knight: for their life is ſo odious before God, that hee will giue mee the ſtrength to reuenge (as I hope) all thoſe miſerable cruelties which they from day to day doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
                  <p>Alas my Lord ſayde <hi>Enil,</hi> you will wilfully loſe your ſelfe: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if twenty of King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> his beſt Knights had vnder-taken that which you alone thinke

to doe, yet might they hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape with honor. Care not thou for that, anſwered hee, if I ſhould let ſuch an aduenture paſſe before mine eyes, and not bee an actor therein, I were vnworthy euer to come into the company of good and vertuous men, and therefore whatſoeuer may chance thereof, I care not. This ſaid, he left <hi>Enil</hi> wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and went vnto that ſide where he might eaſily beholde <hi>Mirefleur:</hi> becauſe the remembrance of <hi>Oaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was ſtill preſent before him, and he bagan to ſay. O my Lady and onely hope, neuer did I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe any aduenture, the which I haue not by your means atchiued: and now that I knowe you are ſo neere vnto mee, and that it is for a thing that ſo much importeth you, forſake mee not I pray you, in this extreamity. Herewithall he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that his ſtrength was redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and ſetting apart all feare, hee went toward the cart, and ſaid vnto the Dwarffes: ſtay you baſe ſlaues, for you ſhall all die, and your mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters alſo.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with the great rage that hee felt, hee roſe vp, and with both his hands hee pulled forth the troun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon of the Launce that ſtucke in his body, and threw it at the <hi>Faire-Forlorne</hi> with ſuch extreame fury, that hee thought to haue ouer-throwne him, and ſo greatly did he ſtraine himſelfe to hurle the ſame, that the tripes came out of his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he tumbled ouer and ouer.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his hart was ſo great, that hee roſe vp againe and drew forth his ſword, that was maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous long, with the which he layed at the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> with all his ſtrength, and hee ſtrained himſelfe ſo much, that the blood iſſued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wounds, in ſuch great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that all his ſtrength fayled him, and he fel down together with his blow, which lighted vpon the ſtones, wherewith the ſword brake in two pieces. The which the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> perceiuing, hee ſtepped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and ſet his hands vnto the bill in ſuch ſort, that by force hee pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it out of his ſhield, wherewith he ſtroke ſo great a blow vpon the Giants helmet, that he made it flie from his head: but the Giant with that little remainder of his ſword, that hee yet helde, pared away the top of his helmet, together with a little of the skin and haire of his head, the which blow if he had ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſomewhat lower, hee had cut his head off.

reſt of the company. Now had the Giants tyed all their horſes at the tayle of the Cart: wherefore the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> went to ſeeke out the Princeſſe her Palfrey, the which he brought, and mounted her vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame, commanding all the reſt to take euery one their owne horſe, and to get them to <hi>London,</hi> and to carrie vnto king <hi>Liſuart</hi> the bodies of the two Giants, and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigant</hi> his horſe, which will ſerue him well in the battaile againſt king <hi>Cildadan.</hi> But the Knights an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, ſir who ſhall wee ſay hath done this good for vs? you ſhall tell the king ſaid he, that it is a ſtrange knight, who is called the <hi>faire Forlorne:</hi> and you may both declare vnto him at large the cauſe of the combat that I had with the Giants, as alſo the great deſire that I haue to doe his Maieſty all the ſeruice I may, whether it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt king <hi>Cildadan</hi> or any other, herewithall they layed both the bodies in the Cart: but they were ſo great, that their legs trayled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vpon the ground more then ſix foote, and taking leaue of the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> they went towardes <hi>London,</hi> praiſing God, and the good knight that preſerued them from death. But by the way <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> and the yong Gentlewomen that were with her (forgeting their paſſed perill) made them garlands of flours which they ſet vpon their heads in entring into the Citty: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people wondring to ſee the Giants, followed the Cart euen vnto the caſtle, to vnderſtand who had done ſuch valiant deedes of armes. The king did already know that his daughter was arriued, and how ſhee brought with her two dead Giants, wherefore he went downe into the Court with the Queen, and many knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen with them, to ſee what the matter was: the which the Princeſſe <hi>Leonor</hi> recited vnto him, together with all that you haue already heard, whereat euery one wondred.

And the king ſaid, in good faith, I doe greatly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile what he may be: but is there none of you that doe know him. And it was anſwered him no: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Coriſanda</hi> Lady and friend to <hi>Don Floreſtan</hi> had found in the poore Rock (as heretofore ſhe had declared vnto many) a ſick knight that was named the <hi>faire Forlorne.</hi> I would ſaid the king, that he were in this company, beleeue mee that he ſhould not depart from vs, for any thing that hee would demand of me.</p>

My good Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, this is not the firſt day that you haue knowne how much I am yours. I beleeue you well ſir, but my Lady would haue you wholly to her ſelfe. Alas, ſaid ſhe haue I not reaſon, ſeeing that I alone was likely by my fault, to haue beene the cauſer of his loſſe? Beleeue me deere friend, the griefe which you felt and the teeres that you haue ſhed (by the fault that I commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſhall be now both acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and thorowly recompenced. Madam, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> you haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer been at any time, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of all my happineſſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, and if I haue felt any tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I, and not you, haue been the cauſer thereof: therefore haue I iuſtly ſuſtained, whatſoeuer ſorrow I haue ſuffered. Alas ſweete loue, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> when I thinke vpon the eſtate wherein <hi>Coriſanda</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> did finde you, and the abundance of teares and lamentations that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſtilled from your eyes (as they haue told me) I aſſure you that yet my mind is troubled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Madam, ſaid hee, the teares wherof you ſpeake, were no teares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for long before the comming of <hi>Coriſanda</hi> to the poore Rock, the ſpring whereof was dried vp: but it was an humor proceeding from my heart, the which did ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually burne in your loue, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtrained by the force of the flame, it did draw vp to the eyes that moyſture, which nature had placed about the heart to preſerue it, and to giue it life: and I beeleue that if the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> had ſtayed from bringing me that reliefe which I receiued of her, in ſteede of teares which diſtilled from mine eyes, the ſoule it ſelfe had departed. Sweete loue, ſaid the Princeſſe, I know well that I committed a great errour in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that letter which <hi>Durin</hi> did bring to you, but you ſhould then haue remembred how that all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are weake, and very light of beleefe, eſpecially in things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are affectioned, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by too extreame loue they are often times carried away, &amp; made ſuſpitious, euen as I haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, wherefore the greater that mine offence is, the greater praiſe ſhall you win in pardoning me: the which I beſeech you to do,

being ready to receiue ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment therefore, as it ſhall pleaſe you to giue vnto me, and to ſatisfie you at your owne diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Alas Madam, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> it is I that ſhould demand pardon of you: for if I ſhould die for your loue, moſt pleaſant would that death be vnto me. But this much I aſſure you, that I had neuer beene able to haue reſiſted this great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that I haue ſuffered, had it not beene that my martiredome was eaſed (knowing the pleaſure which you would receiue in the ſame) that it tooke ſuch force vnto it, as death was not of ſufficient power in any ſort to bring it to an end. Let vs leaue off this talke for this time ſaid <hi>Mabila,</hi> you haue both ſuffered wrong, determine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore henceforth how it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed: and now to eſchue the vapours of the night (which may be vnto you ſomewhat hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) let vs retire vnto ſome couert.

Alas ſaid he, they haue hitherto been the cauſe of my life, and now ſince they haue farther aſſiſted me do you thinke that they will deſire my death? Aſſure you Madam that they are already ſo well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with our affections (eſpecially the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke)</hi> that although they haue not ſeen them effected, yet it mny be they haue preſumed as much and more: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech you (in acquiting you of your promiſe) to ſuccour me. Which ſaid, hee gaue ſuch large ſcope vnto his paſſions, that notwithſtanding all the faint reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that <hi>Oriana</hi> could make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, hee had that of her which he moſt deſired, taſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the ſweete fruit, which they did firſt ſow in the Forreſt, at ſuch time as <hi>Gandalin</hi> was gone to ſeeke for ſome victuals for them: as you haue heard in the firſt booke. And although that <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> made refuſal thereof at the firſt, yet <hi>Amadis</hi> vſed her ſo courteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7181:177"/>
that before they departed from the place, they determined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their ſport, whilſt they had ſo good oportunity, and from thenceforth not to bee in any doubt eyther of <hi>Mabila</hi> or the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> Eight whole dayes did <hi>Amadis</hi> remaine at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refleur</hi> with <hi>Oriana,</hi> leading a life as pleaſantly as they could wiſh, during all the which time he was not ſeene of any, except of thoſe that were the meanes of his bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, as it hath beene tolde you, for all the day long hee was cloſe with the Ladies in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and when the euening appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched they came forth into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where often times after many amorous diſcourſes, <hi>Amadis</hi> alay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heate of his fire (by the ſweete embracings of <hi>Oriana)</hi> at the muſick of the birds, who chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out their pleaſant notes, were witneſſes of the pleaſure that theſe two louers receiued, vnder the ſhade of the little young Trees, wherewith this place was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſtored. Now did <hi>Gandalin</hi> euery day go and come from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to <hi>Mireflure,</hi> to bring newes, from the Court: ſo that one time amongſt others, hee told <hi>Amadis</hi> that the Armour which by <hi>Enil</hi> he had cauſed to bee made for him, would bee very ſhortly finiſhed. Moreouer hee told him, that the King was in great doubt for the battaile which he had enterpriſed againſt king <hi>Cildadan:</hi> for the moſt part of thoſe that hee had to deale withall, were cruell Giants, and without reaſon, and therefore hee had ſtayed <hi>Galaor, Floreſtan, Agrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> and <hi>Don Galuanes,</hi> to aſſiſt him in that encounter. Who (ſaid <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin)</hi> are ſo angry for the famous report that is ſpread abroad, of the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> to the diſprayſe of <hi>Amadis,</hi> as if they had not already paſſed their promiſe to the king, ſeeking not to enterpriſe any combat or voyage before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, they had beene already vpon their way to haue ſought him out to fight with him, and they ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue it out, that if they doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape aliue, they will not reſt vntil they haue both found him, and fought with him. In good faith, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> they ſhall ſee me the ſooner if God pleaſe, but it ſhal be after another manner then they hope for: wherefore do thou returne to the Court, and I arne if any thing hath ſince happened. Herewithall <hi>Gandalin</hi> departed, who went directly to <hi>London,</hi> where hee found the king ready to ſit downe to dinner, and euen as they were taking vp the Table, there entred in a very antient Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, attended vpon with two Eſquires, apparrelled both in one liuery. This old mans beard was ſhauen, and the hayre of his head was white with age, who came and kneeled before the king, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in the Greeke tongue (in which countrie he was borne) hee ſaid vnto him. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, the high renowne that is ſpread in all parts of the world, of the knights, Ladies and Gentle-women that are in your Court, hath beene the only cauſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced me to addreſſe my iourney hither, to ſee if in the ſame I may finde that which this threeſcore yeeres I haue ſought in diuerſe countries farre and neere, to ſmall purpoſe. Therefore moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prince. I beſeech your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to be pleaſed, that to finiſh my trauaile, I may make a proofe of the knights, Ladies and Gentle-women in this aſſembly, the which (as I thinke) will neyther be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7181:178"/>
nor diſpleaſing eyther to your Maieſty, or to any other. Then all the Lords that were preſent, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſee a thing ſo rare, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the king to grant his requeſt, the which he eaſily condiſcended vnto, therewithall the ancient Gentleman tooke from one of his Eſquires, a little cofer of Iaſper, which he did carrie, which was in length about three cubits, and in breadth a ſhaftmont, and it was garniſhed with Gold, and the moſt curious damaske worke in the World: this little cofer he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, afterward he tooke out of it a Sword, ſo ſtrange, as the like was neuer ſeene, the ſcabberd ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was made of two bright ſhining bones, and as greene as any fine Emeraud, ſo as the blade was to be ſeene through it, not after the manner of other blades, for the one halfe of it ſhewed meruailous bright, and the other ſeemed, as if it burned, being as red as fire, and it hanged in a Belt of the ſame ſtuffe as the ſcabberd was of, ſo cunningly made, that any man might eaſily gird it about him. This Sword the Gentleman did hang about his necke, that hee might likewiſe take out of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a kercheif, the one halfe where-of, was be ſet with floures as freſh and greene, as if they had beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then newly gathered: and the other halfe was couered with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther violets, as withered and dry, as if they had beene ten yeeres in the Sun, neuertheleſſe both the one &amp; the other ſeemed to ſpring from one and the ſelfe ſame roote: wherewithal the king being abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, demanded of him how theſe things might bee. If it like your maieſty anſwered the old man, this ſword cannot bee drawne forth of the ſcabbard, but onely by that knight that amongſt all louers, is the moſt conſtant, and that doth beſt loue his Lady: and as ſoone as hee ſhall haue it in his hands, that part which burneth ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as cleere and bright as the reſt, ſo as the blade ſhall bee all of one colour. In like ſort if this kerchiefe beſtrewed with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny flowers, be ſet vpon the head of ſuch a Ladie or Gentlewoman that doth loue her husband or friend with the like conſtantneſſe, the withered and drie floures ſhall appeare againe, of a moſt freſh and liuely colour: and your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty may be pleaſed to know, that I cannot be made a Knight, but by the hands of this perfect louer that ſhall draw forth this Sword, neyther may I take armes but of her that ſhall deſerue this pretious kercheife. For this cauſe haue I theſe threeſcore yeeres continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought in many ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries for thoſe by whom I ought to receiue knight-hood, but yet hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I haue trauailed in vaine, &amp; now proſecuting my voyage (in a manner for my laſt refuge) I am come into your Court imagining that euen as it farre exceedeth the Courts of all other Emperors and kings, ſo I might in like ſort in the ſame find that which in all others I haue failed of. I pray you ſaide the king, let mee know the reaſon why the fire that remaines in the one halfe of this blade, doth not burne the ſcabbard. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwered the olde man, betwixt <hi>Tartaria</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> there is an arme of the Sea which is ſo hot, that the water thereof (beeing meruailous greene) boiles as if it were vpon the fire, and in the ſame there is brought forth a kinde of Serpents more great then <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> the which doe flie very
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7181:178"/>
lightly, by reaſon of their long wings, but they are ſo infectious, that euery one ſhun them ſo much as they poſſible may. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding when a man findeth any one of them hee eſteemeth of him as a thing much worth, becauſe they are profitable for diuerſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and theſe Serpents haue a bone that reacheth from the neck to the tayle, the which is ſo great, that vpon the ſame is formed al the whole body which is greene, as you ſee by this ſcabberd, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, for as much as they are bred vp (as I haue ſaid) in this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſea, no heate of any other fire may hurt them. Thus hath your Maieſty heard the ſtrangeneſſe of this ſword, and of the ſcabberd, now I will tell you of the floures of this kertchiefe. In the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of <hi>Tartarie,</hi> there is alſo an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland enuironed with the moſt ſtrange and dangerous gulfe that is in any part of all the Sea. By meanes whereof (although the floures of theſe two branches, are rare &amp; pretious) yet there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo valiant that dare goe to gather them: but if it ſo chance, that any one be ſo madde as to aduenture himſelfe therein, and if hee may bring them away, aſſure your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, he ſelleth them at as great a price as he pleaſeth: for amongſt other ſingular vertues that they haue, this is one, that whoſoeuer doth charily keepe them, they doe neuer leaue their greeneneſſe, and liuely colour, as you may behold in this kertchiefe. And ſeeing that I haue declared vnto you the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of theſe Iewels, it may pleaſe your Maieſty likewiſe to vnderſtand who I am, and after what ſort I came by theſe thinges. I beleeu that you haue many times heard ſpeaking of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> who in his time, was one of the beſt Princes of the Earth, he it was that did beautifie the firme Iſland, with many rare and ſingular things, as euery one knoweth, my Father was his Brother, and king of <hi>Ganor</hi> who being in loue with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the king of <hi>Canonia,</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get me of her. And when I was of ſufficient age to bee made knight, my father commanded me, ſeeing I had been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued with far more perfect and loyall loue, then euer was any other prince, that I would not in like ſort receiue knight-hood, but by the hand of the moſt faithful louer that might be found in all the World, neyther to take armes, but from that Lady, or Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell who ſhould loue her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or friend, with the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy as the knight doth.

Thus the old man hauing ended his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, there was not any that were preſent, who did not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſire to ſee the matter in proofe: and although the king was as deſirous to ſee the triall there-of as any other, yet did he defer it off vntil the fift day following, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the which day, was the feaſt of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> to be celebrated, and the more to make it manifeſt, he ſent for a great number of his knights. For the more full my Court is (ſaid the king) the more is the likely-hood to haue this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture throughly tryed. Vnto the which determination euery one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed: all this diſcourſe did <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> heare, who by good fortu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e was not 1. houre before arriued at <hi>Lon.</hi> But ſo ſoone as the Concluſion was agreed vpon, he got againe to horſe-back and rode forthwith to <hi>Mireflure,</hi> where he found the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> playing at Cheſts with <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> who ſeeing him returne ſo ſuddainly, ſhee demanded of him what new euent was chanced in the Court.

By my faith, ſaid <hi>Mabila,</hi> your enterpriſe is great: but I haue a garment that my mother did lately ſend vnto me by the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> of the rareſt faſhion in the world, which will be fit for this purpoſe, and if it pleaſe my Lady, wee will preſently try it vpon her, herewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al they went for it, which being brought, ſhe and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> apparelled her there-with, after ſo ſtrange a manner, that they all began to laugh, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princeſſe ſo diſguiſed, and whatſoeuer the <hi>faira Forlorne</hi> had before determined to doe, they thought might now be very eaſily performed. Whereupon they forth-with commanded <hi>Gandalin</hi> to go buy ſome faire Palfrey for <hi>Oriana:</hi> and that hee ſhould not faile to bring him to the end of the Caſtle wall of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> the night before the trial of theſe Iewels was to be performed, and further that he ſhould aduertiſe <hi>Durin</hi> to bring his horſe the ſame euening into that place where hee firſt alighted when hee entred into the garden.

So the Damoſell departed, and returned not vntill it was very late, for ſhee ſtayed the arriuall of the Queene <hi>Briolania,</hi> to meet with whom the king himſelfe did go, and ſhe came into the court with one hundred knights, ready to begin the ſearch of <hi>Amadis,</hi> according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and therefore ſhe was determined not to depart from Queene <hi>Briſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> vntil they were returned again, neyther would ſhe nor her women bee apparrelled with other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then of black cloth, vntill he were found, for ſuch weeds did ſhe weare at ſuch time as hee did make her Queene, and now would ſhee neuer change her manner of life, if he were loſt.

My Lord, ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> I am well aſſured that the kerchiefe ſhall make you beleeue, that what wrong ſoeuer you receiued of me, proceeded of no other cauſe, but by the extreame loue which I did beare vnto you: we ſhall ſee ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> what will happen.

In this ſort did <hi>Oriana,</hi> and the teſt of her company paſſe away the time, vntill the day came wherein they muſt depart, to make triall of that which you haue heard, which cauſed her to riſe about midnight, attiring her as the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> had deuiſed, and hee likewiſe was armed at all points, that done they paſſed through the garden, and came to the place where <hi>Gandalin</hi> held their horſes in readines. Then mounted they vpon them, taking their way toward the Forreſt, right vnto the Fountaine of the three channels. But there <hi>Oriana</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the enterpriſe which ſhe went about, foreſeeing the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience and danger thereof, not onely if ſhe were diſcloſed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo how if ſhe failed in gaining the kerchiefe, <hi>Amadis</hi> might haue iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect her, and by that meanes ſhe might looſe that good reputation which ſhee had gotten with him.

I beſeech you ſweete loue not to take any heede vnto the feare that a timerous woman may haue in the middeſt of this great wood, but vnto the vertue and valor that remaineth in you. Very ſorry was the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> becauſe hee had ſpoken in ſuch ſort vnto her, doubting leſt he had offended her, and he ſaid vnto her.

As they had ended their conference, they came vnto the fountaine being yet an houre from day, where they had not long ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before <hi>Enil</hi> came vnto them, whereat they were very ioyfull. Then the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> ſaide vnto <hi>Oriana:</hi> Madame, behold the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquire which I promiſed you to ſend vnto king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> by whoſe anſwere we may determin what to do.

All the better ſaid the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> wee ſhall then haue no great cauſe of ſtay. Hereupon hee gaue him his ſhield and launce, and without putting off his Helmet at all, they tooke the right way to <hi>London:</hi> the people had already heard that the knight which did ouercome the Giants ſhould come vnto the kings lodging, they ſaid one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: Heauens ſhield the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> from all miſchiefe, for he is worthy of great praiſe, and moſt happy may that Lady thinke her ſelfe, to whom he remaineth a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. Theſe words might <hi>Oriana</hi> vnderſtand very well, wherewith ſhe was not a little ioyfull, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe was Lady &amp; Miſtris of him, whom ſo many people did both loue &amp; honor: afterward they came and alighted at the Palace: where they found the king, Queen Ladies, and a great number of

knights already aſſembled all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a great hal, to make trial who ſhould gaine the old mans Iewels. And as ſoon as they knew of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall of the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> the King roſe vp with his traine to receiue them: wherefore the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> kneeling down would haue kiſſed his hands: but the K. lifted him vp, ſaying vnto him: My good friend, you are moſt hartily welcome hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where you ſhall be as free as you would wiſh, for you haue done as much ſeruice for me, in ſo ſmall a time, as euer any knight perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either for King or Prince. The <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> anſwered not one word, but onely bowed himſelfe to his maieſtie in ſigne of thankes: and without ſtepping one foote from <hi>Oriana,</hi> (whom he held by the hand) they came towards the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who did all ſalute them very courteouſly. You may imagine if the young Princeſſe were not now in ſome feare to be diſcouered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch an aſſembly, for the Queene her mother ſtepped vnto her, looking her ſtedfaſtly in the face, although it was couered with a laune, and ſhe ſaid vnto her.

For the which the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> humbly thanked her Maieſtie, but <hi>Oriana</hi> without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one word held her head down continually. Therewithall the king and all his knights withdrew them to one ſide, and the Queene and her Ladies to the other. And in the meane time the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> leading <hi>Oriana</hi> by the hand, came and beſeeched the King, that he and his Lady might remaine in the midſt of the hall, for they were not determined to touch the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, except that all the aſiſtance did firſt miſſe the gaining of them. The which the king did grant vnto him, who did firſt of all take vp the ſword, which was layd vpon the table by the olde Gentleman na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Macandon:</hi> and the King did draw it out one ſhaftmont and no more. Wherefore <hi>Macandon</hi> ſaid.

There-withall he took the ſword and laid it again vpon the table, for ſo muſt he doe after euery triall. Then <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> tooke it vp, but yet he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med leſſe then the King did. The which <hi>Floreſtan, Galuanes, Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Brandoinas</hi> and <hi>Landin</hi> ſeeing, they all one after another tryed what they could doe, and yet none of them could vnſheath it ſo much as <hi>Floreſtan</hi> did, who drew it ſorth a foote and more: but then <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> the penſiue tooke it, and he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Floreſtan</hi> about halfe a foote, ſo that hee came vnto the middeſt thereof.

You ſay true anſwered <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonis:</hi> but if you be this day made knight, you ſhall not be of ſo yong yeeres but that you may very well remember it hereafter. At that word euery one began to laugh, in the meane ſeaſon there was neuer a knight remaining in the Court who did not put himſelfe forward to gaine the ſword, and yet it was all in vaine. Wherefore the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> holding <hi>Oriana</hi> by the hand, came to take it vp: when <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candon</hi> ſaid vnto him: knight this ſword wil fit you better (if you may gain it) then that which you haue, &amp; yet it cannot be gotten by force of Armes without conſtancy in loue. It muſt then be mine anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> who there-withall did draw it forth of the ſcabbard as eaſily as if it had beene his owne, and that part of it, which ſeemed to be burning, became like vnto the other, and was as bright as euer was ſeene.</p>
                  <p>Therewithall <hi>Macandon</hi> (excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioyfull) caſt himſelfe, at the feete of the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> ſaying, vnto him, O noble knight, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy honour: for in ending my long trauaile you haue greatly honoured this Court. And truly that Lady who is ſerued of you, hath cauſe to loue you well, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſhe be the moſt miſchieuous &amp; diſſoyalſt woman in the world. Now therefore do me this fauour (if it pleaſe you) as to giue me the order of knighthood, for by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then you, may I obtaine it, nor yet enioy the ſignory which of right belongeth vnto me ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great perſonages. Cauſe firſt a triall of the Kerchiefe to be made, anſwered the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward I will performe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I ought to do vnto you. Then girded he the ſword vnto his ſide, leauing his owne for him that would take it vp, and returned to the place from whence hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Great was the praiſe that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue vnto him: but more great was the emulation of <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> towards him, concluding in their minds that ſo ſoone as the battell againſt king <hi>Cildadan</hi> was finiſhed (if they thence eſcaped with life) they would preſently ſeeke him out, and chalenge him to the combat, wherin they would die, or elſe make it knowne vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that their brother <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> was a far better knight then he, who (as they thought) did eclipſe his honor, by the reputation whch he had gotten in gaining the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſword. At that inſtant the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies approched to proue which of them might obtaine the Kerchiefe, and firſt of all the Queene began, putting it vpon her head: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the floures did not any whit change their colour for her: Whereupon <hi>Macandon</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:7181:182"/>
ſaid, Madam if the king your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band haue ſhewed the little loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that remaineth in him, in his triall of the ſword, me thinks you do now well enough requite him for it. The Queene bluſhed and being halfe aſhamed ſhe returned to her place: then came the faire Queen <hi>Briolania,</hi> who therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as much as the firſt. Vnto whom <hi>Macandon</hi> likewiſe ſaid. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me Madam, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>idering the great beauty wherewith you are indued, you are more beloued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> louing, as wee may plainely ſee by this kerchief. After her came foure kings daughters, meruailous faire <hi>Eludia, Eſtreletta, Aldena,</hi> and the ſage <hi>Oliada,</hi> vpon whoſe heads the kerchiefe being placed, the withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red floures began a little to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſo that there was not any one of them which did not imagine that ſhe ſhould be the owner there-of, wherwith <hi>Oriana</hi> was in a great perplexity. Yet in the end the floures returned to their withered colour. And for the ſame cauſe the Gentlewomen ſet them downe againe in their places: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it was not without receiuing ſome little frumpe from the olde Gentleman, who for one of his age could very fitly apply them. In the end <hi>Oriana</hi> perceiuing that euery one had failed, ſhee was very glad thereof, and therefore ſhe made a ſigne vnto the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> that he ſhould leade her to the Table, where the triall was to bee made, but ſo ſoone as the kerchiefe was ſet vpon her head the blaſted floures were as greene and as faire as thoſe that were moſt freſh, ſo that there was no difference at all to be perceiued. Wherefore <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candon</hi> cried out: Ah Madam, you are ſhee whom I haue ſought for fortie yeeres before you were borne, now ſaid he to the <hi>faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> I pray you ſir deferre not the honour which is by you two due vnto me: but if you pleaſe (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready I haue intreated you) make me knight, then of this faire Lady (according as I am bound) I will receiue my Armes. Let it be then preſently ſaid the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> for I am not to tarry long here. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Macandon</hi> cauſed forthwith his Armour to be brought, where-with he was preſently armd puting it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his white coate according as new knights are wont to doe, then the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> laying his ſword vpon his ſhoulder, and faſtning on his right ſpurre, gaue him his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Oriana</hi> girded on his Sword which was in like ſort brought by his Eſquires. Which ceremony being finiſhed, the Gentlewomen beholding him in that order, would in ſome ſort bee reuenged for the flouts which he had giuen them, and therefore they all burſt into a laughter, eſpecially <hi>Aldena,</hi> who ſpake ſo loud that all might heare her.</p>
                  <p>Behold the countenance of this faire Lad how like a young knight hee looketh: Surely wee ought all to reioyce, becauſe hee ſhal all his life long ſeeme as freſh and luſty as now he is. How know you that, anſwered <hi>Eſtreletta?</hi> By his apparrell ſaid ſhe, which ſhall euen laſt as long as hee. Faire Gentlewomen ſaid <hi>Macandon,</hi> I would not change my pleaſure for the beſt of your fauours: and if I am not ſo youthfull as you ſay, yet am I not therefore to bee tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med leſſe diſcreete, but as for you who are yet yong and fooliſh, it were good that you learne to bee more aduiſed and modeſt then you are. This anſwere of his pleaſed the King very well, who in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7181:183"/>
no ſort liked of the gentlewomens ſpeeches. Whilſt theſe thinges were in doing, the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> was ready to depart, when the Queene who knew not her owne daughter, ſaid vnto her, Gentle-woman although you are not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be knowne in this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet bethinke you what it will pleaſe you to command either of the king or me. By my faith, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> I am as little acquainted with her as you, although ſhee hath beene ſeauen daies together in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but for that little that I haue perceiued by her, I can aſſure you that ſhee is moſt excellent faire. Truſt me faire Lady, ſaid <hi>Briolania</hi> (ſpeaking vnto <hi>Oriana)</hi> I know not your name, but conſidering the loyaltie wherewith you are endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if your friend doe affect you with the like conſtancy as you doe loue him, you may well bee tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the faireſt couple that euer loue vnited together. <hi>Oriana</hi> ſmiled at the words of <hi>Briolania,</hi> when the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> tooke his leaue, who ſeeing that the King would leade her towards her horſe he ſaid vnto him. Your Maieſty hath reaſon to honour her, by whom your Court hath this day beene more highly exalted, then euer heretofore by any other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it hath beene. In good ſooth anſwered the king, you ſay true, and therefore I will my ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her forth of the Citty, in the which I could willingly deſire that it would pleaſe her, (and you alſo) to make ſome longer abode. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, they all mounted on horſe-back, and the king held the raines of his daughters horſe, ſpeaking all the way vnto her, who anſwered him not one word againe, fearing to bee knowne. <hi>Galaor</hi> in like ſort entertained the <hi>faire Forlorne.</hi> But he ſo much hated him for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before rehearſed, that hee could not ſpeake one courteous word vnto him, whereat the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> laughed ſeeing his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers countenance, and thus they rode together a good way from the citty, vntill the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> ſaid vnto the King: I beſeech your Maieſty (if it pleaſe you) to paſſe no further, otherwiſe you may chance to diſpleaſe this Gentle-woman, beleeue me ſaid the King, I will rather returne. Therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he embraced him, and ſaid, I would ſir knight that it liked you, to be one of my knights. If it pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwered he, I will willingly bee one of the hundred that ſhall accompany you againſt king <hi>Cildadan.</hi> If you do me that fauour ſaid the king, I hope that thereby our enemies would be no leſſe diſcouraged then thoſe on our part would be encouraged, &amp; therefore I intreate you ſo to bee. Thus they departed, the king ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his way back to the citty, and the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> with <hi>Oriana</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Forreſt, being very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that they had ſo well finiſhed that dangerous aduenture.

And where is <hi>Arcalaus?</hi> Anſwered the <hi>faire Forlorne.</hi> The Eſquire ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him where hee ſate vnder a tuft of Trees, together with another

When <hi>Oriana</hi> heard this meſſage, the poore ſoule was in ſuch extreame feare, that ſhee was likely to haue fallen from her horſe, wherefore the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> ſaid vnto her.

Then he betook him to his armes, &amp; ſaid vnto the eſquire, go, return vnto thy maſter and tell him, that I am a ſtrange knight that knoweth him not, and therfore I will not do that. The eſquire returned to <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> who was ſo mad angry there-with, that hee ſaid vnto the other knight which was with him, good nephew <hi>Lindora<expan>

Therewithall <hi>Lindoraq</hi> went towards the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> who had heard all the words of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> whereupon hee came to meete him.

So <hi>Euil</hi> departed leauing <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Oriana</hi> together, who ſhortly after arriued at <hi>Mireflour,</hi> where they found <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Durin</hi> ſtaying without the garden walls, to take their horſes when they ſhould come: they came to helpe the Princeſſe down, and they told her that <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Demoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> were on the other ſide of the wall in the Orchard. Here-upon they rayſed vp a Luther, and <hi>Oriana</hi> mounted vpon it, whom the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> led by the hand, when they were at the top of the wall they beheld <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> lying faſt aſleepe vpon the graſſe, very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy with the feare that they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured all the day, leaſt matters ſhould not ſort to ſo good effect as they wiſhed.

I, but thanke our Teares (ſaid <hi>Mabila)</hi> by the which they were chiefely gotten. My Coſin ſaid the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> I will not ſtick to ſhedde for you as much blood, as you haue for mee done teares, whenſoeuer you haue neede of me, but I pray if you haue any thing to eate, bring it into my Ladies chamber, for we haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs good ſtomacks. Herewithal he led <hi>Oriana</hi> by the hand into the caſtle. Now becauſe wee will not digreſſe ouer far from that which happened to king <hi>Laſuart,</hi> we will leaue <hi>Oriana</hi> and her company at <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> to tell you what happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto his Maieſty and <hi>Galaor,</hi> as they returned from the <hi>faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> before they came back vnto the citty. For a yong Damoſell did meete them, who deliuered vnto each one of them a letter, ſent from <hi>Vrganda the Vnknowne,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying any other thing vnto them, ſhe turned her horſe toward that way from whence ſhee came. Wherefore the king opened his Letter which contayned this that enſueth. Vnto you <hi>Liſuart</hi> king of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſuch health &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe as beſeemeth your Royall Maieſty. I <hi>Vrganda the Vnknowne,</hi> your humble ſeruant, doe certifie you, that the battell which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed betwixt you and king <hi>Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadan</hi> ſhal be one of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and cruelleſt that euer was ſeene, in the which the <hi>faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> who hath newly giuen ſuch great hope vnto your Maieſty ſhal loſe his name, &amp; by one blow that he ſhall giue, all his valiant deedes ſhall be quite forgotten, and then ſhall you bee in the greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that euer you were: for many good knights ſhall loſe their liues, and you your ſelfe ſhal fall into the like danger, at that ſame inſtant when the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> ſhall draw blood from you, neuertheleſſe by three blowes which hee ſhall giue, thoſe on his ſide ſhall remaine conquerors.</p>
                  <p>And be your Maieſty aſſured that without doubt all this ſhal happen therfore prouide for al your affairs

with good aduiſe. After that the king had read this letter, although that he was a ſtout prince, valiant, and of a couragious heart, yet (knowing <hi>Vrganda</hi> worthie to bee beleeued in all her propheſies) he was afraid, doubting leaſt the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> in whom he moſt truſted, would reuolt vnto the ſide of the <hi>Ireland</hi> king, and knowing alſo what danger was likely to enſue, hee neuertheleſſe diſſembled the matter whatſoeuer he though ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And after hee had a long while muſed thereupon, he declared the whole circumſtance of it vnto <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> ſaying vnto him. My faithfull friend, I doe wholly determine to impart this ſecret vnto you, and to none other, that I may vnderſtand what is your aduiſe therein. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, if it like your Maieſty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, conſidering what <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> hath written vnto me, I haue more neede of counſell my ſelfe, then to counſell another, and if it were poſſible to conclude a peace betwixt you and the king of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana</hi> (prouided that your honour were not thereby to be impared) me thinks it ſhould be for the beſt, or at leaſt if that cannot be, it were good that you ſhould not bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the battaile. For I do ſee in this Letter two ſtrange accidents likely to fall out, the one is that the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> ſhal wound you ſo cruelly, that he ſhall ſhed your blood vpon the ground, and the other that by three blowes which he ſhall giue, thoſe on his ſide ſhal remaine conquerors, and by this aduertiſement it ſeemeth, that hee ſhall be againſt you. Truely ſaid the king I am ſo throughly aſſured of your good will that I know you doe faithfully and louingly aduiſe me, ſo as if my truſt were not in God (who hitherto hath beſtowed innumerable fauours vpon me, as in chuſing mee king ouer his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) or if I did not ſtedfaſtly belieue that no liuing man is able to with-ſtand his diuine determination, I ſhould haue great reaſon to bee in doubt, but you know that the hearts &amp; diſcretion of kings ought to bee anſwerable vnto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their eſtate and calling, endeauouring as well to preſerue their ſubiects in ſafety, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for their owne ſecurity. And therefore I determine to remit all into the hands of my God, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to endure whatſoeuer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he ſhal lay vpon me, for in him only remaineth the diſpoſition of things to come, for which cauſe my good friend, I aſſure you, that I will bee preſent in this battaile, for becauſe I would be partaker of all the good, honor, or hurt that may happen vnto thoſe which ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany me. Greatly did <hi>Galaor</hi> like of the kings magnanimous deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and anſwered him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me it is not for nothing that your Maieſty is eſtemed the moſt vertuous and valianteſt Prince of the world, and if all kings could as well repreſſe the counſell of thoſe who diſſwade them from their haughtie enterpriſes, none durſt be once ſo bold as to ſay any thing vnto them, but that which ſhould bee for their honour and glory, but now your Maieſty may bee pleaſed to ſee what <hi>Vrganda</hi> hath written vnto me. Herewithall he began to reade his Letter, wherein was contained this which enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>Vnto you <hi>Don Galaor</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> moſt valiant and hardie Knight, I <hi>Vrganda the Vnknowne,</hi> doe ſend all hearty ſalutations, as ſhe who both loueth and eſteemeth you, &amp; I will that you ſhould vnderſtand

that which muſt happen vnto you, in this cruell battell betweene the two kings, <hi>Liſuart</hi> and <hi>Cildadan.</hi> If you be there be you ſure that in the end thereof, your large and ſtrong members, ſhall want power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt your inuincible heart, &amp; at the departure from the Combat your head ſhall bee in his power, who with the three blowes that he ſhall ſtrike ſhall remaine conqueror. In faith ſaid the king, if the contents of the Letter be true, and that you bee in this conflict, you ſee your death prepared, which ſhould bee a great loſſe conſidering your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant beginning in deeds of armes, therefore I ſhall ſo order the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as at this time you ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from thence. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> I now do very wel perceiue, that the counſell which euen now I deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you, hath diſpleaſed your Maieſty, when ſeeing mee ſound and able of body, you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to a matter ſo greatly to my diſhonour, God forbid that I ſhould herein obey you. Gentle friend ſaid the king, you ſpeake both vertuouſly, and valiantly, for the which I thanke you: and for this time, let vs leaue off this talke, and my aduice is, that none do ſee our Letters, for (it may bee) they may cauſe ſome feare &amp; aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment euen in the hearts of thoſe that doe thinke themſelues to bee moſt hardy and valiant. By this time they were come ſo neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citty, that they entred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gate thereof, &amp; as the king looked behinde, he beheld two knights armed at all points, whoſe horſes were ouer-trauelled &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and their armour all to broken, in ſuch ſort that it was very eaſy to be perceiued that they had been at ſome bickering. One was <hi>Brunco de Bon' Mer,</hi> and the other <hi>Branfil</hi> his brother, who came of purpoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe hundred knights which ſhould bee in the battaile, if it pleaſed him to accept of them. But by the way <hi>Brunco</hi> had beene aduertiſed, how the aduenture of the Sword was atchieued, where-with he was meruailous diſpleaſed that he came no ſooner, becauſe hee would haue tried his fortune therein, as he had done vnder the Arch of loyall louers, the which he had paſſed, and for the firm and conſtant loue that he did beare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Melicia</hi> ſiſter vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> hee did verily beleeue that no ſuch like aduenture might eſcape him: theſe two knights being come neer, did their dutie vnto the king, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very courteouſly. Then ſaid <hi>Brunco,</hi> it may pleaſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty we haue beene aduertiſed of a battell which you haue agreed to be executed by a few knights, &amp; ſo much the rather ought they to be ſelected and choſen men. For this cauſe if it would pleaſe your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to doe vs this honor that we might be of the ſame number your Maieſty may bee aſſured that wee would bee very deſirous to ſerue you. The King who had many times beene aduertiſed of the proweſſe of theſe twaine, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the valour of <hi>Don Brunco</hi> (who for a yong knight, was as much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as any other that might be found) accepted of them very willingly, and thanked them for their good will.</p>
                  <p>Now did not <hi>Brunco</hi> as yet know <hi>Galaor,</hi> but at the ſame inſtant they entred into ſuch acquaintance and familiarity together, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Battell was finiſhed, they parted not aſunder.</p>
                  <p>And as the king entred into his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7181:185"/>
lodging, <hi>Enil</hi> came before him, with the head of <hi>Lindoraq</hi> which did hang by the hayre at the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trill of his horſe, and he had in his hand the ſhield and fingers of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> the Enchanter, by meanes whereof before he was come neer the Palace, a great number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did follow him, to know what newes he did bring. Afterwards being come into the kinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, hee declared vnto him the meſſage that the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> had ſent by him, wherewith he was no leſſe glad, then amaſed at ſo many good and bleſſed chanſes that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day happened and proceeded from this ſtrange knight, and hee remained a great while praiſing &amp; extolling him without ceaſing. In like ſort <hi>Filipinel</hi> who had been to giue defiance vnto the Giants, at the ſame inſtant approched, &amp; he recited the names and ſirnames of thoſe which were appointed to be in the battell of king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom there were found many ſtrong Giants, and other knights of great worth, who were all embarked already, and how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that foure dayes were paſt, they would all take landing in the bay of <hi>Vega,</hi> where the battell was to be foughten, then hee told the king how he had found at the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lake (which ſtands in the Iſle of <hi>Mongaſa)</hi> king <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>North Wales,</hi> and <hi>Angriotta d'Eſtrauaux</hi> priſoners vnto <hi>Grumadaca</hi> wife vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Famongomad:</hi> who cauſed them to ſuffer infinit miſeries and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, whipping them euery day moſt cruelly ſo that their bodies were wounded all ouer, and they wrote a letter vnto the king, which <hi>Filipinel</hi> deliuered vnto him, the tenure whereof enſueth. Vnto the moſt high and mighty Prince <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> king of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and to all our Friends and Allies within his Dominions. We <hi>Arban</hi> once king of <hi>North wales,</hi> and <hi>Angriotta d'Eſtrauaux,</hi> now detained in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous priſon, doe let you know that our misfortune, more cruell then death it ſelfe, hath brought vs into the power of the moſt pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Grumadaca</hi> wife to <hi>Famongo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad,</hi> who in reuenge of the death of her Husband and Sonne, doth daily cauſe vs to bee tortured with ſo many and ſtrange torments, that it is impoſſible to bee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo as euery houre wee deſire the abridging of our daies, that thereby we might bee releaſed of our dolors. But this miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the more to lengthen our paine, deferreth our death as much as ſhe may, the which with our owne hands we had effected, but that the feare of the loſſe of our ſoules withheld vs.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as we are at this preſent ſo extreamely wounded, that wee are no longer able to reſiſt our deaths, we ſend you this Letter, written with our blood, by the which wee beſeech God both to grant you the victory againſt theſe traitors, that haue in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane ſort tormented vs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he will bée pleaſed to haue mercy vpon our ſoules. Great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and compaſſion had the King for the loſſe of theſe 2. knights, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe ſeeing that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hee could in no ſort remedie their misfortun, he diſſembled his griefe, ſhewing as good a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as hee could, &amp; becauſe he would in no ſort diſcourage the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen there preſent, he ſet before their eyes the accidents whereinto many others had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, for the maintenance of their Honour of Knighthood, from the which many times they haue with

great glory and honour eſcaped. But aſſure you my friends, ſaid the King, that if wee doe gaine the Battaile, I will take ſuch reuenge hereof, that the rumor thereof ſhall fill the eares of all the people in the World. Therefore they who are appointed to goe with mee, let them bee ready to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for I will depart to goe meete mine enemies.

Now had hee commanded <hi>Enil</hi> to goe and ſtay for him at a Caſtle ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the foote of a Hill, neere vnto the which the Battaile was to be foughten, and it belonged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an ancient knight named <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> for in his houſe were all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentrous knights often-times ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and ſerued, when they came thither to lodge. And the ſame night did the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> paſſe hard by king <hi>Liſuart</hi> his Campe not being perceiued at all, afterwards hee rode ſo long that vpon the 5. day following he came vnto <hi>Abradan</hi> his houſe, where he found <hi>Enil</hi> which was there ariued but a little before: greatly was the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> feaſted by his Hoſt, and as they were talking together, there entred in two of his nepheus that were returned from the place where the combat ſhould be who aſſured them that already King <hi>Cildadan</hi> and his troop, were there arriued, and had ſet vp their Tents and Pauillions hard by the ſea ſide. In like ſort <hi>Don Grumeda</hi> and <hi>Gion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> Nephew to king <hi>Liſuart</hi> were there come, with whom a Truce was concluded vpon eyther part, to bee holden vntill the day of the battaile, and that neyther of the two Princes ſhould enter into the Combat with any more then one hundred knights in his company, according as it was promiſed and ſworne by them. Nephewes, ſaid the hoſt, what do you thinke of the Iriſh-men, whom God confound? Vncle anſwered one of them, they haue with them ſo many Giants, that if God doe not miraculouſly aſſiſt our good king, beleeue me it is impoſſible for him to withſtand them. Herewithall the teares fell from their Vncles eies, and he ſaid, I hope that God will protect the beſt and iuſteſt king in the world, from falling into the hands of ſuch wicked people. Mine hoſt, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> be not afraid as yet, for it happeneth out very often that courage and equity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth the pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the ſtrongeſt. But I pray you goe vnto the king, and tell him that there is lodged in your houſe a knight called the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7181:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> and that hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Maieſty to ſend word by you, when the day of the battaile ſhall be. What ſayd the olde man, are you hee that of late did ſend <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> vnto his Court, and ſlew <hi>Famongomad</hi> and his ſon, when they had taken my Lady <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> and her knights? beleeue mee Sir, if euer I did any pleaſure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aduenturous knights, I doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at this preſent acknowledge me throughly to be recompenced, my houſe beeing now honoured with your preſence, and I will not faile to accompliſh that which it hath pleaſed you to command me. Then he mounted vpon his horſe, and tooke with him his two Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, and rode vntill hee came where king <hi>Liſuart</hi> was encamped, within halfe a league of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, vnto whom he declared the meſſage of the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> at the which all the company did greatly reioyce. And the King anſwered: ſeeing that we haue the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> on our ſide, I doe alſo hope that wee ſhall haue the honor of the our enterpriſe. And now ſee the number of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred knights very well furniſhed, had wee but one knight more. It may pleaſe your Maieſty ſaid <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> you now haue the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> is well worth fiue. This ſpeech did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all pleaſe <hi>Galaor, Floreſtan,</hi> nor <hi>Agraies,</hi> for they hated the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> vnto death, for the wrong which they thought he did vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> neuertheleſſe they held their peace, and <hi>Abradan</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued his anſwere of the King, returned to his gueſt, vnto whom he recited the pleaſure that euery one receiued at the newes that he brought from him, and of the hundred knights there was no more then one miſſing, but that they were all aſſembled. The which beeing vnderſtood by <hi>Enil,</hi> hee did ſo much that he found his Maſter apart and falling downe vpon his knees, he ſayd vnto him: My Lord, although my ſeruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you hath not beene ſuch as it ſhould, and therefore haue I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all deſerued, yet am I ſo bolde at this time to requeſt one gift of you, which I beſeech you moſt humbly to graunt vnto mee. Demand it ſayd hee, and riſe vp. My Lord ſayd <hi>Enil,</hi> I pray you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make mee knight, to the end that I may goe vnto the King to entreat his Maieſty that hee will bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accept of mee for the laſt knight of his number. Friend <hi>Enil</hi> ſayd the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> me thinkes that thou ſhouldſt beginne to try thy proweſſe in a place leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then this battaile will bee, not: becauſe I would deferre to make thee knight, but in that I know it is too waighty a charge for thee. My Lord ſayde <hi>Enil,</hi> I knowe that in all my life I cannot haue a better meanes to gaine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: for if I die amongſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men of worth, my reputation ſhall bee thereby encreaſed, and if I may eſcape, my renowne ſhall be perpetuall, hauing been one in number with a hundred of the beſt knights in the world. The <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> hearing <hi>Enil</hi> ſpeake ſo vertuouſly, with a kind pittie that he had of him, he ruminated theſe words to himſelfe. Thou doſt well ſhew thy ſelfe to bee a kinſman vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the good knight <hi>Gandales</hi> my ſecond father. Then hee anſwered <hi>Enil,</hi> if thou haue ſo great a deſire to proue thy ſelf ſuch a one as thou ſayeſt, I will no longer diſſwade thee. And therewithall he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went vnto his hoſt, and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7181:187"/>
him to giue him an armour for his Eſquire, who deſired to bee made a knight, the which he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wherefore <hi>Enil</hi> according to the cuſtome, watched all night in the Chappell, and the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about the breake of day, after ſeruice was ended, hee receiued the order of knighthood by the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> which done they all mounted on horſe-back, in the companie of <hi>Abradan</hi> and his two Nephewes, who ſerued them for their Eſquires. In the end they arriued where king <hi>Liſuart</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ordered his battaile, being ready to goe meete his enemies, who ſtayed his comming in a plaine field, but when the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ioyfull, and there was not any in the company, whoſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was not increaſed at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Then hee approached neer vnto the king, vnto whom he ſayd, it may pleaſe your Maieſty, I am come to accompliſh my promiſe, and alſo I do bring another knight with me, for I was aduertiſed that your number was not full<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where-withall the king gaue him moſt hearty thanks, and although there was not any one of the hundred knights, who were not all approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and eſteemed amongſt the beſt, yet king <hi>Liſuart</hi> (after he had ordered his battallion, ſeeing his enemies aproached) beganne to make this Oration vnto his armie. My fellowes, louing friends and countriemen, I am ſure there is not any one amongſt you, who knoweth not very well, how wee haue vndertaken this battaile with great right, eſpecially for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Realme of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> which king <hi>Cildadan</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> would abaſe, in denying vnto vs the tribute which they haue time out of minde paid vnto our predeceſſors, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the fauours that in times paſt they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at their hands. Moreouer I am throughly aſſured that there is not any of you all, whoſe heart is not both valiant and inuincible, for which cauſe there is no need that you ſhould bee further animated, or incouraged, againſt thoſe with whom you are to encounter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing your honor before your eyes, which I knowe you doe more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme then an hundred liues, (if it were poſſible that ſo many you might haue) one after another. Therefore then my deere friends let vs boldly march on, not reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a ſmall number of cruell and bloody minded Gyants, that are in their troupe, for a man is not to be eſteemed the valianter by the outward appearance of his great, ſtrong, and huge members, but by the magnanimious &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious heart that remaineth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him: you doe oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the dogge to maſter the bull, and the ſparrow hawke or hobbie to beate the kite. Our enemies truſt in the force of theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, without hauing any reſpect vnto the wrong that they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and wee onely put our truſt in God, who being the righter of all iniuries, will giue vnto vs ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtrength to vanquiſh them, by the dexterity of our perſons &amp; our owne endeauours. Let vs boldly then march on my friends, euery one bearing this minde, that hee is able both to combate and conquer the proudeſt of their troupe, aſſuring you if this day we gaine the honour of the battaile, that beſides the honour and glory that ſhalbe ſpread of vs thorow the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7181:187"/>
whole world, neuer enemy to great <hi>Brittaine</hi> dare once hereafter be ſo bold as to lift vp his head to doe vs the leaſt iniury that may bee. Thus did king <hi>Liſuart</hi> incourage his knights: and king <hi>Cildadan</hi> on the other ſide did the like vnto his, for he went from ranke to ranke to animate them, ſaying vnto them: Gentle knights of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if you vnderſtand vpon what occaſion you goe to fight, there is not one of you that will not blame his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, for being ſo ſlacke in the vndertaking of ſo glorious an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. The kings of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> Vſurpers and Tyrants (not onely towardes their ſubiects, but alſo vpon their neighbours) haue heretofore without any right, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted vpon their anceſtors ſuch a tribute, as is very well known hath often beene payd, and for this cauſe wee haue made this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and are come vnto this place to defend our liberty, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee paid by any treaſure. It is your cauſe, it is your right, and not you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> but your childrens, who vntill this preſent time haue beene held, and reputed by thoſe whom you ſee determined like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to make you ſeruants and ſlaues. Will you then alwayes liue in this ſort? Will you continue this yoake vnto your ſucceſſors? are you of leſſe courage, or of leſſe ſubſtance then your neighbours? Ah if wee are conquerours they ſhall reſtore that which they haue had of vs. I am very ſure that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune doth fauour vs, for you ſee what men of worth are come vnto our ayde, knowing our great right. Let vs reſiſt them, let vs reſiſt them valiant knights. I ſee King <hi>Liſuart</hi> and his troupe now in feare &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to turne their backs vnto vs. They are as they ſay, accuſtomed to vanquiſh, but wee will teach them to accuſtome themſelues to be vanquiſhed. One thing I would aduiſe you, that euery one helpe his fellow, keeping you as cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as poſſibly you may. And longer would hee haue continued his Oration, if hee had not ſeene King <hi>Liſuart</hi> prepared to ioyne with him. Wherefore he retyred into the midſt of his ſquadron, and ſayd very loud, Now haue at them, ſince they will care, giue them cold iron enough.</p>
                  <p>At this cry euery man prepared to receiue his enemy, ſhewing by their countenance that they were men moſt hardy, and couragious. And formoſt of all did march the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Enil,</hi> as alſo <hi>Galaor, Floreſtan, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies, Gandalac</hi> the Gyant (who ſtole <hi>Galaor</hi> away when he was but two yeares olde) and his two ſons <hi>Bramandill,</hi> and <hi>Gainus,</hi> whom <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> had newly made knights. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them <hi>Nicoran de Pont Craintif, Dragonis, Palomir, Viuorant, Gion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> (Nephew to the King) the moſt renowmed <hi>Brunnio de Bonne Mer,</hi> his brother <hi>Branfill,</hi> and <hi>Guillan</hi> the <hi>Penſif,</hi> who all marched after old <hi>Grumedan,</hi> (a knight of honour belonging to the Queene) who carried King <hi>Liſuart</hi> his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard.</p>
                  <p>On King <hi>Cildadan</hi> his ſide the Gyants made the front of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, with twenty knights all neere a kinne vnto the King, who (like a prouident Generall) appointed that <hi>Mandafabull</hi> the Gyant of the Iſle of the Vermillio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tower, ſhould remayne vpon the top of a little hill, with ten of the beſt knights in their troupe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding them not to ſtir from thence, vntill they ſhould perceiue aſſuredly toward the end of the battell that the moſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7181:188"/>
valiant knights of Knig <hi>Liſuarts</hi> fide ſhould be ſcattered and weary, and that then they ſhould ruſh in vpon them, without ſpearing any man, ſauing the Kings perſon. Whom they ſhould take priſoner, and if they ſhould perceiue any great reſiſtance to be made, they ſhould kill him if they could not carry him vnto their ſhips. Thus the two battailes approched ſo neere one to another, that they came to the ioining together: there might you haue ſeene Lances bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, armour clattering, armes ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, ſome crying, others brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ranks of their enemies ſo that this day might be well called a ſorrowfull and diſmall day, for thoſe that were in this conflict, the which continued ſo long, vntill the moſt part of the day was paſt, yet none of them had ſo much time as once to breath, and yet it was ſo hot, that there was neither horſe not Knight that was not weary, &amp; exrteamly trauailed: for ſome lay vpon the ground, and the moſt part of the reſt (in little better caſe) were ſo weake, that they could ſcant ſit vpon their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. At the ſame time the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> fearing leaſt the loſſe ſhould fall vpon their fide, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſhew al his force and ſtrength, and he ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon neuer an <hi>Iriſhman</hi> nor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, but that hee drew the blood from his body. Cloſe by his ſide did King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ride, who did well ſhew the great proweſſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in him, and hee was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what conſequence the end of this battaile was, for looſing the victory thereof, he loſt his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, his life and honor, by meanes whereof without ſparing his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hee was entred in amongſt his enemies, hauing his right arme all dyed with the blood of thoſe, whoſe liues had paſſed by the edge of his ſword. On the otherſide, <hi>Agraies, Galaor, Floreſtan,</hi> hauing from the beginning ſeen the great force and high Knight-hood that the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> had executed vpon his enemies, they who of long time did maligne him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined either to dye, or to make knowne vnto euery one, that they could alſo fight as well or better then hee, ſo that this emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was partly the cauſe of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating of them ſo far, that they all had likely to haue loſt their liues, for <hi>Galaor</hi> chafed like a Lion that is purſued, came ruſhing in among the Giants, and encountred <hi>Carta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daque</hi> of the inuincible mountaine, who already with his battaile axe, had ouerthrown at his feete ſix of king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> knights, although that hee was wounded vpon the ſhoulder, with a blowe that <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan</hi> had giuen him, whereby hee loſt much of his blood, then <hi>Galaor</hi> came vnto him, and with all his ſtrength, hee gaue him ſo great a blowe vpon the head, that hee cleft his helmet, and the ſword paſſing down along cut of his eare, and the helue of his axe cloſe vnto his fiſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Giant finding himſelfe disfurniſhed of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, ran vpon <hi>Galaor,</hi> and lifted him vp with ſuch force, that hee tooke him vp from his horſe, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing him betweene his armes ſo ſtreightly, that one might eaſily haue heard his bones cracke. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, the Gyant could not ſit ſo ſure in his ſaddle, but that hee was forced to fal to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with his burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherfore <hi>Galaor</hi> (which yet held his ſword in his hand) fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the meanes to thruſt him in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of his helmet, and it entred ſo farre into his head, that hee there

withall yeelded vp the Ghoſt. But <hi>Galaor</hi> was ſo tyred, that after hee was gotten vp from vnder <hi>Carta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daque</hi> he had not power to pull his ſword from the place wherein hee had thruſted it, and (that which was worſt) he was ſo crouded with the preſſe of people, that hee was likely to haue died vnder the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes feet, for many good knights both of the one and of the other ſide, (hauing ſeene the encounter betweene him and the Gyant, and the perill of them both) were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, of purpoſe to ſuccour them, by meanes whereof the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile was then very great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous hot, for King <hi>Cildadan</hi> ſuddenly came to that place, who ouerthrew all thoſe hee found in his way, and had not the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> beene (who with one blowe of his ſworde ſtroke him off his horſe) <hi>Galaor</hi> had there ſurely died or beene taken, but when hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held King <hi>Cildadan</hi> on foot beſide him, he princely ſeaſed his ſword which hee held, and began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe, and that ſo valiantly as mauger all his enemies, hee made them giue him roome. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee had ouerchafed himſelfe ſo much in this laſt bicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that hee was quite out of breath, and hee fell downe flat vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. There was the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Gandalac,</hi> who had foſtered him vp in his infancy, hee ſeeing him fall, was ſo angry that with great rage hee buckled with <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danor</hi> another Gyant, and ſo many ſtrokes they gaue vnto each other with their clubs, that they &amp; their horſes were ouerthrowne, where-with <hi>Albadanor</hi> had his arme bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and <hi>Gandalac</hi> his legge. But they were not alone that were thus ill intreated, for one might haue ſeene more then ſix ſcore knights lying vpon the ground, and yet was not halfe the day ſpent. Then <hi>Mandafabull</hi> the Gyant of the Iſle of the red Tower, who had beene appointed not to depart from the little hill wheee hee remayned, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the extreamity of the battaile, ſeeing ſo many knights dead, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and wounded, thought that he might well end this enterpriſe, and that it were very eaſie for them to defeate the reſt, by meanes whereof hee began to runne right vnto that place where was the greateſt preſſe, crying vnto his knights: Take heed that none eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape away aliue, let all paſſe by the edge of the ſword, as for mee, I haue vowed to take King <hi>Liſuart</hi> in hand, for hee is mine dead or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. This cry was heard of euery one, eſpecially of the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> who returned from taking of a freſh horſe, which one of the nephewes vnto his hoſt had reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for him, and fearing that the Gyant would doe as hee ſaid, hee came and ſtepped before the King, with <hi>Agraies, Floreſtan, Brunco de Bonne Mer, Branfil, Guillan</hi> the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſif</hi> and <hi>Enil,</hi> who had all day long behaued himſelfe ſo valiantly, that hee was had in very great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now was <hi>Mandafabull</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeconded then he thought, for as hee approached neere vnto the eſquadron of King <hi>Liſuart, Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> the <hi>Leonnois,</hi> Vncle to King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> one of the beſt knights of his ſtocke, came foorth of the troupe, and running againſt the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> he hit him ſo right a blow through his ſhield, that he wounded him, yet not very much, and in paſſing by, the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn</hi> did hit him ſuch a thwart blow with his ſword vpon the beuer of his helme, that he cut both his eyes and the halfe of his viſage off,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7181:189"/>
throwing him downe ſtarke dead vpon the ground.</p>
                  <p>Herewithall <hi>Mandafabull</hi> and thoſe that were with him beeing mad angry, entered pell mell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong King <hi>Liſuart</hi> his knights with ſuch furie, that mauger their reſiſtance, <hi>Mandafabull</hi> took hold of the King by the coller, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him from his horſe, carrying him vnder his armes right vnto his ſhippes. But the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> was ware of it, who ran after him and ouertooke the Gyant, hitting him ſo forcibly with his ſworde vpon the arme, that hee cut it off hard by the elbow, and the blowe ſliding downe, wounded the King in ſuch ſort, that the blood ſell downe vpon the ground. Then <hi>Mandafabull</hi> with the great griefe that hee felt, gaue a loud cry, and without going any further, he fell downe dead in the place, where-upon the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> ſeeing that his blow had ſo well profited, as that therewithall hee had ſlaine ſuch a Gyant, and deliuered the King in like ſort, hee began to cry aloud <hi>Gaule, Gaule,</hi> here is <hi>Amadis</hi> who is yet aliue. So ſaying hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred amongſt the thickeſt of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, who had in a manner loſt their hearts, by ſeeing two of the principalleſt of their army in that ſort to be ſlaine, eſpecially know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Amadis</hi> (whom they long before thought to bee dead) was preſent to their confuſion. And had not <hi>Gandaturiell</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt Gyants in their troupe encouraged them againe, they had then ſurely turned their backs, but hee valiantly made head againſt his enemies, which being percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by <hi>Amadis,</hi> who was deſirous to reuenge his brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> whom hee imagined to bee dead, he thruſt himſelfe amongſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and entred into the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt of the preſſe, ſo farre that there he had remained, without the ayd which King <hi>Liſuart</hi> brought vnto him, who had recouered his horſe, and there were in his companie <hi>Bruneo, Floreſtan, Guillan, La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All thoſe ſeeing <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> in ſo great danger (although the moſt part of them were very ſorely wounded) had ſuch excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioy when they knewe that it was hee, that they beſtirred them in ſuch ſort, as notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance that theſe <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> could make, they gaue ayde vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> and paſſing on further they found <hi>Agraies, Palomir, Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil</hi> and <hi>Dragonis,</hi> manfully fighting on foote againſt thoſe that had throwne them downe. Yet they were ſo neerely driuen, that they could not any longer withſtand the force of their enemies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had already ſlaine more then ſixe, as well Gyants as <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> which would haue ouer-runne them, and without doubt they had beene ſo handled had not theſe ſuccours come vnto them. So that they which would haue forced them, had enough to doe to defend themſelues, becauſe that <hi>Amadis</hi> (in ſpight of them) made them to recoyle backe, and that in ſuch ſort as with the ayde of his troupe hee was the meane that his Coſen <hi>Agraies</hi> and his fellowes did remount their horſes. Then the forces of King <hi>Liſuart</hi> encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> troupes decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who diſpairing of all helpe, had recourſe vnto their veſſels which were afloate hard by the ſhoare to ſaue their booty if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had not contradicted them:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7181:189"/>
but <hi>Amadis</hi> purſuing the victory, chaſed them with ſuch fury, that the moſt part of the vanquiſhed, deſired rather to be buried amidſt the waues of the Sea, then on the ſhoare, which was ſo died and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with their blood. The which <hi>Gandaturiell</hi> perceiuing (being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed amongſt all the Gyants one of the ſtouteſt) without any feare at all of his death, which hee ſaw ready prepared for him, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring before the end of his dayes to bee reuenged, bearing his head ſomewhat lowe, and holding his ſharp ſword in his hand, he would haue ſtroken at king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> but <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſtepped before him, who hit him ſo ſound a knock with his ſword vpon the Helmet, that hee made it flie from his head, and the King who was hard at hand, ſeeing him bare, diuided his pate into two parts. Then was there a great ſlaughter of the <hi>Iriſhmen,</hi> for they were all now ouerthrowne by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis, Floreſtan,</hi> and <hi>Agraies:</hi> who perſued them euen into the Sea, where they were ſwallowed vp with waues, wherewith king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> and his people retyred. And becauſe that <hi>Amadis</hi> had marked the place where hee had ſeene <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> ſtroken downe, hee prayed his Coſen <hi>Agraies</hi> &amp; others that they would helpe him to finde him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the dead. Neuertheleſſe they had not found him without the helpe of <hi>Floreſtan:</hi> who knew him by a greene ſleeue which hee did weare, wrought full of white flowers, but hee was ſo couered with blood &amp; duſt, that they could ſcant knowe him. And I doe not knowe ſo hard a heart which had then ſeene the mone that <hi>Amadis</hi> did make for him, that would not haue burſt forth into teares, for he beholding him in this eſtate, fell down all along vpon him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his wounds did open, againſt which the congealed blood was already ſetled, and I thinke that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> had died vpon him if twelue Damoſels had not by chaunce come thither ſuddenly, who were very richly attyred, and had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a rich bed to bee brought by their Eſquires, theſe finding <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſo deſperate, ſayde vnto him: My Lord wee are come hither to ſeeke your brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> and if you will euer ſee him aliue, ſuffer vs to carry him preſently away, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe there is no Chyrurgion in all Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> that is able to heale him.</p>
                  <p>Herewithall <hi>Amadis</hi> was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſhamed, becauſe the Damoſels had found him in that order, and although that hee knew them not, yet hearing them ſpeak of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers health, hee determined (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extreame perill wherein he was) not to refuſe their requeſt, though it was to his extreame griefe. And therefore he anſwered them, my faire gentlewomen, may in pleaſe you to tell vs whither you will carry him. Not now ſaid they, but if you will deſire to haue him liue, giue him vnto vs without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer delay, otherwiſe wee will be gone. Alas anſwered he, I pray let mee followe you. You may not, and yet for your ſake wee are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent that <hi>Ardan</hi> the Dwarffe and his Eſquire ſhall accompanie him. Then they layd him vpon the bed (all armed as hee was) &amp; they cauſed him forthwith to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſhip from whence they were come, which was yet cloſe to the ſhoare. Afterwards they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe vnto king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to entreate him that hee would giue them king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> who lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead, and to induce him
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7181:190"/>
thereunto, they ſhewed vnto him that although Fortune had fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him in this exployt, yet hee ſhould not exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his cruelty vpon his enemy. The which the King conſidering, permitted them to carry him away dead or aliue, wherefore the Damoſels took him vp and carried him away with <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> and ſo ſoone as they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſhip they ſet ſayle, hauing the winde ſo faire, that ſuddenly they were out of all mens ſight.</p>
                  <p>Thus king <hi>Liſuart</hi> remayned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour ouer his enemies, going quite through the field to find out as well ſuch of his owne people as thoſe of his enemies, that were not yet thoroughly dead, to cauſe them carefully to bee looked vnto by skilfull Surgeons. And as hee went from one place to another, hee met with <hi>Amadis,</hi> whoſe face was all to be blubbered with tears, vnto whom he had not as yet ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſince his returne, and ſeeing him ſo heauy, after he had knowne the cauſe of his mone, hee ſhewed an euident ſigne of the ſorrow that he ſuſtayned for <hi>Galaors</hi> ſake, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee loued as dearely as himſelfe, &amp; not without cauſe, for from the firſt day that hee receiued him for one of his knights, he alwaies ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him faithfully, neuer forſaking him for any warre or debate that happened betweene his maieſty &amp; <hi>Amadis,</hi> as hereafter ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed vnto you. But the King deſirous to manifeſt the force of his vertue, the better to comfort his knights, all wounded as hee was, lighted from his horſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>Amadis,</hi> who kneeled down to ſhew his duty vnto his Maieſty. My deere friend ſayd king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> you are moſt happily met, I know now very well, that without your ayde the realme of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> had beene in no ſmall danger, and I pray you be not ſo heauy for the loſſe of your brother, ſeeing that the Damoſels haue aſſured you of his health.</p>
                  <p>In this ſorte want king <hi>Liſuart</hi> comforting of <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom hee cauſed to mount on horſe-backe, and afterwards hee brought him into his tent where there was brought ſomewhat for them to eat, &amp; becauſe he would depart the next day, he appointed ouer night that the dead ſhould bee buried in a Moneſtarie hard by the place where the battaile was giuen, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the which place hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed great riches, to cauſe them to pray for him. In like ſort hee diſpatched a knight to goe in haſte to aduertiſe the Queene of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory that hee gad gotten ouer his enemies, and the next morning he tooke his way toward the Citty of <hi>Gonata</hi> (which was about foure leagues off) where hee remayned vntill he and his people were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. While theſe things were in doing, the Queene <hi>Brialania</hi> got leaue of Queene <hi>Briſena,</hi> that ſhe might goe to <hi>Mirefleur</hi> to viſit <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> hauing a great deſire to ſee her, becauſe ſhe was renowmed through all the world for her moſt excellent beauty. Of whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Oriana</hi> being aduertiſed, ſhe cauſed the place to bee decked vp as well as poſſibly it might be, and ſhe receiued her moſt honorably, but when ſhe beheld her to bee ſo faire, the ſuſpition that ſhee had conceiued againſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> was not ſo thoroughly mortified but that it ſomewhat reuiued againe in her, notwithſtanding all the proof that ſhe had had of him, eyther by his paſſing thorough the Arch of loyall louers, or by his winning of the olde mans ſworde, beleeuing

On the other ſide <hi>Briolania</hi> verily thought that the often ſighes of <hi>Amadis</hi> in her preſence, proceeded of no other cauſe, but the affection which hee did beare vnto <hi>Oriana:</hi> for ſhee was the moſt rare Princeſſe and of the ſweeteſt grace that euer ſhee had ſeene.

                  <p>In this ſort did the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes paſſe away their time, ſtill talking of <hi>Amadis</hi> during their aboad in the Caſtle of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> from whence within a fewe dayes after they departed to go towards <hi>Fenuſa</hi> to ſee the Queene <hi>Briſena,</hi> where ſhe ſtayed for King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who was very glad to ſee her daugter returne in ſo good health.

And no leſſe abaſhed was king <hi>Cildadan</hi> to ſee that hee was locked vpon a ſtrong Tower, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with the maine Sea, although that the chamber where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee remayned was moſt richly hanged, and he laid in a good bed. Neuertheleſſe hee was alone, and he thought that he did heare ſome people talking right vnder the vault, but hee could neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue doore, nor place where tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough any body might enter into his chamber. Wherefore he roſe vp, and put his head foorth at the window, and he could ſee nothing but the Sea, whoſe waues did beat againſt the place wherein hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned ſhut vp, the which was built vpon the top of a moſt ſteep and hard Rocke, neither did hee know how hee was brought from the place where hee was ſmitten downe among the preſſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Notwithſtanding hee knew very vell ſeeing hee was in ſuch a place that he had loſt the battaile, and that his knights were either all dead, or taken, but yet he comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe as well as he could, &amp; layd him downe againe vpon his bed, bewayling greatly the griefe which hee did feele in his wounds. Thus was <hi>Galaor</hi> lying ſicke on the other ſide, as hath beene recited, who heard the little doore of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7181:191"/>
garden open: which cauſed him to riſe from his bed, as well as hee could, and hee perceiued a faire Gentlewoman comming vnto him, being very richly attired, the which did bring with her a knight ſo olde and crooked, that it was wonder how hee could bee able to ſtand. Theſe approching nere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſayd to him through the grates of yron, without opening the chamber dore. Knight, prouide for your ſoules health, for we will not henceforth warrant you. Then the Damoſell tooke forth two lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleboxes, one of iron, and the other of ſiluer: and ſhewing them vnto <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhe ſayd vnto him. Knight, the party which hath cauſed you to come hither, will not that you ſhould die, before ſhe doe knowe whether you will accompliſh her will or no, and in the meane ſeaſon ſhe will cauſe your wounds to bee cured. Gentlewoman, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> if ſhee deſire that I ſhould do any thing contrary to mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I had rather die. You may doe, ſayd ſhe, as you liſt, although it is your choyce either to liue or die. Herewithall the olde man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the gate, and ſo ſoonas they were entred into the chamber, the the Gentlewoman preſently gaue vnto him the yron boxe, willing him to ſtep back, the which he did. Afterwards ſhe ſayde vnto <hi>Galaor.</hi> My Lord, I am ſo ſorry for your ſickneſſe, that for to ſaue your life, I will hazard mine owne death, and I will declare that which I was put in charge to doe. Which is, that I ſhould fill theſe two boxes, the one with poyſon, and the other with oyntment to make you ſleepe, to the end that when you did awake, you might feele ſuch extreame paine, that with the rage thereof, you might cruely end your life, but I haue done cleane contrary, for I haue filled them with ſuch a ſalue, that if you vſe it but ſeuen dayes together, you ſhall finde your ſelfe whole, ſound, and able to mount on horſe-backe. Then ſhe rubbed his wounds with the oyntment, the which was of ſuch vertue, that at the ſame inſtant his paine was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and hee felt ſuch eaſe, that he ſayde vnto the Damoſell. Faire Gentlewoman, you doe binde me ſo greatly vnto you, that if euer I come forth from hence, you may bee ſure that neuer any Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was better recompenced by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knight, then you ſhall be by me, neuertheleſſe, if you haue not the meanes to deliuer mee, I beſeech you at the leaſt, doe ſo much that <hi>Vrganda the vnknowne</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed thereof, for I haue euer-more had a great confidence in her. The Gentlewoman began to laugh, and anſwered him. What? doe you make ſuch account of <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda,</hi> ſeeing that hitherto ſhe hath been ſo careleſſe of your wealth or woe? I know well, ſayd he, that as ſhe knoweth the ſecret thoughts of men, ſo is ſhee not ignorant how much my deſire is to ſerue her.

Goe to, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhee, let this ſuffice you now, vntill it bee time for mee to returne againe to dreſſe you, in the meane ſeaſon couer you, and feigne as if you ſlept ſoundly, the which hee did. Then the Gentle-woman called the olde man, and ſayd vnto him, ſee how the knight ſleepeth, the poyſon doth now worke vpon him. All the better, anſwered the olde man, hee which hath brought him hither, ſo farre as I ſee ſhall be ſufficiently reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon him, and ſeeing that you haue ſo well obeyed that which you were commanded, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent henceforth that you doe come without any guard at all to viſite him. But vſe him after this manner fifteene dayes together, for at that time they ſhall come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who (for the iniurie that hee hath done vnto them) ſhall take ſuch ſatisfaction of him, as they pleaſe. <hi>Galaor</hi> heard all their talke, and hee knewe very well that the old man was his mortall enemie, neuertheleſſe hee had ſome hope in the Damoſels promiſe, who had aſſured him that hee ſhould be healed in ſeauen dayes, hoping (if ſo ſhee did) that hee might eaſily ſaue himſelfe from their hands. Hereupon the olde man and the Damoſell departed: but ſhee tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not long before hee did ſee her returne with two other young virgins, exceeding faire, who brought victuals vnto <hi>Galaor,</hi> and cauſed him to eate. This done the Damoſell commanded the other two to keepe him company, and to reade before him ſome pleaſant Hiſtories, to keepe him from ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the day time, ſo that <hi>Galaor</hi> being greatly comforted by the Damoſels kinde entertaynement, was thoroughly aſſured that ſhee would helpe him as ſhee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and ſo ſhutting the gate, ſhe departed &amp; left the two yong Gentlewomen diſcourſing with him. Farre otherwiſe did it happen vnto king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> who beeing ſhut vp within a Tower, and layd vpon his bed, did ſee a doore of ſtone to open (the which was cloſe faſtened in the wall, that it ſeemed as if it had beene the wall it ſelfe) by the which there entred in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of middle age, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with two armed knights, the which came cloſe to his bed ſide. The King ſaluted them, but they anſwered not, the gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lifted vp the couering that he had vpon, and looking vpon his wounds, ſhe dreſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, afterwards ſhe gaue him ſomewhat to eate, &amp; returned both ſhe and the knights the ſame way they came, not once ſpeaking vnto him. When the king beheld their maner of behauiour, he beleeued that he was in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch a one where his life was in no great ſafety, neuertheles he took as good comfort vnto him as he could, not being able other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to remedy his miſhap. But the gentlewoman that looked vnto <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing that it was time to dreſſe him went vnto him, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him how he fared. Paſſing wel anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> &amp; I hope (ſeeing the good beginning of my amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) that I may be healed within the time that you haue promiſed. There is no doubt thereof ſaid ſhe, therefore I will that you promiſe me as you are a loyall knight, not to depart from hence without my leaue, otherwiſe your life may bee in perill of death <hi>Galaor</hi> did ſweare
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7181:192"/>
vnto her ſo to doe, beſeeching her moſt inſtantly to tell him how ſhe was called. But ſhe anſwered him. How now <hi>Galaor,</hi> doe you not yet know my name? Truely now I am greatly deceiued conſidering the ſeruices that heeretofore I haue done for you, when you are ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of me? I am called, The wise among the wiſeſt: ſaying ſo, ſhee went forth of the chamber fayning to bee very angry, and pulled the dore rudely after her. Wherewith <hi>Galaor</hi> remained more penſiue then before, and hee remembred him of the faire ſword that <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> had giuen vnto him, when his brother <hi>Amadis</hi> made him knight, whereby hee ſuſpected that it was ſhe her ſelfe, neuertheleſſe, hee was in ſome doubt, becauſe that when he ſaw her firſt, ſhe ſeemed to bee olde and crooked, and this was young, faire, and in good liking. And as he was in this ſtudy not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſleepe, hee turned his head toward the place, where the young Gentlewomen were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to ſit in keeping him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but in ſtead of them he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <hi>Gaſauel</hi> his eſquire, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> the Dwarffe of <hi>Amadis:</hi> at which he was no leſſe abaſhed then ioyfull, and he called them becauſe that they ſlept. Who at their awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, ſeeing their Maiſter, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came no leſſe amaſed then he, and they roſe vp doing their duty vnto him, and hee demanded how they were come thither, who anſwered, that <hi>Amadis, Floreſtan</hi> and <hi>Agrates,</hi> had commanded them to follow him. They further declared vnto him, in what eſtate the Damoſels tooke him vp, for which cauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> ſeeing in what extremity you remained, permitted them to carry you away, together with King <hi>Cildadan.</hi> What do you ſay? ſayd <hi>Galaor,</hi> was <hi>Amadis</hi> in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly? My Lord, ſayd <hi>Gaſanel,</hi> it was hee that was called the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> by whoſe ſtrength and courage the battaile was gayned. Then he recited vnto him the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he deliuered the King, and killed <hi>Mandafabull,</hi> and that then he made himſelfe knowne, crying <hi>Gaul</hi> with a loude voyce.

This was the eſtate wherein <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadan</hi> remained, who in few dayes felt ſo great eaſe of their wounds, that they began to walke about the chamber. Wherefore <hi>Vrganda</hi> (in whoſe power they remained in her vnknowne Iſland) made her ſelfe knowne vnto them ſaying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. That the feare wherein ſhee had put them, had beene the meanes to effect their health the ſooner, otherwiſe they had beene in danger of their liues. Afterwards ſhe commanded her two Nieces to be fetched to keepe them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which were daughters vnto King <hi>Falangris,</hi> brother vnto King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who had begotten vpon them the ſiſter of <hi>Vrganda,</hi> one of them was called <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But during their aboad there, as <hi>Amadis</hi> talked with Queen <hi>Briolania</hi> (in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Oriana)</hi> ſhe ſayd vnto him. My Lord, I aſſure you I was ſo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull when it was told mee that you were loſt, that I can in no ſort expreſſe vnto you the diſpleaſure that I receiued therewith, and at the laſt ſeeing that you ſtaied ſo long before you returned, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to come vnto this Court, with a hundred of my Knights, to cauſe the ſearch of you to begin, according to the appointment of my Lords your bretheren. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe by meanes of the battaile which the King had appointed with King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> my enterpriſe was ſtored and that in a good houre, ſeeing that it pleaſed God ſo ſoon to bring you home againe. Therefore aduiſe you now (if it pleaſe you) what you will that I ſhall doe for you, for I will obey you all my life long. Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if you were in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perplexity for mee, you had great reaſon, for I am well aſſured, that there is no knight in the world more ready to do you ſeruice then is <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaul.</hi> But ſeeing that it pleaſeth you to refer all your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires vpon me, I pray you to tarry yet in this Court eight or tenne daies longer, vntill we may heare ſome newes from my brother <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> in the meane time you ſhall haue the paſtime of a Combate, which my brother <hi>Floreſtan</hi> muſt performe againſt <hi>Laudin,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I will conduct you home into your Countrey, and from thence I will take my way vnto the Firme-Iſland, where I muſt needs be.

Madame, anſwered he, it is not to bee counted a preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to trie that wherein all others haue failed vntill this preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not faire enough, and you which are one of the moſt excellent creatures in the earth, ſhould doe ſo much amiſſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerre this ſingularity, as your feare might turne you greatly vnto blame, in not performing your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour. <hi>Amadis</hi> did ſuddainly per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue by her countenance that <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> was not greatly pleaſed with this diſcourſe, and although hee thought that hee had ſaid nothing, but what might redound vnto her honor, yet did it greatly repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him that he had ſpoken ſo much, for he had ſeene the old image of <hi>Grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſa,</hi> was in no ſort equall vnto her in beauty, therefore could ſhe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7181:193"/>
not attaine vnto that glory, the which hee made no doubt at all in <hi>Oriana.</hi> But <hi>Oriana</hi> iudged farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, for ſhee imagined that there was not any thing in the world that <hi>Briolania</hi> might not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, if by beauty it might bee conquered, and diſſembling before her the malice that ſhe now had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued againſt her, ſhee praied her that if ſhee entred into the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that ſhe would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſend her news thereof. Then ſhee roſe vp, and went to ſeeke out <hi>Mabila,</hi> whom whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe had found, ſhe recited all the conference that had paſſed betwixt <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Briolania,</hi> (in her preſence) ſaying vnto her. By my faith your Coſin doth very often giue mee the like alarmes, although hee bee aſſured that I take no pleaſure at all in any thing, but onely in that wherein I may beſt pleaſe and obey him, without reſpect of mine honour, feare of God, or obedience to my parents. But he knoweth that hee hath ful power ouer me, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him now to diſpiſe me, for the which I may onely blame that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate familiarity which I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto him, thinking that I had done all for the beſt. In vttering theſe her ſuppoſed wrongs, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teares fell from her eyes, which <hi>Mabila</hi> perceiuing (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very diſcreete) ſhe bethought her of a preſent Antidote to expell this poiſon. And therefore faining to bee exceeding angry, with the iniury that <hi>Oriana</hi> offered vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> ſhe anſwered her very ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſhrewdly: Madame, I doe greatly wonder at you, and your manner of behauiour, for ſo ſoon as one miſchiefe hath forſaken you, another doth preſently follow you, and you ought (methinkes) to take better regarde vnto that which you ſay of my coſin, and not to bee perſwaded that he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either one thing or another to anger you, ſeeing that you may be aſſured that he neuer imagined to offer you any offence, either in word or deede. And heereof ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient witneſſe you haue, in the proofes &amp; triall that he hath made, as well in your preſence as in your abſence, but I ſee well what your meaning is, you would haue mee know (being weary of my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) that you would put mee away vnder the coullour that my cofin is ſo wholly yours, abuſing your ſelfe with the bondage wherein he is ſubiected vnto you. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, when you ſhall haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me, it will be no great matter, ſo that your <hi>Amadis</hi> (for your may I call him) be not worſſe vſed. For you know very well and I alſo, that the leaſt diſpleaſure he ſhall take at your griefe, will bee ſufficient to cauſe his death, therefore I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile what pleaſure you take to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him ſo often, hee aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe for you as much as is poſſible to bee done for any other Lady liuing. Doe you not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>Apolidon</hi> willed the proofe of the forbidden chamber ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the world? What a great error ſhould my Coſin then commit, to diſwade <hi>Briolania</hi> that ſhee ſhould not doe as much as others? Tuely I beleeue that neither you nor ſhe are yet faire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to performe that, which all the faireſt during theſe hundred yeeres could neuer obtaine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am throughly aſſured, that this new iealouſie proceedeth not from any fault which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, whoſe minde is wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to obey you. Moreouer his miſ-fortune hath ſo much ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſtered him, that to pleaſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7181:194"/>
you hee hath not onely forgotten himſelfe, (but alſo regarded none but you) hee hath quite diſday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all his kindred, and hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them as meere ſtrangers, not knowing them at all, nor any other but you whom hee adoreth as his God, and yet you would by your folly procure his ouer-throw. Ay mee, the dangers and euident perill wherein hee and his haue oftentimes beene brought vnto for your ſake, as well againſt <hi>Arcalaus</hi> as in this laſt battaile, are very ill acknowledged by you, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that now in ſatisfaction there-of, you deſire the deſtruction of the chiefe and principalleſt of my kindred. Is this the fauour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the ſeruices that I haue done vnto you? Truely my hope is now greatly deceiued, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before mine eyes, a complot is layd for the ruine and fall of a wight whom I doe moſt loue in the world, and hee that is yours more then his owne, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (if it pleaſe God) it ſhall not be ſo, nor ſhall ſuch a misfortune happen ſo neere vnto mee. For I will intreate my brother <hi>Agraies</hi> and my Vncle <hi>Galuanes</hi> to carry mee into <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereby they ſhall doe mee a great pleaſure to take me away from your company who are ſo vngratefull. Herewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhee wept ſo extreamely, as though ſhee would haue drowned her ſelfe with teares. Alas ſayd ſhe God grant that the cruelty which you commit againſt your <hi>Amadis,</hi> light not vpon your owne head, to ſatisfie all his kindred, who ſhall not loſe ſo much (in his lacke) as you alone ſhall doe, although it ſhould be the greateſt misfortune that could happen vnto vs. When <hi>Oriana</hi> did heare <hi>Mabila</hi> ſpeake in ſuch choller, her heart was ſo ouercharged, that her ſpeech fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vntill ſhee had a little while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted her, when burſting out into teares, ſhee mainely cryed out, ah mee poore ſoule, aboue all deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and ſorrowfull women, moſt wretched: who would euer haue imagined this which you haue now made manifeſt vnto mee, could euer haue proceeded forth of your heart? Alas I haue diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſecrets vnto you (hauing about me no other worthy to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my ſorrowes) to haue counſel &amp; comfort at your hands, but you diſcomfort mee, and vſe mee worſe then I haue deſerued, reputing me to be farre otherwiſe then I am, or euer ſhall be ſo long as breath remayneth within my ſorrowfull heart, which maketh mee to preſume that nought but my misfortune hath brought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee this vnhappy vſage, ſeeing that you haue taken in ſuch ill part that which I did tell you for the beſt. And let God neuer helpe mee if I did thinke dayes of my life vpon that wherewith you doe blame and accuſe mee, for I haue ſo great confidence in your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, that I ſtudy vpon nothing ſo much, as how to content him: yet thus much I muſt tell you, that I had rather die then any other but my ſelfe ſhould gaine the honour of the forbidden Chamber.

Thus were theſe two Ladies reconciled together as before, neuertheleſſe ſhortly after <hi>Mabila</hi> came vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> vnto whom ſhe declared all the talke that <hi>Oriana</hi> had with her, reproouing him ſharpely for that which he had ſaid to <hi>Briolania</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, knowing that already ſhe had been ſuſpitious of them both. Therefore my good Coſen ſayde <hi>Mabila,</hi> endeauour henceforth not to giue her any farther occaſion to vſe you ill, ſpeaking hereafter more diſcreetely then you haue done, eſpecially before my Lady, for it is a very hard matter wholly to baniſh and extinguiſh iealouſie from a woman after it is much rooted in her mind, and had it not beene for my ſharpe anſwer vnto her, by my faith ſhee had paſſed the bounds of reaſon. Sweet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I doe much maruaile at the phantaſie of my Lady, but yet I doe giue you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great thankes, for the counſell that you giue vnto mee, although I doe ſweare vnto you that whatſoeuer. I did ſpeake, I thought was wholy for her aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And I will tell you how eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knoweth that <hi>Briolinia</hi> is reputed one of the faired Ladies in the world, ſo as one would thinke her ſufficient to enter into the forbidden chamber, but this thought is falſe: for I haue ſeene the Image of <hi>Grimaneſa,</hi> vnto whoſe beauty <hi>Briolania</hi> in no ſorte comes neere, wherefore it is moſt ſure that ſhee ſhall neuer attaine to this honour, the which my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſhall obtaine without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie. Neuertheleſſe if it were firſt before <hi>Briolania</hi> had made her tryall therein, one might ſay after-ward, If ſhe had begun before <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> that then ſhee had firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued the aduenture: by means whereof I was ſo bold (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of my Lady) to giue her that counſell which you haue heard, <hi>Mabila</hi> liked well this excuſe of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and tolde <hi>Oriana</hi> thereof, who did greatly repent her that ſhee had ſpoken ſo much, fearing leaſt <hi>Amadis</hi> would haue been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with her, and to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for this fault which ſhe had committed, ſhe ſent him word by <hi>Mabila,</hi> that he ſhould come to ſee her in her lodging, where ſhe and <hi>Briolania</hi> ſtayd for him, the which he did. At his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming the Ladies tooke him by the hand, and made him ſit betweene them, then they prayed him to tell them the truth of what which they would demand of him, wherunto hee diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ended. Tell vs then ſayd <hi>Oriana,</hi> what is the Ladie that gained the kerchief with the flowers, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the burning ſword? <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> perceiued well that he was not onely ouertaken, but alſo conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to tell the truth, for which cauſe he anſwered <hi>Oriana:</hi> In faith Madame I know no more what ſhe was then you doe, although I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in her company ſixe daies together. But thus much did I ſee in her, that ſhe had the faireſt haire that any Lady or Damoſell could poſſibly haue, and ſhee is beſides moſt beautifull, and of a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent grace, for the reſt you know as much as I doe. By my faith ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> if ſhee got the kerchiefe with great honour, it had bin like afterward to haue coſt her
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7181:195"/>
very deere as it was tolde mee, for without your aſſiſtance <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the enchanter and his Nephew <hi>Lindoraq</hi> had taken it from her, &amp; alſo done her ſome villany. It was not hee anſwered <hi>Briolania</hi> (if hee be <hi>Amadis)</hi> but another who was called the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> from whom wee muſt not derogate the honour to attribute it vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And although I am greatly bound vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> yet will I not let to ſpeake the truth of the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> becauſe if the one haue ſurmounted <hi>Apoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in proweſſe by winning of the Firme-Iſland, the ſame being vnto him an exceeding great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo in like ſorte was the other worthy of no leſſe praiſe, who in one onely day ouerthrew tenne of the beſt knights in Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and ſlew the moſt redoubted Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Famongomad,</hi> and <hi>Baſigant</hi> his ſonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if <hi>Amadis</hi> did paſſe vnder the Arch of loyali louers, in whoſe fauour the Images of copper did ſound a more melodious tune, then it did for any other that euer proued the ſame aduenture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by manifeſting his loyalty, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in like ſort that the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> had as great an aduantage in gaining the the burning ſword, the which for the ſpace of threeſcore years no other could draw forth of his ſcabbard. Therfore Madame, it is not reaſon to take away the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> and without deſert to giue it vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> ſeeing that both in prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe and loyalty they may (as I thinke) equall one another. And as they were in theſe pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, a Damoſell came and told <hi>Amadis</hi> that the King asked for him, becauſe that <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Laudin</hi> his Nephew were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to acquite them of the promiſe that they had made by the meanes whereof <hi>Amadis</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to leaue the Lady, and to goe vnto the Court. By the way hee met with <hi>Bruneo</hi> and <hi>Branfil,</hi> who followed him, &amp; they found that <hi>Quedragant</hi> had begunne his ſpeech vnto the King, ſaying: It may pleaſe your Maieſty, I haue ſtayed heere for <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> according to the couenant that I made with the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> and now that hee is in the Court I will diſcharge me of my promiſe True it is that by force of armes, I was conſtrained to graunt vnto the <hi>Faire Forlorn</hi> that I ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from your company, vntill <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> were returned, and then hee being come before your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I ſhould ceaſe all quarrels that I had enterpriſed againſt him, for the death of king <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> my brother, and neuer after to demand any thing at his hands, therefore and in like ſort that I ſhould neuer hereafter beare arms againſt your Maieſty, or any of yours. Which matter hath ſince grieued me more then one would thinke, becauſe I could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the battaile, the which you had vndertaken againſt king <hi>Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadan</hi> and his followers, of the number of whome I thought to haue beene, but fortune was ſo contrary that my intent was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned farre otherwiſe then I had purpoſed, for the hate which I did beare vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> is conuerted into a moſt great amity, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that I doe manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue that fortune is wholly

determined to aduance him, as the the force which hee did ſhew in this laſt battaile can ſufficiently witneſſe, the honour whereof ought wholly to bee yeelded vnto him and to no other. For this cauſe it may pleaſe your Maieſty, ſeeing my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> is heere preſent, that firſt you will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge mee of that which I haue promiſed vnto him vnder a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary name, and as for him I remit all the euill will that I did beare vnto him, for the death of my late deceaſed brother king <hi>Abies,</hi> and I doe further intreate him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept mee for his companion and perpetuall friend. Sir <hi>Quedragant</hi> anſwered the King, you ſpeake like a prudent and wiſe knight, for what proweſſe or courage ſoeuer a Gentleman hath, if hee bee not gouerned by counſell &amp; reaſon, he is not worthy that any man ſhould make account of him. You are ſufficiently knowne for one of the beſt knights in the world, yet you may be aſſured that the fellowſhip which you demand of <hi>Amadis</hi> ſhal in no ſort deminiſh your praiſe &amp; renowne, you two continuing in mutuall amity together: and you may beleeue that hee will bee very glad to accept of the offer which you doe make vnto him. Is it not true gentle friend? ſayd the King vnto <hi>Amadis.</hi> If it like your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty anſwered he, <hi>Quedragant</hi> is ſo worthy a knight-that his fame is ſpread abroad in many places, and ſeeing that it pleaſeth him to chuſe mee for his conſort, I doe thankefully accept his kind offer. Herewithall they embraced, and ſo long did their friendſhippe thenceforth continue, that it was neuer ſeperated but by death. At the ſame time was <hi>Floreſtan</hi> &amp; <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> before the King, purchaſing their leaue to enter into the field, according to their appointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement (a good while before) in maintenance of <hi>Amadis</hi> his quarrell againſt <hi>Quedragant:</hi> but when they ſaw them friends their combate was finiſhed, and their hatred conuerted into amity, wherewith <hi>Landin</hi> was exceeding glad, for hee had already proued <hi>Floreſtan</hi> in the iourney againſt king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> and ſeene his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and proweſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus were theſe quarrels ended, &amp; how much the Court had here-tofore been troubled, by ſo much was the ioy and paſtime thereof increaſed, neuertheleſſe the King hauing not forgotten the miſerie wherein king <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Northwales</hi> and <hi>Angriota de Eſtrauaux</hi> remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, (after he had ſome few dayes ſtayed with the Ladies) he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke their deliuerance, and the better to effect the ſame, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to paſſe into the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> to ſet them at liberty, wherewith hee made his knights acquainted. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, your Maieſty doth know that my brother <hi>Galaor</hi> hath beene loſt in your ſeruice, therefore I beſeech you to excuſe mee from accompaning your grace in this voyage, for if God pleaſe my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins and I will goe ſeeke him as it is reaſon, and ſo ſoone as we haue found him, I aſſure your Maieſty that incontinently wee will follow vnto that place where wee ſhall heare your grace abideth.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow it happened the ſame day after the King had ſupped, as hee walked along a gallerie, being almoſt bed-time, hee beheld two ſtrange fires vpon the Sea, which came with great ſwiftneſſe directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cittie. Wherewith he was greatly amaſed, becauſe hee thought it very difficult that water and fire ſhould continue together, eſpecially when hee beheld in the midſt of theſe fires, a galley, at the maſt whereof were many great burning torches, ſo that one would haue iudged the veſſell had beene all on fire. This wonder did aſtoniſh the people ſo much that in a manner they came all forth of the Cittie, preſuming that ſeeing the Sea was not able to quench this fire, it was impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Cittie from being burnt to aſhes, if the ſame once tooke hold thereof, wherefore the King as fearfull as the reſt mounted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his horſe, and came forth with them vpon the ſands. And as hee came neere the water ſide, he did ſee that the moſt part of all the knights were already arriued, and amongſt the reſt was <hi>Amadis, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil,</hi> and <hi>Guillan,</hi> who were at that time ſo neere the galley, which was hard at ſhore, that he thought it impoſſible for them to eſcape from the fire thereof. Hereupon he ſet ſpurres to his horſe, becauſe hee tooke on exceedingly with the noyſe that was made, and whether hee would or no hee brought him cloſe to the galley ſide: vpon the which ſhortly after he ſaw a cloth lifted vp which couered it, and a Damoſell appeared clothed in white ſilke, that held a ſmall Cofer of gold in her hand, which ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, then ſhee tooke out of it a burning taper which ſhe caſt into the Sea, and preſently the two great fires vaniſhed away ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, that it was not perceiued what was become of them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the people were maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous glad, ſeeing that they were out of danger, for there remained no more light then that of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which burned vpon the maſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then the galley was plainly perceiued which was decked with many garlands of floures, &amp; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts began to ſound very ſweetly.

And ſhe marched forth firſt of all that had throwne the taper into the Sea, who comming a ſhoare did her duty vnto the King, and he receiued her very kindely, ſaying vnto her: Madame in ſatisfaction of the feare wherewith your fire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted vs, tell vs if you pleaſe who you are, although wee alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſurmiſe that we know you well enough. Your Maieſtie anſwered ſhe, is of ſuch a valiant courage, that it is impoſſible to terrifie you with ſo ſmall a thing, yet the fires which you haue ſeene were orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to no other ende but for the ſafety of my women and me when we are determined to goe by Sea. For the reſt if you thinke mee to bee <hi>Vrganda</hi> the <hi>vnknowne,</hi> your thought is true, and I am expreſly come into theſe parts to viſit you, as the beſt Prince in the earth, and the Queene alſo, who is one of the wiſeſt Ladies that liueth. Then ſhee called <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaying vnto him. My Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> come neer and I will tell you, (to eaſe you of the trauaile that you ſhould haue in ſeeking of <hi>Galaor)</hi> that your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is well, and ſo throughly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that you ſhall ſee him heere very ſhortly, therefore leaue off your determined ſearch of him, for hee is in ſuch a place as all the men in the world can neuer finde him. Madame anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> when hee was demanded of me by the Damoſels that carried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, I imagined that he ſhould be ſaued by you, and that no other but <hi>Vrganda</hi> would haue vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch an enterpriſe, which hath euer ſince put mee in good hope, without the which I thinke I had beene dead. For this one thing I am ſure of, that there is no knight in the world more bound to Lady or gentlewoman then I am to you, for the which I am not able to yeeld you ſuch condigne thanks as I doe owe, and you deſerue, but you know very well, that <hi>Amadis</hi> his life ſhall neuer be ſpared to do you ſeruice. Madame ſaid the king, will it pleaſe you to come and reſt you in my Pallace? Your Maieſty anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> ſhall pardon me, for I will remayne this night in my galley, and to morrow I wil doe whatſoeuer it ſhal pleaſe you, but <hi>Amadis, Agraies, Bruneo,</hi> and <hi>Guillan</hi> ſhall keepe mee companie, becauſe I knowe they are as amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as my ſelfe, and their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie will be a meanes to driue away all melanchollie. Doe what you will ſaid the King, for you ſhall be obeyed. Then he cauſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to returne vnto the Citty, and he himſelf (bidding <hi>Vrganda</hi> good night) departed, leauing for her guard a number of archers vpon the ſands: the next morning the Queene ſent vnto <hi>Vrganda</hi> twelue of her owne hacknies richly trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, vpon the which ſhee and her women entred into the Cittie, and <hi>Vrganda</hi> rode in the midſt of the foure knights which ſhe had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh detained to keep her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.

And this ſaide <hi>Vrganda,</hi> becauſe that ſhee languiſhed with extreame loue which ſhee did beare vnto the faire Knight, of whom in our

firſt booke wee haue mentioned vnto you. Their conference was no ſooner ended, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached neere vnto the Pallace, but the King who there had ſtaied, came forth to meete them, and as hee embraced <hi>Vrganda</hi> (bidding her heartily welcome) ſhe looked round about her vpon the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and beheld a great number of knights, in each place. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſhe ſayd, me thinks your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty is now royally accompanied, not onely for the multitude of great perſonages that are with you, but eſpecially for the loue which I am ſure they do beare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, for which you ought greatly to praiſe God. For the Prince that is beloued of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, may be ſure to maintaine his eſtate in great ſafety, therefore your Maieſty muſt endeauour to entertaine and vſe them Kingly, that your fortune (which hitherto hath fauoured you) do not forſake you if you doe otherwiſe: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things take heede of falſe reports, ſeeing that it is the very poyſon and ruine of ſuch Princes as giue credit vnto them. And as the King would haue brought her to her chamber, ſhe ſaid vnto him: may it pleaſe your Maieſty that I may firſt goe and doe my duty to the Queene? I with all my heart gentle Lady anſwered hee, I am ſure that ſhee will be moſt glad to ſee you, as ſhee that hath greatly deſired to honour and pleaſe you. Herewithall hee conducted her where the Ladies were, and ſo ſoone as the Queene did ſee her, ſhe roſe vp and kiſſed her, ſaying, that ſhe was exceeding welcome: then ſhee made her ſit downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Oriana</hi> &amp; <hi>Briolania,</hi> whom <hi>Vrganda</hi> had neuer yet ſeene: and ſhee found that <hi>Briolania</hi> was the faireſt Lady in they world, if <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> by her excellency had not ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed her beauty, and to ſpeake truth there was great difference betweene them two. Then <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> ſayde vnto the Queene: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I doe now finde that true which I haue euer heard reported: Which is, that the King was more accompanied with worthy knights then any other Chriſtian Prince, and you alſo attended vpon by the faireſt Ladies on the earth, for hee which conquered the Firm-Iſland (being a better knight then <hi>Apoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)</hi> &amp; the famous victory which ſo lately hath beene obtayned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> by the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the blood of ſo many Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants as there dyed, are ſufficient witneſſes of the one, and I am ſure (to proue the other) it will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be granted vnto me, that vnder the firmament it is not poſſible to finde fairer Ladies then theſe two heere, pointing to <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olania:</hi> but if your Court hath this preheminence, it is yet honoured for one thing and farre more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable, which is the loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty wherein loue is there main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, as well to be ſeene by the proofe of the burning ſword, and the kerchiefe beſet with flowers, which aduenture was performed in your preſence. When <hi>Oriana</hi> heard her goe ſo farre in her talke, her heart beganne to tremble, and ſhe became ſorry and penſiue, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt <hi>Vrganda</hi> would ſpeake more, in diſcloſing the ſecreſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Amadis</hi> and her.

By my faith anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> there is great cauſe why <hi>Amadis</hi> ſhould know better what ſhee was then I, for ſhee followed him, and after-ward hee deliuered her from the hands of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the enchanter, and from <hi>Lindoraq</hi> his Nephew, not without great daunger of his perſon.

The Queene could not refraine from laughter, and ſaide vnto <hi>Vrganda.</hi> Hitherto ſhe may be pardoned for any ſuch danger that ſhee hath as yet brought thoſe vnto of whom you ſpeake: and therefore for this time I bid you good night.

Now they were all foure lodged in one chamber together, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Vrganda</hi> perceiuing <hi>Briolania</hi> and <hi>Mabila</hi> to be faſt aſleepe, and <hi>Oriana</hi> awake, ſhee ſayd vnto her, Madame, if you now doe not take your reſt for thinking vpon him, that day and night doth wake for your loue, your quiet and his are both alike. I knowe not what you meane anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> but ſure I am, that loue neuer hindered me from ſleepe. <hi>Vrganda</hi> knew very well that ſhe made her this anſwer, becauſe ſhee would not that <hi>Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania</hi> ſhould vnderſtand the loue betwixt her and <hi>Amadis,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſayd vnto her: aſſure you that I am ſo carefull that your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets be not diſcloſed, as I will not offend you with any thing that I ſpeak, for I know what is needfull for you better then your ſelfe. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> you may waken the Gentlewomen that are in this chamber. Let me alone for that ſayd <hi>Vrganda,</hi> I will rid you ſtraight of this feare.

You know as well as I that hee loueth you, by the experience not onely of that which hath beene tolde you, and you haue made knowne vnto him, but alſo by the aduentures which hee hath brought to paſſe in your preſence: therefore you ought to thinke your ſelfe happy aboue all thoſe that are beſt beloued, being miſtreſſe of him, that deſerueth (by his chiualrie) to be Lord of all the world. Now it is time to wake the Ladies, &amp; end our diſcourſe. Here-withall ſhee began to read againe in her booke, and at that inſtant the Ladies that were aſleepe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to breath as if they had beene ouerwearied, and ſhortly after they roſe vp, but when the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> perceiued, that ſhee was laied in ſuch ſort naked in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the chamber, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer woman more amaſed then ſhe, the which when <hi>Oriana</hi> perceiued, ſhee demanded (ſmiling to her ſelfe) if ſhee were come thither to ſeeke freſh aire. By my faith Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, anſwered ſhe, I know neither who brought me hither, nor can I remember how I came hither. Whereat they all began to laugh: and after they were ready they went vnto the Kings lodging, whome they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d together with the Queen in the church: and ſo ſoone as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice was ended, the King came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Vrganda,</hi> and bid her good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſhee after her duty done vnto his Maieſtie, ſaide, that if it were his pleaſure to cauſe the Knights and Ladies in his Court to aſſemble together, that before her departure (which ſhould bee very ſhortly) ſhee would declare ſomething before them that ſhold happen vnto him, heereupon the King appointed a large hall to bee made ready, in the which the next morning a great number of Lords and Ladies were come. Then <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> beeing in the midſt of them all, addreſſing her ſpeech vnto the King, ſhee ſaide vnto him. Seeing that your Maieſtie hath kept the letters which I did write vnto you and <hi>Galaor,</hi> preſently after the <hi>Fair Forlorne</hi> had obtained the burning ſword, and the Damoſell the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife with flowres, it may pleaſe you now to cauſe them to be read, that euery one may plainely know that I am not ignorant of things before they happen. Heereupon hee ſent for them, and they were read before al the aſſiſtance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it plainely appeared that ſhee had wholly foretold the manner of the battaile, euen as it happened out, and they all greatly wondred thereat, eſpecially at the ſtout hears of the King, that would be in a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile ſo dangerous, when hee was before hand threatned ſo rigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his better. In like ſort was it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7181:199"/>
certainly known that the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> had been the cauſe of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, by the three blowes that hee gaue. The firſt when he caſt King <hi>Cildadan</hi> at <hi>Galaors</hi> feet, the ſecond in killing <hi>Sarmadan</hi> the Leonnois, and the third when hee ſuccoured the king, whom the ſtout <hi>Mandafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bul</hi> of the virmillion tower did car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto his ſhips, whoſe arme hee cut off cloſe by the elbow, which was the cauſe of his preſent death. And in like ſort that which ſhe had ſaid of <hi>Galaor</hi> was come to paſſe, for his head was certainly at the mercy of the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> at that time when the Damoſels deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to carry him away. But now, ſaid <hi>Vrganda,</hi> I will tell you in or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der that which muſt happen, great contention ſhall ariſe between the mighty ſerpent &amp; the ſtrong Lion, which ſhall be aided by many cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell beaſts, they ſhall come with ſuch fury, that a great numder of them ſhall ſuffer moſt cruel death.

In this time the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The tender licorne putting his mouth to the eare of the fierce Lion, ſhall awake him out of his ſound ſleepe with his loud crye, making him afterwards to take part of his beaſts, with the which hee ſhall ſpeedily goe to the ſuccour of the mighty ſerpent, whom they ſhall finde ſo bitten and wounded by theſe ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued wolues, that his blood ſhall bee aboundantly ſhed vpon the earth, at the ſame time ſhall he be deliuered from the teeth of the wolues, and they be cut in pieces. Then the life of the mighty ſerpent being reſtored (leauing within his den all the poyſon of his entrails) he ſhall bee contented to put him-ſelfe betweene the clawes of the ſtrong Lyon, and the white hind, who in the dreadfull Forreſt did lift vp her greeues to Heauen, ſhall bee taken from thence and called home againe. Wherefore noble King, may it pleaſe your Maieſtie to cauſe this to bee written, which before all this company I haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, for there is no doubt but all this ſhall come to paſſe. I will ſo doe, anſwered hee, ſeeing it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you, but I beleeue there is not any of vs that at the preſent vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands this propheſie. Aſſure you, ſaide ſhee, that a time will come when it ſhall be manifeſted vnto all of you. So ſaying ſhe caſt her eies vpon <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom ſhe perceiued to be maruailous penſiue, and ſaid vnto him.

At ſuch time as you ſhal be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to death in the defence of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others life, the ſmart being yours, and the profit his, the recompence that you ſhall reape thereby, ſhall be a wonderfull diſcontent, and a baniſhment from that whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you ſhall moſt deſire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Then ſhall your good

rich and ſharpe Sword ſo bruiſe your bones, and in ſo many places wound your fleſh, that with the loſſe of your blood you ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very feeble, and moreouer you ſhall bee ſo ſharpely purſued, that if halfe the world were yours, you would giue it, that your ſword were caſt into the bottom of ſome deepe lake, from whence it could neuer be taken forth againe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bethinke you of your deſtiny, which ſhall be ſuch as I haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told you. <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one had their eyes fixed vpon him, looked vp with a ſmiling countenance and anſwered <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> Madame, by the things that are already come to paſſe wherof you foretold vs, we may wel credit and beleeue that which now you tell vs, and knowing that I am mortal, I am very ſure that my life ſhall not be prolonged one minute longer then it pleaſeth God, and therfore whilſt I may, I will endeauour to gaine ſome reputation, rather then ſeeke to conſerue my life, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding if any perill were to be doubted, I ſhould haue more occaſion to feare thoſe that doe hourely happen vnto mee, then ſuch as are hidden &amp; yet to come.

I will tell you ſaid ſhe, The faire <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima</hi> accompanied with twelue Gentlewomen of great birth, ſhall bee ſent as hoſtages and become the Queenes priſoners, vnder this condition, that if this which I haue ſaid be not wholly accompliſhed, the king may cauſe them all to die in what ſort hee pleaſeth, and as touching you, I demand no other aſſurance, then this, that if you be vanquiſhed <hi>Madaſima</hi> may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward haue your head without contradiction.

Truly anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if the king and Queene haue theſe perſons which you ſpeake of in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the ſecurity is ſufficient, but yet you ſhall haue no anſwere of me, vnleſſe you firſt grant to dine with me in my lodging, with theſe two Eſquires that attend vpon you. I do greatly wonder ſaid ſhee, what moueth thee ſo inſtantly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate and inuite me to dine in thy company, ſeeing that I hate thee more then any man that I know.

Truely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, I will go more conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then I hoped for, and ſeeing it hath pleaſed the king to grant mee that which I requeſted, I aſſure you that without faile <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Gentlewomen with the knights, ſhall yeelde themſelues priſoners vnto his Maieſty and the Queene, ſo that alſo hee will bee pleaſed to warrant <hi>Ardan</hi> from all the reſt of his Court, except <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> from whom I hope he ſhall carry away the head. When <hi>Don Brunco</hi> heard this, hee anſwered the Damoſell, I haue many times ſeene one make account of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7181:201"/>
another mans head when hee hath loſt his owne, and the like may happen vnto <hi>Ardan,</hi> whom you ſo much exalt. Gentle friend ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> I pray you let this Gentle-woman ſpeake at her pleaſure, for one like vnto her ſelfe, for ſhe and ſuch as reſemble her, haue liberty to ſay what they liſt, and often-times more then they know. What are you ſir? anſwered the Gentle-woman vnto <hi>Bruneo,</hi> that ſo well can pleade for <hi>Amadis?</hi> I am, ſaid he, a knight that would willingly beare a part in this enterpriſe, if <hi>Ardan Canila</hi> had a companion with him. By my faith, anſwered ſhe, I beleeue that if you did think to bee receiued you would not ſpeake ſo proudly, but you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard that <hi>Ardan</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> muſt bee alone without any more, which maketh you to ſpeak ſo haughtily, neuertheleſſe if you be ſuch a one as you ſay; I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the combat of them two, ſhall be no ſooner ended, but that I will bring before you a brother of mine that ſhall teach you to hold your peace, and I aſſure you that hee is as great an enemy vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> as you profeſſe to bee his friend. He ſhall be very welcome, and better entertained ſaid he, and tell him hardly that he forget none of his Armour behinde him at his lodging, for be he neuer ſo valiant le will be all little enough for him. Herewithall hee threw downe his gloue. See here ſaid he my gage, take it vp for your brother, if hee will alow you to do it, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the combat that you haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for him. The Damoſell tooke vp the gloue, and afterward vntying from about her head a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenet of Gold, ſhe ſaid vnto the king, If it like your Maieſty, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the combat for my brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this knight in his abſence, in witneſſe whereof, your grace may keepe (if it pleaſe you) theſe two pledges, the which ſhee gaue vnto him, and the king receiued them, although hee would willingly haue remitted this quarrell, for hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready doubted the other, for that he had heard of the valiant deedes of <hi>Ardan Canila,</hi> who neuer did meete (as it was ſaide) with any knight in foure yeeres before, that durſt combat him. When the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell perceiued that ſhe had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted her commiſſion, according vnto her deſire, ſhe tooke leaue of the Court, and went with <hi>Amadis,</hi> who brought her vnto his lodging but it had been better for him that he had beene at that time a ſleepe, for the courteſie which hee did ſhew vnto her, turned him to ſo great diſpleaſure, that ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was in great danger to haue loſt his life. Becauſe that he would the more honour this Damoſel, he brought her into that Chamber wherein <hi>Gandalin</hi> did beſtow his Armour. But ſhee had no ſooner ſet her foote in the ſame, but ſhee caſt her eyes vpon <hi>Amadis</hi> his good Sword, which ſhee thought was of ſo ſtrange a faſhion, that from that time forth, ſhe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſteale it, if ſhee might finde the meanes, and to doe the ſame more cleanly, ſhe walked ſo long about the chamber, that as <hi>Amadis</hi> and his people had their backs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, ſhe ſlily drew the ſword forth of the ſcabbard, and held it vp cloſe vnder her cloake. Afterwards ſhee preſently went forth of the chamber, and taking aſide one of the Eſquires (in whom ſhee moſt truſted) ſhe gaue it vnto him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: doeſt thou know what thou ſhalt do? run quickly into my ſhip, and hide me this Sword vnder the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7181:201"/>
ballaſt in ſuch ſort that none doe ſee it vpon thy life. The Eſquire was diligent and departed. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> entred into talke with the Damoſell, demanding of her at what houre <hi>Madaſima</hi> would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue in the Court. I beleeue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe, that you may ſee her, and ſpeake with her before the king haue dined: but what moues you faire ſit to enquire ſo much after her? Becauſe ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi> I would go meete her vpon the way to doe her honour and ſeruice, to the end that if ſhee haue receiued any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure by mee, I may make her ſuch mends as ſhe ſhall demand of me. I know anſwered ſhe, that if thou run not away, <hi>Ardan Canila</hi> ſhall be he that ſhall make thee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the wrong that thou haſt done vnto her, with the loſſe of thy head, the which hee ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto her, for other ſatisfaction ſhe deſireth not to accept. I will keepe them both faſting without that (if God pleaſe) ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> neuertheleſſe if ſhee will haue any other thing of mee, I ſweare vnto thee, by my faith Damſel, that ſhe ſhall haue it, as ſhee whoſe good will and fauour I doe moſt deſire. Then were the Tables couered, &amp; dinner was brought in, wherefore <hi>Amadis</hi> cauſing her to ſit downe, deſirous to leaue her alone, ſaid vnto her, that the king had ſent for him, and that ſhee in the meane time ſhould make good cheere, for hee would returne preſently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The Damoſell ſhewed by her countenance that this depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his did not a little pleaſe her and fearing leaſt her theft ſhould be perceiued, ſhe made as ſhort a dinner as ſhe could. Which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhe roſe from the Table, and ſaid vnto thoſe that ſerued her, you may tell <hi>Amadis</hi> that I giue him no thankes at al for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement that he hath ſhewed me, thinking thereby to do me honor, and aſſure him that I am ſhee that wil purchaſe (as long as the breath remaineth in my Body) his death and vtter deſtruction. So God me helpe, anſwered <hi>Enil,</hi> I beleeue it well, and according to that which you haue already manifeſted, in my opinion you are the moſt iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious woman that I haue ſeene in all my life. Whatſoeuer I am, ſaid ſhe, I care not for thee, and leſſe for him, and if thou thinkeſt mee iniurious, yet is it not ſo much as I would be both towards him and thee, and for the paines that thou haſt taken in ſeruing mee this day at dinner, I would in recompence thereof, that I had ſeene you both twaine hanged. Saying ſo, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted and got into her ſhip, very ioyful of the Sword which ſhe had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> had conſented vnto the combat which ſhe had demanded of him. Is it true? anſwered <hi>Ardan,</hi> let me neuer bee accounted a knight of any worth, if I doe not then bring back againe my Lady to her honour and reputation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering henceforth her countrey from the attempts of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and if I take not the head of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii</hi> from off his ſhoulders in leſſe time then the beſt footeman in the world may haue run halfe a league, I am content (ſaid he vnto <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima)</hi> not to deſerue your loue ſo long as I liue. But ſhee hearing him ſpeake ſo raſhly, held her peace: and although ſhe greately deſired to be reuenged of him for the death of her Father, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſlaine, yet
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7181:202"/>
did ſhe ſo extreamely abhorre <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> that ſhee a great deale rather wiſhed his death then his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee pretended to marry her. For ſhe was exceeding faire, and be a deformed villaine and voide of all humanity, and this combat was not practiſed by her meanes, but by the perſwaſion of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had ſent for him, for the defence of her Countrie vpon this condition, that if he reuenged the death of her husband and ſonne, ſhe would giue it vnto him, and her daughter <hi>Madaſima</hi> in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for hee was ſo feared and had in ſuch reputation, that ſhee thought ſhe could not beſtow her daughter better. And to let you know his manners and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hee was deſcended from the race of giants, borne in a Prouince called <hi>Canila,</hi> the which was in a manner wholly inhabited by ſuch kinde of people, notwithſtanding hee was ſomewhat leſſe of body then they, but not in ſtrength: his ſhoulders were narrow, his necke and breſt vnreaſonable thicke, his hands and thighes large, his legs long and crooked, his eyes holow, flat noſed like an Ape, his noſtrels wide and lothſome, his lips great, his haire red and thicke briſtelled in that ſort, as very hardly might it be cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>led. To conclude, he was ſo beſet with freckles and blacke ſpots, that his face ſeemed as though it had been of ſundry ſorts of fleſh, hee was of the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres or thereabout, bold and expert in armes, furious, ſpitefull, and as vncourteous as might bee. And yet ſince hee was twenty and fiue yeeres of age, he neuer fought with any Giant or other knight, eyther a foote, a horſeback, or at wreſtling, that was able to reſiſt him, &amp; whom he did eaſily not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercom: ſuch was the beauty, faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gentle behauiour of <hi>Ardan Canila.</hi> When the iniurious Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell heard <hi>Ardan</hi> make ſuch large promiſes vnto <hi>Madaſima,</hi> &amp; perceiued that ſhee made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof, ſhe tooke vpon her to ſpeake in her behalfe, me thinks my Lord that you ſhould thinke the victory very ſure on your ſide, ſeeing that Fortune is ſo fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto you, and ſo contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your enemy, as you may well perceiue, in that ſhee hath cauſed him to loſe the beſt part of his armes. And this ſhee ſaid in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſword which ſhe had ſtolne. By my Gods, ſaid <hi>Ardan,</hi> I am more glad of his diſpleaſure for the want thereof, then for any good that I hope to receiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, for although <hi>Amadis</hi> had the force of three ſuch as hee is, yet were hee not able to withſtand the ſtrength of my arme, accuſtomed to tame his betters. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very early hee departed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and and the reſt which ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vp as hoſtages, according to the promiſe that the Damoſell had made vnto king <hi>Liſuart</hi> before the Combat was agreed vpon, and <hi>Canila</hi> did aſſuredly hope, that he ſhould eaſily obtaine the victory. By meanes whereof hee departed with great ioy, ſaying vnto thoſe that were with him, <hi>Amadis</hi> is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſed for one of the beſt knights in the world, neuertheleſſe I will haue his head, if he dare enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the liſts againſt me, and by that meanes my glory ſhal be the more increaſed in the ouercomming of him, my Lady ſhall reſt well reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and I remaine her husband and louer. And becauſe he would know before hee entred into the court, whether <hi>Amadis</hi> had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7181:202"/>
him or not, hee ſent the iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Damoſell before, to aduertiſe the King of their comming, and in the meane ſeaſon hee cauſed his tents to be ſet vp, ſomewhat neere the Cittie where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> did remaine. But you muſt know, that incontinently after the Damoſell was departed from <hi>Amadis</hi> his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, <hi>Enil</hi> told him thereof: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe he would prouide all things neceſſary for his enterpriſe, hee withdrew him vnto his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, accompanied with ſome of his moſt priuat friends, and in like ſort there came at that inſtant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Floreſtan, Agraies, Galuanes</hi> without land, and <hi>Guillan</hi> the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, who were altogether ignorant of the enterpriſe of this new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. But when they were aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereof, thinking that it ſhould haue beene performed with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of knights, ther was not any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who were not diſpleaſed with <hi>Amadis,</hi> in that he had not cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to aſſiſt him therein, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Guillan</hi> who greatly deſired to proue his man-hood againſt <hi>Arda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Canila,</hi> for he had heard that he was eſteemed for one of the ſtrongeſt Knights in all the Weſt. And as he was about to reprou <hi>Amadis</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting him, <hi>Floreſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him, ſaying vnto his brother. So God helpe me, my Lord, I now doe very wel perceiue, the little loue and the ſmall account that you doe make of me, in that you would not ſend for me to be with you in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. In faith, anſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> if hee had thought mee any thing worth, he would not haue left mee behinde, and what of me? ſaid <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes.</hi> My Lords, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I beſeech you all to holde mee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and not to bee diſpleaſed with mee, aſſuring you that if it had beene in my choyſe to haue elected a companion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they all agreed: ſo that the day following (knowing that ſhe was neere at hand) <hi>Amadis</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with eight of the beſt knights in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, mounted on Horſe-backe in very good order. But they had not long ridden when they did behold her a farre off, comming with <hi>Ardan Canila,</hi> who did lead her, &amp; ſhe was apparrelled all in black, mourning as yet for the death of her father, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſlain. This ſad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell did ſo much grace her, that although of her ſelfe (without any other helpe) ſhe was eſteemed one of the faireſt that might be ſeen, yet was her beauty much more encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by this mourning weede, with the which the liuely whiteneſſe of her face was the more manifeſted, by the grace which this blacke

                        <desc>•</desc>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde her marched the twelue gentlewomen, apparrelled with the like attire. After them came the old giant, and his ſon followed with nine knights, which all came as pledges. Great was the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement that <hi>Amadis</hi> ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her and the reſt of her traine, and ſhee in like ſort ſaluted them moſt courteouſly. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> approching more neere, ſaid vnto her, I promiſe you Madame that if you bee accounted faire and of good behauiour it is not without great cauſe, ſeeing that I am now my ſelf an eye witneſſe of the truth thereof, and truly that man ought to thinke himſelfe happy, whoſe ſeruice it ſhal pleaſe you to like of, aſſuring you that I am willing to do you any pleaſure, and ready to obey your commandements: when <hi>Ardan Canila</hi> heard him ſpeake ſo courteouſly (although hee was finally fauoured by <hi>Madaſima)</hi> hee was ouercome with iealouſie, and anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> knight ſtand back and ſpeake not ſo priuately vnto her, whom you know not. Sir ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the cauſe of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither is not onely to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, but alſo to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto her my perſon and my goods. You are no doubt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he ſome good fellow, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be by her greatly imployed, neuertheleſſe faire ſir, get you gone from her, otherwiſe I will make you know that it is not for ſo baſe a companion as you, to vſe ſo great familiarity with a woman of ſo high worth as ſhe is. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I am anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> yet do I deſire to ſerue her, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your threats, for although I am not of that worth as I would be, yet ſhall not the affection that I beare vnto her, bee abated by thy malapert boldneſſe. But ſir, you that are ſo luſty, who would make me know my duty &amp; depart from her, for whom willingly I would employ my beſt meanes, tell mee what you are? <hi>Ardan Canila</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding angry, beholding <hi>Amadis</hi> with a ſterne and ſcornefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance anſwered him, I am <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> who am better able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe her welfare and honour in one day, then thou canſt with the beſt meanes thou haſt, doe her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in all thy life. It may very well be ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> notwithſtanding I know that this whereof thou vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhall neuer by thee bee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo indiſcreete and ſpightfull art thou.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe that thou greatly deſireſt to know whether I am a ſufficient man or not, know thou that my name is <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> againſt whom thou deſireſt to fight: and if this Lady be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ought that I haue ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, I wil make her ſuch amends therefore as ſhee ſhall pleaſe to command at my hands.

That would diſpleaſe me meruailouſly, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> but I will giue her a head that ſhall bee more welcom to her (if ſhe pleaſe) breaking the marriage of you two, being ſo far vnfit one for another: for ſhe is faire, wiſe, and of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behauiour, &amp; thou deformed fooliſh &amp; churliſh, Hereat <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> &amp; the Gentlewomen began all

And becauſe it is already very late, and that the night approacheth, it were better to deferre the combate vntill to morrow morning.

But all that while was <hi>Amadis</hi> in the Church deuoutly praying.

In this ſort did <hi>Amadis</hi> enter into the field, into the which he was no ſooner come but that he did his dutie vnto the Ladies, and amongſt them all he ſpied out <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> who the more to encreaſe his courage did put her head forth of the window. And ſmiling kindely vpon him, ſhe made a ſigne vnto him that he ſhould ſomethings do for her loue, wherwith <hi>Amadis</hi> did imagine that all the force in the world was at that inſtant placed round about his heart, and hee thought that <hi>Ardan Canila</hi> ſtayed too long before hee came. In the meane time he buckled on his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met &amp; retyred to that part of the field where they appointed. Iudges were ſeated, which were <hi>Don Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan, Quedragant,</hi> &amp; <hi>Brandoinas.</hi> And ſhortly after came <hi>Ardan</hi> in richly armed, mounted vpon a great ſtrong horſe, and hee had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck a ſhield of fine ſteele ſhining as bright as burning glaſſe. At his ſide did hang the good ſworde of <hi>Amadis,</hi> holding in his hand a great huge Launce, the which he weelded ſo ſtrongly, that notwithſtanding the thickneſſe thereof, hee ſhaked it with ſuch force, that he made it double in his fiſt. Whereat <hi>Oriana, Mabila,</hi> and the other Ladies beholding the ſterne countenance of <hi>Ardan</hi> (as it often happeneth in thoſe things which one feareth to to loſe) they beganne to bee in doubt of him whom they all fauoured, ſo as <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> ſayd: Alas if God take not pittie vpon <hi>Amadis,</hi> this day will be his laſt.

Then <hi>Amadis</hi> beholding <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſet ſpurres vnto his horſe, and they both met ſo rudely, that their Launces were broken into ſhiuers, encountring together with their ſhieldes &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſo forcibly, that <hi>Ardan</hi> his horſe fell down dead in the place, and the other of <hi>Amadis</hi> had his ſhoulder broken, neuertheleſſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> with great lightneſſe roſe vp, although the truncheon of his enemies Lance remained ſticking in his vambraces, the which hee preſently pulled forth, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his ſword, hee valiantly marched againſt <hi>Ardan Canila,</hi> who in like ſort with great paine was riſen vp. And as hee ſtayed to mend his helmet which was ſome-what ſhaken with his fall, ſeeing his enemy approach, hee made head againſt him, and there began betweene them ſo cruell an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, as there was not any man preſent that did not greatly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereat, for with the ſparkles of fire which preceeded by their ſtrokes from their helmets, they ſeemed to bee all on fire, and by their waighty blowes which with great proweſſe were beſtowed, they mainfeſted the hate which they did beare vnto each other, for there was not one blowe ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but the blood followed, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it ſeemed that <hi>Ardan</hi> had the aduantage ouer his enemy, as well becauſe of the ſhield of ſteele which he had, as alſo for the hurt which hee did with the ſword of <hi>Amadis,</hi> which the iniurious Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell had giuen him. But yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> followed him ſo neare, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes hee brought him out of breath, wherewith <hi>Ardan</hi> was much abaſhed, and hee verly thought that in all his life hee had not found a knight that handled him ſo rudely, eſpecially hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined his enemies force to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled when moſt of all his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. Whereat as it were diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that hee ſhould ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, couering him with his ſhield, hee ran vpon <hi>Amadis,</hi> who had all his armour and ſhield in ſuch ſort hacked and broken, that he could not wel tel wherewith to defend him any more, becauſe that <hi>Ardan</hi> neuer faſtened blowe vpon him but that his fleſh f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then was <hi>Madaſima</hi> very ſorry hereat, for ſhe was a woman of ſo ſtout a heart that ſhe would rather haue loſt her land and herſelfe then to marry him, and ſo long theſe two knights maintained the combate, that euery one did mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile how they were able to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. But <hi>Oriana</hi> ſeeing the pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eſtate of <hi>Amadis</hi> and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whereunto hee was brought, by the reaſon that his armour was ſo broken, ſhe was likely to haue ſounded, &amp; ſhe became very pale and out of heart, vntill <hi>Mabila</hi> perceiuing it, ſayd vnto her. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame it is no time now to leaue <hi>Amadis</hi> in this perill, ſeeing that if you turne your backe, you haſten his end, and depriue him of his victory, at the leaſt if you cannot beholde him, turne your face quite from him.

Truſt mee you ſay true anſwered <hi>Grumedan,</hi> and I am very ſorry for it. Of my faith ſayd <hi>Quedragant,</hi> I haue prooued <hi>Amadis</hi> when I fought with him, but the longer he fighteth, the ſtronger and more inuincible hee waxeth, ſo that it ſeemeth each houre his force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, the which is not ſo with <hi>Ardan,</hi> as by proofe you may now ſee by his vnweeldineſſe, &amp; more ſhall you ſee before the battaile be ended. This ſpeech was heard by <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila,</hi> where-with they were greatly comforted, and becauſe he had ſeene <hi>Oriana</hi> almoſt ready to depart from the window, not daining any longer to behold him, hee thought ſhee was diſpleaſed, for that hee defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo long to get the victorie of his enemy. Whereat hee was ſo grieued, that griping his ſworde faſt in his fiſt, hee ſtroke ſo ſound a blow vpon the helmet of <hi>Ardan,</hi> that hee made him bowe one knee to the ground, but by miſchance his ſword broke in three peeces, the leaſt whereof remained in his hand. Then did hee thinke his life in very great danger, &amp; there was not any of the beholders that did not ſuppoſe him vanquiſhed, and <hi>Ardan</hi> victor: who began to lift vp his arme, ſaying ſo loud that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one did heare: behold <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> the good ſworde which with wrong thou gotteſt, by the which thou ſhalt receiue a ſhamefull death.

By meanes whereof, hee either determined to die ſpeedily, or to be reuenged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his enemy ſuddenly, and the better to execute his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee leaped vnto his enemy ſo lightly, that before <hi>Ardan</hi> could ſtrike him, hee pulled the ſhield from his necke, and then ſtepping alittle aſide, he took vp a trunche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Lance, that lay in the field, and hee thought to haue thruſt it thorough the ſight of <hi>Ardan</hi> his helmet: but hee went backe, and lifting vp his ſworde hee ſtroke ſo ſtreat a blowe within the ſhield which <hi>Amadis</hi> did hold, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>although

Who purſued him ſo cloſe, that he pulled his helmet from his head, and lifting vp his arme hee woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him moſt cruelly, ſo that hee fell from the top of the Rocke downe into the Sea, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after ſeene. For the which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praiſed God, eſpeciall king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> of <hi>Northwales,</hi> and <hi>Angriotta de Eſtrauaux,</hi> becauſe they had ſeen <hi>Amadis</hi> in ſuch daunger that they greatly ſtood in feare of his ſafety.

                  <argument>
                     <p>How <hi>Bruneo de Bonne Mer</hi> did fight with <hi>Madamaine</hi> the ambitious, brother to the Damoſell iniurious, and of the accuſations that were made by ſome of the enemies of <hi>Amadis</hi> vnto the King, for which cauſe hee and many others (that were deſirous to follow him) departed from the Court.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next day after the combate was ended between <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Ardan</hi> (as hath beene related heretofore) the iniurious Damoſell came and preſented herſelfe before the king, beſeeching his Maieſty to ſend him that ſhould fight with her brother, whom according vnto promiſe ſhee had cauſed to come thither. For (ſayd the Damoſell) although my brother be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and cannot take that reuenge of his enemies as the friends of <hi>Ardan</hi> may reſt ſatisfied for his death, yet will it bee ſome ſmall comforth vnto them notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Now <hi>Brunco</hi> was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who (without making ſtay, anſwered to the reſh ſpeeches of the fooliſh woman) ſaid vnto the the King. If it like your Maieſty, I am the man ſhe ſpeaketh of, and ſeeing that her brother is come hither as ſhee ſaith, if it be your pleaſure and his will, wee ſhall quickly know if hee be ſuch a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant as hee vaunteth. Vnto the which the King condiſcended. Wherefore they both went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to arme them, and anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they entred into the field, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were accompanied with certaine knights their friends. They beeing then in the place aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for that purpoſe, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounded to warne them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the combate. Forthwith they charged their Launces, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpurres to their horſes, they ranne the one againſt the other ſuch force that their Launces flew into ſhiuers, &amp; encountring each other with their ſhieldes and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>Madamain</hi> loſt his ſtirrops, and was vnhorſed, &amp; <hi>Bruneo</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the left ſide. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo ſoone as hee had finiſhed his carreer, hee turned himſelfe to his enemy, and ſaw that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready recouered his feet, and held his ſword in his hand in a readines to defend himſelfe: but as <hi>Bruneo</hi> drew neere to charge him, he ſayd to him: Sir knight alight, or elſe aſſure you that I will kill your horſe. Truely ſayd <hi>Bruneo,</hi> at your choyce bee it, for it is all one to me, to ouercome you on foote or on horſebacke. When <hi>Madamain</hi> ſaw that his wiſh came to a good end, being as he thouhgt ſtronger then his enemy, who was but little, and himſelfe in a manner a Gyant, he was moſt glad thereof, and ſayd to <hi>Bruneo,</hi> It were better for you to alight, and then you ſhould ſoon make profe whether you were able to effect that which you make brags of: well quoth <hi>Brunco,</hi> &amp; ſo withdrawing himſelfe he alighted &amp; left his horſe, then he tooke his ſhield &amp; ſet hand to his ſword, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching vnto <hi>Madamain,</hi> who like a valiant &amp; ſtout knight recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him coragiouſly. They began to lay on load the one at the other both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pretending to get the victory, which was the cauſe that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7181:207"/>
neither ſhield nor armour of how good temper ſoeuer, was able to withſtand their blowes, for they hacked them to peeces, ſo that the field in many places was couered with peeces of their ſhields. Now if the knights did aſſaile one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with great hardineſſe, their horſes did no leſſe, for they ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one another, and with their feete and teeth fighting together, they did ioyne in ſuch ſort, that the moſt part of the lookers on, were more intentiue to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the beaſts, then the fight of the knights. Notwithſtanding <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damain</hi> his horſe in the ende had the worſe, being conſtrained to leape ouer the barriers, and to run away. This gaue a great preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to euery man to imagine that <hi>Bruneo</hi> ſhould obtaine the victory, and ſo it fell out, for hee purſued <hi>Madamain</hi> ſo neere, and brought him to that extreamity, that being almoſt out of breath, he ſayd vnto <hi>Bruneo.</hi> I doe beleeue conſidering the rage thou art in, that thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſt the day will not bee long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to end our quarrell. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, if thou doeſt conſider, that thy armour is almoſt vnriuited, thou ſhalt finde that it were better for thee to reſt thy ſelfe, then to aſſaile mee ſo vndiſcreetly as thou doeſt, and therefore I being vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to vſe thee ſo rigourouſly as thou deſerueſt, I am content to giue thee leaue to take breath, that we may afterwards begin the fight more hotly then before. <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> anſwered, thou declareſt in plaine tearmes that which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for thy ſelfe. Wherefore I pray thee as luſtie as thou art, not to ſpare mee a whit. Art thou ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the occaſion of our combate? Knoweſt thou not that either thy head or mine muſt ceaſe this ſtrife? I doe aſſure thee that I am no more determined to liſten vnto thy preaching: wherefore if thou determine not to dy preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, looke to thine owne defence, better then thou haſt done here-tofore. Immediately without any further diſputations hee aſſailed <hi>Madamain</hi> afreſh, but hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo weake (as not being able ſo much as to defend <hi>Bruneo</hi> his blowes) hee drew himſelfe by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little to the top of a Rock, euen to the place where <hi>Amadis</hi> had caſt the body of <hi>Ardan</hi> into the Sea. And there <hi>Bruneo</hi> thruſt him ſo rudely downe, that he ſent him to be buried in the Sea, but before hee came to the bottome, his body was torne in twenty ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peeces. Which the iniurious Damoſell perceiuing, ſhe entred into ſuch fury and diſpaire, that as a mad woman ſhee ranne vnto the place where <hi>Ardan</hi> and <hi>Madamain</hi> were throwne downe headlond, where finding <hi>Madamain</hi> his ſword, ſhe ſet it to her breaſt, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo loud that all the companie heard her, Seeing that <hi>Ardan</hi> the flower of chiualrie, &amp; my brother haue choſen their graue in this raging Sea, I will beare them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And becauſe that the Queene <hi>Briolania</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that <hi>Amadis</hi> was not like to be cured in a ſhort ſpace, nor to accompany her as hee had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhe tooke her leaue of him to go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Briola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> departed, bidding <hi>Oriana</hi> fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, aſſuring her that ſhe ſhould be aduertiſed what happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her in trying the aduentures of the Iſland, but ſhee was no ſooner gone from the Court, when it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Fortune endeauoured the ruine of the kingdom of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which had ſo long time liued in happineſſe. Yea euen king <hi>Liſuart</hi> himſelfe, who (forgetting not onely the ſeruices hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of <hi>Amadis,</hi> of his kindred and friends, but eſpecially the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and counſell of <hi>Vrganda)</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to flatterers, two ancient knights of his houſe, to whom (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of the long educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had receiued, as well of the King <hi>Falangris</hi> his eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as of himſelfe) hee gaue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, beleeuing their vntrothes which he ought not to haue done, as you ſhall preſently vnderſtand. Theſe two of whom I ſpeake as wel by reaſon of their ancient age, as of a kinde of hypocriſie, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with wiſedome, tooke more paines to ſeeme good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then to bee ſo in deede, by meanes whereof they entred into great authority, and were often-times called and made priuie to the moſt ſecret affaires of their Lord, one of them was named <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadan,</hi> and the other <hi>Gandandell.</hi> This <hi>Gandandell</hi> had two ſonnes, who before the comming of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and of his followers into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> were eſteemed two of the moſt hardieſt knights in all the countrey, notwithſtanding the proweſſe and dexteritie of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did abate the renowne of thoſe whom I ſpeake of. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at their father was ſo diſpleaſed, that forgetting the feare of God, the faith which hee ought to his Prince, and the honour which all men of honeſty ought to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withall, determined not onely to accuſe <hi>Amadis,</hi> but likewiſe all thoſe whom hee eſteemed as his friends, and did conuerſe withall, hoping to build his treaſon in ſuch ſort, that by the ruine of ſo many good knights, he would worke his owne &amp; his friends profit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding the King on a time at leaſure, hee vſed ſpeeches of like ſubſtance vnto him. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, I haue all my life long deſired to bee faithfull vnto you, as to my King and naturall Lord, euen as my duty bindeth mee, and will yet continue, if it pleaſe God, for beſides the oath of fidelity which I haue ſworne vnto you, you haue of your gracious fauour heaped ſo many benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> a vpon mee, that if I ſhould not counſell you, in that which did concerne your royall Maieſty, I ſhould commit a great fault both towardes God and men. In conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof if it like your Maieſty, after I had long weighed with my ſelfe that which I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you, I haue often repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I deferred the matter ſo long, not for any malice I beare vnto any man (as God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) but onely for the damage which I ſee ready to enſue, if your Maieſty do not ſpeedily and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeke remedy to preuent it. Your Maieſty knoweth that of long time there hath beene great controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betweene the kingdomes of <hi>Gaule</hi> and great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> becauſe that the Kings your predeceſſors, haue alwaies pretended title of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7181:208"/>
ſoueraigntie thereunto. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that for ſome time this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell hath line dead, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is likely that thoſe of that Countrey (calling to minde the warres and domages they haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by your ſubiects) haue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly determined to take reuenge thereof. And in my opinion, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> who is chiefe and principall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, is not come into this Countrey, but to practiſe and gaine your people: who (ioyned with the forces which he may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly land heere) will ſo trouble you, that it will be hard for you to reſiſt them. And I beſeech you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whither the likelyhood there-of bee not already very apparent. Moreouer your Maieſtie may bee pleaſed to conſider that he of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſpeake, and thoſe of his aliance likewiſe, haue done mee ſo much honour and pleaſure, that both I and my children are greatly boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnto them, and were it not that you are my ſoueraigne Lord, I would in no wiſe pleake againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> but in thoſe things which concerne your perſon, let mee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiue death, then that I ſpare any man liuing were he mine own ſonne. You haue receiued <hi>Amadis</hi> with ſo great number of his parents and other ſtrangers into your Court (like a good and liberall Prince as you are) that in the end, their traine will become greater then your owne, wherefore if it like your Maieſty, it were good to fore-ſee this matter before the fire bee kindled any further. When the King heard <hi>Gandandel</hi> ſpeake in this ſort, he became very penſiue, and afterwards anſwered him: In faith louing friend, I beleeue that you aduertiſe mee as a good and faithfull ſubject, neuertheleſſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeruices that they of whom you ſpeake haue done vnto me, I cannot be perſwaded in my mind, that they would procure or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any treaſon againſt me. May it pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwered he, that is it which deceiueth you, for if they had heretofore offended you, you would haue beene ware of them as of your enemies, but they can wiſely cloake their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended treaſon, colouring it with an humble ſpeech, accompanied with ſome ſmall ſeruices, wherein they haue employed themſelues, watching a time of more fit oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The King turned his head on the one ſide without anſwering any farther, becauſe there came ſome Gentlemen vnto him, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe <hi>Gandandel</hi> being as yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how the King had taken his aduertiſement, he practiſed with <hi>Brocadan,</hi> and drew him vnto his league, declaring vnto him the whole diſcourſe which he had with the King, aſſuring him that if they might baniſh <hi>Amadis</hi> and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that from thenceforth they two alone ſhould gouerne the king and his Realme peacebly. <hi>Brocadan</hi> receiuing this counſell for good, did afterwards imprint in the King his minde ſo great iealoſie, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition againſt <hi>Amadis</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, as from that day hee hated them in ſo ſtrange a ſort, that hee could not in a manner abide to ſee them, forgetting the great ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces performed by them, as well when he and <hi>Oriana</hi> were deliuered from the hands of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the battaile againſt King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> and in many other places heretofore recited. Truely if this King had well remembred the counſell and aduiſe which hee had receiued of <hi>Vrganda,</hi> hee had not ſo farre digreſſed from the bounds of reaſon, although that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7181:208"/>
the like malady doth often haunt al Princes, when they take not heed of falling into the like accidents and danger as King <hi>Liſuart</hi> did. Who giuing credit to the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words of theſe traitors, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer afterwards viſit (as hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed) <hi>Amadis</hi> and the others that were wounded, whereat they were not a little abaſhed, but to doe them the more diſpite he ſent for <hi>Madaſima</hi> and other pledges, vnto whom he ſayde, that if within eight dayes the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza</hi> were not yeelded vnto him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their promiſe, that then hee would ſuddainly cauſe their heads to be ſmitten off. When <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſima</hi> heard this rigorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, neuer was woman more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, conſidering, that in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the will of the King, ſhee ſhould remaine poore and vtterly diſhereted, and on the other ſide, denying to ſatisfie his beheſt, ſhee did ſee her death prepared, ſo that ſhe was in ſuch perplexitie, as not being able to anſwere him, ſhe had recourſe vnto her teares. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Andaugell</hi> the old Gyant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King, ſaying. If it pleaſe your Maieſtie, I will go with thoſe whom you ſhall appoint to ſend, vnto the mother of <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and I will deale with her in that ſort, as ſhee ſhall accompliſh your will, yeelding the Countrey and places which you demand, otherwiſe your Maieſtie may doe your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with vs. This the King liked well of, and euen that day he ſent him with the Eearle <hi>Latin,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her women to bee carryed back to their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med priſon, whether they were brought by diuers Gentlemen. Whom ſhe moued greatly to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie her eſtate, by the complaints and ſorrowfull lamentation that ſhe made vnto them, praying eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them particularly to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in her behalfe vnto the King, ſo that there was not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, who promiſed not to doe for her as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they could, eſpecially <hi>Don Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes,</hi> who at that time held her by the arme, beholding her with ſuch an eye, as hee became of her ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, and ſaid vnto her: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I am ſure that if it would pleaſe you to accept mee for your husband, the King would freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon vs all the right that he pretendeth in your Countrey. I beeleeue alſo that you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of my nobility, being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that by me your authoritie ſhall not be deminiſhed. For the reſt, aſſure your ſelfe that I will vſe you as you are worthy. Now <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima</hi> had known him of long time, &amp; ſhe was aſſured that he was one of the beſt Knights in the world. Wherefore accepting the offers of <hi>Galuanes,</hi> ſhee fell downe at his feete, moſt humbly thanking him for the good and honour which he did offer vnto her, and euen then was the marriage betweene them agreed vpon, the which afterward <hi>Galuanes</hi> laboured to effect to his vttermoſt power. And the better to accompliſh it, ſome few dayes after he came vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> making them acquainted with that which you haue heard, and <hi>Agraies</hi> ſaid vnto him: Vnkle, I know very well that loue hath no reſpect of perſons, ſparing neither young nor olde, and ſeeing that you are become one of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, we will beſeech the King ſo much in your behalfe, that you ſhall enioy your deſired loue, therefore determine to behaue your ſelfe like a luſty champion for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7181:209"/>
                     <hi>Madaſima</hi> is a woman, not likely to bee pleaſed with a kiſſe onely By my faith (anſwered <hi>Amadis)</hi> my Lord <hi>Galuanes,</hi> the King in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, will not refuſe vs, and I promiſe you that ſo ſoone as I am able to walke, your Nephew and I will goe vnto his Maieſty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat that which you demand. But you muſt vnderſtand that whileſt theſe things were in doing, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> the better to couer &amp; diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the treaſon which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, did goe oftentimes to ſee and viſit <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſo that one time amongſt the reſt hee ſayd to him: my Lord, it is long ſince you ſaw the King. What is the cauſe there-of anſwered <hi>Amadis?</hi> Becauſe ſaide <hi>Gandandel,</hi> by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſeemeth hee beareth you no great good will. I know not anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> yet to my knowledge I neuer offended him. For this time they paſſed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill at another inſtant this traytour came againe to ſee him, ſhewing vnto him a better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance then he was accuſtomed, ſaying: my Lord, I told you the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, that I thought by the ſpeeches which I heard the King ſpeake of you, that his friendſhip was not ſo firme vnto you as it was wont to be, and becauſe that I and mine are ſo greatly bound vnto you, for the pleaſures which you haue done vnto vs, I will tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let you vnderſtand how the King hath a very bad opinion of you, and therefore looke vnto it. So many times did hee repeat this and the like matter vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> that hee began to ſuſpect leaſt hee had layd ſome ſnare to entrap him in, whereby the King might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſome euill opinion of him. And therefore one day when <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandel</hi> perſeuered in his aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Amadis</hi> being very angry, anſwered him: My Lord <hi>Gandan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> I doe greatly wonder what mooueth you to vſe this ſpeech ſo often vnto me, ſeeing that I did neuer thinke vpon any thing but onely wherein I might doe the King ſeruice? And I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that a Prince ſo vertuous as hee is, would euer ſuſpect mee for a thing which I neuer committed. Wherefore neuer breake my head more with ſuch follies, for I take no pleaſure therein. For this cauſe <hi>Gandandel</hi> durſt neuer after that ſpeake any more thereof vnto him, vntill that <hi>Amadis</hi> beeing healed, went vnto the Court, but ſo ſoone as the King beheld him hee turned his head from him &amp; his fellowes, not vouchſafing ſo much as once to looke vpon them. Then <hi>Gandan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> who was hard by them ſeeing the Kings countenance, came to embrace <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſaying vnto him, that hee was glad of his recouery. But by my faith ſayd he, I am very ſory that the king vſeth you no bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, notwithſtanding now you may know whether the aduertiſements that I gaue you were falſe or not. <hi>Amadis</hi> anſwered him not one word, but came vnto <hi>Angriota</hi> &amp; <hi>Bruneo,</hi> who thinking that hee had not marked the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance which the King ſhewed vnto them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed him thereof. There is no cauſe anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> that you ſhould take it in ill part, ſeeing that very often a man is intentiue vnto ſome thing whereon his minde is ſet, that hee taketh no heed vnto that which others doe, it may be that the king muſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſome other matter when wee ſaluted him, therefore let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and ſpeake vnto his Maieſty for that which <hi>Galuanes</hi> entreated vs. Herewithall they approached

Although, if it pleaſe your Maieſtie, that I haue not here-tofore done you that ſeruice that I deſire, yet haue I preſumed (truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your good bounty) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt one gift of your highneſſe, which can not but turne greatly to your honour, moreouer you ſhall binde thoſe vnto your Maieſtie, whom you may pleaſnte with your gacious grant.

If it like your highneſſe, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> the gift which I and my fellowes here preſent, do beſech your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grant vnto vs, is, that it would pleaſe you to beſtow vpon the Lord <hi>Galuanes</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> for the which he ſhall yeeld you fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and homage, in marying with <hi>Madaſima,</hi> by the which fauour your grace ſhall both aduance a poore Prince, and extend your pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vnto one of the faireſt Gentle-women in the world. When <hi>Broca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel</hi> heard this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they looked vpon the King, making a ſigne vnto him that hee ſhould not grant it to them Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe it was a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſpake, conſidering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of <hi>Don Galuanes,</hi> and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices which hee had receiued of him in many places, eſpecially how that <hi>Amadis</hi> had conquered with the price of his blood, the land which he required for another, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſle hee gaue no eare vnto him, although by verture hee was bounden to condiſcend vnto a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſo reſonable, yet hee thus anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi>

deſire in any ſort to thinke well of vs. If my entertainement like you not anſwered the King, the world is large enough to finde out ſome other, that may vſe you better. Truely this word hardly digeſted, turned afterward into a greater conſequence, then the King thought it would, who perceiued ſhortly after by <hi>Brocadan</hi> and his companion, how hurtfull a thing, hatefull and vncourteous ſpeech is, as the forgetting of good and his honour, is oftentimes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow both of a king and realm <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo diſpleaſed with this farewell, that he ſaid vnto the king. If it like your Maieſty, I haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thought that there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King nor Prince in the world more indued with vertuous and honourable qualities then you, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe we now by proofe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the contrary. Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you haue changed your anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent good cuſtome, by the aduiſe of ſome latter bad counſell, wee will goe ſeeke out another manner of life. Do anſwered the king, what you will, for you know my minde. Saying ſo, hee roſe vp in a great rage, and went vnto the Queene, vnto whom he imparted the whole diſcourſe that he had with <hi>Amadis</hi> and his companions, and how hee was diſpatched of them, where-with hee was very glad. I am in great doubt ſaid the Queene, leaſt this your pleaſure doe not hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turne you to diſpleaſure, for you are not ignorant, from the firſt day that <hi>Amadis</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats entred into your ſeruice, how your affaires haue alwaies proſpered better and better, ſo as if you conſider that which they haue done for you, you ſhall finde that they haue deſerued no ſuch anſwere as you haue made vnto them. Beſides when it ſhall bee manifeſt vnto others what they both haue done and can doe, and the little account you doe make of them for their deſerts, they may hereafter hope for no better at your handes, and therefore will they deſiſt to employ themſelues for you, reputing them fooles, that ſhall do but the leaſt ſeruice for ſo vngratefull a man. Tell mee no more of it ſaid the king, for it is done but if they make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint vnto you, tel them that long ſince I haue giuen that land which they required of me to our daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Leonor,</hi> as I did tell them. I will doe it anſwered the Queene, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is your pleaſure, and God grant that all may turne to the beſt.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt vnderſtand, that after <hi>Amadis</hi> and thoſe in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had ſeene in what ſort the King had left them, they went forth of the Palace, and as they went to their lodging they concluded to ſay nothing thereof vnto their friends vntill the next morning, againſt which time they would pray them all to meete together, and that then they would take counſell what was beſt to be done. And at the ſame inſtant <hi>Amadis</hi> ſent <hi>Durin</hi> to tell the Princeſſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi> that he would (if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) the night following ſpeake with <hi>Oriana</hi> about ſome matter of importance newly fallen out. In this ſort the day paſſed, and the night approched, being alreadie apparrelled in his ſable weede: wherefore at ſuch time as euery one was in their ſoundeſt ſleepe, <hi>Amadis</hi> called <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and came vnto that place by the which hee commonly entred into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Oriana,</hi> who ſtayed for him according to the meſſage which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7181:211"/>
ſhee had receiued by <hi>Durin,</hi> where being arriued, without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her at the firſt with any thing that might diſpleaſe her, after they had a little while diſcourſed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly together, <hi>Mabila</hi> &amp; the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell of <hi>Denmark</hi> (who were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſleep, or it may be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure that heat where-with loue did pricke them, ſeeing the kiſſings &amp; embracings where-with theſe two louers entertained one another) ſayd vnto them, the bed is bigge enough for you two, and the darkneſſe fit for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, it is now late, lie you downe if it pleaſe you, and afterwardes talke together as much as you wil. Madame ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi> vnto <hi>Oriana,</hi> by my faith their counſell is very good. It is beſt for vs then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them anſwered ſhee, and therewithall hauing nothing vpon her but a cloake caſt about her, ſhe had quickly gotten her in between a paire of ſheets, and as ſhee layd her downe cloſe in her bed, hee lent ſo neere vnto her ouer the beds ſide, that after the curtains were drawne (not to encreaſe his paſſion, but to redouble his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) a wax taper being onely ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp in the chamber, they began to kiſſe and embrace each other ſo inceſſantly, that remaining in this great eaſe, their ſpirits entertained a double delight, by the ſweet ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace which their metamorphoſed ſoules did mutially receiue from the outward parts of their lippes, being brought at the ſame inſtant into ſuch an extaſie, that they were thereby vnable to ſpeake one worde, vntill the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> (thinking that <hi>Amadis</hi> had beene aſleepe) pulled him by the garment, ſaying. My Lord you may lightly take colde, get you into the bed if it pleaſe you. With this waking as it were forth of a ſound ſleepe, hee ſetched a deepe ſigh. Alas deare loue ſayd the Princeſſe, ſhould you not be as well at your eaſe if you were laid downe in the bed by mee, as to take ſo much paine and hurt your ſelfe. Madame (anſwered he) ſeeing it pleaſeth you ſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, I will not make it dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſtraine a little curteſie with you.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner had hee ſayde theſe wordes, but that hee threwe him-ſelfe ſtarke naked betweene the Princeſſe her armes, then begunne they againe their amorous ſports, performing with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment that thing which euery one in the like delight doth moſt deſire: after-wardes they began to conferre of diuers matters, vntill that <hi>Oriana</hi> dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of him wherefore he had ſent her word by <hi>Durin</hi> that he had ſomewhat of great importance to tell her. Madam anſwered he, I wil declare it vnto you, ſeing that you deſire to know it, although I am ſure it will be both ſtrange &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto you, neuertheles I muſt of neceſſity aduertiſe you thereof, becauſe it is of ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. You muſt vnderſtand therefore Madame, that the King your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yeſterday did ſpeake vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies, Galuanes,</hi> &amp; me in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteous ſort, that thereby we wel perceiued little good hee wiſheth vs, afterwards he recited vnto her word by word, of all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, &amp; how in the end the king riſing vp in a great rage, told them that the worlde was large enough for them to goe ſeeke ſome other place where they might bee better requited then of him. And for this cauſe Madame ſayde <hi>Amadis,</hi> wee muſt of force doe what hee hath commaunded, otherwiſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7181:212"/>
wee ſhould greatly preiudice our honours, remaining againſt his wil in his ſeruice, ſeeing that he might preſume that wee had no other place to goe vnto, where we might be entertained, therefore I beſeech you not to be offended, if in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him I am conſtrained to leaue you for a ſeaſon. You know what power you haue ouer mee, and that I am as much yours as you can wiſh, more-ouer I know very well that if I ſhould gaine any bad repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you are ſhe that would bee moſt offended therewith, ſo much am I ſure that you doe loue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme mee, which maketh mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to entreate you to allow of my departure, and to giue mee leaue, vſing your accuſtomed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and vertue. Alas, anſwered ſhee, my deere loue, what doe you tell me? Madame, if it pleaſe God the King heereafter will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the wrong that he hath done vnto vs, and I ſhall bee as well wel-come vnto him as euer I haue bin. Gentle friend, anſwered the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, you do much amiſſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of my father, for if he hath receiued any good from you, it was for my loue, &amp; by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I gaue vnto you, and not for his ſake, for I alone did bring you hither, and was the cauſe that you remained with him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not hee that muſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence you, but I, vnto whom you belong. It is very true that hee hath alwaies thought otherwiſe, for which hee is the more to bee blamed for anſwering you ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly. And although that your departure is the moſt grieuous thing that could happen to me (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter of conſtraint) I am content to ſortifie my ſelfe, and to prefer reaſon before the delights and pleaſures which I receiue by your preſence. Therefore will I frame my will to your liking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſure that in what place ſoeuer you ſhall bee, your heart (which is mine) ſhall remaine with mee, as pledge of the power which you haue giuen me ouer your ſelfe, and yet moreouer, my father in loſing you ſhall know by thoſe few that he ſhall haue left, what he hath loſt by you. Madame, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the fauour which you ſhew vnto me is ſo great, that I eſteeme it no leſſe then the redemption of mine owne life. For you know that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery vertuous man ought to haue his honour in ſuch eſtimation, that hee ought to preferre it before his owne life. In like ſort Madam, ſeeing that to conſerue it I muſt of force depart from you, doe thus much if it pleaſe you for mee, as (during my abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) to let me heare very often from you: And to hold mee alwaies in your good fauour, as he who was neuer borne but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obay and ſerue you. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whoſoeuer had ſeene the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe then, when <hi>Amadis</hi> took this ſorrowfull farwell, he might eaſily haue bin witnes of the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſhe indured. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing the day conſtrained him to depart (in kiſſing her ſweetly) hee roſe vp, leauing her ſo ful of ſorrow &amp; heauines, that although ſhee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled as well as ſhee could, this her extreame greefe, yet had ſhee not ſo much power ouer her ſelfe, but that ſhee awaked <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> with her loud ſighes, who thinking her to bee taken with ſome new diſeaſe came haſtily vnto her, and found that <hi>Amadis</hi> was already apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Then they demanded of him, what moued <hi>Oriana</hi> in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſort to complaine. <hi>Amadis</hi> tolde them the whole diſcourſe in

what ſort hee was conſtrained to forſake the court, and the ſeruice of the king, wherefore my louing friends ſaid he, I pray you to go &amp; comfort my Lady. Which ſaid he tooke his leaue of them, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, leauing al the three Ladies accompanied onely with ſorrow, and extreame paſſion. Now you muſt know that ſo ſoon as <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> were come vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> his lodging, they ſent vnto all their friends particularly, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate them to meet there the next morning, the which they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly performed, then they went altogether to the Church to heare ſeruice, at their returne from whence, they all walking in a great field, <hi>Amadis</hi> began to ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in this manner: My Lords becauſe that ſome one may wrongfully blame my Lord <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes, Agraies,</hi> me, &amp; ſome others here preſent, for leauing the king his ſeruice (as wee are determined to do) they and I haue thought good to let you vnderſtand what is the occaſion thereof. I beleeue that there is not any in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that knoweth not whether ſince our arriuall in great <hi>Brittaine</hi> the authority of a Prince bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or diminiſhed. Wherfore without ſpending the time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing the ſeruices which wee haue done vnto him, for the which we had great hope to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (beſides his good will) a great reward, I will declare vnto you particularly, with what ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude he vſed vs yeſterday, &amp; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as, fortune which is mutable &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, doth often times ouerthrow all things, ſo hath hee changed his conditions, eyther by ſome bad counſaile which he hath receiued, or for ſome ſleight occaſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are ignorant. But this much I am ſure, that my Lord <hi>Galuanes</hi> did deſire vs to bee a meanes for him vnto his Maieſty not paſt eight or ten daies ſince, that hee would bee pleaſed to permit him to marry with <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and in ſo doing, to ſuffer him likewiſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy her lands, vpon this condition that he ſhould hold them of him, and of his Crowne, by fealty and homage, the which wee promiſed to performe. By meanes wherof, ſo ſoone as I was able to goe, I and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this company did make this requeſt vnto him, but he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard eyther vnto vs that were ſutors, or vnto him for whom we ſued, who is (as euery on know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) brother vnto the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as valiant and hardy a knight as poſſible may be, &amp; ſuch a one as in the late battell againſt king <hi>Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadan</hi> hath not ſpared his life, but hath done as much as any other that was there, he hath not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed our requeſts, but alſo giuen vs ſuch iniurious words, as were far vnfit and vnworthy ſuch a king. And notwithſtanding at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning wee made ſmall account thereof, vntill hee ſaid vnto vs all (as we ſhewed vnto him ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for our requeſt) that we ſhold goe ſeeke elſe where for ſuch a one as would acknowledge, and better eſteeme of vs then he did, and that the world was wide enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out importuning him any further. Therefore my fellows and friends ſince that being in his ſeruice, wee haue beene euer dutifull vnto him, ſo for my part I am yet very well content in this caſe not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him and to get mee forth of his countrie.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe it ſeemeth vnto mee that this his licence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part doth not onely touch mee, and thoſe vnto whom hee ſpake,

My Lords, it is yet no long time ſince I knew the King, and for that little acquaintance that I haue had with him, I did neuer ſee a Prince more wiſe, vertuous and temperate, then he hath bin in his affaires, wherefore I doubt mee greatly, that this which hee hath done vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> and to theſe Lords preſent, proceedeth not of his own fancy: but he hath bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited thereunto by ſome wicked malicious perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hath perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that ſort. And becauſe that for theſe eighteene daies, I haue ſeen <hi>Gandandel</hi> &amp; <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadan</hi> very often conſulting with him, and that ſo he hath been more priuat with them then any other, I feare me that they are the men that haue bin the chiefe workers of this miſchiefe, for I haue known the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of long time for the moſt malicious perſons in all the world.

                  <p>For the reſt, my good friends, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> if it pleaſed the King and Queene to vouchſafe to ſee mee, I am determined to goe forthwith and take my leaue of them, and ſo to retire vnto the Firme-Iſland, in hope that thoſe which will follow mee, ſhall wholly bee pertakers with mee, in all the good and pleaſure which there I ſhall haue. And as you doe know the Countrey is pleaſant and wealthy, full of faire women, ſtore of forreſts, and many riuers fit for hauking, furthermore, diuers as well of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as of ſtrangers, wil come and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7181:213"/>
viſit vs: beſides, in our neede if we ſhall want any aide, and that king <hi>Liſuart</hi> will attempt any enterpriſe againſt vs we ſhall bee ſupported by my father, from the Countrey of little <hi>Brittaine</hi> and from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> eſpecially from the Realm of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> the which the Queene <hi>Briolania</hi> will wholly yeelde into our hands, at all times when wee ſhall pleaſe. Seeing that you are in theſe tearmes anſwered <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi> now may you know thoſe which do loue your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, from thoſe which doe not. By my faith ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I am of the opinion if any loue his owne particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, that hee ſhould not forſake ſo good a Maſter, yet thoſe which will follow mee ſhall neither fare better nor worſe then mine owne ſelfe. And as they thus conſulted in the meddow the king happened to come by them, accompanied with <hi>Gandandell</hi> and many other knights, and ſeeing them together he did paſſe on, making as though he ſaw them not.</p>
                  <p>Then cauſed he a caſt of Iackes or Hobbies to be let flie at a Larke, and after hee had a while ſolaced himſelfe with this paſtime, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe vnto the Citty, without ſpeaking eyther to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medis</hi> or any other in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>

Then approching vnto him he ſaid, may it pleaſe your Maieſty if in any thing I haue offended your grace, God and your ſelfe can witneſſe, aſſuring you, that although the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices which I haue done vnto you haue beene very ſmall, yet the will which I haue had to acknowledge the benefits and honour which it hath pleaſed you to beſtow vpon mee hath beene exceeding great.

Whereunto the king replied, <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> your tongue doth well declare the little loue you beare vnto me, yet notwithſtanding mee thinks you are not ſo tied nor ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> as in accuſing me you ſhould excuſe him as you do: but your thought is otherwiſe, you ſay more then you thinke.

                     </hi> of <hi>Fryarqua, Tantilies</hi> the haughty, and <hi>Don Grauat de Val Craintif.</hi> All theſe came vnto the king and ſaid.

And euen as they were cauſe of the ſeruice that you haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs, they alſo ſhall bee the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7181:214"/>
meanes that we will forſake you, and we do take leaue of your grace to keepe them company. When the king perceiued that hee was ſo ſuddenely forſaken of ſuch a great number of good knights, hee was highly diſpleaſ'd, for very ſpight he would not permit <hi>Amadis</hi> to goe take his leaue of the Queene, who (as much as in her lay) did wholy oppoſe her ſelfe againſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Gandandell</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And therefore <hi>Amadis</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the auncient knight <hi>Don Grumedan</hi> to make his excuſe vnto her Maieſty. Afterwards taking his leaue of the king with great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, he retired vnto his lodging with his friends and companions, where they found their dinner rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and as ſoone as the Table was taken vp, euery one went to arme him, and they trouped altogether in a place where <hi>Oriana</hi> might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, and their number was ſo great, as they were thought to be fiue hundred knights and more, the moſt part of them being Sons vnto kings, dukes or earles. Afterwards in very good order they all paſſed along hard by the Queenes lodging. Then <hi>Mabila</hi> being in one of the windows called <hi>Oriana</hi> who was laid vpon her bed as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy as might be, ſaying vnto her, Madame, I pray you forget your heauineſſe, and come ſee how many knights you haue at your commandement. All the while my coſin was in the ſeruice of the king your father, he was accounted but as a ſimple wandring knight, but no ſooner is he departed from him when hee ſheweth that hee is a Prince and mighty Lord, as you may now behold, and if you haue power ouer him, by greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon haue you power ouer all his troope, of whom hee is the chiefe and principall Leader. <hi>Oriana</hi> was ſo greatly comforted with this ſight, that euer after ſhe was more merry and at better hearts eaſe. In this ſort did <hi>Amadis</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers paſſe through the Citty, and there accompanied them king <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>North Wales, Grumedan,</hi> a knight of honour belonging to the Queene, <hi>Brandoinas, Queuorant Giontes</hi> Nephew to the King, and <hi>Liſtoran</hi> the good iouſter. All theſe were very ſorry for the departure of ſo many good knights, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for <hi>Amadis,</hi> who prayed them that in any matter wherein his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour might bee blemiſhed, they would ſhew themſelues to be ſuch friends for him, as hee eſteemed them. And although the king (without any occaſion) had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a hate againſt him, yet they ſhould not ceaſe for all that to be his friends, without forſaking the ſeruice of ſo good a prince, and they anſwered him that excepting their ſeruice and loyalty in the which they were by duty bounde vnto the king, they would bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pleaſure him at all times and places, when and where he would employ them, for the which hee heartilie thanked them. Afterwards hee ſaide vnto them, If you finde the king fit to be ſpoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, you may aduertiſe him that which <hi>Vrganda</hi> declared to mee in his preſence is now accompliſhed, for ſhee told mee that the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which I ſhould haue in gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Dominions for another, ſhould be hate, anger, and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that place where moſt I deſired to remaine. I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered as euery one knoweth with the edg of my ſword, and the loſſe of my blood, the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> thereby enlarging the limits of the realme of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7181:215"/>
al this, the king with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe at all, hath requited mee with hate, but God is iuſt, and will recompence euery one according to his deſerts.</p>
                  <p>By my faith, anſwered <hi>Grumedan,</hi> I will not faile to let the King know as much as you haue ſayde. And curſed be <hi>Vrganda</hi> for propheſing ſo right, which ſaide, they embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced one another and tooke their leaue, but <hi>Guillan</hi> the penſil whoſe eyes were full of teares, ſaid vnto <hi>Amadis.</hi> My Lord, you know my occaſion, and how I cannot of my ſelfe doe any thing, being ſubiect ſo the will of another, for whoſe ſake I ſuffer and endure ſtrange greefes and anguiſhes, which is the cauſe that I cannot follow you, for which I am very ſorry and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo great a deſire haue I to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the fauour and honour that I haue receiued of you, being in your company, beſeeching you moſt humbly at this time to holde me excuſed Now did <hi>Amadis</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in what ſubiection loue did holde him, and hee knew very well by himſelfe what paine hee might ſuffer, by meanes whereof he anſwered him: My Lord <hi>Guillan,</hi> God forbid that by my occaſion you ſhould commit any offence vnto the Lady whom you loue ſo conſtantly, but I rather counſell you to be obedient vnto her, and to ſerue her as hitherto you haue done, and the King likewiſe being ſure that your honour ſaued, you wil be vnto me in all places a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend and louing companion. Heere withall he embraced him, &amp; taking his leaue, <hi>Guillan</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes returned vnto the Cittie, and <hi>Amadis</hi> and his followed on their way to the Firme-Iſland, vntill at the laſt they arriued along by a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, vpon the ſide whereof <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſent before to cauſe his Tents and Pauillions to be armed and ſet vp. There they lodged for that night, praiſing God in that they had ſo happily been warned of the Kings ingratitude, with whom if they had remained any longer, ſpace, they had but loſt their time. But <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo heauie for his baniſhment from <hi>Oriana</hi> (igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant when he ſhould ſee her again) that he knew not in what ſort to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his malancholie, and thus they paſſed away the night vntill the next morning, that they had rode forward on their way. In the meane time King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was in his Pallace, who after the departure of ſo great a number of Knights, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that he now was but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied. Then he began to acknowledge the fault which he had committed, and to repent him greatly for the words which he ſaid vnto <hi>Amadis.</hi> At the very ſelfe ſame time, <hi>Gandandel</hi> and <hi>Brocadan</hi> were aduertiſed what <hi>Angriotta</hi> had ſaid of them, whereat they were maruailouſly abaſhed, fearing leaſt the King and the reſt ſhould diſlike of the bad counſell, which they had giued vnto him, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſince there was no remedy: they determined to paſſe it ouer, and to worke ſuch meanes that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any of thoſe Knights who were departed ſhould enter into the King his fauour againe. And the better to bring it to paſſe, they both came vnto him, ſaying. Your Maieſtie ought greatly to praiſe God, that you are ſo honeſtly rid of thoſe men who might haue wrought you much miſchiefe, for your highneſſe knoweth there is nothing more dangerous then a ſecret enemy.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore you haue now no other thing to trouble you, neither
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7181:215"/>
neede you take any care for your affaires, becauſe that wee two will take order, and warily prouide for any perill that may happen to this Realme. When the king heard them ſpeake ſo audaciouſly, hee looked vpon them with a ſowre countenance, and anſwered them: I do much meruaile how you dare bee ſo preſumptuous to perſwade me that I ſhould leaue vnto you the gouernment, not onely of my houſe, but alſo of my whole realm, knowing that you are nothing fit, not ſufficient for ſuch a charge. Doe you imagine that the Princes and Lords of this monarchie will obay you, knowing the place from whence you are deſcended? And if you thinke to play the good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, deſiring to enrich mee by ſparing of my treaſure, vpon whom doe you thinke that I may better imploy it, then vpon ſuch Gentle-men and knights as are in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? Seeing that the Prince can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be named a king, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath many at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. And if in times paſt I haue ſhewed my ſelfe liberall vnto thoſe whom at your inſtance I haue driuen away, cuen by them was I maintained, feared, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, and therefore content you with that you haue done, without any farther diſſembling &amp; forging of matters, otherwiſe you ſhal know that you nothing pleaſe me therewith.</p>
                  <p>Saying ſo he left them, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed at theſe wordes, and hee mounted on horſebacke to goe chaſe a hart which his hunters told him was incloſed within his toiles. As theſe things were in doing there arriued at the Court a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell that was ſent from Queene <hi>Briolania</hi> vnto <hi>Oriana,</hi> who after ſhee had done her duty, ſaid vnto her, Madame the Queene my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe hath her commended to your good Grace. And ſhe hath expreſly ſent me vnto you, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you at large how ſhee hath beene in the firme Iſland, and what happened vnto her in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the aduentures which there ſhe found.</p>
                  <p>God keepe ſo good a Queene from miſchiefe, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> and you alſo that haue taken ſo much paine. Then all the Ladies and Gentlewomen deſirous to heare newes, came round about her, and the Damoſell beganne to rehearſe that which ſhe had ſeene, ſaying. Madam, at the departing from this Court, the Queene my Miſtreſſe and her companie, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the fift day following in the Firme-Iſland, where ſo ſoone as ſhe was come, ſhe was demanded if it pleaſed her to prooue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Chamber or the Arch of loyall Louers, but ſhee anſwered that ſhee would firſt ſee the other maruailes of the place. And for that cauſe <hi>Iſania</hi> cauſed her to bee conducted to a moſt faire houſe, ſcituated halfe a league or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, from the principall Palace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> in the which after ſhe had a little while walked, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the excellent building there-of, ſhee came vnto one of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a Parke which was very darke and deepe, that none durſt approch vnto the ſame, ſo feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a thing was it. Afterward my Lady was brought into a moſt fair Tower, well furniſhed with win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, from whence ſhee might ſee all the waies round about her, and there we were ſo well ſerued and entreated as might bee. And as the ſecond ſeruice was brought in, wee did ſee come forth of that deepe ditch, a great ſerpent, which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7181:216"/>
did caſt fire and ſmoake as well from her eyes and eares, as from her throate, who came and entred into this Tower, ſhewing a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſo furious, that the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the company trembled with great feare, after him there ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly followed two Lions, who in like ſort came forth of this ditch, they came leaping in and aſſailed the Serpent, herewithall there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a battaile betweene them, the crueleſt that may poſſibly be ſeene betweene brute beaſts, and it laſted halfe an houre and more, and ſo long continued it, that the two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons became ſo wearie as they fell downe in the place as if they had been dead, &amp; the Serpent likewiſe ſo out of breath, that hee remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great while lying vpon the ground. In the end hauing reſted a little, hee roſe vp and ſwallowed one of the Lions down his throat, and carried him into the ditch, and preſently after he returned, &amp; did the like vnto the ſecond, and were no more ſeene all the day after. Thoſe of the Iſle (accuſtomed to ſuch wonders) beholding our feare laughed at vs, aſſuring vs that all the day long wee ſhould ſee no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nouelty. Whereupon we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to laugh at our folly, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching one another, for the affright that had happened vnto vs, &amp; thus we paſſed all the afternoone vntill it was bed time, that my Lady and wee her women were brought into a chamber richly hanged, in the which wee were all layed. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight, wee did heare our chamber doore open with ſo great noyſe, that wee awaked with great feare thereof, and therewithall we ſaw entring in a Hart, one ſide of whom was as white as ſnow, and the other ſide more blacke then a rauen: hauing vpon his head thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hornes, vpon euery one of which there was a burning candle, which gaue ſo great a light, that one might haue ſeene as plaine within the chamber, as if it had beene broad day. The Hart entred in running with great force, for hee was purſued by a cry of ſwift hounds, that laboured to ouertake him, and incourage them thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, there was heard an Iuory horne ſounding after the beaſt, who in the ende was ſo hardly purſued, that after hee had long turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the chamber, hee leaped vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our beds euen thorough the midſt of vs. The feare whereof made vs to cry, and ſuddenly to riſe vp, all naked as wee were, ſome of vs ran vnder the beds, others vnder the benches, but the more we thought to ſaue our ſelues, the more were we purſued by the Hart and hounds that followed him, till at the laſt hee ran towarde the windowes, afterwardes being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better aſſured, we took vp our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell which was fallen downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, and wee began to chat of the feare which we had. And as wee were in theſe tearmes, there came a Damoſell, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with two other women, who asked vs what mooued vs to riſe ſo earely. By my faith ſayde my Lady, we haue had ſuch an alarme, that my heart yet trembleth with feare. This Damoſell ſmyled and ſayde vnto her, that ſhee and wee might ſleep in ſafety, for we ſhould haue no more ſtirre all the night after. Whereupon wee layd vs downe in our bed, and there wee remained vntill it was indifferent late the next morning, when my Lady cauſed vs to riſe vp, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wee had heard ſeruice, as ſhee walked in a great meddow watered with many pleaſant brookes going
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7181:216"/>
through a pleaſant and delectable wood where we found at the end thereof many pleaſant orchards, and a houſe very round, ſet vpon twelue pillars of Marble, ſo artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially wrought, that in ſtead of ſtone and morter, the walls there-of were of fine Chriſtall, through the which they that were within, might eaſily ſee thoſe without, and there was neuer a doore thereof which was not of Gold or Siluer. And (that which was moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) there was about it many I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of copper, made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Giants each of them hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their hands a bended bow, and an arrow therein, the head whereof was of ſuch a burning brightnes, that it ſeemed fire came out therof. And it was told vs that no ſooner was any ſo hardy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein, but preſently he ſhold bee ſlaine by the arrows which by them are ſhot, whereupon my Lady was deſirous to make proofe thereof, by a Horſe and two Apes, who being put into the Chamber were preſently conſumed by the fire, proceeding from theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that compaſſed them about. And there was grauen vpon the portall theſe words. Let no man nor woman be ſo hardy as to ſet foote within this Palace, except it be he or ſhee that loueth as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly as <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> and <hi>Apolidon,</hi> that made this enchantment. And they muſt of neceſſity enter in both together for the firſt time, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe let them be aſſured to die moſt cruelly, and this enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall laſt, and all the reſt of this Iſland, vntill that the knight &amp; Lady (who do ſurpaſſe in loyalty thoſe that made the defences of the forbidden Chamber) bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in, and there haue taken their pleaſure. Hereupon my Lady cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iſania</hi> to be called, and tolde him ſhe was glad that ſhe had ſeen theſe wonders, but ſhee would yet ſee the Arch of loyall Louers, and the chamber ſo renowned, and in the meane ſeaſon, ſhe deſired him to tell her what was meant by the Hart, Serpent, Dogs and Lions, Madame anſwered <hi>Iſania,</hi> I know no other thing thereof, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day at thoſe houres and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that you did ſee them, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats of the beaſts are made, and the Hart doth alwaies leape downe from the window, and the Dogs after, who purſue him into a Lake not far from hence, where they are hidden and ſeene no more vntill the next day and houre that the chaſe beginneth againe, as you haue ſeene it this night paſt. But thus much you ſhall know, that if you were one whole yeere in this Iſland, yet ſhould you not haue time enough to ſee all the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things which there are. For this cauſe my Lady and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany mounted on horſeback, and we came vnto the Palace of <hi>Apoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to ſee the arch of loyall Louers and the forbidden Chamber. Whereunto my Lady was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come but ſhe alighted, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched vnto the Image of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (as ſhe that had neuer falſified her loue) and paſſing vnder, there was heard the moſt ſweete, and melodious tune in all the world, and the Queene paſſed through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the place where the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and <hi>Grimane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi</hi> were, which ſeemed vnto her as though they had been aliue. And from thence ſhee came vnto the piller of Iaſper, where ſhe ſaw writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe wordes. <hi>Briolania</hi> the daughter to <hi>Tagadan</hi> king of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bradiſa,</hi> is the third Damoſell that did euerenter into this place.

For which cauſe beeing one day withdrawne into her cloſet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her eyes full of teares, and her heart oppreſſed with griefe, ſhee ſayd vnto them: Alas my deare friends and louing counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, I do now well perceiue that Fortune wil wholy work my ruine and ouerthrowe: You haue ſeene what inconuenience hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of late vnto the perſon whom I doe moſt loue in the world, and now (that which is worſt of all) the thing which I haue moſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and doubted, is lighted vpon mee: For certainely I am with child, and I know not what I ſhall doe, that I be not diſcouered and vndone. Much abaſhed were theſe two Damoſels at this: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe (as thoſe which were wiſe &amp; well aduiſed) they diſſembled that which they thought thereof.

Wherefore your highneſſe may be pleaſed, to bee aduertiſed that within theſe three dayes, I was in ſuch a place, where I heard that <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandel</hi> did not only then conſpire (but already had committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and your grace) the greateſt treaſon that might be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined. It is ſure that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to counſell &amp; perſwade you to put <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen to death, and for the reſt I hope if it like your Maieſty, before ten dayes be paſt, that their wickednes ſhalbe wholy laid open &amp; proued vnto you. And becauſe that in maintayning ſuch traitors, you haue of late baniſhed my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> and many other good knights from your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, I am not determined to ſtay any longer with you, and therefore I take my leaue of your grace, to goe ſeeke out my Vncle <hi>Angriotta,</hi> whom (if God pleaſe) you ſhall ſee in theſe parts, and I with him, determined to auouch by force of armes againſt theſe two traytors, their vniuſt conſpiracies. God be with you (anſwered the king) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you haue ſo great haſte. Herewithall <hi>Sarquiles</hi> roſe vp, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the king alone very penſiue for the wordes which hee had ſaid vnto him, and ſome few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he arriued in the Firme-Iſland, as <hi>Amadis, Angriotta, Bruneo,</hi> and others were walking by the Sea ſide, cauſing certaine ſhips to be prepared and rigged, to paſſe into <hi>Gaule:</hi> where king <hi>Perion</hi> had ſent vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> that he ſhould come for certaine affaires which were lately happened vnto him. When <hi>Angriotta</hi> beheld his Nephew <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiles,</hi> he wondred thereat, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him why hee had left king <hi>Liſuart.</hi> My Lord, anſwered <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiles,</hi> it is for a matter whereat you &amp; all this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie wil greatly admire, Hereupon hee recited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the whole diſcourſe of the practiſes and counſailes that <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel</hi> had held vpon the accuſation of <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; his companions. Well anſwered <hi>Angriotta,</hi> I did alwaies thinke ſo of them. And you my Lord, ſaid hee vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> doe now finde that to be true which I haue here-tofore told you: But ſeeing it is ſo, I proteſt they ſhall repent their treacherie: for I will depart hence tomorrowe morning to goe and fight with them, and make them acknowledge their villany. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle friend anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> the matter being ſo certaine as it is, you haue no reaſon to deferre the execution of your enterpriſe: and if you had any ſooner performed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7181:218"/>
that which you now determine, it had beene (perchance) with leſſe aſſurance then you now haue. And after many other diſcourſes they went vnto their lodging, vntill the next morning that <hi>Angriotta</hi> took his leaue of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his Nephew <hi>Sarquiles,</hi> tooke the right way towards great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> where within few dayes after he arriued. Now you muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that euer ſince the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Amadis,</hi> king <hi>Liſuart</hi> was ſo melancholly as no man could be more, and hee ſpent all the day long in ſtudying with himſelfe: whereof one time aboue all the reſt, <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alone very penſiue, came vnto him and ſayd. May it pleaſe your Maieſty, it ſeemeth vnto vs, that the ouer great care which you take in theſe your affaires, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you of your wonted manner of life, and you take matters more to heart then you neede. It may wel be anſwered the king, but what meane you to tell me ſo? Is it (if it like your Maieſty) ſayd they, for doubt of thoſe that come from the Firme-Iſland, in the defence of <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels? by the faith wee owe vnto God, if it pleaſe your grace to credit our counſell, you and your eſtate ſhall be henceforth in greater ſecurity then euer yet it hath beene. And to bring that to paſſe, commaund the heades of thoſe pledges which you haue, this day to bee ſmitten off: Then afterwardes ſend vnto <hi>Galuanes</hi> and the reſt of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie (your enemies) that vpon their liues they be not once ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as to enter into your countries, and if by chance they be already arriued, command them foorth-with to depart, or otherwiſe you will cauſe them to bee cut in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. When the King heard this wicked ſpeech, and vngodly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of theirs, hee remembred that which <hi>Sarquiles</hi> had tolde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, &amp; therwithall he knew that without doubt theſe two traytors did with wrong procure the death of theſe Damoſels: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding becauſe he would not at that time amaſe them, hee onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered this. You counſaile mee to things farre vnfitting my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: the one that I ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proceſſe or order of Iuſtice, put <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels to death: and the other, that I ſhould forbid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my Court thoſe knights that are minded to come thither. But if I ſhould doe this which you ſay, I might bee grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly reproued for it before God, who hath by his great bounty and mercy inſtituted mee King, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Iuſtice vnto euery one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: therefore the counſell which you doe giue vnto mee, is wicked and vnworthy to be receiued. Let it ſuffice you therefore that I haue already liſtned vnto you in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation which you haue contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> whereof I doe greatly repent mee: for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiued of him, nor any of his, but all honor, pleaſure, &amp; ſeruice, wherefore I charge you vpon your liues, that you mooue me no more thereof.</p>
                  <p>Saying ſo he roſe vp, ſhewing by his countenance that hee was very angry, whereat <hi>Gandandel</hi> and <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadan</hi> were greatly abaſhed, and they were conſtrained to departe vnto their lodging, to determine what was beſt for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be done, ſeeing that already fortune had maruailouſly croſſed them, &amp; they came not in the King his preſence all that day after vntill the next morning, when they attended

The King beeing halfe a league from the Cittie, he behelde comming toward him the knights of the Firme-Iſland, for the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels, being come ſomewhat neere they all did their duties to his Maieſtie. Then <hi>Galuanes</hi> who marched for-moſt, took vpon him to ſpeake for all his fellowes, ſaying vnto the King. If it like your Maieſtie, wee (being all of vs well aſſured of your accuſtomed vertue) are come to demand iuſtice of your grace for <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels, and to defend their right if by force of armes it is defenſible. My friends, anſwered hee, ſeeing that you haue already ſet vp your Tents in this place, if you thinke good you may heere abide for this day, and to morrow you may come vnto mee, to aduiſe vpon that which ſhall be reaſonable to bee done. If it pleaſe your highneſſe, ſaid <hi>Brian</hi> of Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſta, wee all are aſſured that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your, ancient royall beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, iuſtice ſhall not bee denied vnto vs, and if wee finde it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is rather by the counſaile of ſome wicked traitors that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, then any of your owne motion. <hi>Brian, Brian,</hi> ſaide the King, I am well aſſured that if you had beleeued your father, you would neither haue departed from my ſeruice (as you haue done) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would you in this ſort haue helde argument againſt mee. The argument which I do hold againſt your Maieſtie, ſaid <hi>Brian,</hi> is not for any il will, or that I would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any dutifull ſeruice for your grace, for I know well that in time you will acknowledge that which I ſay true. And where your Maieſtie doth tell me that if I had beleeued my father, I would not haue forſaken you, ſauing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of your Maieſtie I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forſake you, for I neuer did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto you: but I onely came into your houſe to ſeeke my cofin <hi>Amadis,</hi> who ſo long as hee was yours, ſo long had I a deſire to ſerue you, and neuer did I whilſt I there remained offend you, Well, well, anſwered the King, wee will debate of this another time more at large.

                  <p>Beleeue me <hi>Gandandel</hi> ſaid <hi>Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> had you held your peace you had done but your duty, for the king hath not yet commanded you to ſpeak, &amp; alſo becauſe you know that by the cuſtome of great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> no woman ought to ſuffer death, except it bee in two caſes, the one for <hi>Leze maieſtie,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for treaſon. But there is not any in this company, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how theſe poore women were brought into the king his hands, more by compulſion then their owne conſent. Therefore we beſeech your Maieſty and you my Lords all to conſider of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for reaſon and pittie are moſt fit to be vſed therein.

It is well ſaide anſwered the king, who ſent for the Damoſels to come vnto him, and afterward ſaid vnto them, Looke vp Ladies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe Gentlemen which will defend your right, will you be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to put your quarrell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture your liues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their force. Alas if it like your Maieſty anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Madaſima,</hi> ſeeing it pleaſeth them to affoord vs this good, wee doe put our liues into their hands, and your good mercy. Truſt mee Madame ſaide <hi>Imoſel;</hi> If there bee any heere which will gaineſay that you are not deliuered and ſet at liberty, behold me ready to proue the contrarie, &amp; if there be twelue together of the like opinion, wee are twelue likewiſe that wil hazard our liues for yours. Therewithall the king did caſt his eyes vpon <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandel</hi> and <hi>Broquadan,</hi> and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that they hanged downe their heads, looking vpon the ground, ſo much amaſed, that they were not able to anſwer one word, wherefore the king ſaide vnto the knights of the Iſle. My Lords, I pray you to withdraw your ſelues for this day, and to morrow you ſhall haue anſwere of thoſe with whom you are to deale. Where-upon they all departed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the king called apart <hi>Broquadan</hi> &amp; <hi>Gandandel,</hi> vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, come hither, you knowe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7181:220"/>
that many times you haue ſolicited me to put theſe poore Damoſels to death, perſwading mee that it was iuſt and reaſon ſo to doe, and that if need were you &amp; your ſons would maintain this counſaile vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death. You haue heard what <hi>Imoſel</hi> and his fellowes haue ſaide vnto mee, which I doe thinke to be good &amp; right, wherefore it is time that you determine what to do. For by the faith that I owe vnto God, I will not permit that any other of my knights ſhall fight with them, &amp; if you look not vnto it, you ſhall bee anſwerable for all, and the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels deliuered. If it pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwered they, to morrow we will be ready to maintain what-ſoeuer we haue ſaide. And for that time they departed to their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, greatly troubled for that which they were to do. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſeeing that now there was no remedy, they determined to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in their daurned opinion by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of words onely, without putting themſelues or their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in danger: knowing aſſuredly that they were not able to reſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that were come from the Firme-Iſland. But it happened out ſo well for them, as the very ſame night newes came vnto the King, that <hi>Grumeda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a</hi> the olde Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anteſſe was dead, and that a little before her death, ſhee had yeelded vp her ſtrong places into the hands of the kings people, beſeeching him to haue pitty vpon her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Madaſima.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon the next morning at their returne from church, hee cauſed the twelue knights of the Firme-Iſland to bee called, vnto whom he ſaid. My friends, you may carry away with you the Damoſels which you demand, when it ſhall pleaſe you, for I ſet them at liberty, becauſe that this night the Earle <hi>Latin</hi> hath written vnto me, that he hath the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza</hi> in his hands, and that the olde Gianteſſe is deceaſed. If any were glad here-of, you may beleeue that the two traitors <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel</hi> were nothing ſorry, for as much as they did perceiue that if this had not happened, their treaſon had bid diſcouered. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Imoſel</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the king. If your Maieſtie doe but <hi>Madaſima</hi> right, ſhee muſt not remaine poor nor diſinherited, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your grace knoweth that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are bound to obey their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as ſhee hath done, more by feare then free will. And ſo if it pleaſe your Maieſty, vſing your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed liberality, you ſhould ſhewe her ſome grace and fauour, ſhewing thereby an example to all other vertuous and couragious Princes to do the like. <hi>Imoſel,</hi> ſayde the king, let it ſuffice you that the Damoſels are at liberty, for I cannot reuoke the gift which I haue made to my daughter <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> of the land which you demand. I moſt humbly beſeech your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> to haue pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vpon her and mee, who at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought to hold the place deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her anceſtors, of whom ſhee is the lawfull inheretrix, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the land which you doe take from her: and if it pleaſe your highneſſe, in remembrance of the ſeruices which I haue done vnto you, you may reſtore them vnto vs to hold them of your grace by feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and homage. I haue ſaid enough my Lord <hi>Galuanes,</hi> anſwered the king, that which is done, cannot be vndone. Truſt me, anſwered he, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I can neither haue right nor reaſon of you, I will trie if I may get it ſome other way. Doe what you can, ſaid the king, I am in good
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7181:220"/>
hope ſeeing I haue won if fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then you, to deſend it againſt thoſe that are leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they. Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> he which got it for you, hath bin very badly reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therefore. Care not you for that, ſaide the King, if he of whom you ſpeake dare but aduenture to aide you, I dare bee ſo bolde as to withſtand him, and to make him beſhrew himſelfe. <hi>Agraies</hi> hearing theſe threats, was exceeding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and in great choller anſwered: Sir, although my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> was neuer other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring knight, yet did he that good for you which as yet you neuer recompenſed, for he hath many times defended you, and deliuered you from death. <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan</hi> did well perceine that <hi>Agrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> entred into farther tearmes then was fit hee ſhould, for which cauſe he a little pulled him back, and ſaid vnto the king. Sir, although you be a king and a great Lord, yet it may be you ſhall finde ſomewhat to do, to vſe my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> in ſuch ſort as you threaten him. By my faith, ſaid <hi>Brian, Amadis</hi> hath done you too many ſeruices to be thus badly requited eſpecially he being ſonne vnto a Prince as worthy as your ſelfe. Soft and faire <hi>Don Brian,</hi> ſaide the king, we know wel enough that you are one of his friends. I am and ſo ought to be, ſaid <hi>Brian,</hi> for euery one knoweth that I am his coſin german, and therefore it were a ſhame not to ſuccour him in his neede. Truely, anſwered the King, for the ſame cauſe doe I hold you excuſed. And as they were in theſe tearmes, <hi>Angriotta de Eſtrauaux,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sarquiles</hi> his Nephew came before the King, who beeing armed at all points, did their duty vnto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie: but when the knights of the Firme-Iſland did beholde them, they greatly wondred, for they knew nothing at al of this their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. Then <hi>Angriotta</hi> with a loud voice began his ſpeech in this manner. May it pleaſe your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, my Nephew and I heere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, do beſeech your grace to cauſe two traitors that are in your Court, <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before your Maieſtie, vnto whom I will declare the treaſon which they haue done againſt you. Much affrighted was <hi>Broquadan</hi> and his companion, hearing <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griotta</hi> ſpeake after this manner, who continuing his ſpeech ſaide: If it like your highneſſe, theſe two wicked perſons of whom I ſpeake, without reſpect or feare of God or men, haue falſly accuſed my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; other of a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they neuer ſo much as in thoght offended. By means whereof I dare well ſay, that you haue baniſhed from you the beſt Knights that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer entered into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> therefore if thoſe traitours dare maintaine that they be not ſuch as I tearme them, I alone, by the help of God, and the edge of my ſword will make them confeſſe it. And if they ought to bee excuſed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their age, there is neither of them both which hath not a ſonne of long time bearing armes, and well enough eſteemed of amongſt the Knights of your court, againſt whom I will fight if they will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the quarrell of their wicked fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Moſt mighty ſoueraigne, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Gandandel,</hi> doth not your grace ſee the boldnes of this proud iniurious fellow, who is come into this countrey to no other end, but onely to ſhame the Gentlemen of your court? By my faith if your Maieſtie would haue beleeued me long agoe, ſo ſoone as hee had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into your Realme, hee ſhould haue bin hanged vp, vpon the firſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7181:221"/>
tree that he had come vnto, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your grace doth ſuffer him, you muſt not hereafter be abaſhed if <hi>Amadis</hi> in his owne perſon doe come euen hither to iniurie your owne ſelfe. Notwithſtanding, thus much I proteſt, that by the liuing God, if I were as young now as when I began to enter into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the late deceaſed king your brother, vnto whom I haue done many great ſeruices, I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that <hi>Angriotta</hi> durſt not ſo much as haue dreamed to vtter halfe theſe iniurious words of me, as hee hath proferred now before your Maieſty. But the gallant doth well know that I am olde and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as well by the great number of my aged yeeres, as by the infinit wounds which I haue receiued, in a manner in all the parts of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in the warres of your predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, witnes wherof are yet theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes. Saying ſo he opned his breaſt, vpon the which were many ſcarres apparrantly to be ſeene. Villaine, ſaid <hi>Angriotta,</hi> thou doeſt thinke to defend thee with the eloquence of thy tongue. But by the faith of a Knight, if the King do but iuſtice vnto vs both, hee ſhall apparrantly perceiue thy great treaſon. There-withall <hi>Sarquiles</hi> ſtepped forth and kneeling downe, hee ſaid vnto the King: It is long ſince I did aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe your Maieſtie, that ſo ſoone as my Lord <hi>Angriotta</hi> heere preſent, ſhould come vnto your Court. I would let you vnderſtand that, which with my two eares I did hear ſpoken by the mouth of theſe two traitors: heereupon hee recited word by word, the whole conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he had heard, whereat al they that were preſent did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonder to heare ſuch conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies repeated. And for as much if it like your Maieſtie, ſaid <hi>Sarqailes,</hi> as they can in no ſort excuſe them-ſelues, my Lord <hi>Angriotta</hi> and I will combate with their three ſons, if they dare maintaine the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now were they preſent of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſpake, who ſeeing the iniury that was done vnto their aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that euery one gaue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the words of <hi>Sarquiles,</hi> in a great rage they thruſt through the preaſe, and falling on their knees before the King, they ſaid: May it pleaſe your Maieſtie, <hi>Angriotta</hi> and <hi>Sarquiles</hi> haue moſt falſly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly lied in the words which they haue ſaide before your Maieſtie, and whereſoeuer, or whenſoeuer they doe ſay ſo they ſhall lie, and therfore it may pleaſe you preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to grant vnto vs the combate which they haue demanded. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, anſwered the King, it is now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry late, but I am content that to morrow after ſeruice you ſhall do that which you can, as well on the one part as on the other. Then <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> one of the ſonnes of <hi>Broquadan</hi> by the ſiſter of <hi>Gandandel,</hi> a valiant and expert man at arms (but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adicted to villany) ſtepped forth ſaying vnto the King. Sauing the reuerence of your Maieſtie, <hi>Sarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> hath vniuſtly and leaudly lied in all that he hath ſaid, and I ſhall be one of them that will maintaine it againſt him. By my faith, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Angriotta,</hi> if there were a fourth here too, he ſhould be as wel hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as I hope thou ſhalt. Go too then, ſaide the King, depart you all for this day, and to morrow thinke vpon your buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards hee called <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi> and <hi>Giontes</hi> his Nephewe, and after hee had conſulted with them a little while, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Gandandel</hi> and <hi>Broquadan</hi> to come before him, vnto whom hee ſayde: Come hether, you
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7181:221"/>
haue ſo many times declared vnto me, that <hi>Amadis</hi> and his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates had determined to betray me, and to vſurpe vpon mee the land of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe when it is come to an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, you excuſe your ſelues from the combate, ſetting your ſons to maintaine your wickedneſſe, who cannot doe therewithall, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God is iuſt, &amp; by all that I do owe vnto him, it is very lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of you, neuer would I euer haue thought you ſuch as you are. May it pleaſe your Maieſty anſwered <hi>Gandandel,</hi> our children ſeeing vs too ſlow in our iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, put themſelues forward to maintaine the honour of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They had reaſon ſayd <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>medan,</hi> for hardly could you haue recouered any other, &amp; no doubt but you are men of little worth, or reputation, for the Diuell could neuer haue inuented ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as you haue ſet abroach, ſo as if the King ſhould cauſe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch as you are to be hanged, yet could hee not holde him ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the treacherie which you haue done vnto him, but your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall beare the puniſhment for you. My Lord <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſaid they, although you wiſh it ſo, yet ſhall it not haphen ſo, if God pleaſe: for our ſonnes deliuering vs from ſhame, ſhall obtaine the victorie with honour. You ſhall ſee ſayd <hi>Grumedan</hi> what the iſſue will bee. And becauſe this talke continued longer then the King liked, hee ſent euery man vnto his lodging. And the ſame night thoſe which the next morning were to performe the combate, did looke that nothing might be wanting in their armour, eſpecially <hi>Angriotta</hi> and his Nephew, who withdrewe them vnto a Chappell where they continued in prayer vntill the day breake. And becauſe the King had receiued iniurious ſpeeches by the twelue knights of the Iſland, they went vnto their tents, with <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima</hi> and her Damoſels, where they remained all that night. But the day appearing, they all mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted on horſeback, &amp; came to accompany their fellowes <hi>Angriotta</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiles,</hi> vnto the place of combate, there were already arriued the King, Princes, and Lords, with the Queen &amp; the other Ladies. Thus the combatants entred into the field, <hi>Angriotta</hi> and <hi>Sarquiles</hi> on the one ſide, <hi>Tarin, Corian</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> on the other ſide. Then the trumpets ſounded, whereupon each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pulled downe the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of his helmet, and with their Lances in their reſts, they ſet ſpurs to their horſes, running with ſuch force one againſt another, that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> and <hi>Tarin</hi> brake vpon <hi>Angri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otta,</hi> &amp; <hi>Damas</hi> vpon <hi>Sarquiles:</hi> but <hi>Angriotta</hi> hit <hi>Corian</hi> ſo ſound a ſtroke with his Launce that he vn-horſed him. Then turning his face, he ſaw <hi>Tarin</hi> ready with his ſword in his hand: who beholding his brother ouerthrowne, came with great rage againſt <hi>Angriotta,</hi> &amp; thinking to ſtrike him vpon the top of the helmet, the blow fell ſhort, and lighted vpon the head of his horſe, wherewith hee was grieuouſly wounded. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Angriotta</hi> finding that he was neere his enemy, he hit him ſo ſoundly with his ſworde, that with the ſtroke hee vnhorſed him, and at the ſame inſtant he himſelfe perceiued his horſe waxed faint, with the wound hee had receiued vpon his head, forſooke him and leaped on the ground. Then with his ſhield on his arme, he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him whom he had firſt ouer-throwne,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7181:222"/>
who was already riſen vp &amp; marched againſt <hi>Angriotta.</hi> And thus began the combate betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two, where ſhortly after came <hi>Tarin</hi> in like ſorte, and <hi>Angriotta</hi> was to anſwere them both: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he did make knowne, that he was not to ſeeke in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity: for hee had led them ſo roundly that hee gaue them not ſo much leaſure as to take their breath, ſo that in leſſe ſpace then an houre, their armour was hacked in peeces, &amp; they ſo wounded that the blood ran downe on all parts. I belecue there is none of you all that doth heare this Hiſtory, who vnderſtandeth not well enough, that <hi>Angriotta</hi> could not defend himſelfe ſo well, but that hee felt ſome part of the ſtrokes, for he was ſore wounded in many places, yet was it nothing in reſpect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. In the meane time <hi>Sarquiles,</hi> whom <hi>Damas</hi> had in hand, began to be aſhamed with the ouer great reſiſtance that his enemy made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and for the ſame cauſe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpurs vnto his horſe, he found the meanes to buckle with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: and as they were ſtrugling together and ſtriuing who ſhould fall firſt, <hi>Angriotta</hi> doubting that his Nephew would haue the worſt, drew towards him, but before hee came neer vnto him, <hi>Sarquiles</hi> and <hi>Damas</hi> fell down one vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another: By this means was their incounter re-enforced, becauſe that <hi>Angriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> endeauoured to ſuccour his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, &amp; the others to relieue their kinſman: Who being vnder <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiles</hi> could by no meanes riſe vp, for <hi>Sarquiles</hi> held him ſo ſhort, that pulling off his helmet, hee thruſt his ſword into his throat, then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his enemy dead hee left him there, &amp; came running vpon <hi>Tarin</hi> and his companion, who were in a manner out of breath, &amp; ready to yeeld, or to aske mercy. The which the King, <hi>Broquadan</hi> &amp; <hi>Gandandel</hi> perceiuing, they were ſo ſory that they departed. Notwithſtanding although they were diſpleaſed with this ſight, yet all the reſt of the Court there preſent, tooke pleaſure to behold it, for the loue which they did beare vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; his friends. And more gladder yet were they when they ſaw them brought to the extreamity of their vnhappy end. For ſcant had the King turned his head fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but that <hi>Angriotta</hi> did hit <hi>Corian</hi> ſo forcible a blow, that hee quite cut off all his right ſhoulder: with the extreame griefe whereof, giuing a ſigne of his death, he fell downe kiſſing the ground with his noſe, after whom <hi>Tarin</hi> ſtaied not long before he did as much.</p>
                  <p>Thus were the ſons of theſe trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſlaine, for the which <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Oriana,</hi> and many others did greatly reioyce. Then <hi>Angriotta</hi> &amp; his Nephewes tooke the bodies of the vanquiſhed, and dragged them forth of the fields, afterwards they demaunded of the ludges if they had performed as much as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, who anſwered that they had. Whereupon they both rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in great triumph, &amp; accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with their friends, they came vnto the tents of their fellowes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting with them <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her women, becauſe they knew aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was very angry for the good fortune which had hapned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo much hurt did he wiſh vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that he wel perceiued how his affairs proſpered very badly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince he had driuen him away, &amp; the <hi>Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch</hi> knights of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany.</p>
