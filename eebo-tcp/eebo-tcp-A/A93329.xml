         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

voice, by a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
before we have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170083:8"/>
ſcarce enjoyed ſo
much as light for it;
and our eys may be
ſaid to ſet their mark
to it, before we are
able to ſet our hands
to this Article of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſweat of our
brows: for our eys pay
their ſweat, which is
their tears, for what
we taſte, even before
we be able to receive
bread for it; and as we
grow into a ſtate to ſet
our hands to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of labour, we
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170083:8"/>
know there is ſcarce
any thing we reliſh
much, that doth not
coſt us ſweat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
nay we are of
ſuch a conſtitution,
that we can have no
kinde of delectation:
the which ſome want
and ſuffering muſt not
precede to affect us
with the guſt of it, ſo
as we are ſentenced to
pay a great fine of pain
before hand for all
thoſe fleeting, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory
pleaſures, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170083:9"/>
at beſt do but run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our ſenſes, and ſo
paſs away and leave
them again in their
drouth, and privation.
And moſt commonly
the advance of all our
pain and paſſion ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
us nothing of
what they negotiate.
So as a man when he
looketh upon himſelf
in the beſt reflexes
his temporary wiſhes

finde this brand and

               <p>And this is a mark

the diſtaſte of ſatiety
following it, or with
vexation of a deprive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them during
the Order of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections

as we may well ſay
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170083:10"/>
that every thing we
finde now aſſaults our

ſome ſort to kill it,
and to revive to us
the memory of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of ſufferance
we entered into as
ſoon as we entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
light. For which
reaſon the wiſe man
proclaimeth elegantly
the tenour of it ſaying
<hi>Eccleſ. 40. 1. Great
travel is created for all
men, and a heavie yoak
upon the children of</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:170083:11"/>
Adam, <hi>from the day of
their coming forth of
their mothers womb un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the day of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in the mother of
all</hi> their cogitations,
and fears of the heart,
imaginations of things
to come, and the day
of their ending, from
him that ſitteth upon
the glorious ſtate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him that is humbled
in earth and aſhes.
Neither need we look
back upon the defaced
images of all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170083:11"/>
in the dead prints
of Hiſtory, we have
ſuch living figures of
them before our eys,
as muſt needs imprint
upon our thoughts a
lively character of the
deplorable eſtate of
all mortals, whereby
out of the ruines of
houſes whereof you
lament the demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
you may pick
up ſome materials to
build in your mindes
this frame of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
conſtructure of

the greateſt ſtrength
of humane happineſs;
and thus your friends
may in their fall ſome
way ſupport your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and your patience,
when you conſider
how incident it is to
the viciſſitudes of the
world to expoſe unto
us that changeable
ſcene whereof <hi>Solomon</hi>
reporteth this to us.
<hi>Eccleſ. 10</hi> and 7. <hi>I
have ſeen ſervants up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
horſes, and Princes
walking upon the

ground as ſervants.</hi>
And in ſuch capital
letters as theſe you
may now reade the
articles of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of ſufferance,
which man is engaged
in, whereof <hi>Job</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a manifeſt, is
ſigned even by all the
Princes of the earth;
for we finde this under
their hands in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of them, in ſome
part of their lives.
<hi>Job 14 1. Man born
of a woman and living
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170083:13"/>
a ſhort time is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</hi> In ſo much that
after man by ſin had
made miſerie for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in this life, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a mercie of God
to have joyned death
with it, before which
even the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſufficient to
ſhew the Philoſophers
that none can be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
happy. And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this proof, we
mark that <hi>Cain</hi> he who
firſt abuſed death by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170083:13"/>
imploying it to make
ſin, was thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of no leſs a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than the protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of life, which he
had made ſo afflicting
by his fearing to die,
and thus he was made
his own torturer, by
the ignorance of the
evil of life, and of the
good of death which
he had ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited
the knowing
of, for his brothers
goodneſs was thought
worthy to be quickly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170083:14"/>
relieved by death, and
his malice was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the pain of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
it, and to
the ſupplice of a long
life. With good cauſe
then may this be well
reflected on, that the
firſt virtuous and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Abel,</hi> man was
quickly removed out
of this hedg of thorns
his father had ſet, and
reconveyed towards
Paradiſe, and the firſt
impious murtherer
was ſentenced to live
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170083:14"/>
in the pungencie, and
aſperity of theſe pricks
and bryars of the
earth. But ſuch is Gods
wiſdom as he can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
medicines out of
all the Brambles, and
Thiſtles our earth is
over-run with, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
them to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
for he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
even thoſe griefs,
and ſorrows which ſin
introduced to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
of ſin in it ſelf;
ſo as this is an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
worthy of Gods
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170083:15"/>
invention by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and exerciſing

artifice which
God uſeth by hanging

<hi>David</hi> ſaith. <hi>Pſal. 4. 1
In tribulation thou haſt
enlarged me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable
that God
miniſtred this receipt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170083:16"/>
(drawn out of thorns)
to all thoſe Sons of
<hi>Adam</hi> whoſe mindes
he meant to purge and
clarifie; for all the
holy <hi>Patriarks</hi> took
this deterſive potion
of bitterneſs and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in this life; and
it deſerveth our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to note, how the
nearer the time drew
to the manifeſtation
of the Son of God
(who was deſigned
the man of ſorrow) the
paſſions of gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170083:16"/>
grew the bitterer
and the ſharper, for
the <hi>Patriarks</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
by divers mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
which were
not capital, they ſtaid
upon the diſtreſſes of
their life: ſome of the
Prophets as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
to this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the time of
paſſion taſted by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation,
of the cup
of death, in which they
were all but figures of
<hi>Chriſts</hi> cup-bearers, as
<hi>Eſay, Jeremy, Zachary,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:170083:17"/>
and others, and ſo
thoſe ſufferings which
in time were the leaſt
diſtant from <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as
thoſe we finde record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Maccabees)</hi>
came alſo the neareſt
to the horror and acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity
of the paſſions of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Chriſtians
for they went not
ſtraight to death, but
turned about to take
a compaſs of tortures,
to make death bitter
to thoſe they could
not make it terrible; as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170083:17"/>
you may reade in the
execution of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and her ſeven
children, the very
dawning of the day
of paſſion which was
coming on gave them
this light of fortitude.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth this
weight of ſufferance
and ſorrow was always
in ſo natural a motion
upon the children of
God, that it moved
the faſter the nearer it
came to the centre (the
man of ſorrow) who
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170083:18"/>
being the Son of God
by nature, was the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of all the Sons by
grace, and adoption,
and therefore all the
bloudy ſacrifices of
the Law of nature, and
ceremonial, tended and
pointed to him as their
laſt term, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to ſay that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all ages ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and triumpheth
in all the Churches
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170083:18"/>
perſecutions: in <hi>Abel,</hi>
he is killed by a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in <hi>Noah,</hi> he is
derided by a Son, in
<hi>Abraham</hi> he is a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim,
in <hi>Iſaac</hi> a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim,
and in <hi>Jacob</hi> a
Servant, in <hi>Joſeph</hi> he
is ſold, in <hi>Moſes</hi> left a
Derelict, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
he is ſtoned,
ſtarved, and vilefied.
So as all the lines of
holy paſſions, drawn
from the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of all ages tend,
and reſort to this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170083:19"/>
of the man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
the Lamb of God,
ſlain from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world.</p>
               <p>Theſe evidences
may prove unto us
clearly enough the firſt
bond or covenant of
ſufferances we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into as men, (and
even in that notion we
ſeem to be implicit
chriſtians) ſince he who
ſuffered ſufficiently for
us all, maketh all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
afflictions refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raable
to him) it had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170083:19"/>
been very eaſie for me
to have exhibited a
more preciſe manifeſt
of this our firſt deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to ſufferings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of men,
there are ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
draughts of it
ſtamped by the mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
or naturaliſts of
all ages; but I choſe
to deflect a little from
the letter of the Text,
that I might make
the inferences rather
ſtongly uſefull, than
critically uniform; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170083:20"/>
therefore as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſtepped beyond
the out court of the
Gentiles, into part of
the temple, I will not
call back to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
to borrow any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of this
principle, wherein the
proofs are ſo acumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
as all Sects of
Philoſophers which
differ ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the point of
the good mans life,
concur in the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the multiplicity
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170083:20"/>
of the ills thereof, but
I ſhall not as I ſaid
walk aſide into the
gardens and flowry
beds of the Gentiles,
becauſe I conceive it
more proper for your
ſtate, to have ſome
wholeſome confection
to take, than a noſegay
of the flowers of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
to ſmell to
onely, in theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful
times; for the
larg contemplations of
of the miſeries of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature is not a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170083:21"/>
receipt direct, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
enough for your
preſent exigencies, for
that is but as a good
air of meditation, that
may be ſufficient for
ſuch as are but in light
ordinary indiſpoſitions
of fortune, but your
diſtempers require
ſome more forceable
application of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
by taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your mindes the
ſtrongeſt obligations
to patience and longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170083:21"/>
paſs on to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two aſſignments

               <p>WHat we have
ſaid of our firſt
obligation may well
extenuate all, we are
bound to ſuffer by the

behold the infelicity of

are men, we may well
wonder more that we
are preferred to be

we are continued to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170083:22"/>
be ſufferers: for ſure
if God had conſulted
with <hi>Adam</hi> after he
ſaw his own naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the anexture
of all the miſeries
thereunto whither he
would have bowed the
heavens &amp; have come
down, to repair this
his ruinous condition,
by his inveſting his
miſerable human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

Seeing he who made
all by one word, could
have redintegrated <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
with a word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
without the Word
being made fleſh, and
being as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made
himſelf (as the
Apoſtle warrants us
to ſay) by taking that
fleſh upon him, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170083:23"/>
was become as it were
mans priſon, ſo far was
it from being worthy
to be the receptacle of
God.</p>
               <p>When we conſider
then how God choſe
this way of commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
our nature, not
to purg it by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
but by the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
thereof, by
taking the paſſibleneſs
of it upon him, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny the ſuffering
part to be the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
property of it,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170083:24"/>
ſince God made uſe
of that onely for the
reſtauration of it,
wherefore the feeling
that portion of human
nature upon us, which
is the moſt ennobled
by Gods election, and
preference, cannot
rightly be accounted
a prejudiced condition,
whereupon we may
conclude that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of being Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
may eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
us to the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being ſufferers,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170083:24"/>
for what can be the
reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> when
by his pains he took
away the ſting of ſin,
could not alſo take off
the points of ſuffering
in this life; which are
but thorns of that
plant, but becauſe his
paſſions had infuſed
ſuch a quality into our
pains, as might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this ſtrange effect
in our nature, to make
our root the leſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of bearing fruit
by the excreſcenſe, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170083:25"/>
growth of theſe ſprigs
out of it, for temporal
afflictions ſpring out
of ſin; as out of the
root thereof, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
drieth up, and
infecundateth ſo much
the radicall fructify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vigor of this root,
as the ſpringing up of
temporal miſeries, and
diſtreſſes; ſo as the fruit
of ſin, which is death
is killed the ſooneſt by
the fertility of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in this life.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170083:25"/>
then by the virtue of
his Crown of thorns
imparted this faculty
of the aſperities of our
life, of taking off the
growth as his did the
guilt of ſin, we need
not wonder why he
hath left all theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
bitterneſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our nature which
he himſelf took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
to taſte in our
nature: ſo as we may
be ſaid to become the
more Chriſtians, the
more we are called to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170083:26"/>
be patients. Which
poſition we ſhall finde
the more clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
to us, the
farther we advance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the principles of
Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he
wrot to the <hi>Romans</hi> in
thoſe times, when in a
paralel of our caſes the
Chriſtians were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
immured up in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and partly expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the adjoyning
fields thought (it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
to ſweeten their

condition to them by
repreſenting that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,

<hi>Rom 6. 3. Are you

Intimating that our
firſt incorporation into
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170083:27"/>
the bodie of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is
in effect an expiration
of this world, and a
tranſlation by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the death of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> into ſuch a ſort
of life as he hath pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terned
to us by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
progreſs, and
conſummation of his
life. And the Apoſtle
preſſeth thus the proof
of this aſſertion <hi>Rom.
6. 4. For we are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>d
together with him in
baptiſm into death:</hi> to
evince this poſition
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170083:27"/>
that our mundanity is
drowned, and buried
in our Chriſtning, and
that the life of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
which was a continued
part of mortification
is to be (as it were) our
breath, and animation.
And while we are in
this ſpiritual manner
buried in the life of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is covered,
and incloſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we are acting that
part we took upon us
in baptiſm, where we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170083:28"/>
iſted our ſelves into
that <hi>militia</hi> which was
erected by him, who
killed death by dying,
and hath left the ſame
diſcipline to all his
ſouldiers to deſtroy
death by dying to the
world: mortifications
therefore muſt needs
be the proper duties of
that ſervice a chriſtian
is upon, and his pay is
conditioned rather up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ſuffering, than
his acting as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
proceedeth to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170083:28"/>
For if we become
complanted to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of his death,
we ſhall be alſo of his
reſurrection. So in a
Chriſtians caſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of death is life, for
if he die here by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the carnal life
of this world, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
the condition
of life everlaſting. For
which reaſon S. <hi>Paul</hi>
who was the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the Gentiles
in this militancy (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
this kinde of dying
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170083:29"/>
death is ſwallowed up
in Victory) hath left us
his diſcipline in <hi>1 Cor.
15.</hi> I die dayly; and he
giveth us thoſe orders.
To be the followers of
him as he was of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
whom he began not to
follow untill he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
he had in this
world, and was (as it
were) reſuſcitated by
the ſame hand that had
killed him. We may
remember he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
by what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170083:29"/>
to this life, by
being almoſt famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and illuminated by
this worlds darkneſs,
and reſtored to corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
light, onely to ſee
how much he vvas to
ſuffer for that Name
for which all the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
he had in his
head were to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
far differing from
this deſign; for they
were aſſigned to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
by himſelf not
to be diſpenſed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170083:30"/>
by his hand ſo as
this ſeemeth the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
the having of
all that treaſure of
croſſes he had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
appropriated to
his own uſe; whereof
he grew ſo ſenſible, as
in gratitude to this his
preference, he returned
his. I do exceedingly
abound in joy in all our
tribulation.</p>
               <p>But let us look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his maſter and ours
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170083:30"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in his own
time of tribulation, and
we may repreſent him
to our ſelves, in the
firſt inſtant of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
accepting this
Order from his father,
which he gave to his
follower S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of
<hi>Acts 9. 15. I will ſhew
him how great things he
muſt ſuffer for my Name
before the Gentiles, and
Kings, and the children
of</hi> Iſrael. In which
commiſſion he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
three and thirty
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170083:31"/>
years, wherein, all we
are acquainted with of
his life is either labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or incommodious,
or in extremity dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and painfull. It
ſeems the holy Ghoſt
did not think any
thing worthy to ſtand
upon record for <hi>Christ</hi>
that was not eminently
ſuffering, and therefore
paſſed over in ſilence,
thoſe parts of his life
which we may ſuppoſe
to have been the leaſt
diſtreſsfull. If we look
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170083:31"/>
upon his way that is
drawn out to us from
his cradle to his Croſs,
we ſhall finde that he
fore-ſaw in all ages,
more than the perſons
themſelves who are
under them can do. He
truly bore all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and our griefs.
All the anxieties, and
contriſtations that
now oppreſs you were
in a ſharper degree
preſſing upon his heart
and ſince he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to aggravat all his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170083:32"/>
ſufferings by taking
on him the ſenſe of
your grievances, may
not you very eaſily
alleviate all your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſes,
by taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your minde the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of ſufferings,
which were deſigned
for your ſuccor in your
temptations, by the
reflection upon his
precedent? ſo that his
example is not a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
injunction on you
to ſuffer, but a confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an abilitie to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170083:32"/>
ſuſtain it, and a means
to improve, and ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorate
your eſtate in
your coinheritance
with him: for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
inforceth this
Doctrine with this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy
of A fathfull
ſaying <hi>2 Tim. 2. 12.
For if we be dead with
him, we ſhall live alſo
together, if we ſuſtain
we ſhall alſo reign to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This deſerves well
our conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation, that
the fulneſs of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170083:33"/>
did inhabit in
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the clear
viſion of God did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
illuminate him,
notwithſtanding this,
it was miraculouſly
diſpoſed by God, that
the affluence of joy
ſpringing from the dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſhould not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
his body, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
the inferior porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his ſoul, that
there might be left
room for pain and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh;
the which was
manifeſt in his paſſion,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170083:33"/>
in ſo much as ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
miracles were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
for an admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
into his moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
minde: If God
were pleaſed thus to
multiply miracles, that
affliction might have
acceſs to his beloved
Son, in whom he was
ſo well pleaſed; ſhall
we with whom he hath
ſo much cauſe to be
diſpleaſed wonder at
any calamity, or tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
whereby he is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170083:34"/>
pleaſed to correct us,
eſpecially when it is a
mark of our filiation,
and fraternity with
<hi>Chriſt?</hi> We who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be exempt from
ſufferings without a
miracle, as we are Sons
of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhall we be
aſtoniſhed at any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
under this
notion of brothers,
nay even Members of
<hi>Chriſt?</hi> in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith
excellently, that Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and tender Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170083:34"/>
are not decent,
and becoming a head
ſtuck full of thorns.
Therefore the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and pungencies
of this life make the
Symmetry, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the body of
Chriſtianity, to the
head <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> who
ſince he did not ſo
much as ſpeak one idle
vvord, all his praiſes,
and Beautifications of
the poor, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
muſt needs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the good of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170083:35"/>
And Surely
<hi>Chriſt</hi> did much leſs
do any idle deed, and
if the exemplarie life
of his labours, and one-rations
had not been
directed to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
therein, there
might ſeem ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervacuouſneſs
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy
in his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
hardneſs, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie
of life. Would
God have afflicted his
onely Son ſo, if it were
indifferent to do, or
not to do as he did? or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170083:35"/>
that it did not concern
thoſe vvhom he had
fore-knovvn, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated
to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the image
of his Son in this point
that he might be the
firſt born of many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
Our fraternity
therefore is derived to
us by this ſimilitude.
Our ſins might have
been effaced not onely
by a drop of <hi>Chriſts</hi>
bloud, but even by a
drop of his ſvveat;
vvherefore this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170083:36"/>
one of the chief
reaſons that did induce
the atrocity of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and the auſteritie
of his life, the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſuch a patern
for our imitation, ſince
our nature vvas grown
ſo degenerous, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate,
as no leſs
than gods participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the ſorts
of grievances, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
thereof, would
ſerve to form in us a
chearfull diſpoſition
to the ſufferings, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170083:36"/>
infelicities of this life
God did not therefore
intend to vex us, when
he placed our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in difficulties, and
in our natures averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for to ſweeten
the bitterneſs of this
ſtrong neceſſity, which
was to work upon our
nature, to purg us from
the love of this world
he was ſo gratious, as
to infuſe the company
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> into this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
that the taſte of
his ſociety might make
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170083:37"/>
more pleaſant to us
the ill ſavour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbity
of the remedy.
Well therefore may
we ſay. A greater than
<hi>Eliſha</hi> is here, who
hath amended theſe
waters by but taſting
of them, and hath left
neither death nor bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
in them; for
they are become ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waters ſpringing
up to life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>And we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to Gods method
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170083:37"/>
with his Son Chriſt
continued the ſame
ſtile to his Mother;
for ſhe whom all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
were to call
bleſſed was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any of what this
world calls Bleſſings;
for ſhe who had born
the Redeemer of the
whole world, was not
able to go to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rate of the Temple,
for his Redemption;
her poor eſtate did not
reach to pay ſo much
as a Lambe for the Son
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170083:38"/>
of God, and the Lamb
who was to take away
the ſins of the world,
had not ſo much as a
Lamb for his Ranſom.
The loweſt price that
was ſet for any of the
children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was
the rate her low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was taxed at,
none was ſet at leſs
than a pair of Pidge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or a pair of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
and the Mother
of God was in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
form of the
Daughters of Men.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170083:38"/>
This may ſerve to
ſweeten the bittereſt
water of poverty
when we ponder this,
that <hi>Christ</hi> would not
allow his Mother to
taſte of any other
ſpring; and though he
would not let her taſte
of the ſowreneſs of
the forbidden fruit:
yet he fed her more
than any other with
theſe bitter Leaves,
which grew out of the
ſame root, that is,
though he was pleaſed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170083:39"/>
to exempt her from
ſin, yet he would not
diſpenſe with her in
ſufferings, which we
know are but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of ſin; and
ſo ſhe whom we may
ſuppoſe to have been
excepted out of the
rule of ſinners, was
exalted above any in
the ſtate of ſufferers.
And this ſeems to be
very conſonant, that as
ſhe was Mother to the
man of ſorrow, and of
no ſin, ſo ſhe ſhould
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170083:39"/>
be a bearer of all
griefs without any
guiltineſs: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
this point is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by all parties
that being the pureſt
of all creatures, <hi>Luke
2. 29, 35.</hi> ſhe was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the leſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of all Patients:
when ſhe came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
her own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
by the legal
ranſom, and was to
enter into poſſeſſion of
her Son, we may note
that the joys that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſaged
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170083:40"/>
her by <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in him were very
dark, and myſtical,
but her own ſorrows
very clear and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.
For this myſtery
of her having a light
to the revelation of
the Gentiles in her
arms, and the glory of
thy people <hi>Iſrael</hi> was
hard to be underſtood
of one that was in the
loweſt rank of the
people: but this part
was eaſie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of his being a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170083:40"/>
mark of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that a ſword
ſhould pierce through
her own ſoul.</p>
               <p>Nature it ſelf evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth
the miſeries
which mothers are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to from children,
and thus ſhe had here
her ſorrows and her
ſufferings writ to her
in the common Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet
of nature, and
her joys and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
cyphered out
onely to her in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and characters
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170083:41"/>
of grace, which are ſo
hard to be decypher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though it may be
ſhe had the key of
them: but howſoever
her faith was to be
exerciſed by a tedious
and very ſudden triall
in affliction. She
quickly found the
ſword in her ſoul, for
we may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what a wound
her ſudden flight into
<hi>Egypt</hi> was, how many
fears, diſtreſſes and
anxieties, pierced her
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170083:41"/>
tender heart in that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
flight. And
ſure the ſword of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi>
that parted ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mothers and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
pierced her ſoul
even while ſhe poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her childe: ſhe
may well be judged to
have out-ſuffered any
of them in their own
loſſes, for ſhe had the
grief of being the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of all them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her heart, ſo as the
ſword that was drawn
directly againſt her
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170083:42"/>
ſoul though the ſtroke
did not light upon it,
as it was aimed, yet it
may be thought to
have wounded her in a
ſharper manner than it
did any it fell bloudily
upon, for her exquiſite
charity muſt needs
feel all their anguiſhes
and paſſions who were
thus afflicted as perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
her.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how
ſhe began her poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her Son with
the ſorrows of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170083:42"/>
of mothers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on her, and if
we look upon her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſpoſſeſt of her
Son, there we ſhall ſee
the ſword piercing her
ſoul in ſo horrid a
manner, as the pains
which all the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ever
had in the birth, or
death of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were but ſhadows
of her torture: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith,
Neither tongue can
expreſs, nor heart can
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170083:43"/>
conceive the dolours
wherewith the holy
bowels of this Mother
were excruciated.</p>
               <p>Now bleſſed Virgin
you pay with rigorous
intereſt that pain
which nature was not
allowed to exact of
you in your delivery:
the pangs which you
felt not in the birth of
your Son, are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
replicated upon you
at his death, when we
conſider the Mother
of <hi>Christ</hi> ſtanding by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170083:43"/>
the Croſs, and ſeeing
her Son under thoſe
Nails, Thorns, and
Scourges, and all the
other Tortures.</p>
               <p>With what hand
can we hope to touch
this dolefull figure of
the bleſſed Virgin, to
give it a lively reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance?
I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leave it veiled
with this reaſon upon
it, No figure is like to
ſorrow, the not being
pourtraictable being
the neareſt ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170083:44"/>
can be made of
this figure of diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
That which
purporteth moſt to
our purpoſe is, that by
the not being able to
comprehend the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity
of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Mother of
God, we may be the
leſs apt to apprehend
any extremity in our
own: when ſhe who
had at leaſt no actual
ſin to expiate, had ſo
much ſorrow to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
her virtue. How
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170083:44"/>
ſhall we (who have
ſo much ſin to ſatisfie
for) wonder at any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
whereof we
have ſo much need to
ſanctifie us?</p>
               <p>There is then no
reaſon why we ſhould
fear to be miſtaken, in
taking croſſes for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
indignities
for honours, poverty
for treaſures, ſince the
eternal wiſdom, and
divine underſtanding
hath counſelled this
acceptation of them,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170083:45"/>
not onely by his adviſe
but by his Mothers
preſident, and his own
perſonal inveſture of
them. He who is both
the ſupreme goodneſs,
and the ſupreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
choſe by thoſe low
humbled means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
us, and by the
ſame we muſt perfect
our ſalvation; the work
muſt be finiſhed by the
ſame inſtruments by
which it was begun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> told his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170083:45"/>
manſions in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe, but never
gave them notice of
any other way to any
of them but this of the
croſſes, and miſeries of
this world; &amp; ſurely
as he ſaid of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
ſo may we ſay of
the marches to them, if
there had been another
paſſage he would have
told it them. This nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
is all the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we finde either by
his life, his doctrine or
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170083:46"/>
his death. <hi>Mat. 11. 12.
The kingdom of heaven
ſuffereth violence, and
the violent bear it away.</hi>
Is the word, or motto
belonging to the Arms
of the Goſpel: and as
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, no body
aſcendeth into heaven
but he that deſcended
out of heaven; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he vouchſafed to
come down to live out
this way, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
upon his ſacred
humanitie: So that
now this way lyeth ſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170083:46"/>
fairly marked out by
the prints of his ſteps, in
his return to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
manſion, as no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
that looketh up to
heaven can miſs the
ſeeing of it, though it
be not the milkie way
of the Poets, but the
bloudy way of the
Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
It is traced out
more fairly in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
which is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
than the other in
the material skie. The
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170083:47"/>
life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſuch a
ſequence, and connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of bright, and ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufferings, as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our ſouls as intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligably
the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as thoſe ſtars do
our eys that ſenſible
trace in the firmament.
We may caſt our eye
upon this Galaxie or
conſtellation of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and depreſſion in
<hi>Chriſts</hi> life, we ſhall
ſee it illuſtrious, and
ſhinning in an humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
under all ſorts of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170083:47"/>
Creatures. He hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himſelf to the
Angels, he vouchſafed
to receive comfort of
an Angel; as if his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
not humility,
had required it. When
he was hungry he was
pleaſed to take food,
as alms from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
when he could
have turned ſtones into
bread. He humbled
himſelf to man, and
woman, remaining o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to his Mother,
and <hi>Joſeph.</hi> He ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170083:48"/>
himſelf to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Princes, to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,
Ceſar, Caiphas,</hi> and
<hi>Pilate,</hi> by underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their burthens, and
their judgments he
ſubmitted himſelf to
vile, and infamous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
as to <hi>Malchus,</hi>
and to his torturers,
deriders, and others.
He yielded himſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to inanimate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ſuffering heat,
and cold, to ſtrike up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and by Iron,
Wood, Thorns, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170083:48"/>
Reeds he indured to be
violated, and offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nay he ſubjected
himſelf to his greateſt
enemy the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
when he ſuffered
him to carry him up
to the pinnacle of the
Temple; So there is
no creature from the
ſublimeſt to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
from the beſt to
the worſt to whom
<hi>Chriſt</hi> did not humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
himſelf.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee
this arch of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170083:49"/>
ſet as it were on
another bowe, in the
clouds of his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for a ſign of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of ſufferances,
wherein I have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to you your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
and this
bowe of his covenant
is ſo extended, as it
makes a perfect circle,
it reacheth from the
ſphere of angelical, to
that of inanimate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
to both which
we ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himſelf, and ſo his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170083:49"/>
ſubjection toucheth
the higheſt, and the
loweſt point of his
own creatures, which
conſideration of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable
humility muſt
needs aſſure us of the
admirable effect it hath
produced of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
croſſes into the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of his body
left upon earth, and ſo
to bring that which
ſeperated his ſoul, and
his body, now to be
the means of reunite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the body to the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170083:50"/>
head, for the croſs is
left in his Church, to
conjoyn, and conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the Members into
their ſuffering head,
<hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and we
may well add, that
this divine ſign of the
croſs ſet in the heaven
of his perſon, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly
remains as
a ſenſible mark of his
promiſe to the Church
of never being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any inundation of
croſſes failing on her.</p>
               <p>Looking up therefore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170083:50"/>
to the heavenly object
of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſufferings
we may be comforted
by our ſimilitude, and
we may rejoyce at our
ſecuritie, which this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
recapitulateth
to us, as often as we
contemplate it; in ſo
much as there is none
of you who groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any preſſure or
tremble under any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>Heb. 12. 2.</hi> But
Looking up upon the
author and finiſher of
out faith <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:170083:51"/>
may not ſee him bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame croſs with
joy, deſpiſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of it. Whither
you ſweat under your
burthens, or whither
you bleed under the
edg of theſe times, you
ſhall finde your perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
both civil and
ſanguinary, patternd to
you in the perſon even
of God, &amp; man, <hi>Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> who hath not
left ſo much as your
fears, and terrours out
of the exemplar of his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170083:51"/>
paſſions, his <hi>Mark 14.
33. He began to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and to fear.</hi> Was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
purpoſely as a
cordial in your fits of
fainting, and if there
were any point in your
afflictions which were
not exemplified to you
in <hi>Chriſts</hi> paſſions, that
circumſtance ought to
prove to you a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
conſolation, in
that you had ſome ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to offer to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> of your own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the coppy and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170083:52"/>
portraicture of his.
But alas all that we
can imagine in our own
pains wherein there is
no imitation of his, is
that which we may
better bluſh at, than
boaſt of; for it is onely
the guilt of deſerving
more than we can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
in this life, this
is ſimply ours in our
afflictions, wherein we
finde no reſemblance
in the figure of <hi>Chriſts</hi>
ſufferings, which part
of our caſes may make
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170083:52"/>
us offer up to <hi>Chriſt</hi>
a thankfull alacrity in
all temporal penalties
infflicted on us, for
having taken off from
us the burthen we
could not remove by
any ſufferings, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left us onely ſuch
preſſures as may alevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the weight of that
intolerable gravation
which is the guilt of
ſin: for our croſſes in
this life by the virtue
of the croſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
(whereof our heavieſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170083:53"/>
are but chips or ſhave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings)
do not onely keep
our ſins lower, but alſo
weigh againſt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
penalty of thoſe
which are in the ſcale.</p>
               <p>It may admit a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whither it be a
more precious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
exerciſe to do
good, or to endure
evils: that ſtate
is certainly the beſt
in which both are
conjoyned, when ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
we act as much
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170083:53"/>
good as we are able.</p>
               <p>Let them then who
have nothing left to
give to God by way
of actions, rejoyce in
the facultie of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:
When King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
extols the dignity
of man he raiſeth it
upon this ground that
God had made him
a little lower <hi>Pſal. 8.</hi>
Then Angels, but in
this reſpect we may
ſay that God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
him above
them by furniſhing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170083:54"/>
him with more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of attaining
heaven than they have
by having coupled a
body to this ſpirit in
which he may ſuffer
for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when many
other capacities of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
his gratitude
are ſuſpended; for man
hath not onely all the
ſeveral powers of his
minde but alſo the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of his body given
him as Organs of
working out ſalvation
by carrying the Croſs
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170083:54"/>
upon them, with this
corporeal furniture
man is enriched above
Angels; ſo as man may
even out of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
infirmities of his
conſtitution extract
matter of glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This virtue hath
been imparted to the
vility of fleſh, &amp; bloud,
ſince God vouchſafed
to be inveſted in it;
Our fleſh received this
priviledg not onely of
being admitted into
heaven, but of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170083:55"/>
to the ſouls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of glory by the
proportions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſuffering; <hi>Rom 8.
13.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, It is
no wonder that God
having giving his own
Son to humane nature,
ſhould have given all
theſe other preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
with him.</p>
               <p>Out of this ſtate
of our mortality the
Saints ſhall riſe as high
as they ſhould have
done from the ſtate of
innocence, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170083:55"/>
which ſhews
that they are equally

their life now, to what

in many ages,
if they had remained
immortal. The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of ſorrows, and
croſſes by the grace of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> countervaileth,
and compenſateth the
numerouſneſs of the
years of our ſervice.
Our redeemer hath left
us this compendious
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170083:56"/>
way of approaching
heaven by the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and moleſtations
of our fleſh, the which
he would not expunge
in it that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
his Father the
children of his moſt
pretious paſſions, as
much purified in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time, as they ſhould
have been in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
of many ages. He
who raiſed above the
higheſt heaven the
heavieſt of our earth
upon this engine of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170083:56"/>
Croſs, hath left it us,
to winde up the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer
our terreſtrial
qualities upon the
ſame Machine. This
was the means which
S. <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of in
all his elevations up
to the third heaven.
<hi>Gal 2. 20.</hi> With <hi>Chriſt</hi>
I am nailed to the
Croſs: carried him up
to that ſublimity; and
he kept himſelf ſo
cloſe nailed to the
Croſs all his life, as
when he was weak
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170083:57"/>
he was ſtrongeſt and
never eſteemed his
raptures ſo much as
his revilings, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominies.
He profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to glory willingly
in nothing but in his
humiliations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2 Cor. 12.</hi> Gladly
will I glory in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
in contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
in neceſſities, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
for <hi>Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
becauſe he found pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was perfected in
infirmity, whereby
we are convinced that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170083:57"/>
thoſe who are called
to Chriſtianity are
aſſigned to all ſorts of
crucifyings.</p>
               <p>All the iniquity of
a Chriſtian conſiſts
either in doing what
<hi>Chriſt</hi> did not, or in
refuſing to do what
he did, and none can
excuſe themſelves by
an in capacity of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> in that
wherein he hath been
pleaſed to ſtate Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
profeſſion; for every
one may be poor, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170083:58"/>
patient, and mortified,
but every one is not
qualified to attain to
Riches, Honour, or
Learning. This is the
wiſdom, and love of
God, to have thoſe
things made the beſt
contributions to our
eternal felicity, which
may not onely be
reached by every one,
but can even ſcarce be
miſſed by any, which
are the afflictions, and
adverſities, of this life,
wherefore thoſe who
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170083:58"/>
it may be would not
have had the Zeal to
affect a ſimilitude to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe hard
touches of Gods hand,
muſt not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
as to repugne
this operation of God
upon them, or be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
and confuſed
to ſee this figure of
deformity in the

upon them, in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

of friends, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of enemies and

acknowledg a mercy of

whereunto they have
anſwered but ill in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

you to underſtand
clearly the integral

ſo much efficacy to it,
ſuppoſing the patience
I handle to be an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170083:60"/>

ſaith, True pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
ordaineth us to
endure all kindes of
evils of pain, to avoid
all manner of ills of
guilt. Theſe definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170083:61"/>
do not admit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a lame, or a pide
patience to enter
into this high form
of efficacy, that is,
if it be peccant, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in progreſs and
continuation, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
in the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that is required in
it, of ſubmitting to all
ſorts and degrees of
ſufferances, as coming
all from one provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
If we have any
exception againſt any
of this Jury of Gods
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170083:61"/>
chuſing to try us by, it
is a ſign our patience is
but ſpotted, and party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd,
or if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting,
and by fits
onely, this betrayeth
the unſoundneſs of it.
Wherefore we muſt
endeavour to certifie
our nature in theſe two
deficiences, to which
it is very liable: The
firſt is of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory
intervals, in
which we let in
impatience, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
to detract at
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170083:62"/>
leaſt from the intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this virtue,
and ſuffer our ſenſes to
ſpeak too freely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth
them. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is of our aptneſs
to make motions to
God for ſome eſpecial
exceptions in our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,
reſigning
our ſelves but partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his deſign upon
us, and likewiſe this
deprecation is of the
preſent croſſes that are
upon us, believing we
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170083:62"/>
could place any other
to ſit lighter upon us,
if that were removed,
with which we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
charged, and
thus we are commonly
tempted inſtead of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for patience to
God, to deſire his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in our repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and that he would
change his minde ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than ours. This
is a familiar irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in our natures, in
the point of our ſins,
as well as of our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170083:63"/>
there are but
few that have not ſome
boſome ſorrow, that
they would compound
for the being exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from, and offer a
reſignation to all the
reſt: but this is that
heſitation, or ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
(as I may ſay)
in our patience, which
is a great impediment
to our converſation
with God.</p>
               <p>I do not cenſure the
firſt motions or the
propenſions of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170083:63"/>
to ſuch eaſes, and
diſcharges for ſuch a
fault as ſhould diſtract
or ſcandalize any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in this
kinde; for as S. <hi>James</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Jam. 3. 2. In
many things we offend
all; if any offend not
in word this is a perfect
mar.</hi> Theſe inclinations
to eaſe are (as we may
ſay) ſlips of the tongue
not of the minde, but
ſuch trips and faltrings
as are hardly fully to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170083:64"/>
be redreſſed: therefore
this animadverſion is
intended onely for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to every one that
findes theſe knots, and
ſtands in their patience
to endeavour to work
them out faithfully,
by prayer, and not to
ſtop, or hang willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon them. But the
interruption or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and breaking off
into fits of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
complaints, is
much more to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautioned,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170083:64"/>
and mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for reformation;
for according to Saint
<hi>Augustines</hi> ſimilitude,
this is not onely to
ſtrike out of tune, but
even to break the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument;
for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
patience to a
Lute, and tribulation
to the ſtrings, which
while they are well
touched make muſick;
and ſo whileſt patience
praiſeth God, and
gives thanks in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
it yieldeth a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170083:65"/>
ſweet melodie to the
ears of God; but
when we fall into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulouſneſs
and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
we break the
Lute. When therefore
we are ſo far advanced
towards victory as the
having our ſenſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
by affliction,
the pleaſures of which
are our enemies ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
inſtruments, we
muſt watch that he
forge not new arms
out of our pains, which
God hath given us as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170083:65"/>
armour againſt his
ſhafts; and when he
hath ſcarce any art left
to wound us by ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
through the
hardneſs of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then he tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us by the weight of
our armour, to bring
us to throw it off by
impatience, and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which indeed is
to caſt off the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
armour that God
giveth the ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the devil, and
the fleſh. When the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170083:66"/>
Tempter hath nothing
left but pain whereby
to provoke us to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
one would
think he were not to be
feared, ſince all impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
is but a new
pain, which is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to us, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſider that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
when we are
ſolicited to unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and reluctation.</p>
               <p>When we ſuffer by
the violence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
of our enemies,
the devil would get
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170083:66"/>
nothing by this nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
if we ſhould
bear it patiently, and
virtuouſly; for he
would loſe ſo much on
the one ſide as he had
got on the other;
what he had gained
upon thoſe he had
made his Officers, and
emiſſaries of iniquity
and injuſtice he would
loſe as much by the
ſufferers improvement
and ſanctification, and
ſo his malice would be
unprofitable unto him,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170083:67"/>
therefore when he hath
prevailed with the one
part to act his ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
to the innocent,
then he turneth to the
other paſſive ſide, and
labours to excite their
murmur, fury, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
that his trade
may render him profit
on both ſides; a great
prize by the malice he
imports into the
hearts of his Factors,
and may have ſome
gain alſo exported
to him out of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170083:67"/>
mindes of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.
We know when
Satan had ſet the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans</hi>
&amp; the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>
a work againſt <hi>Job,</hi> he
left no art uneſſayed
to infuſe the fire of
murmur and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
into his breaſt,
and he took the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſt
way; for he got
fully into that half of
him that lay in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
and though he
did not kindle any
ſpark of rebellion
in his own holy
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170083:68"/>
breaſt, yet we may ſay
his heart was a little
over-heated in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
of that fiery
fornace he lay ſo long
in; for his breath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
a little of
ſome diſtemper which
he found in it. By
which we are not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
to let our
tongues looſe when
they preſs and ſtrain
to break from us, to
run after ſome provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to murmur and
complaint, but rather
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170083:68"/>
warned to be exactly
vigilant in all ſuch
motions, ſince he
whom God choſe for
his champion, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not his like upon
the earth had ſuch
words ſhaken out of
him in his ſtorm, as
we may believe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
more their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
eſcaped him, than
he did all the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he had ſuffered
from his adverſary,
for he never wiſhed
any thing recall'd but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170083:69"/>
his words. <hi>Chap. 40.
verſ. 4. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be a forceable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to us, to ſet a watch
over our lips, when
God hath ſet ſuch a
guard over our heart,
as affliction, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a good cauſe. Let
us not then, when
there is no fault in the
cauſe make one in the
calamity, by our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
ſince we
ought rather to render
double praiſes both
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170083:69"/>
for out affliction &amp; for
our innocence. When
we are puniſhed for
crimes we ought to
have patience, &amp; when
we ſuffer innocently
we may well add glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to it; and we finde
a good cauſe produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this effect in the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> when
they were in your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
whom the holy
Ghoſt hath left upon
record as a preſident
for you. <hi>2 Cor. 8. 2.</hi>
In much experience of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170083:70"/>
tribulation they had
abundance of joy, and
their very deep pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
abounded unto the
riches of their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity:
All this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of virtue iſſued
out of the mine of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and longanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which maketh by
the power of grace e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the duration of
the pain an Antidote
againſt impatience.</p>
               <p>But by exhibiting
unto you this high mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of patience which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170083:70"/>
is (as I may ſay) a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
confirmation of
all virtue, I do not
intend to diſcourage
thoſe who are but
yet initiated and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized
in this miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for this ultimate
perfection of rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in tribulation is
not a precept that
claimeth our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
but a counſel
that ſheweth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
we may aſpire
to; which the grace
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170083:71"/>
in our reach to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
that virtue, which
though it ſeem ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
is but ſuitable
to the Members of
ſuch a head. Thoſe
therefore who finde
not in their natures
this finiſhed diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
need not perplex
themſelves with any
ſcruple of faultineſs,
for if they are but in
this temper of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
and humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
of God that
grace which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170083:71"/>
for the diſcharge
of their duties in theſe
caſes of temptations,
though they finde for
the preſent ſome aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and reintencie in
their mindes againſt
their miſeries, they
may ſafely conclude
that God will mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and ſuppeditate
grace ſufficient for
their ſupport from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into any direct
ſedition, ſo long as
they feel a ſound and
rectified deſire to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170083:72"/>
in the ſtate of
perfect abnagation.
Let them not diſquiet
themſelves with their
diſtances from the top
of the mountains ſo
long as they are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
climbing, in this
caſe the indulgence of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is very appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
when he ſaith:
<hi>Mark. 9. 40. verſ. Thoſe
that are not againſt
him are with him.</hi> So
long as we finde not
our will joyned with
our weakneſs againſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170083:72"/>
this ſelf-denial we ſhall
not be charged with
diſloyalty.</p>
               <p>There was a great
cloud of infirmity in
that Fathers faith,
when he began with
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Mark. 9. 22.
If thou canſt any thing
help us;</hi> yet as ſoon as
he was advanced to.
<hi>I do believe Lord help
my incredulity.</hi> His
ſuit was granted, in
like manner when we
begin with much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
we muſt not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170083:73"/>
diſtract our ſelves in
apprehenſions of our
faintneſs, but proceed
ſincerely to. I deſire,
O Lord, a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to all thy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
help my incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
This prayer
continually purſued
will certainly obtain
the expulſion of that
ſpirit which caſts us
often into fire, and
water, into ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
in onr affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
let us remember
<hi>Chriſts</hi> leſſon in this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170083:73"/>
caſe. All things are
poſſible to him that
believeth.</p>
               <p>If we aſpire faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this perfection
we ſhall quickly finde
we have dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
left; when we
have once ingeniouſly
undertaken our own
reduction, we muſt not
expect to taſte ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
the good reliſh
of mortification. The
firſt fruits of <hi>Canaan</hi>
were held to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
to figure to us
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170083:74"/>
that there is always
ſome impurity in
our firſt thoughts, and
deſigns of a ſpiritual
conformity; we muſt
expect ſuch a progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in this perfection
of Chriſtianity, as <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac</hi>
made the digging
of his wells in the Land
of Promiſe. The firſt
water he called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
the ſecond En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment,
and at the
laſt he came to that
he called Abundance,
when all ſtrife and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170083:74"/>
was ceaſed. So
we ſhall in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our digging
for this refreſhing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of patience finde
the inhabitants of our
earth (our ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites)
raiſe great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and in our
purſuance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
we ſhall meet
with leſs contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and more enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our ſpirits,
and at the laſt after a
faithfull proſecution
we come to that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170083:75"/>
of water which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John 7 38. Out of
his belly ſhall flow rivers
of living water.</hi> Which
is not onely acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence,
but joy and
exultation in all preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and diſtreſſes.
This is the method of
our advance in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
graces as the
Pſalmiſt deſignet to
us. They ſhall go from
virtue to virtue.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt
not be diſmayed and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170083:75"/>
relaxed when at firſt
we encounter difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and conteſtation
in our ſenſes againſt
patience, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
but remember
how gratious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
God is to a
little tender virtue,
that hath but the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of ſincereneſs, as
the holy ſpirit inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth
by the Angel
in the Revelation ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Apoc. 3. 8. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I have given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee a door opened
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170083:76"/>
which no man can ſhut,
becauſe thou haſt a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
power, and haſt kept
my word, and hast not
denyed my Name.</hi> So
that here we ſee God,
to a little diſpoſition
openeth a large paſſage
towards plenitude,
and conſummation.</p>
               <p>When therefore we
finde our hearts ſet to
keep Gods word, and
that in the firſt incoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our virtue we
do but accept afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in his Name. He
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170083:76"/>
that is the holy One,
and the true One, will
open that door of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the whole
world ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſhut any more
againſt us. Wherefore
in all our ſtraights, and
coactions, either of
our ſpirits, or of our
fortunes, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how the holy
Spirit calls to us; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
thy mouth and I
will fill it. As long as
we do not contract
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170083:77"/>
and ſhrink our hearts
in a perverſe chagrin;
we need not fear the
finding them yield,
and give a little at the
firſt in the preſſures of
affliction, and though
we never arrive at
this laſt ſtation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
patience, of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in tentations, there
are many manſions in
heaven which anſwer
the ſeveral promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon earth.</p>
               <p>Not all Apoſtles,
not all Prophets,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170083:77"/>
                  <hi>1 Theſſ. 1. 14.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
promiſeth their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<hi>Apoc. 18.</hi> To
them that fear thy
Name, little and great.
So long as we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
our own minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we may hope for
our portion among
the little ones. This I
ſay onely by S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
warrant of, Comfort
the feeble hearted,
ſupport the weak: for I
perſwade every one to
this holy ambition of
aſcending as high even
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170083:78"/>
as the ſteps of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
can raiſe them;
and there is no Ladder
ſo good as this of the
Croſs to ſcale by:
and in our invitation
to the nuptial Supper
of the Lamb, it is not
humility, but rather
puſilanimity, to aim
to ſit down but in the
loweſt place; they who
point no higher, deſign
to ſtay too near the
door, and ſo may more
eaſilier fall ſhort of
that than they who
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170083:78"/>
aſpire to the place of
thoſe who have left
all for <hi>Christ,</hi> which
is the throne of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nations.</p>
               <p>With good cauſe
then I humbly adviſe
every ones aſpiring to
the ſupremeſt pitch of
patience, and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And I have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to diſcharge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one from dejection,
and confuſedneſs in
this caſe of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
when they do
loyally and ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170083:79"/>
enterpriſe a profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in this virtue.
And for this reaſon
the Apoſtle when he
adviſeth perfection,
yet admitteth infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to an expectance of
Gods perfecting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
ſaying, <hi>Phil. 3. 15.
Let us as many as are
perfect be thus minded,
and if you be any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
minded this alſo
God will reveal to you.</hi>
They who are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſtated in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170083:79"/>
virtue may hope for a
further improvement
by the compaſſion of
God to ingenious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes.</p>
               <p>Gods indulgence to
the compleatneſs of
our patience muſt
therefore be taken
hold on, onely as they
ſtay to keep us from
falling into dejection,
and is not to be uſed
as a Reſt whereon to
lean the wrineſs and
bent of our perverted
nature; for ſo we may
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170083:80"/>
inſenſibly induce an
habit of crookedneſs,
and petulancy into our
own diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>Let us have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this direction of
S. <hi>James</hi> always in
our deſign at leaſt:
<hi>Jam. 1. 3. Let patience
have a perfect work,
that you may be perfect
and intire, failing in
nothing.</hi> By this we
may reſt aſſured of
the perfection which is
contained in patience,
ſince the Apoſtle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170083:80"/>
this integrity,
and indeficiency to it
in all things. So as
when we are poſſeſt of
this compleatment of
patience, then we are
inſtated in a fortune
which is ſo obnoxious
to the diſtreſſes of any
want, that all privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
adminiſter to
us the end of all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
which is joy
and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>This hath always
been the ſtate of the
Saints by whieh ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170083:81"/>
nothing they
were poſſeſſing all
things, <hi>2 Cor. 6. 10.</hi>
For out of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
they who loſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
children, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and lands, for the
Goſpel have their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment
for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fold now in this
time. And in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this truth
we finde by experience
that there is no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo perfect in this
world, that hath not
often need of patience
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170083:81"/>
to make it tolerable:
and they who have
perfect patience never
want any other poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
to make their
conditions acceptable.
All which duly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
I ſhall not need
ſay more in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
virtue: but it
is requiſite to cloſe up
this point with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling

is a conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch
of it by prayer.
In that order therefore
I ſhall leave it to you
with this petition of
S. <hi>Paul</hi> for the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi>
upon the ſame
occaſion. Our Lord
direct your hearts in
the charity of God,
and patience of
CHRIST.</p>
