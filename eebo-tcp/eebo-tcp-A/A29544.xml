            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS enſuing Letter having long lurked in ſome private hands, not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them for whom it has been prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally deſigned; Tranſcribing and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of large Papers being uneaſie, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the vulgar, falling now at length into my hand, I do here preſent it to thee in Print, for thy eaſe and profit. I know not the Author, nor does it much concern you or me, <hi>Quis dixit,</hi> but, <hi>Quid dictum.</hi> Naked truth will doubtleſs be acceptable to lovers of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> whoever the Herald be that publiſhes it. Nor is it my part to write an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Commendatory; all I ſhall ſay is, <hi>Tolle &amp; Lege,</hi> do but once ſeriouſly, and without a preoccupied mind peruſe it, and read it through, and it is hoped it ſhall not repent you of your labour. You ſee it is an <hi>Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> deſigned to caſt water upon theſe unhappy flames, which have burnt up, conſumed and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more of the intereſt of Piety in that Land, than Tongue or Pen can expreſs. And ſince our Bleſſed Lord hath ſaid, <hi>bleſſed are the Peace-makers,</hi> it is expected the children of Peace will not refuſe an ear to the counſels of peace, nor count it an unhappineſs to be charmed by the words of truth and peace here held forth with convincing light, and perſwaſive

power. The Author it ſeems hath not affected to be like ſome, <hi>Verborum Mare, Rerum Inane.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light will <hi>projicere ampullas, &amp; ſeſquipedalia verba,</hi> to bogle conſciences with big and busked words; the ſimplicity of the Goſpel ſeems the moſt native and proper dreſs for the Truths of Chriſt.

It is true, none of thoſe dividers, with whom the Author deals, had than unmask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, nor run to that height of extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which ſome of late have been carried unto; and therefore all are mildly and modeſtly dealt with. But conſidering the ſtate of the Controverſie, and of the perſons, as <hi>then</hi> it was, and <hi>ſtill</hi> (for moſt part) is, it is hoped ye will find this Paper, through the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> not a little uſeful for clearing doubts, compoſing differences, and binding up of wounds. And ſeeing that fire ſtill burneth (and is like to burn all into aſhes) among that poor afflicted remnant, to contribute my mite of help to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ſame, is my aim in letting thee have it in Print.

            <p>WE ſalute you heartily in the Lord: Grace and Peace, through Jeſus Chriſt be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied unto you. And be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, we pray you, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us liberty to uſe a little freedom with you, being conſtrained in duty to lay ſome things before you, concerning your late Differences, which are like to run to ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable height, and to have ſuch ſad effects, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65758:4"/>
may make you the aſtoniſhing wonder as well of your ſelves, as of others. An Addreſs, which we confeſs may ſeem ſtrange, upon divers conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, eſpecially that ſuch as we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to interpoſe with ſuch as you, of whom it becomes us to learn, rather than to warn and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh.</p>
            <p>But our Apology is, <hi>Neceſſity has no Law.</hi> Were your Malady like to heal of it ſelf, (as we once expected time ſhould have cooled your Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, worn out ſuch diſtempers, and not augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them), or were it tolerable, and not like to be a ſickneſs unto death; or, were others (of whom there are many fitter than we) underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Task, to apply Balm to your bleeding wounds: We ſhould have been glad to have ſtood by, and let better hands deal with you, and we to be joyful ſpectators of your Cure, as we have been, and are ſad witneſſes of your Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>We know alſo how dangerous and thankleſs an office it is (uſually) to meddle with Diviſions; how ready ſuch are (like parters of a Fray) to get the redding-ſtroke, and be divided themſelves, and torn in pieces by thoſe who are moſt out of humour, whether moſt in the right or not, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.27. Who can meddle with ſuch a flame as is kindled amongſt you, and not burn his face or fingers, even when he caſteth water to quench it? To get behind the hedg, and lye under the wind, were more eaſie and ſecure for us, than to ſtand up in the gap, and offer to pacifie the quarrel; the contentions of Brethren being (like
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65758:4"/>
that of the <hi>Ephramites,</hi> Judg. 12.1.) ſharper and harder to be compoſed than the jars and embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an offended City, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.19.</p>
            <p>Moreover, true is <hi>Solomons</hi> word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.17. <hi>He that medleth with ſtrife belonging not unto him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.</hi> But, dear Friends, our intereſt in you, and near relation to you, makes that we cannot but think our ſelves concerned: Is not every man called to bring water, and put to his hand to help, when his Neighbours houſe is on fire? Hear us therefore in a few words of ſoberneſs and truth, and let no prejudice or byaſs preoccupy your ear.</p>
            <p>Ah! the noiſe of your condition, courſes, and temper, hath come abroad, and filled all ſober and tender hearts with amazement! Serious and ſolid ſpectators wonder what all this ſtir and buſsle among you meaneth; and it putteth them ſadly to enquire thereinto, ſince their concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in you as fellow-members of the ſame my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body calleth them to ſympathize and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their help, and not look unconcernedly upon your matters. It is not long ſince we bled for your ſufferings and oppreſſions under the gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yoke, which reared up it ſelf upon the ruins of ſo much of the Lords precious inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and the caſting out and cruſhing of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy Miniſters of Chriſt, and haraſſing ſo many godly people for their non-compliance with that courſe of defection. Yet herein we thought you happy, that you found mercy to be faithful, and to keep your integrity, bearing the Croſs with patience, and adhering to the way
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65758:5"/>
of truth, with zeal and conſtancy; until the Lord ſhould ariſe and plead for himſelf, his Altars and People; expecting he would make your patient ſuffering in due time mollifie the hearts of your Rulers towards you, and be crowned with an happy outgate.</p>
            <p>But alas! no ſooner find we the Moſt High ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending mercy to you, in granting you ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the eyes of Authority, inclining them to relent of the former rigors, and begin to take off reſtraints under which ye groaned, and lay by almoſt uſeleſs; and to revive the ſtones out of the rubbiſh, by granting a liberty to ſome of your outed Miniſters to return to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to build the Sanctuary; but alas! ſoon (almoſt) we find you ſplitting among your ſelves! Behold what heats, ruptures and animoſities have broken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, like to conſume the bleſſed remnant into aſhes! giving your Zion cauſe to complain, <hi>Behold the wounds that I have received, even in the houſe of my friends!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When your firſt Indulgence was granted, how much was we refreſhed to ſee a <hi>little reviving,</hi> and none of you caſting at a day of ſmall things, but rejoicing that any nail was got in the holy place; and none that were in Providence kept ſtill in the Captivity, envying them who in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were permitted to return; nor thoſe that were returned, forgetting their Brethren who were detained in <hi>Babylon</hi> behind them, but thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying, and endeavouring for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But ſince a ſecond Indulgence unhappily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65758:5"/>
with ſeveral Grievances, what dividings and jarrings have ariſen! ſome being free to make uſe of that liberty, accounting it a mercy that the Legal reſtraints which debarred them from the publick, free, peaceable exerciſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, were taken off; and that it was their duty to take hold of the indulged liberty, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to give Teſtimony <hi>in their ſtation</hi> againſt what their acceptance of the ſame might be lyable to be miſtaken in, or be reputed to Homologate of faults in the Magiſtrate; as alſo, not to obſerve any unlawful Injunctions impoſed, or to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them; judging that thus they wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated the precious from the vile, and were obliged to hold faſt that which was good, as well as to refuſe the evil. Others of you were unclear to make uſe of the foreſaid liberty, ſome upon one account, ſome upon another; of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>And had your different apprehenſions of that matter been managed with ſobriety and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no ſoul-waſting and Church-ruining conteſts been raiſed thereabout; but God waited upon, and mutual forbearance exerciſed, till your different meaſures of light had come to ſome happy accommodation; Bleſſed had ye been, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1, 2. And ſome, we grant, yea a good many, have obtained mercy to do ſo.</p>
            <p>But others, alas! have carried otherwiſe, not contenting themſelves to enjoy and follow their own light, have alſo laid, and ſtill lay ſore at thoſe who differ from them. What woful heart-burnings, rentings, alienations, fierce and fiery
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65758:6"/>
clamours, and pitiful confuſions, are fallen in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you! as if a judicial ſpirit of Diviſion were poured out upon you, (ah! the anger of the Lord hath divided them! and will he no more regard them?) Which who can look upon, and not be pained at the very heart with ſorrow! Who can hold their peace at ſuch a doleful thing! Whoſe tongue would not looſe, as <hi>Croeſus</hi> his Son's did, in a like caſe, and cry, <hi>Spare!</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding therefore ſuch exorbitant heats and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant courſes to be in ſome of you againſt others, meerly for their following their light in uſe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that Licenſe to exerciſe the Miniſtry which they have and hold of the Lord; Albeit we may not preſume to be <hi>Palaemon</hi> or Umpire betwixt you, yet (judging the part of a Monitor not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent unto us) we cannot but interpoſe, and with the tear in our eye, cry, <hi>What mean ye to fall at ſuch odds!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Brethren! Can there be no <hi>difference</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you without <hi>diviſion?</hi> no <hi>diverſity</hi> of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of things without running into <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>conteſts</hi> about them? Is difference of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in every leſſer thing, inconſiſtent with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace, concord and communion in things wherein ye are aggrieved? And may ye not be of one heart, till ye be of one way in things wherein ye differ? Muſt ye caſt out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, when ye cannot all be of the ſame mind, in ſuch <hi>inferiour</hi> things, albeit ye agree in the <hi>Main?</hi> Are ye not united in Doctrine, Worſhip, <hi>Principles</hi> of Diſcipline and Government? and will ye rent at ſuch a rate about the <hi>Application</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65758:6"/>
of one principle to a particular caſe? Will ye fall out among your ſelves, while ye are jointly ingaged in one common cauſe againſt a common adverſary, who watcheth for your halting, and ſaith of your jarrings, <hi>Aha! ſo would we have it!</hi> Have ye forgotten the former Perſecution, that ye are ſo ſoon fallen by the ears among your ſelves? Are ye not under their eye, who rejoice at the ſport, clap hands and cry, <hi>Hui</hi> to the fray? Could ye gratifie them, and diſadvantage your ſelves more than by ſuch reelings? Is not this that which their very ſouls longed for?<note place="margin">Hoc Itha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus velit, &amp; magno mercentur Atridae.</note> and now you grant them their deſire, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.15, 16. You are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a wedg of your own timber, whom all the enemies fury could not undo! Are ye not become the ſcorn of the Adverſary, the ſhame and ſorrow of your friends? <hi>Ah! tell it not in Gath,</hi> &amp;c. How much alſo of the indignation of the Lord doth Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing import? What fatal judgments doth it portend? <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.13, 14. And what a ſcandal is it to ſee the Sons of Peace, as it were, <hi>intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> with the waters of <hi>Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah?</hi> Will not this be <hi>Marah,</hi> bitterneſs in the end? Is it not your great plague to be thus disjointed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.19—21? Were it not your rich bleſſing to be compoſed, and unite, for the better follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of common duties, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.13, 14? And will not your foes carefully improve ſuch advantages againſt you? And being broken among your ſelves, are ye not become weak and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and expoſe your ſelves a prey to all the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65758:7"/>
beaſts of the field that pleaſe to devour? And utterly incapacitate your ſelves for Duty or Outgeate? What will probably become of ſuch a diſtracted divided company; crumbled into ſo many Atoms and Fractions? Yea, Subdiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and new debates ſtarting daily, fra once Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion beginneth, being like the letting forth of water, breaches multiplying and waxing wider and wider, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. What will this ſickneſs terminate into? We need no <hi>Galen</hi> nor <hi>Hypocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> to foretel its event. A wiſer than they, telleth us, <hi>A Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi> May ye not remember your laſt rupture, how the wild Boar of Devaſtation came in at that gap over all your bellies, which might have been prevented, had not your renting open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a door for it, and incapacitated you to oppoſe it? and what may come in at this, is not hard to foreſee! Is not Popery, that devouring Leviathan, at your gates, ready to be uſhered in by it? Was not <hi>Hannibal ad Portas,</hi> a ſtrange alarm to the <hi>Romans</hi> to lay by their private jars, and unite againſt their common danger? And will no ſuch hazard induce you to let alone your inteſtine embroilments? Will neither by-paſt experience (the School-maſter of very fools) nor preſent fears and peril warn you? Will ye ſtill daſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Rock on which the Church of Chriſt hath ſo oft ſplit, and God hath ſet up ſo many Beacons of his Diſpleaſure? Shall Schiſm be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the bane and blemiſh of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> party; and your comely parity be any more like the mother of confuſion, and ſo the way of God
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65758:7"/>
be evil ſpoken of through you? Or, Is this the way for the Goſpel's proſpering? Can they be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Architects, who build the Lords houſe by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, or pulling it in pieces? Or, Theſe good Chirurgeons who know no other method or means to heal, but by Diſlocation, Amputation, or other the like dogged Cures? Is this the mean to make Chriſts Kingdom and Crown flouriſh, by ſetting his faithful Friends and Subjects at variance? Did ever Religion indeed thrive by ſuch dividings and ſtrivings of Miniſters or People? Is not Diviſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſtempering, and the very Moth and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-worm of the life of Piety? Look, whatever Religion ſeemeth to gain in a parcel, doth it not loſe much more in the Bulk, in a factious time? And how much <hi>Profeſſion</hi> enlargeth her Phylacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Practice,</hi> Power, Life, and Tenderneſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth as much in reality: See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>James</hi> 3.16. Verily the miſchief of dividing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable.</p>
            <p>Again, Are ye not Brethren? and the <hi>Canaanite</hi> and the <hi>Perizite</hi> in the Land? And will ye yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the very face of the Enemy, and Jaws of devouring-like danger? <hi>Will ye not ceaſe your Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, till the Popiſh Sword end the quarrel?</hi> Will ye be like thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Siege, waſting and weakning your ſelves by furious inteſtine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, while the Roman Enemy lyeth about your Walls, ready to ſwallow you up both? Or like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Mariners falling by the ears together, while the ſwelling Sea and raging Storm is like to ſink the Ship and you both? (Oh how fatal-like and demented!) Moreover, Is not Schiſm a breach of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65758:8"/>
your Covenant, as well as Prelacy? abjured with that ſame breath wherewith ye renounce it and Popery? And will ye cry out of others for breach of Covenant, and yet violate the ſame ſo groſly your ſelves? Be aſtoniſhed, O Heaven! and tremble thou Earth! to ſee men ſo careful to run from one evil, and ſo little tender to hold off another? What, are there no healing Medicines, nor healing men among you? None to ſtand in the Gap? Can there be no accommodating your differences? Is your Breach wide as the Sea? your wound incurable? Does any of you think it their glory to blow the Bellows, and to be ambitious who ſhall act higheſt in oppoſition one to another? Then ſhall our Soul weep in ſecret for your miſery, and ſoon may your Fate be read, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Their Heart is divided, now ſhall they be found faulty:</hi> Rent, and Ruin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.9. Dividers are certainly Subverters; and will ye burn down the Sanctuary into Aſhes, while ye pretend to defend and uphold it? Ah, how is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Bottle filled, not with Wine and ſtrong drink, but a reeling Spirit mingled in, to make them ſtagger and fall? Are they not like a wild Bull in a Net, full of the fury of the Lord, and of the rebuke of their God? How may here our Pen ſtop, and our eye trickle down with Tears!— Ah Tragedy beyond Lamentation! — What ſhall we do for our little Siſter with her can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cered Breaſts?</p>
            <p>Yet the Moſt High is to be bleſſed, that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, godly, grave, and experienced of you, are not for fomenting, but for ſopiting and quaſhing the differences. But oh! the heat and inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65758:8"/>
of the unſolid, unſtudied, younger ſort, and a few eager of the Elder! What unbridled intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancy of Tongue and Actions ſtand they guilty of, before the Lord! And may not every ſober Perſon ſay, what <hi>Jacob</hi> left for <hi>Levi</hi>'s Legacy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.7. <hi>Wo is us for their Anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel! O our Soul, come not thou into their ſecret, and unto their Aſſembly our Honour be not thou united!</hi> What will ſuch diſtractions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into at laſt, if the Healer of the Nations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it not? See <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15. <hi>If ye bite and devour one another, take heed ye be not conſumed one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Will ye be like the fooliſh Knights of <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> who never ceaſed Fighting among themſelves, while there were any to maintain the quarrel?</p>
            <p>We mean not by this to diſparage any's zeal and good affection, but the prepoſterous, irregular, immoderate proſecutions of that zeal, which ſome ſeem to be tranſported in, we cannot approve, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.17, 18. We doubt if ſuch of you as are moſt buſie and greateſt ſticklers in ſuch an unhappy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, will find neither thanks or reward from the Prince of Peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.14, 15. But happy they who being perſecuted, ſuffer it; being defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, intreat; and ſtudy by patience, meekneſs, and long-ſuffering, to conquer their Brethren, and to bring them to a better underſtanding together, rather than to meet humour with humour, heat with heat, railing with railing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such are likeſt their ever bleſſed Lord, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, theſe quiet indulged men are not ſuch Dunces, but they could well repay their Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts; but (whatever diſadvantage they lye at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65758:9"/>
yet in this they ſeem to have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that while others are for War, they are for Peace, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.6, 7.) They ſeek peace and purſue it, they follow theſe their angry Brethren with love, while they run from them; they pray for them, ſome of whom to their power perſecute them, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 18.20.) and inſtead of holding up Debates, they love rather to let them fall for peace-ſake, and to give their Backs to the Smiters, and their Cheeks to them that pluck off the Hair, and hide not their Face from ſhame and ſpitting; counting nothing dear to them, ſo they may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their courſe with fruitfulneſs, and fulfil the Miniſtry they have received of the Lord.</p>
            <p>But, dear Friends, could ye give us leave (and not take it ill) to uſe a little freedom with you, we would humbly adventure to proffer a word of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to you all, which perhaps may be not unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable at ſuch a juncture.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, <hi>Study Reconciliation with God.</hi> We fear your breach among your ſelves has begun here at diſtance with God; you eſpecially hath he known beyond others, and therefore will not let you go unpuniſhed. What higher provocations are there, than thoſe of Sons and Daughters? And what ſorer ſcourge can there be, than to be left of him to bite and devour one another? By this means ye do the Biſhops work, and the Papiſts work, to their hands: Now ye ſee nothing will unite you, till ye unite in God; a common cauſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt will not unite you, a Furnace will not unite you, no Bonds will cement you, until ye be One in him who is the Corner-Stone, in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65758:9"/>
whom both ſides of the Building meet.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Get more of the power of Grace into your hearts, and walk in his fear.</hi> Did Grace, not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour predominate, and the fear of God awe you, durſt ſome take the latitude they do? Get heart-diſtempers (the cauſe of heart-deluſions) purged away. Mortifie pride and ſelf-conceit (the uſual fault of men of parts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. and the ſnare of Novices, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. yet the uſual Makebait of contention, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10.) As alſo paſſion, peeviſhneſs, male-contentedneſs, ſelf-ſeeking, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which are not ſeldom inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſufferers), and all other dividing-co<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, lay them aſide; and get Love, humility, ſobriety, meekneſs, moderation, ſelf-denial, and ſuch like uniting Graces to poſſeſs your hearts and minds. It is our Lords advice, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.50. <hi>Have ſalt in your ſelves, and peace one with another.</hi> What is it but the corruptions, not the Graces of good men, which maketh them jar? ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3, 4. Let therefore your furnace refine you, and purge away your droſs; be not the boiling pot, retaining the ſcum; homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things unite eaſily and well.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Study the practice of that excellent duty of mutual forbearance:</hi> Read <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13. and ſeriouſly ponder what there is inculcated by the wiſdom of God. Do not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor rigidly ſtrain or wreſt one anothers words or deeds, commenting and putting gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon them, or wringing conſequences from them (as prejudice uſeth to do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5, 6.) which they never dreamed of, nor is there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

Backbite not one another, talk not of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers failings, real or ſuppoſed, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.11.) but pity and pray over them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. Chuſe rather to weep in ſecret for the ſame, than to tell them for news. Ye know <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, his famous word and deed at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> when delations and complaints were preferred to him by the Miniſters one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I had rather,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>hide a Miniſters fault with my Robe, than eliminate them</hi>; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he burn'd their Libels and Accuſations, for the Goſpels ſake. O let love cover (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8.) and not carnal zeal divulge, much leſs coin faults and miſreports one of another. What would ye give the Adverſaries leave to do but to make you odious with ſlanders, that your Cauſe may ſtink, and your name rot above the ground? And ſhall any of you (as ſome do) take that trade off their hand, blaſting (ſo far as they can) every bodies Reputation not of their way? Is this the Spirit of the Lord? Are theſe his Doings? See <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.19, 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21, 22, 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 54.55. Is this acceptable ſervice to the Prince of Paſtors? ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.8, 9, 10. <hi>Wherefore were ye not afraid to ſpeak againſt my ſervant Moſes, ſays the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Weigh alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.3, 4. Is <hi>Shimei</hi>'s vice now become a a virtue? would it not become you better, in Chriſtian tenderneſs faithfully to admoniſh one another, than by word or writing in publick or private to traduce and load one another with Legends of falſe ſtories, and groundleſs miſtakes?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65758:10"/>
and yet what greater engine is uſed by ſome to breed and feed your Differences, than this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.28. But will not wo be to them who widen breaches by evil whiſpers, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſurmiſes? <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.14. Much more ſin they, who dare preach ſuch things for the Oracles of God.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Fall into ſerious diſlike of Diviſions,</hi> as moſt of all your grave and ſolid, tender and ſerious Miniſters and Chriſtians abhor them. Know the ſin and evil of them, what bitter fruits and ſad conſequences they are of.

But if over-Sea Divines writings ſeem ſtrangers to you, read ſome of thoſe at home, ſpecially Judicious and Holy Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> your Country-man, in the laſt part of his excellent Treatiſe of <hi>Scandal</hi>; and God<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> your Neighbour, in his Treatiſe of <hi>Heart-Diviſions.</hi> Read, conſider, and lay to heart what theſe <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> of their age, have by their Golden mouths and Silver pens deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt dividings; and ſee if ye will dare to make light of rentings any more.—Godly men may for a time through infirmity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be led upon that ſnare, (O ſad ſnare!) as <hi>Act.</hi> 15.39. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.49, 50. yet it is not the better for that: It is their infirmity, not their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even to be in the leaſt overtaken with it;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65758:11"/>
but of what untender (not to ſay deboſhed) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences muſt they be, who (like <hi>Salamanders</hi>) take pleaſure in the fire, and love to kindle or inflame the combuſtion? <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16, 19. Is it not ſad when ſome who ſeem ſtrict and tender in other things, yet are nothing tender of renting the ſeamleſs Coat of Chriſt, and take a ſtrange liberty to accuſe and calumniate their Brethren? Did ye ponder the woful evil and miſchief of ſuch practices, we think ye would abhor them little leſs than the ſacrificing to the <hi>Dagon</hi> of <hi>Rome!</hi> And yet alas, how prone are ſome to pride themſelves in ſuch untowardly ways, as if it were a piece of Religion, yea the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> and <hi>Culmen</hi> of Honeſty! thus glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſhame!—We know, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> may know the certainty of theſe ſad things; We are not ſuch ſtrangers to your <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but we have ſeen of your bitter Papers, and otherwiſe had good information of ſome's ſtrange <hi>Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> wherein we have wondered to ſee them ſo tranſported with prejudice and paſſion (as <hi>Saul</hi> was in his zeal againſt the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>) unto ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and practices which might have made any ſober and tender heart break in pieces.</p>
            <p>If any <hi>ſay,</hi> May and ought we not to teſtifie againſt the corruption which we ſuppoſe to be in the Indulgence? And if others ſay, may not we defend that which we ſuppoſe to be a lawful liberty, againſt all attackers of it? We <hi>confeſs,</hi> we hear not much Din of any defences, as if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged truſted ſo much to the merits of their cauſe, that they think its own Innocency might

bear it out, and therefore reſolved by patience and prayer to wait on God, until he bring forth their Righteouſneſs as the light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all the noiſe we hear, is of impugning them, Axes and Hammers breaking down that reſtored piece of the carved work, as many take it to be.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in order to your bearing Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, might we adventure without your offence to adviſe you, we would humbly offer theſe three things to be conſidered: (1) <hi>Be ſure it be a ſin before ye appear againſt it</hi>; leſt ye condemn Truth and Duty inſtead of error and ſin. And in this, remember ye muſt not too much indulge your own notions, nor every light ſcruple, which though they may <hi>ſuſpend</hi> you from <hi>approving,</hi> yet may prove too weak a ground for <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3, 23. and how groundleſly did thoſe contend with <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 11.1? What if you be in a miſtake as thoſe were? Conſult therefore the Oracles of God; hear what your Brethren has to ſay for themſelves; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn nothing peremptorily but what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evidently condemneth; and in intricate and debateable points (which are controverted even amongſt the learned, godly, and orthodox) be not raſh and poſitive in condemning all that are not of your mind. Let the Church define and determine the Controverſie before ye conclude any thing peremptorily about it, as to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others; and that part of the queſtion which they own, what ye are unclear in, and boggle at, forbear to practice it your ſelves; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn not others who are not of the ſame appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65758:12"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13. what if your unclearneſs be your infirmity? ſhall your infirmity warrant you to cenſure others perfection?</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Being once ſure the thing is a fault, <hi>Be ſure alſo your Brethren be guilty thereof,</hi> before ye condemn them for it. What if they be innocent of that you charge upon them? Think not jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, whiſpers, or uncharitable conſtructions, and raſh and rigid Imputations, or far-fetched, and not certain conſequences, ſufficient to fix guilt upon them. How did <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake him, and raſhly condemn him as wicked, and but an hypocrite, and many a threatning (true in the general) did they miſapply to him in particular? and ſo their diſpute and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were like Arrows ſhot at rovers, miſſing the mark, by miſtaking him for the man he was not. Thus innocency often ſuffers ſadly upon miſtake. Whence the Reformed Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it as a great injuſtice done them by their Adverſaries, That ſuch and ſuch odious <hi>Dogmata</hi> of Doctrines, which their ſoul abhors, ſhould be imputed unto them, and faſtened upon them as theirs, which are denied by them, yet gathered (by their Adverſaries) by ſome ſort of probable-like conſequences, from Principles which they hold: Even as ye do charge your Brethren with Eraſtianiſm, and Communion with the Kings tranſcendent Supremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while yet they diſclaim theſe as much as ye do, only by ſome remote and violent conſequences ye would infer it from their practice of accepting the indulged liberty. <hi>Nihil injuſtius</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mareſius</hi>

But think not that every fault, real or ſuppoſed in them, will be found before God or man a relevant ground to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant contention, ſeparation and diviſion from them. If ye over-do, ye may undo; and your right ſide (as ye take it to be) become the wrong ſide by miſmanagement. Do ye think there can be no ſinful exceſs of heat, violence and diſorder, in proſecuting a good cauſe? ſo no leſs than <hi>Jehu</hi>'s furious march ſufficient to exonerate you? Is there no golden mediocrity betwixt fiery zeal and <hi>Laodicean</hi> luke-warmneſs? Did not worthy <hi>Luther</hi> once ſpoil his cauſe much by over-acting, and exceſs of fervour? Let right things be done in a right manner.

Confine your ſelves therefore within the juſt bounds of holy zeal, and think it no lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be ſober; and many of your extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies will hereby be cut off.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Conſider in ſober ſadneſs, what cauſe is there for all your outcry?</hi> What has theſe indulged men done, that ye rate them, and perſecute them more largely and briskly than ye do any of the other? What is the quarrel? your edgineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them would make the world believe they were monſters of men, and have committed ſome horrible iniquity in going to feed the flocks of God, to which people called them, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate granted them his Legal leave. Why, what crime is this? Ye debacchat againſt them, and yet when we ſearch into the matter, we can find no ſuch ground of ſtumbling at them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Qualifications not the meaneſt of your party; in their lives holy and blameleſs, in their Miniſtry faithful and painful lovers of truth and peace, piety and purity.</p>
            <p>And for their ſimple taking occaſion of the Magiſtrates grant of Civil Liberty to return to their charges, or to officiate and ſupply in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vacant place, being called thereunto by the people, until God ſhould open a door of regreſs to their former charges, we wonder what fault this ſhould be thought!</p>
            <p>Whether is it better to Preach with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates good leave, or without it? Seeing both thoſe ways of Preaching differ only in circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which of the two are moſt deſirable, judg ye. When God makes him do the work of a Nurſe-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65758:14"/>
ſo far, as to permit and allow them the free exerciſe of the Miniſtry, which they have of Chriſt Jeſus their Lord and Maſter; does the Prince his civil Licenſe vitiate their Miniſtry, or make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanly, even to that height (as ſome in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſms drive it) that they may not be heard nor owned, but rejected and ſeparated from, as the height of Abominations? Is the exerciſe of their Function the worſe, that the liberty thereof is not taken at their own hand? We hope none of you do nor will allow your ſelves to think ſo; therefore ye will do well to take heed, that your juſt offence at the Magiſtrates faults in other things, do not diminiſh your reſpect to the Ordinance of God, (<hi>viz.</hi> that juſt Right and Authority he is clothed with) and unjuſtly prejudge you at the lawful Acts and Favours thereof; and while ye diſlike the abuſe of his power, ſtumble not at the right uſe thereof. Shall any think nothing pleaſeth now, but what is croſs the grain of Authority? We doubt not but Miniſters have a Right to Preach, and in ſome caſes may and muſt make uſe of that Right, even when the Magiſtrate denies his permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet is it not much more deſirable to have his leave than to want it? Specially when the peaceable Preaching of the Goſpel is not feaſible without it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Legal Reſtraints backed with force, as was their caſe. Does not the Lord himſelf direct <hi>Moſes (Exod.</hi> 3.18. with 5.1, 3.) to deſire leave e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> to go and Sacrifice to their God in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Let my People go, that, &amp;c.</hi> Not that their Liberty did depend abſolutely and <hi>Quo ad jus ad rem,</hi> or in point of Right, upon

               <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s good will; but ſuch reſpect would the Lord put upon the Magiſtrates leave, though a Tyrant and Oppreſſor: And to teach all men how deſirable it is, to have the permiſſion and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Authority to the free exerciſe of Religion, if it can be obtained; therefore would the Lord have this liberty intreated for. And did not <hi>Moſes</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> accept this Liberty when it was granted? <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.31. Or did any blame him for ſeeking and accepting it? It is true this Liberty was full as to Perſons and Things, <hi>Moſes</hi> being ſpecially appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God <hi>not to leave one hoof behind, nor a little one,</hi> nor to ſacrifice <hi>in the Land, Exod.</hi> 8.25, 26, 27. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.8, 9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.24, 25, 26. yet that does not ſay, but others may accept of a more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Liberty, till they get more; not having ſuch peremptory Injunctions and Reaſons for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, as hereafter ſhall be made to appear, nor being in <hi>poſſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

However, this Inſtance proveth that the Magiſtrates civil permiſſion is no blemiſh, but a deſirable mercy to the publick, ſolemn, free Exerciſe of Religion, Miniſtry and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the more full the Liberty be, the better it is; whence alſo it followeth, that a ſnatch, a parcel of that Liberty cannot be in it ſelf ſinful, being all of one <hi>kind,</hi> though differing in <hi>Meaſure and Degree.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65758:15"/>Moreover, See how <hi>Paul</hi> did obteſt the very Heathen Governour for this Favour, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.39. <hi>I beſeech thee</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſuffer me to ſpeak to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> And when he gave him <hi>Licenſe,</hi> he made uſe of it and Preached.

Preach for ſome years at <hi>Rome,</hi> upon a <hi>Negative</hi> Permiſſion, <hi>no man forbidding him, viz.</hi> neither Emperour nor Senate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is there marked? And <hi>Acts</hi> 26.1. upon a <hi>Poſitive</hi> Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he not only Apologized, but Preached to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa.</hi> Now, ſurely, if to Preach Occaſionally upon ſuch a Warrant, be not ill, neither can it be to Preach in a more ſtated way (as your Brethren do) upon a ſtated permiſſion.</p>
            <p>And who can deny, but that <hi>Cyrus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> their Grants of Liberty (recorded by <hi>Eſdras)</hi> to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and build the Houſe of the Lord, and offer Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there, was a mercy, and more valuable than for the Children of the Captivity to have gone up and done this at their own hand? And is this your like piece of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, though of a leſſer ſize, not at all to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced? What would the Proteſtants in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> eſteem of the like favour?</p>
            <p>Further, Did not your ſelves generally allow of the firſt Indulgence? counted it an hopeful begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of good to your poor afflicted Church? (as can be atteſted.) How come ye then now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert it? And would ye not yet (as is informed) accept of a general Indulgence? much more of a complete Reſtauration of the Church to her former
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65758:15"/>
Integrity? And is it ſuch a ſin to take part of that Liberty, till God put it into the heart of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to grant more? Doth <hi>magis &amp; minus vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are ſpeciem?</hi> Will ye either have all or nothing, and deſpiſe a day of ſmall things?

            <p>But to come nearer the purpoſe: What is it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth you at your Brethrens deed?</p>

            <p>Now this power of his is extended by Divines to no leſs, if not to more, than your Indulgence (in ſo far as it is accepted by the Brethren) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts unto. And that, conform to the word of God in the commended practices of ſeveral Kings mentioned in Scripture, who warrantably

took upon them by vertue of their calling to do as much and more, without the leaſt imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of invading the Prieſtly or Spiritual power; <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, and <hi>Judahs</hi> Scepters, remaining ſtill diſtinct notwithſtanding. Particularly, did not <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3. <hi>Open the doors of the houſe of the Lord,</hi> which had been ſhut for a long time, as <hi>v.</hi> 7. and <hi>v.</hi> 4. it is ſaid, <hi>He brought in the Prieſts and Levites.</hi>—And <hi>v.</hi> 5. he <hi>puts</hi> them to their work, <hi>to ſanctifie and cleanſe the houſe.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>To offer ſacrifices is commanded</hi> by him.—And <hi>v.</hi> 25. he <hi>ſet</hi> (or reſtored to their place) <hi>the Levites in the houſe of the Lord with Cymbals, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>Commanded them to ſing praiſe,</hi> &amp;c.

The like is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.2. that <hi>Joſias</hi> ſet the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in their <hi>Charges.</hi> From theſe Citations Note three things:</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That as it is proper to the Spiritual Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Houſe of God <hi>Operari in Sacris,</hi> or <hi>elicitively</hi> to act in the exerciſes of Religion; ſo it is not incompetent to the Civil Ruler to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> and put forth his authority about the ſame <hi>imperatively,</hi> but <hi>jure</hi> he <hi>may,</hi> yea <hi>ex Officio</hi> he <hi>ought</hi> to do ſo; even to put the Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to their duty and work, when need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; and that not only by removing Reſtraints and Impediments, nor by naked permiſſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but even by way of Authoritative order and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65758:17"/>
command. As there, the Prince appointeth, and the Prieſt acteth.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) That this is eſpecially competent, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent to him, <hi>In ſtatu Eccleſiae Turbato, vel corrupto,</hi> in a perturbed or corrupted ſtate of the Church, ſuch as then was, and as yours was and is.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) That it is no crime for the Miniſters of the Lord to obey the Magiſtrate in ſuch a caſe. As the Magiſtrate acteth no Eraſtianiſm, nor Papal Supremacy in this kind of doing; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does the Miniſter homologate or involve himſelf in any ſuch crime, nor is to be loaded with ſuch Imputations in and for going along (in his place) with ſuch appointments of the Magiſtrate. However <hi>Uzziah</hi> was faulty in the one ſort (as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16, 18.) and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in the other ſort of ſoleciſms in the exerciſe of Magiſtratical power about Religion, (as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.28, 29, 31, 32, 33.) <hi>Uzziah</hi> invading the Prieſts Office, like an Eraſtian indeed, and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> uſurping that unlawful Supremacy like Lord and Head of the Church; yet good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did neither of them: Nor does any other Prince, who contains himſelf within his line, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did. And the Licenſing of your Miniſters to return to their publick ſtations, is no other, (as afterward ſhall be cleared) but moſt like unto <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in ſeveral points above rehearſed. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no fault in your Miniſters acceptance thereof in ſo far as it is accepted by them.</p>
            <p>Add to this <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> approved practice in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.7, &amp; where we find he <hi>ſent</hi> the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>

to <hi>teach</hi> the Lords word in divers <hi>places</hi> of the land; who <hi>went</hi> accordingly. Whence it is evident,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That it is not repugnant to the Word of God, that in ſome caſes, ſpecially in a lapſed caſe of the Church, the Magiſtrate may diſpoſe upon Miniſters, as to place and parts of a Land, where they may exerciſe their Miniſtry, at leaſt for a time; may ſend them here and there, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches need calling for it: And that this is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Eccleſiaſtical planting or tranſplanting of Miniſters (as ſome invidiouſly term it), but only a Civil Authorization as to exerciſing their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in ſuch a place for longer or ſhorter time, as need may be.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) It is evident alſo here, that in ſuch a caſe, the Paſtors <hi>Miniſterial Miſſion</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to Teach and Preach, is not from the Magiſtrate, but from the Lord; nor do they innovate or renounce their Commiſſion from the Lord, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Magiſtrates ſuperadded miſſion or command and legal warrant; nor do they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ceaſe to be Chriſts Miniſters or Ambaſſadors in his name, or become Council-Curates, (as ſome opprobriouſly and injuriouſly alledg) becauſe the King by his Council adds his civil Sanction to the Authority they have of Chriſt. Who can ſay, their <hi>Levites</hi> were <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> Curates, and not the Lords Miniſters, for undergoing the like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of his power? Does the Magiſtrates ſupervenient Authority diminiſh or enervate the antecedent intrinſick power and ſpiritual autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their office, or alter its nature? Is Chriſts
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65758:18"/>
Commiſſion to his Ambaſſadors, and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates adding his Civil Warrant (kiſſing and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Son of God therein, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11, 12.) deſtructive and ſubverſive, and not rather corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borative one of another; and may ſweetly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together, as being, though <hi>Diverſa,</hi> yet not <hi>Adverſa</hi>; and contrary one to another? <hi>Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata, &amp; ſubſervientia, non pugnant.</hi> Add to all this, that ſeveral of your General Aſſemblies, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court of Chriſt in your Church, when they were (as oft they were) Indicted and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate by the Kings Authority, and upon his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Proclamation did ſit; were they (pray you) therefore but Eraſtian Courts and Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, deriving all their Authority from the King, and acting in his Name, like other Civil Judicatories of the Kingdom, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Seſſion or Parliament? were they in this caſe not at all Chriſts Court, nor acting in his name as his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and not the Kings? was this in them a renouncing of Chriſts Headſhip, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of another Lord and Maſter, and a taking of Commiſſion from the Civil Magiſtrate? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We hope none will be ſo abſurd as to affirm it, or to think that the Magiſtrates Auxiliary deed, and their making uſe of it, was derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry either to Chriſts Kingly Office, or to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies intrinſick power, or altered their nature from being purely ſpiritual Courts of Chriſt. Even ſo, what more does the Prince, his <hi>permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> or <hi>appointing</hi> actual Miniſters to exerciſe their Office here or there, in this broken ſtate of the Church, conſtitute them his Curates or Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates?

or ſtate them guilty of Homologating an Eraſtian power, and eſtabliſhing a ſpiritual ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in the Magiſtrate? or infer them to be ſuch as may not ſay to people, <hi>Over you hath the Holy Ghoſt made us overſeers,</hi> but the King? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if the ſuperaddition of the Magiſtrates Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do not innovate nor prejudice the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies Authority in the exerciſe of Government; neither doth it the Miniſters in the Exerciſe of their Function. The Magiſtrate herein but <hi>ſerves</hi> the Lord and his Chriſt, and his Spouſe the Church, and her Miniſtry, but acts not as in Chriſts ſtead as her <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> The Magiſtrate his interpoſing his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this caſe, what place holds it then, ſay ye?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not conſtitutive of their Office (as was in the caſe of theſe Prieſts whom <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did <hi>make</hi> and conſtitute of the loweſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple), but cumulative to it, (<hi>Accumulando jura juribus</hi>) in a ſubſervient and extrinſick way; and corroborative of its Exerciſe, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them in the exerciſe thereof as to ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, namely the place or places of the Land, where they are to exerciſe their work. Now this power aforeſaid being not improper to Kings under the Old Teſtament, why may they not under the New put forth the like, as your own Divines hold, and none but the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> deny? And if they may in ſome caſes <hi>appoint,</hi> much more <hi>permit,</hi> as your Indulgence is, as hereafter ſhall be made to appear.</p>
            <p>To this Scriptural Doctrine agreeth: (1) That
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65758:19"/>
general Aſſertion, <hi>That to the Prince it belongeth as Nurſe-father of the Church, to take care, and do what in him lyes, in ways and by means congruous to his capacity and ſphere, that indigent people be provided with a godly and well-qualified Miniſtry</hi>; as learned Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> (that noble Antagoniſt of the Eraſtian Exorbitancies of the Civil power) hath it in his hundred and eleven Propoſitions, <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 41. And before him, famous Mr. <hi>Welſh,</hi> in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to King <hi>James,</hi> prefixed to his piece againſt Popery, ſpeaking of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned practices of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> ſaith to the King, <hi>Follow theſe Examples, Sir; ſend Paſtors through all the borders of your Kingdom to teach your Subjects the Law of the Lord their God, &amp;c.</hi> We hope ye will not think or ſay that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent man of God (who ſuffered ſo much for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Churches rights, and withſtanding the incroachments of the time) doth here teach the King Eraſtian Principles or practices, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and Spiritual Supremacy; and yet as much doth he teach, as your Indulgence amounts unto, in what of it is accepted by the Brethren.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Ponder how particularly your Church concedeth to the Magiſtrate a power to put Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to particular Charges, when the Church is not in her ordinary or well ſetled caſe: as in the <hi>ſecond Book of Diſcipline,</hi> Chap. 10. §. <hi>laſt,</hi> they ſay, <hi>That Kings and Princes that be godly, may by their Authority, when the Kirk is corrupted, and all things out of order, place Miniſters, and reſtore the true ſervice of the Lord, after the example of ſome godly Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So bleſſed Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65758:20"/>
in the formentioned Epiſtle to King <hi>James,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of the King his being deſirous (as he had profeſſed in two Aſſemblies) <hi>to plant every Pariſh within his Kingdom with a Paſtor.</hi> Which expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>placing</hi> and <hi>planting,</hi> uſed in the foreſaid Citations, albeit they mean not of Ordaining and making of Miniſters conſtitutively, but only a ſetling of Miniſters (already Ordained) in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places; yet ſurely they import no leſs than the word [<hi>Appoint</hi>] in the firſt Indulgence, and more than the Grant of the ſecond, which only <hi>permits</hi> Miniſters to Preach in ſuch and ſuch vacant Congregations. Yea further, in the firſt <hi>Book of Diſcipline,</hi> pag. 37. it is expreſly allowed to the Magiſtrate in ſuch a caſe to <hi>appoint</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to certain <hi>Provinces</hi> and Charges.</p>
            <p>§. If any <hi>except</hi> here that this power is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed only to <hi>Godly</hi> Magiſtrates, ſuch as <hi>Hezekiah, &amp;c.</hi> was.</p>
            <p>To this we ſay three things: (1) Is it not hard to ſeclude any Prince profeſſing the Goſpel, and being a member of the Viſible Church, from the claim at leaſt of Foederal Holineſs, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he have his own perſonal faults? ſee <hi>Job</hi> 34.18.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Ye know it is a Popiſh principle to ſay, <hi>Dominium fundatur in gratia,</hi> that Soveraignty and power is grounded on Grace and Piety. Whence it is when Kings change their Religion, and turn Proteſtant (which they call Hereſie) the Pope declareth them fallen from their Regality, exau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorats and depoſeth them. Your Confeſſion of Faith teacheth otherwiſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. §. 4. <hi>That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65758:20"/>
or difference of Religion does not make void the Magiſtrates juſt and Legal Authority.</hi> Hence Mr. <hi>Calderwood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and others of your Writers teach, that neither doth Piety add, nor Impiety detract any Legal power, but only inable or diſable to the right uſe of his power. In vain therefore uſe ye the diſtinction here betwixt Godly and Ungodly Magiſtrates, as if their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal power were not the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) We find in Scripture, even Pagan Princes warrantably claiming and exerciſing ſuch-like power about matters of Religion, as <hi>Cyrus, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Artaxerxes</hi> and others. From all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations we ſee it plain, that the Regal Power is not augmented by the Princes Religiouſneſs, nor diminiſhed by his Irreligion; but both the Godly and ungodly Magiſtrate have the ſame power about Religion; though it be true, that without piety he will not have the Sanctified, nor readily any diſcreet and good uſe of it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if Religion were a ground of Authority and power about the matters of God, then all Saints and Religious perſons ſhould have that power, and be as Kings and Magiſtrates to act <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> part; for, <hi>a Quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Phraſe uſed in the forecited place of the Book of Diſcipline, ſeeming to limit the power <hi>circa ſacra</hi> to godly Magiſtrates; <hi>We anſwer,</hi> The word <hi>Godly</hi> is added there, not <hi>Reduplicatively,</hi> but <hi>Specificatively,</hi> that is, not as a Diacritical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting deſignation, (or reſtriction of the power to Piety) but as a plain qualification of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who find mercy to uſe that power well, which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65758:21"/>
(of Right) is common, and equally due to Princes in the like caſe.</p>
            <p>If again any ſay, Theſe Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were <hi>Prophets,</hi> and that power about Religion (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) appertained to them as <hi>Prophets</hi> only, and conſequently not to any Kings now adays; nor can their example be for imitation. <hi>We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> This is a great miſtake; how will it ever be proved that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or clothed with any extraordinary power, incompetent to other Kings? What ground in Scripture is there for this? And how can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it without a Scripture-Warrant? Moreover, we ask, were the Heathen Kings, forementioned, Prophets? And yet they intermedled in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner about affairs of Religion.</p>
            <p>If any further ſay, Howbeit ſuch a power to interpoſe ſo far in and about Eccleſiaſtical Matters, to redreſs and ſettle things out of courſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be competent to other Magiſtrates <hi>in a broken State of the Church</hi>; yet who can allow it to him who <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>hath been</hi> the Troubler of the Church himſelf? To this the <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, (1.) What Reaſon can there be to debar ſuch an one from interpoſing to redreſs what himſelf hath overturned, more than his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor? (for ye grant one may juſtly interpoſe thus to Reform what his Predeceſſor marred:) What binds up a King from doing the ſame, as to what himſelf hath diſordered? Who will ſay, but <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> might have done, in the caſe of the Church by himſelf corrupted, whatever <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> or <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, in her caſe, perverted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65758:21"/>Would not Reaſon ſay, the Prince is the more obliged to Interpone his power, and extend it as far as others for her Relief, that himſelf was the Author of her Malady? And to open the door to Miniſters which himſelf did ſhut? And to build what he formerly did deſtroy? Can any Relevant Exception be aſſigned againſt this? If ye <hi>ſay,</hi> This tends to incourage the Magiſtrate to trouble and break the Church, and caſt matters in confuſion, that he may have the more latitude of power to Act in Church-matters. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not at all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with no reaſon can it be ſaid, the allowing him power to do good and heal, does natively and juſtly incourage and warrant him to take power to hurt and do ill. We humbly ſuppoſe it rather implies a Challenge: Certain it is, no man may do evil that good may come of it, nor does the good that reſults upon occaſion of evil, juſtifie Bigones, nor encourage to more in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Conſider (2.) That it is not properly his fault of perturbing the Church, but her Neceſſity and his Office, which alloweth him to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſo far; and therefore, as his fault obligeth him to Repentance, (ſpecially if it was done upon wicked deſign, to get Scouthroom to act extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in reſtoring her again) ſo it cannot juſtly be reckoned to deprive him of power to put things in order again, in as far as may be congruous to any other Princes, who had not injured the Church themſelves. But on the contrary, His doing her wrong, obligeth him the more to make amends: A Chyrurgeon, who cuts his Pupils Arm, to try an experiment of his Art and Balſom upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65758:22"/>
it, has he not as good right to heal it again him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as any other? Yea, Is he not the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to do the Cure? His fooliſh or wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in being the Author of the Sore, does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige him from, but rather oblige him unto, the Cure.</p>
            <p>Now lay what is ſaid together, and ſith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is evident that the Magiſtrate may, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſe, put forth himſelf lawfully (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſurping Eccleſiaſtical Power, properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or encroaching upon the Churches Rights) to allocate Miniſters to certain places; may he not much more Remove the <hi>Legal Bars</hi> (in <hi>whole</hi> or in <hi>part</hi>) which debarred your Miniſters from the free exerciſe of their Office, and permit them acceſs to return to their Charges, or to officiate in ſome other vacancies? which is your very caſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Miniſters did not take his Licenſe, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſtate them in a Paſtoral Relation to theſe Congregations; but beſide, they had the peoples call to determine and engage them to exerciſe their Miniſtry there for the time; ſo all they owe unto, and hold of the Magiſtrate, is, that <hi>Eatenus removet prohibens; t.</hi> 1. He ſo far takes off the Legal Reſtraint, under the force whereof they did lye, and by permiſſion and allowance of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they are freed of danger of the Law, in the publick exerciſe of their Office there; a thing which He was (in duty) obliged to <hi>do,</hi> and they to <hi>take hold of,</hi> and to count it a mercy and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg to have it. But <hi>ſay</hi> ye, Had he Reſcinded, Revoked, and Annulled the Act at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> that outed them, it had been clearer to have been ſo:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65758:22"/>
But when he lets that ſtand, and only gives a new permiſſion or Mandate to Preach, that looks like more. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not only the Act of Council at <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,</hi> by which they were outed of their Charges, but all other Acts and Laws by which they were reſtrained from the exerciſe of their Miniſtry any where within <hi>Scotland,</hi> unleſs they conformed, are certainly ſufficiently taken off the Fyle, as to them. For, the King having the Executive Power of the Law, albeit he did not fully <hi>Repeal</hi> and Reſcind thoſe Acts and Laws, yet by his Indulgence <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth</hi> them, as to the Indulged: And albeit this be not done <hi>in Terminis,</hi> yet Directly, Formally, and Expreſly, yet <hi>Materially</hi> and <hi>Virtually,</hi> in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them to exerciſe their Office in ſuch and ſuch places, any Laws to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For, when the Legiſlative, or Supreme Adminiſtrator, permits or commands a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſtanding Laws, in all Law it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to exempt and priviledge theſe Perſons from the ſaid Laws, and to <hi>indulge</hi> them a Liberty and immunity from theſe Statutes. Now, this is the preſent Indulgence; the Native Effect and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is, to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with the Legal Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe Miniſters were under, but not at all to inveſt them with new ſpiritual power to officiate, as ſome invidiouſly alledge. And by this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, the Indulged to their own Charges are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and in effect reſtored <hi>in integrum,</hi> and put <hi>in ſtatu quo prius,</hi> as to any Liberty the Laws debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them from, in reſpect of their Miniſtry there; and theſe indulged to other parts, are ſo far reſtored, as to be indempnified and licenſed to Preach there,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65758:23"/>
being before interdicted to Preach any where.</p>
            <p>And by virtue of this Indulgence, neither the one nor the other ſort of theſe Miniſters do Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate upon a new <hi>Miniſterial Title</hi> (as is unjuſtly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) the Indulgence conferring or pretending to confer no ſuch thing; only it gives them a new Legal Immunity to exerciſe their old Miniſtry in ſuch and ſuch places. Any that wreſt the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this Indulged Liberty to any other Senſe, ſeems to us, and all unprejudiced men, to put a ſiniſter and malicious gloſs upon it.</p>
            <p>But in the third place, perhaps ye will ſay, it is not the ſimple taking a Licenſe from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, which offends you; but it is the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nature and Tenour of this Indulgence, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch and ſuch ſinful Circumſtances, which ſeems to illegitimate it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> What are theſe?</p>
            <p>O, ſay ye, <hi>Firſt,</hi> In General, Are not theſe Acts of Council, wherein the Indulgence conſiſts and is comprehended, very ugly in ſeveral points, and various reſpects? Is not their Deed then, in accepting ſuch an ill circumſtantiated Liberty, moſt diſallowable?</p>
            <p>For <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this, Let us 1. Conſider, What theſe Acts are? (Next) How far the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters has accepted, or not accepted, the ſame. And (3.) What your Exceptions are, againſt what they have done.</p>
            <p>As for the Acts of Council relating to this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they are namely two. The one Ordereth <hi>the Miniſters therein named, to Repair to ſuch and ſuch Pariſhes as are therein expreſſed, and there to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65758:23"/>
remain confined, permitting them to Preach in the ſaid Pariſhes, and exerciſe their Miniſtry there.</hi> This is properly the Act of Indulgence.</p>
            <p>The other Act, which followed the former, appointeth the Indulged to obſerve ſeveral things, which they call <hi>Rules, viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Not to Baptize any Children, except of the Pariſhes to which they are confined, or of their Neighbour-Pariſhes, if vacant.</hi> 2. <hi>To Celebrate their Communions all in one day.</hi> 3. <hi>That they Preach only in the Kirk, and not in the Kirk-Yard, nor in other places of the Pariſh, under an heavy pain.</hi> 4. <hi>That they depart not forth of their Pariſhes without leave.</hi> 5. <hi>That in their Exerciſe of Diſcipline, the Caſes formally referrable to Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, be by them referred to the Conformiſts Meetings, which now are in place of Presbyteries.</hi> 6. <hi>To pay the Burſars and Clarks their Fees, as formerly wont to be.</hi> This Act is not of <hi>Indulgence,</hi> but rather of <hi>Reſtrictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>ſay</hi> ye, How could the Magiſtrate law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make, or Miniſters accept, ſuch an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, namely, ſo clogged?</p>
            <p>To <hi>Anſwer</hi> this, It is neceſſary (in the <hi>next</hi> place) to conſider what theſe Miniſters have done, and what is the true ſtate of the Controverſie between you and them. To which we ſay in the general, that it is no ſmall injury done to them, to charge them with all and every thing comprehended in theſe Acts, as if they had ſwallowed all down in groſs, without exception of any. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, it is a great miſtake to think, whatever may be juſtly objected againſt ſundry of thoſe things ſo enacted, does militate againſt them and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65758:24"/>
their deed, ſeeing they diſclaim and never owned moſt of theſe things more than thoſe do who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all. And is it not hard from their acceptance of a part, <hi>viz.</hi> the naked permitted liberty, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and caſt upon them an Homologation of the whole contents of theſe acts?</p>
            <p>Here then it would be remembred what the true ſtate of the Queſtion is: Which is not, (1) Whether theſe acts forementioned be in all things approvable and rightly done? But what in all or any of theſe acts might be and is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done? Particularly, Whether or not the Magiſtrate might and did <hi>jure</hi> order theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and repair unto, and grant them a permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Preach and exerciſe the other parts of their Miniſtry in ſuch and ſuch places as are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Act? In a <hi>complex</hi> Act there may be many things largely cenſurable, and very ſinful, upon the Magiſtrates part; yet may there be other things not unwarrantable. And in that caſe the one are not to be condemned out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte at the other. And certainly, whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competency or iniquity may be alledged to be in other points of theſe Acts, it will be hard to find any in the particular forementioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the Indulged liberty.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) It is not ſo much to be Queried, what is <hi>Lawfully,</hi> as what is <hi>Legally</hi> done in this by the Magiſtrate; for a thing (for example, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of a Godly Miniſter for no fault) may be very unlawfully and unjuſtly done, and a real ſin upon the Magiſtrates part, like other acts of Injuſtice; yet may it be legally done, that is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65758:24"/>
to ſay, not Heterogeneous and incompetent to his Office, not beyond the bounds of his power; and therefore cannot therein be counted an <hi>Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> (or Eraſtian), though perhaps not free of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> This conſideration well obſerved, may help to clear a frequent miſtake in many ſimple people who count every act of injuſtice real or ſuppoſed in the Ruler about matters of Religion, an act of Eraſtianiſm or Papal Supremacy.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Neither is the Queſtion ſo much, What has the Magiſtrate done in all this, as, What has the <hi>Miniſters accepted,</hi> or <hi>ſubmitted unto?</hi> For, perhaps there are many more things enacted by him, than imbraced by them. Now what are the Miniſters concerned farther, than as to what they have accepted, or yielded ſubmiſſion unto? Let each bear their own burden, and not every thing, wherein it is ſuppoſed the Magiſtrate hath done amiſs, be charged upon the Miniſters.—</p>
            <p n="4">(4) It is not the Queſtion either, Whether or not it be lawful for Miniſters to have cloſed with the <hi>whole complex</hi> of both theſe Acts? This ye know they never did; nor do they allow of all contained in theſe Acts more than you do. But the Queſtion is, Whether might they lawfully accept of, or ſubmit unto <hi>any</hi> thing contained therein, rejecting the reſt as evil, or inconvenient; Particularly, whether they might upon the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned order, repair to ſuch and ſuch Pariſhes, and there Preach the Goſpel, and exerciſe the other parts of their Miniſtry, being permitted by the Magiſtrate, and alſo called thereunto by the people, and this for ſuch time only (in caſe it be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65758:25"/>
not their former charge) until they ſhould have regreſs to their former Pariſhes? This ye know is all they did embrace. And in a complex buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, why might not the good be taken hold of, and the evil abſtracted from, waved, and laid by? as is directed in the like caſes, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Prove all things,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>and held faſt that which is good.</hi> And commended in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> and recommended in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9, 10. And whatever the Magiſtrate did <hi>overſtretch</hi> in, what is it to the Miniſters if they did not <hi>cloſe</hi> with theſe exceſſes, as they did not? If ye <hi>ſay,</hi> the circumſtances, or concomitants or parts of an action cannot be morally abſtracted from, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the one from the other, ſeeing all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs to make up the morality of the action; Therefore no circumſtances or parts of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates deed can be by the indulged ſeparate, more than by himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Howbeit the circumſtances of the action cannot be juſtly waved by the <hi>Agent,</hi> as relating properly to him; yet no doubt but the <hi>Patient</hi> well may; and falſe it is to ſay, all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances upon the Agents part, does alſo terminate upon the Patient, and reflect upon the one as well as upon the other; as both Philoſophy and Divinity teacheth. It is not therefore to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but a complex frame of Indulgence, clothed with vicious circumſtances, and ſtuffed with ill ingredients upon the granters part, might very well be divided by the accepters, and the good ſeparated from the bad, very warrantably; and this to be counted no more Logical abſtraction,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65758:25"/>
but wiſe and Chriſtian diſcretion and diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and conſequently they ought not to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this caſe, with accepting the Indulgence as circumſtantiat in the Magiſtrate. But more of this after. And ſo they are not acceſſary to the guilt may be complicated in it, as it comes from the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>From all which ye ſee, It is no ſmall perverſion of the ſtate of the Queſtion, as it is moulded by ſome in their Papers, making it to be this; <hi>Whether the Magiſtrate, by virtue of his Office, may, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and immediately without the Church, and the previous Election of the People, aſſign and ſend Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to particular Churches, to take the Fixed and Paſtoral Overſight of them? And preſcribe Rules and Directions to them, for the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and confine them to the ſaid Congregations?</hi> And then Impugning this multiplex Queſtion, renders their exceptions againſt it, as Reaſons why they could not embrace the Indulgence, as their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have done: As if Exceptions at any part of the Magiſtrates Deed, did juſtifie their refuſing of the whole, and reflected guilt upon thoſe who did not wholly reject it as they did; or as if their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren embraced all and whole of it, not ſeparating the good from the evil. What unfair dealing is this? And among the many iniquities obſervable in this framing of the Queſtion (whereof ſeverals ſhall be ſpoken to afterwards, namely, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Confinement, and Act of Regulation) theſe two at preſent would be noticed. I. That more is charged upon the Magiſtrate, than really he hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65758:26"/>
done, namely, 1. It is ſupponed, that by the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he gives the Miniſters a <hi>ſpiritual poteſtative miſſion</hi> (as they call it) for Preaching to ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and taking Paſtoral Charge thereof: Hence they frame their Arguments to militate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Indulgence, as if therein the Magiſtrate took upon him the Spiritual Power of the Church in <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Admiſſion.</hi> Whereas all his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Aſſignment is purely Civil and Local (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Tenor of the Act) ordering them to repair to ſuch Pariſhes, and be confined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; only (for mitigation of their Confinement) he permits and allows them alſo liberty to Preach there, yet leaving it to peoples liberty to call them, and to their own liberty to embrace that call, to exerciſe their Miniſtry there, or not, as they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; (for their Freaching is not <hi>enjoyned,</hi> but <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>) Whence it is plain, there was no <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Miſſion,</hi> nor <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Admiſſion</hi> and <hi>Setting</hi> of theſe Miniſters over theſe Congregations, like that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 14 23. (unleſs ye call confinement to the place, with a civil permiſſion to Preach there, a ſpiritual and poteſtative Miſſion which were abſurd.) And therefore all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſtered up (upon this account) againſt the Indulged Liberty <hi>cum larvis luctantur,</hi> fights with their own Fancy only, and makes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true queſtion. Yea further, Suppoſe there had been ſome ſort of <hi>Political</hi> Miſſion, or Appointment and Command, ſuch as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> gave to the Levites, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to the Prieſts, as aforeſaid; yet that differs <hi>toto genere</hi> from an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Miſſion, ſuch as the Church gave <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65758:26"/>
and <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13.2, 3.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates political Appointment in this caſe, being not a <hi>Spiritual Authorization</hi> in the Name of Chriſt, but merely a <hi>Legal Warrant</hi>; not conferring intrinſick power and right to Preach, or be Paſtors to theſe people, but only warranting them (in point of Law) to exerciſe their Miniſtry to and among them. 2. It is ſupponed here, that the Miniſters are ſent to take the <hi>Fixed</hi> and <hi>Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Charge</hi> of theſe Congregations; whereas there is no ſuch thing in the Act; but ſimply a <hi>confining,</hi> with a <hi>Licenſe</hi> to Preach, without defining in what capacity, whether as a <hi>ſtated</hi> Paſtor of that people, or in <hi>occaſional way</hi> only, as they and the people ſhould agree: So that as their Aſſignment is but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, their Liberty but legal and permiſſive, their capacity alſo of Preaching there is left undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Magiſtrate. Thus ye ſee, more is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged (in this ſort of ſtating the queſtion) to be done by the Magiſtrate, than indeed He hath done. How unequal is this, that men ſhould put their Commentary and Senſe of the Matter, for the Text! And ſtate the Queſtion according to their miſtaken Notion, and not according to Truth?</p>
            <p>The Second Enquiry in this ſtating of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and in determining and impugning thereof as ſo ſtated, is, That it is ſuppoſed the Contents of the Councils Acts were propoſed to be accepted all and whole together, or elſe none, and nothing at all: And that theſe who have embraced the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Liberty, have joyned with all. Whereas, ſo notorious it is, that neither the one nor the other is true, that we need not inſiſt to demonſtrate the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65758:27"/>
ſame. And if any be ſo bold, as to affirm the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is incumbent to them to prove it, before their aſſerting can merit any credit with Rational Men. In ſum then, the genuine and plain ſtate of the queſtion is, <hi>Whether or no, when the Law had outed you all of your Charges, and reſtrained you moſt ſeverely from all publick, free, and peaceable Exerciſe of your Miniſtry, in any part of the Kirk and Kingdom of</hi> Scotland; <hi>whether or not (I ſay) did the Magiſtrate lawfully diſpenſe with, and take off that Reſtraint, as to ſome Perſons and Places? And the Miniſters thereby Licenſed, did they lawfully make uſe of that liberty, being withal moſt ſeriouſly called thereunto by the People?</hi> Now, what is exceptable againſt this? This is the true ſtate of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie betwixt you and your Brethren; what is your quarrel at it?</p>
            <p>There are nine particular Objections (the moſt material and moſt uſual, ſo far as we can learn) which here we ſhall conſider and anſwer, finding them not Relevant to prove the concluſion they drive at.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some ſay, This Indulgence it is mere Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm, and an Homologation of the Supremacy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They object the Rules and Inſtructions fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some alledg this Preaching with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates permiſſion and allowance, to be a Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of their former Commiſſion from Jeſus Chriſt, and a taking of a new one from the Magiſtrate, and an holding of their Miniſtry of him with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto him, and dependance upon him, like other Civil Judges of the Land.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65758:27"/>4. Divers offend at the Magiſtrates intent and deſign in this Indulgence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Others ſtumble at the narrowneſs of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as to Perſons and Places; and alſo as to the extent of the Exerciſe of Government permitted to theſe Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The manner of their Entry is quarrelled by ſome, as not being called by the people, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Order of Presbytery, as wont to be.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Other ſome cry out for want of a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt the Magiſtrates Incroachments, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſad grievances, in theſe and other of his Acts.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Some exagitates them for their confinement, yea for their fixing at all, though it be in their former Charge.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Others ſtumble at this, that ſo many other zealous and godly Miniſters and people are againſt it, and all the Godly divided about it.</p>
            <p>To all theſe we ſhall ſay ſomewhat ſhortly, to clear the miſtakes therein.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt, O ſays ſome, <hi>Is not this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence a Maſter-piece of the States Eraſtianiſm, and of the Prince his ſinful Supremacy now aſſerted by Law? And conſequently the accepting thereof, an homologa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſupporting of both?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Head, how admirably do ſome Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, inſult, yea and anathematize the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and all that has accepted thereof, or hears the Indulged Men! What fierce Outcryes are made, eſpecially by ſome Novices and Vulgars, harping continually (almoſt) upon this String, as their moſt melodious Muſick to pleaſe themſelves
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65758:28"/>
with, and their greateſt Argument to decry theſe Licenſed Brethren by; canting theſe jingling Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cables of <hi>Supremacy, Homologat, Eraſtian, ad Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vim uſque:</hi> And yet knows not perhaps what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm; nor are able at all to rid marches, and diſtinctly tell what power about Eccleſiaſtick matters does of right belong to the Magiſtrate, and what not; nor what is Eraſtianiſm, or ſinful Supremacy, or Homolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of either. <hi>Experti loquimur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let all that quarrel upon this ſcore, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ponder theſe few things, which we preſume to lay before them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to take off their offence as to this: (1) Be ye well aſſured, your indulged Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ye agree well enough in <hi>Theſi</hi> (in the general), That no Eraſtianiſm, nor unlawful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy (properly and truly ſo called) is to be complied with? They abhor both as much as you do. All the difference is about the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> (or particular application); that they cannot call every thing ſo, which you do call ſo; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that in this indulged liberty, as accepted by them, they can ſee neither of theſe. If you ſee further than they, bring forth your ſtrong reaſons, plead with them in love, and labour to convince them. Mean time be ſober till ye prove your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions demonſtratively, and not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y confident averring, nor by weak and unconcluding Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Certainly <hi>Fortia, non Phalerata,</hi> ſoft words and hard arguments were your beſt for convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and reclaiming your honeſt Brethren, in caſe they err here.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) As for the charge of Eraſtianiſm, let it be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65758:28"/>
conſidered what is Eraſtianiſm, but when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate uſurps in whole or in part the internal; proper, formal ſpiritual power of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (called in Scripture, <hi>The power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven)?</hi> and ſo wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Keys out of the Kirks hand, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing them to himſelf, accordingly exerciſeth them, or delegates them to others. Now who can warrantably ſay, this indulged liberty is of that nature? being meerly a Civil or Legal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to exerciſe their Miniſtry, notwithſtanding the Laws to the contrary. Whatever may be deemed of the Act of Inſtructions ſo called, (wherein they are not much concerned, as after may be cleared), ſurely this Act of Licenſing them to Preach in ſuch and ſuch places, is no proper, formal, intrinſick Act of the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> (no more than the <hi>Roman</hi> Governours permitting of <hi>Paul</hi> to Preach, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.39, 40. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26.1.) But rather an Act of the Regal <hi>Scepter</hi>; and is only objectively Eccleſiaſtical: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no Eraſtianiſm, nor without the verge of the Prince his juſt power, as hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed. Any that are contrary minded, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly judg their Brethren will think themſelves much obliged to them, if they will convince them of their miſtake in this, if there be any. Mean time it is hoped theſe Opponents will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude big words, or bold Aſſertions, or crafty inſinuations, inſtead of ſolid probations. Let School Doctors digladiat nimbly among themſelves, contending for the palm of Victory, rather than for Verity; and let them dictate to their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65758:29"/>
as if their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their bare authority were enough to reſt upon. It is hoped Divines and Chriſtians will be far from ſuch humours and practices; and will know, that every man muſt live by his own faith, and not implicitely upon anothors word. Convince your Brethren then of what Eraſtianiſm, or overſtretch of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his power is in this particular, as accepted by them, if ye find any in it; and hear what they have to ſay for themſelves, before ye condemn them, and divide from them, as is taught you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.46. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.51. <hi>Act.</hi> 25.16. Yea, ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate had ſtretched a little beyond his ordinary line, in the permiſſion granted (which yet we ſee not), nevertheleſs may not the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary caſe of the Church do much to excuſe, yea purge it of crime? in which caſe the moſt ſtrict Presbyterians and Anti-Eraſtian Divines are loth to charge him with the odious imputation of Eraſtianiſm. Read your worthy Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy, Aarons Rod,</hi> pag. 182. <hi>In extraordinary caſes</hi> (ſays he) <hi>when Church-Government doth degenerate into Tyranny (as under Popery it is for the moſt part) then—the Chriſtian Magiſtrate may and ought to do divers things in and for Religion, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Authority divers ways, ſo as doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto his—Adminiſtration, ordinarily in a Reformed and well conſtituted Church: Becauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extraordinary Diſeaſes muſt have extraordinary Remedies.</hi> To this ſame purpoſe ſpeaks bleſſed Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in his <hi>Due Right of Presbytery, pag.</hi> 416. Here more is conceded by your ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Writers, than the accepted liberty amounts unto.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65758:29"/>(3) As for the Supremacy, as it is now eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Law, <hi>Parliament</hi> 2<hi>d, Caroli</hi> 2. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. We ſhall not at preſent ſcan the nature of it, whether it be only (as ſome of your ſelves judg) a meer <hi>Civil</hi> Supremacy <hi>about</hi> Eccleſiaſtical perſons and things, but exalted to a <hi>dangerous height,</hi> devolving all the Legal power (about matters of Religion) into the Kings hand, making him abſolute, and intirely ſupreme, <hi>Quo ad Statum Politicum,</hi> that is, in point of Civil Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, Arbitrary; ſo as he may do in Church-matters (in point of Law or Civil capacity) as he thinks fit, without advice or conſent of the Eſtates of Parliament? or whether it be (as moſt others judg) a <hi>Caeſarec-Papatus</hi> (as they ſpeak) or a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, Spiritual Supremacy,</hi> [that is] a power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe abſolutely in a Soveraign, Arbitrary, Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical way, (as well <hi>in genere Ethico,</hi> as <hi>in genere Politico</hi>), upon the matters mentioned in that Act; Particularly, to ſettle what <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> in the Church he pleaſeth, and in whoſe <hi>hands</hi> he pleaſeth; as if all the ſpiritual power of Church-Government were in him as <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Fountain,</hi> and <hi>Modellable</hi> by him at pleaſure; even as the Civil perhaps at firſt was? and conſequently it be an high incroachment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſts Crown, to whom alone, as the only King, Head, and Monarch of his Church, ſuch a tranſcendent power and priviledg does belong? We ſay, we judg it not neceſſary to examine that matter now. But this we may offer to be conſidered, That whatever Overſtretch of the Soveraigns power be made in that Act of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65758:30"/>
as (upon the one hand) none of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged alloweth thereof, more than any others; but lament, as much as any, the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this or any other Acts of Parliament, tending to the prejudice of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt his Rights, or of the intrinſick Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Church; ſo (upon the other hand) who can, with any reaſon affirm, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Liberty (in ſo far as it is accepted by your Brethren) hath any affinity with ſuch a Papal Supremacy, or is a part of the unclean thing that might not be touched? Any that aver it to be ſo, we humbly beg their Reaſons: for, hitherto we have ſeen few, but ſome quirks and iniquous lame ſimilitudes and compariſons, which are not Argumentative, as all Scholars know, however taking they be with the vulgar; and you know too, that, <hi>Affirmanti incumbit probatio,</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of probation is incumbent to the purſuer. Nevertheleſs (for exculpation) we ſhall lay before you five reaſons, which we humbly judg may weigh much with any ſober and unprejudicate perſons to evidence the contrary.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Conſider the nature of this Toleration or Indulgence: It is (as hath been ſhewed already) meerly an Act of ſupreme <hi>Civil</hi> power <hi>Circa Sacra,</hi> and therefore differs <hi>toto genere</hi> (as far as Heaven from Earth), from <hi>Spiritual</hi> Supremacy, and is nothing of kindred to it; though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the name.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) A <hi>Politico-Papatus,</hi> or Papal ſpiritual Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, ſeated in <hi>Caeſar,</hi> conſiſts (as Writers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it) in a power to alter and diſpoſe arbitrarily
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65758:30"/>
upon Chriſts Inſtitutions, and to pervert the frame of Religion at pleaſure, and to ſet up Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inſtitutions in their room, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did. But this Indulged Liberty is not of that nature, but rather an act of his power as Nurſe-Father to the Church, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.23.) being for reſtoring and countenancing Chriſts <hi>own</hi> Miniſters and Ordinances, and not of Humane inventions, for promoving, not ſubverting of Religion; for the good, not the hurt of the Church; an Auxiliary, not a privative exerciſe of his power. Therefore being an Act of the Magiſtrates kiſſing the Son of God, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12.) and miniſtring to the Church in her diſtreſs, (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.10.) ſurely it can be no act of that Papal Supremacy, deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to Chriſts Prerogative. Who can (with the leaſt grain of reaſon) ſay, that the reſtoring (in any part) of Chriſts Miniſters and Ordinances, is a taking of Chriſts Crown off his head, (as ſome of you call the Indulgence) and not rather an helping to put it on?</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Manifeſt it is, that the Supremacy aſſerted in that Act of Parliament, relates directly only to the matter of Church-Government, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal thereof, and of perſons to be imployed therein, and matters to be treated therein. And ſo whatever diſpoſal of the Key of Diſcipline it put into the Prince his hand, yet no ways med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with the Key of Doctrine, and power of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> i. e. the inveſting of men with the power of Preaching, and Miniſtring the Sacraments; for the Act expreſly limits the Supremacy to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and diſpoſal of the external Government
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65758:31"/>
of the Church. But ſo it is, that this Indulged Liberty (as the Copies of the Act which we have happened to ſee, bears) is only, a <hi>permiſſion to Preach</hi> (including virtually a permiſſion to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments alſo), but no Licenſe is mentioned therein to exerciſe Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (albeit they venture upon ſome parts of Government alſo, competent to a Congregation, being connived at therein); whence it followed, the Indulgence granted them can be no efflux of that Supremacy, being not <hi>ad Idem.</hi> Or if the Act of Indulgence be of this tenor (as is ſaid ſome other Copies bear) <hi>permitting them to preach and exerciſe other parts of their Miniſtry</hi>; thence it is evident that the Act of Indulgence <hi>preſuppoſes</hi> their power and right to Preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that they have a Miniſtry, and intrinſick right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe all its parts, <hi>antecedently</hi> to that Indulged Liberty; but no way <hi>confers</hi> a new Copy-hold of their Miniſtry: Only it ſays, the exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was under a Civil Inhibition, or Legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, which this Indulgence takes off. But ſo it is, that the Supremacy, as it is aſſerted, is a power of conferring power of the matters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in expreſſed (as ye your ſelves grant) as if the Prince were head and fountain thereof. Sith therefore by the Indulgence the power of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exerciſing the other parts of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is not delegate, nor derived unto them, but only the free and peaceable exerciſe thereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and reſtraints removed, plain it is that the Indulgence is no Act of that Supremacy. And that even the power of Kirk-Seſſions, or Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65758:31"/>
parts of Government exerciſed by them, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſpecifically, and in kind, from what the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy can pretend to give.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Power of Indulging is a thing which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate uncontrovertedly had, and did exerciſe anteriorly to the foreſaid Aſſertion of Supremacy; for the firſt Indulgence was before it, and your ſelves grant that that Act Aſſertory of the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is not declarative only, (though it run in that Style, as the <hi>Stylus Curiae)</hi> but Collative and Conſtitutive, conferring upon him more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had before, elſe why did not ye and your Church Reſent it before that Aſſertion of it? Whence it follows, that the Indulging Power is not a proper part of that new Supremacy, being exiſtent before it had a Being; nor the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, a Native Product of that Supremacy, but the Efflux of a power prior unto it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Act of Indulgence does not, in any the leaſt Syllable or Jot of its Tenor, Refer unto, or Bottom it ſelf upon, the aſſerted Supremacy; but runs in common Form and Style of other Civil Acts of the Council.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is obſervable, that the Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Biſhops, and the Act anent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their National Synod, are expreſly Founded upon the Kings Supremacy, as the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives thereof bear. Whence it is manifeſt, that even the Magiſtrate himſelf did not grant the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence as an Act of that ſpiritual Supremacy, that new Jewel of his Crown, but merely as an Act of his ordinary Supreme Civil Power. Why then will ye Strain, Force, and Father it upon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65758:32"/>
that his Tranſcendent Supremacy, when himſelf does not ſo?</p>
            <p>Upon all which Reaſons, ye ſee that the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in ſo far as accepted by the Brethren, hath no Conſanguinity nor Affinity with that Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as now aſſerted, and as expounded by you of a ſpiritual Supremacy.</p>
            <p>From all theſe Conſiderations alſo it is plain, that the Argument uſed of late by ſome of you, to prove the Affinity of the Indulgence with the Supremacy, is but a very Sophiſm, <hi>viz. To Enact, Settle, and make Conſtitutions, concerning Matters, Meetings, and Perſons Eccleſiaſtical, according to Royal Pleaſure,</hi> is the very ſubſtanee and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Supremacy, expreſſed in the Act Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of it: But the Indulgence is to <hi>Enact, &amp;c.</hi> therefore it is the very ſubſtance and definition of the Supremacy. How do ſome Triumph in this, as a Demonſtration, and Achillean Argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, Beloved in the Lord, take with us a ſecond look of it, and weigh it in the Ballance of Right Reaſon, and ſee the weakneſs and fallacy of it in theſe few particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition is an unfaithful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Supremacy, as defined by the Act of Parliament; for the Act expreſly reſtricts it to Matters, Meetings, and Perſons of Eecleſiaſtical Juriſdiction and Government, as is before obſerved. And yet the Argument ampliates and extends it indefinitely unto all Matters, Meetings, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Eccleſiaſtical, of what kind ſoever, even of Worſhip as well as Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And indeed it could not otherwiſe ſuit with the Subſumption,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65758:32"/>
which comprehends theſe. Now, In this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Comprehenſion, it is a very great miſtake; and if ye Limit it to matters of Government, (as it ſhould be) then it varies the Suppoſition, and does not quadrate with the Subſumption; and would be <hi>ex majori particulari in prima figura,</hi> which is bad Logick.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, wherein ye apply your foreſaid definition of Supremacy to the Indulgence, obſerve theſe miſtakes in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it meaneth of the whole Complex and full Latitude of the Indulgence, as comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the parts and pendicles of it, the Act of Reſtrictive Rules and all; for ſo the Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in his Paper (called Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Teſtimony) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prove his Charge, by adducing theſe Rules and Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as witneſſes of it.</p>
            <p>Whereas ye know (as was aboveſaid) that is not the State of the Queſtion betwixt you and your Brethren; diſtinguiſh betwixt the Indulgence as <hi>Enacted,</hi> and as <hi>Accepted:</hi> And know, that whatever the Indulgence, as Enacted by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in its full Latitude, may be charged with, or judged to comprehend, yea or not; ſure ye'll find that part of it, which is accepted by your Brethren, not to be as is by you alledged, being only a permiſſion or allowance of Liberty to Preach and Exerciſe the other parts of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, wherein no Veſtige of the Supremacy (as expounded of a Papal, Arbitrary, Architectonick, Spiritual Supremacy) is to be found, as hath been already cleared. And for further clearing of which, conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:65758:33"/>2. That in this grant of Liberty, the Magiſtrate acteth not merely according to pleaſure (except it be <hi>in genere politico,</hi> that is, as to his own deed, doing it without conſtraint, controul, or counta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to any perſon) but rather againſt his mind <hi>in genere Ethico,</hi> permitting that which he does not approve, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the Bill of Divorce: So that herein he acts not as a <hi>Coeſareo-Papa,</hi> or Head of the Church, and Fountain of Church-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Enacting what he will in diſpoſal of Church-matters, as modellable by his pleaſure; but only and ſimply, as a Supreme Civil Magiſtrate, he ſuſpends and diſpenſes with the Laws which cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and hedged in your Brethren, and permits them now to enjoy a portion of their wonted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, for Reaſons of State expreſſed in his Act; ſo that while the major Propoſition of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tells us, that, <hi>to Enact, Settle, and make ſuch Conſtitutions about Matters, &amp;c. Eccleſiaſtick, according to Royal Pleaſure</hi>; that is, to make any Acts anent them he will, as modellable, in their kind, at his Arbitriment, <hi>is the Definition of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> (for in this Senſe only it is truly ſo defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as <hi>Apollonius</hi> and others tell.) And then ſubſumes, <hi>that this Act of Indulgence,</hi> even as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the Brethren, <hi>is of that Nature</hi>; it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently a very great miſtake; which might give us occaſion to Remark what multiplyed Sophiſtry is in this Argument, <hi>a compoſitione &amp; diviſione, ab</hi>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65758:33"/>
and conſequently the <hi>All</hi> of it, and convertible with it, as if the Supremacy and this Indulgence were reciprocal Terms, and whatſoever the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy can pretend to, to that ſame is this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence applicable, according to the Rule, <hi>cui competit definitum, ei competit definitio; &amp; vice verſa.</hi> But ſuch Logical Remarks we forbear; only we are ſorry to find ſuch paralogizing among you in a matter ſo grave and ſerious: But more ſorry that ſuch a caption ſhould deceive and inſnare the ſimple. Had this Syllogiſm been applyed to the Act of Ejecting you, and that of demoliſhing the Church-Government, and erecting Prelacy in its ſtead, we ſhould have thought it more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and conſiderable. Theſe being Acts of his Privative and Deſpotical power, and ſavouring of a more Dominative Supremacy: But while ye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to this Indulged Liberty, which is but a Cumulative and Auxiliary Act of his power, as Nurſe-Father, and call this the very Eſſence, Exerciſe, and Application of the Supremacy (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spiritual and Architectonick) who may not with half an eye ſee it a viſible miſtake? And pray you if the King ſhould write down to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and thereupon a Proclamation be made, for permitting, yea appointing and commanding that no Government be exerciſed in your Church, but the Presbyterian, and that forthwith it be ſet up and exerciſed, and all outed Miniſters be allowed acceſs to the free exerciſe of their Miniſtry any where; would you ſay, This were the Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Settling, and Emitting Conſtitutions about Matters, Meetings, and Perſons Eccleſiaſtick, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65758:34"/>
to Royal pleaſure, and the very ſubſtance and definition of the Supremacy, and ſo caſt at it, as a thing vile, not to be touched? If not, (as no ſober, rational, man, will think ye ſhould) why judge ye otherwiſe of this partial Liberty? Both the one and the other being of one and the ſame grain, piece, and kind, though differing in meaſure. Upon all that is ſaid then, ye ſee it ſtill plain, that this indulged Liberty, in ſo far as it is accepted, hath nothing to do with this aſſerted Supremacy.</p>
            <p>But <hi>ſay</hi> ye, Many are of the opinion that this power of ſo Indulging, though pre-exiſtent before, yet now is included in the Aſſertion of the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though this be not evident, but much appears to the contrary by what is ſaid; yet, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it were ſo, that the clean and unclean power of civil and ſpiritual Supremacy, were compacted together in the ſame aſſertive Law, and declared Inherent to the ſame Crown, what then? Being in it ſelf lawful, does its Neighbourhood <hi>(in eodem ſubjecto)</hi> with what is counted unlawful, defile it? Does the Acceſſion or Conjunction of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent power, nullifie or corrupt the whole Syſteme of the Regal Authority? And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even that juſt power which did without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie belong to the Crown before that unjuſt Superaddition? And that, to ſuch a Degree, as neither he may exerce, nor ye make uſe (without ſin) of the Effluxes of the juſt power, till firſt he diſclaim, and lay by the Addition of what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due? How Irrational were this? For, as Lawyers tell, <hi>Accedente injuſtitiâ, non decedit, nec corrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65758:34"/>
juſta poteſtas.</hi> For example, An Husband, Father, or Maſter, uſurping the power of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate or Miniſter, does he therefore loſe and fall from his Marital, Paternal, or Maſterly Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Or is it a ſin in the Wife, Son, or Servant, to ſubmit unto, or make uſe of, the exerciſe of the one, while he doth not diſclaim the other? Sic-like <hi>Uzzah</hi>'s going beyond his Line, intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Prieſtly Office, did it evacuate or vitiate his Levitical Power, ſo as (had he lived) no man might lawfully have made uſe of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Service? Or did <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Uzzah</hi> their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Prieſts Office, yea or <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſinful Supremacy in the matters of God, render all their Regal Power <hi>circa ſacra,</hi> null or unclean, ſo as no uſe might be made of it, no not to the beſt ends? What a ſtrange Principle were this? And conſequently it cannot be admitted (which ſome, but few of you, have bigotly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) that it is not lawful either to ſeek or take any Indulgence or Benefit of the Magiſtrates pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er about the matters of Religion, until he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce what he has by Law or Practice aſſumed of Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy. Moreover, were this Principle admitted, how deſperate would it render the caſe betwixt your Church and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate? It not being likely he may be readily induced to Reſcind that new aſſerted Supremacy (which he takes for a Flower of his Crown:) And it not being lawful for you (according to this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple) during the Non-Retractation of that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, to receive any favour of his hand, were it even to an Univerſal Indulgence, or Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65758:35"/>
of the Presbyterian party and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, among themſelves, or in all the Land. Dear Friends! Have your Senſes exerciſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern betwixt things that differ, and ſeparate what is ſeparable in their Nature and Exerciſe: Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt <hi>Gods Ordinance, viz.</hi> the Magiſtrates Civil Supremacy, and <hi>Mans annexed Corruption, viz.</hi> his Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtick Supremacy: And when the former acteth its part purely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of the latter, and contains it ſelf <hi>intra Sphaeram Debitae Activitatis,</hi> within its proper bounds (as it did in the matter of this Indulged Liberty, abſtracted from the Reſtrictions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions annexed, and in ſo far only it is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) what hinders, but ye and your Brethren might take the benefit of its favourable Acts, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it lodgeth in the ſame Crown with the other? Yea, though they did put forth both their Actings beſide other, in different points, in one and the ſame Complex Law? As was in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Engliſh Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> — for ſetting up of Presbyterian Government, with Reſervation of Appeals from the Church-Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Parliament. Here is an Act of that mixture and complexion we ſpeak of, yet your Brethren in <hi>England</hi> wiſely diſtinguiſhed and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Good from the Evil, Embracing the one, and Rejecting the other.</p>
            <p>§. If any be againſt Diſtinguiſhing and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting betwixt theſe things ſo vaſtly different, which they ſuppoſe to be ſo confounded and complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now in the ſame Supremacy, that they cannot well be put aſunder; we crave leave to tell them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65758:35"/>
two things: One is (as is ſaid already) That different Powers and Principles of Acting, may very well remain diſtinguiſhable and ſeparable in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Actions, notwithſtanding their Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the ſame Subject, as the former Inſtances ſhew: So that in this caſe, it is (almoſt) juſt as in the caſe of <hi>Jordan</hi> running through the Lake of <hi>Geneſareth,</hi> with which (notwithſtanding) it mixeth not, but remains pure and ſeparate. The other thing is, that when Folk begin to caſt at juſt diſtinguiſhing and ſeparting the precious from the vile, as mere notional and metaphyſical Abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, unfit for Chriſtians or Men, (as ſome of you are pleaſed to talk:) We fear they be found Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> not of <hi>Salem</hi>; but love who will to be Maſters of Confuſion, far be it from you.</p>
            <p>But here ſome <hi>Object,</hi> That the Indulgence oweth all its Legal Being, Life, and Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the Act of Supremacy now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law; and therefore it cannot be abſtracted from; nor the Indulgence conſidered without it, whereon it ſo much depends, as its Patron and Protector in Law; it being for the ſake and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Indulgence, that this Supremacy was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in the King.</p>
            <p>Thus, we confeſs, ſome Argue, who would ſeem very Noſe-wiſe and prying; drawing (if their Aſſertion will paſs for proof enough) all things done by the Magiſtrate about matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to have, either directly or indirectly, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Relation to the Supremacy: Alledging what Indulgence was after the Supremacy, to be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65758:36"/>
an efflux of it, and deſigned for ſupport of it; and what Indulgence was born before the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, muſt be drawn back to crouch under the Supremacy, for ſhadow and ſhelter in Law.</p>
            <p>But to the Objection we <hi>anſwer,</hi> 1. This Alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, if true, ſays, that the Supremacy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence muſt needs be of a civil nature, not ſpiritual; ſeeing (as ye aſſert) both its fountain and end are civil. For, firſt, being of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beſtowing, who never pretended to have any other but a Civil Legal power, (and more than themſelves had, they could not bequeath upon their Prince), thence it appears (upon this ground of yours) to be but of a civil alloy. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the end and uſe for which ye ſay this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy was Enacted, was for <hi>warranting</hi> and <hi>ſecuring</hi> the King and Council in Law, for what was paſt and done in the Indulgence, being a diſpenſing with ſome poenal Statutes, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome a liberty to preach contrary to ſuch ſtanding Laws; and for <hi>inabling</hi> him and them to do more of that in the future. Whereupon ye ſay, the Indulgence owes all its Legal life and being to this Act of Supremacy as its Charter. Whence it is plain, that ye make the Act of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy to be but a Legal and Civil ſecurity for the King to grant, and Miniſters to accept this Indulgence: and conſequently, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence derives nothing but <hi>Legality,</hi> not any <hi>Spirituality</hi> from that Act of Supremacy. And therefore no efflux of any Eccleſiaſtick Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctonick power is judged to be in it, nor does not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65758:36"/>
Homologat the ſame; owning only what is Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, for its Legal protection.</p>
            <p>But paſſing this, know, 2. That this Alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of yours, is but a meer fiction to caſt an <hi>odium</hi> upon the Indulgence. How inſtruct ye this to have been the drift and end of that Act? Does not all that know the myſtery of that matter, know that it was upon another occaſion, and for another end? <hi>viz.</hi> to curb the inſolency of the Prelates, who thinking themſelves and their Church-dignities and power cock-ſure in Law, were become bold to ſpeak liberally of the King, and againſt his Minions, as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> has done. Therefore to keep them in awe and d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>endance, as wholly in the Kings reverence, and conſequently obnoxious to his Minions, that Act was made, inabling the King with his Council to alter their eſtabliſhed frame of Church-Government, and looſe the pins of their Fabrick at his pleaſure; which then was threatned to them by ſome Stateſmen, to keep them ſober; and therefore the Biſhops were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry backward to conſent to the paſſing of that Act, till awed thereunto. That this was the <hi>profeſſed</hi> end of the Act, can (as we are ſurely informed) be atteſted by the prime movers in it. So that, whether the Indulgence had been or not, this Act would have been to put the diſpoſal of the Church-Government in the Kings lurch. Falſe and groundleſs therefore is it, and <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa,</hi> to ſay the Indulgence was the riſe of this Act, or that it was done in reference to the ſame. 3. Suppoſe the Indulgence had been Illegal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65758:37"/>
this, or ſome other Act to warrant it, yet ſeeing ye judg the Laws that were oppoſite to this liberty were not juſt upon the matter, it ſeems ſtrange to us, that ye, who ſo much juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, yea magnifie the liberty of Conventicling (which your Brethren do not condemn if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed) taken at your own hand, againſt the ſame Laws, and many more, and conſequently as illegal, though not unlawful; ſhould ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry the Magiſtrates deed, in diſpenſing with theſe Laws, and granting your Brethren liberty of their Miniſtry. Maugre them. Is your liberty taken ſo Divine? and theirs granted, an illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or Baſtard-brood, as in your papers ye call it? may not theirs be juſt and lawful, though not according to Law, as well as yours? does not this unequal dealing ſay, nothing of this ſort pleaſes you but what is taken at your own hand? and that your quarrel at the Indulgence is, that it is granted, not taken?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether the King had ſuch a Prerogative or not (before the Act) as to indulge Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt Miniſters liberty of their Miniſtry, beſide the Laws allowance, we humbly judg is not theirs, nor your concern to debate; being <hi>jus tertii,</hi> viz. the Parliaments intereſt. If the thing was juſt and right in it ſelf, you and your Brethren were not to ask <hi>quo jure,</hi> the King took it on him? Let the Parliament ask that; was it not enough for your Miniſters acceptance of it, that the thing was good and right in it ſelf, and not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon the matter; the King being to anſwer for the legality of his own deed? and whatever
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65758:37"/>
               <hi>hazard</hi> the indulged might have incurred for want of the alledged legality, yet we hope ye will not ſay they <hi>ſinned</hi> in taking their hazard upon the Magiſtrates allowance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We humbly ſuppoſe the objecters of the King his not being inſtructed with Legal power to indulge, before the Act of Supremacy was made, may find themſelves much in a miſtake. Whoever queſtioned it to be a part of your Kings Prerogative to diſpenſe with poenal Statutes (we mean <hi>in foro ſoli</hi>) at leaſt as to the execution of them? Hath it not been his uncontroverted pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, paſt memory of man, as to other poenal Laws? and why ſhould it be denied him in this kind more than in others? is not a current, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted cuſtom, equivalent to a Law? Whereupon you know the King did ſeveral times write down before, for allowing liberty to ſome Miniſters, but it was obſtructed and ſuppreſſed by the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices; till at laſt one of you, Mr. <hi>John Smith,</hi> was by ſpecial and peremptory command of the King to the Council, allowed to preach at— and ſome years hereafter, your firſt more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Indulgence came; all this while the King and Council never doubting, nor any other queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this power of indulging. How then can ye ſay, that to this Act of Supremacy the Indulgence oweth its whole legal being?</p>
            <p>Upon all therefore that hath been ſaid, is it not moſt evident to be a meer miſtake to think, and a groundleſs aſſertion to affirm, as ye do, That the foundation, baſis, fountain, and ground-right
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65758:38"/>
of the Indulged liberty, is this Act of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy; ſeeing (beſides the reaſons forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to diſprove their affinity) this liberty did, and doth ſubſiſt without the Supremacy, and borroweth neither its natural nor moral being from this aſſertion of Supremacy, and hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Legal nor Spiritual dependance upon it? Nor is it the exerciſe of any other but a lawful civil Supremacy, competent to the Magiſtrate, before ever that new Act had a being, and for whoſe cauſe that new Act was not at all hatched, as ye would fain bear the world in hand.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared, that in the Indulgence (abſtractly conſidered, as it is accepted by the Brethren) there is nothing of Eraſtianiſm, nor any ſibneſs unto, or homologation of the ſo much talked of Supremacy; let none ſtumble at them, nor divide from them upon that ſcore; nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim impetuouſly againſt them, as ſupporters of the unlawful Supremacy; for how groundleſs that imputation is, the premiſes may abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew. For our part we cannot ſee how their Preaching <hi>with</hi> the Magiſtrates Tolerance and leave, can be a pillar and prop to his Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Supremacy, more nor your Preaching <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> his leave is. If ye fancy any <hi>accidental</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that may redound from theirs to uphold it; as ye can hardly name that, ſo may not the like be found to flow from yours, by its occaſioning the ſetling of a military force to maintain the Supremacy, and the Hierarchy depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and to ſuppreſs your liberty? which is the States fault, we grant; yet by you occaſioned.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65758:38"/>
Conſider ſeriouſly then, that their Preaching with the Magiſtrates Civil permiſſion, is not ſo much, let be more, a prop to this Decantated Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, than your Preaching without permiſſion is: (Though it can be juſtly attributed to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) And let out-crys on this head, go, and indulge not your humours, while ye cry out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Indulgence! nor ſtate your ſelves Judges paramount and infallible, as if you had a Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over all perſons, and in all cauſes, while ye go about unjuſtly to task your Brethren with Communion with this juſtly lamented Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>But if ſtill ſome cannot part with that high-ſounding word of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and ſtill will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the indulged liberty to Supremacy, uſing that ambiguous word as a <hi>Gorgons</hi> Head, or Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to fright the vulgar by, and ſcare people at the Licenſed Miniſters; will they be intreated to deal as candidly in their diſcourſes, as ſome of you have done in their publick Papers, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt the Civil Supremacy (whence the Indulgence flows), and the Eccleſiaſtical Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy (with which it hath no affinity), and then the ſnare were broken. But to talk of Supremacy in the general, and thence to inſinuate a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by the accepted Indulgence, with the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Supremacy in ſpecial, is to argue <hi>a genere ad ſpeciem, affirmative,</hi> (from a general to a particular, affirmatively), which is fallacious and unfair dealing.</p>
            <p>And finally, what better reaſoning is it to ſay (as ſome do), That becauſe the Magiſtrate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65758:39"/>
in the ſecond Indulgence ſuch and ſuch Miniſters to preach in ſuch or ſuch a place, if they and the people pleaſe to have it ſo, without impoſing a neceſſity or compulſion upon them thereunto; therefore he takes upon him the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Miniſters, and judging of their Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and fitneſs for theſe places, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (ſay ye) he acts in this Eraſtianiſm and Supremacy.</p>
            <p>For removing this miſtake, <hi>firſt,</hi> as to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, conſider, (1) This doth not concern theſe of the firſt Indulgence, who were pitched upon, nominate, preſented, and petitioned for, by ſome repreſenting the Pariſh, before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Licenſed them to the place.</p>
            <p>Conſider (2) that the Nomination of Miniſters in the ſecond Indulgence, was primarily a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating of them to confinement in the place, and but ſecondarily to the free liberty of Exerciſe of their Miniſtry there; but not to ſtate them in the relation of Paſtors to thoſe people. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples call doth this.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Suppoſe in this troubled and unſetled ſtate of the Church, the Magiſtrate had nominate them to be Paſtors there, what is that but what the <hi>Books of Diſcipline</hi> of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in ſuch Exigents, as in the forecited place, <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 37. <hi>For this preſent</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we think it expedient, that either your Honours by your ſelves</hi> Nominate <hi>ſo many as may ſerve the forewrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Provinces, or that ye give Commiſſion to ſuch men as ye ſuppoſe the fear of God to be in, to do the ſame. And the ſame men being called into your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,

ſhall be by you, and ſuch as your Honours plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to call unto you for conſultation in that caſe,</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>to their Provinces.</hi> Where you ſee the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of the Superintendents, and the <hi>Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of their Province is given to the Council for that juncture, yea, and they to be called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> and <hi>in praeſentia,</hi> in the face of Council to be <hi>appointed</hi> to their <hi>Charges.</hi> And Charges were they much beyond what your Brethren pretend to in the places of their confinement. Nor was it here thought a ſubjecting the Miniſtry to the Magiſtrate, or putting on him an Eraſtian power, or a renouncing Chriſt, and a taking of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry from the Magiſtrate by a new Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, For Miniſters to appear Perſonally before the Council, and be appointed to Provinces: Will you ſay, your Church here eſtabliſheth Eraſtianiſm, or a ſinful Supremacy? or allows an encroachment upon the Church and peoples Right? And does not your <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writers, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Bowels</hi> in his <hi>Paſtor Evangelicus, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. allow the like?</p>
            <p n="4">(4) Whatever pretence this Nomination might have of <hi>oppreſſing</hi> the liberty of the people; yet we wonder ye count it <hi>Eraſtianiſm,</hi> being no Act of Church-Government, no exerciſe of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keys; elſe when people, to whom no power of the Keys belongs more than to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, does nominate and elect a Miniſter to themſelves, they ſhould Eraſtianly uſurp and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Government of the houſe of God. Your own Divines aſſert Election to be a matter of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> or <hi>priviledg,</hi> not a <hi>power of Juriſdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:65758:40"/>
               <hi>Next,</hi> as for the Magiſtrates alledged judging of Miniſters Qualifications and fitneſs for places, we preſume to propoſe four things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Whereupon ground ye this plea? what Act of Judicial cognition, or definitive Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation concerning your Brethrens gifts, did the Magiſtrate put forth?</p>
            <p n="2">(2) What judging upon Miniſters Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did the Council here exerciſe more than in the forecited caſe of their Nominating and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Superintendents to their Provinces? or, then people does, when they elect a Miniſter to themſelves?</p>
            <p n="4">(4) To clear all, diſtinguiſh betwixt a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative,</hi> or <hi>Diſcretive</hi> judgment, and a <hi>Judicial, Forenſick, Definitive</hi> judgment. The former (<hi>viz.</hi> a judgment of <hi>Diſcretion</hi>) is not, ye know, to be denied to any man or people concerned, much leſs to a Chriſtian Magiſtrate: and more than that, yours did not take upon them; yea, nor that either, but ſuppoſed theſe Miniſters able and qualified, being before tried and ordained by Presbyteries, to no leſs eminent Charges than now they were indulged unto. And for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (<hi>viz.</hi> the judgment of <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> which is properly the work of Church-Judicatories) they medled not therewith. What then did they in this matter, without their ſphere? If ye <hi>ſay,</hi> by his Majeſties Letter they were appointed to Licenſe only <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Peaceable</hi> men; and is not this to judg of their Qualifications?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Manifeſt it is, that that is meant only of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65758:40"/>
ſome Civil or Moral Qualifications, not of Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gifts; and this alſo they conſidered and cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſced upon only <hi>Diſcretively,</hi> not by a <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> and <hi>Declarative</hi> ſentence. Did they at all, <hi>in foro,</hi> Inſtitute a trial and cognition of theſe or any other their Qualifications? not at all, but contented themſeves with a Negative Teſtimony thereof, that is, if no body objected againſt their peaceableneſs. What Eraſtianiſm then, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Supremacy was here?</p>
            <p>But finally, ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached and gone beyond his line, in nominating theſe Miniſters to ſuch places, and judging of their Miniſterial parts and fitneſs: What is that againſt the Miniſters themſelves, who did not, does not preach to ſuch people upon the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Nomination or Deſignation (except in ſo far as it imported a taking off their civil Reſtraints) but upon their own office (as their <hi>Miſſio Poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva</hi>) and the peoples call (as the Determiner of them to officiate in that place)? neither did they ſubmit the trial of their Miniſterial Qualifications and fitneſs for ſuch a place to the Magiſtrates cognition: But as the Magiſtrate preſumed they were competently fit; ſo, they (without any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Recognition of their abilities and ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) condeſcended upon the peoples earneſt call to imploy their Talents, whatever their meaſure were, for the edifying of that people for an <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim.</hi> Now, upon all this, what juſt ground of out-cry is there againſt your honeſt Brethren? wherein have they homologate Eraſtianiſm, or a Spiritual Supremacy?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:65758:41"/>The Second Objection is, Concerning the Act of Rules or Inſtructions (ſo called) wherein the Magiſtrate does, by his Civil Authority, Statute and Ordain, that ſuch and ſuch things (already mentioned) be done and obſerved by the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, under Civil pains.</p>
            <p>This Act is Repreſented unto People (in <hi>odium</hi> of the Indulged Miniſters) as both moſt cenſurable upon the <hi>Matter,</hi> and Eraſtian in its <hi>Nature,</hi> and as inſeparable <hi>Clogs,</hi> yea <hi>Conditions,</hi> of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But, Dear and Worthy in the Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in ſober ſadneſs, what can be juſtly charged upon theſe Brethren in this matter, and what not. For our part, we cannot apprehend; and therefore wave to examine, whether this Act be formally civil, and only objectively Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and that only in a few particulars, the reſt being Civil; or whether the Magiſtrates Error here be in the <hi>Form,</hi> uſurping an unjuſt Power; or only in the <hi>Matter,</hi> abuſing his juſt power, and miſapplying it to unjuſt purpoſes, as ſometimes he may do in civil caſes; which we think, the inverting of theſe Rules to their contrary, may help to clear. Nor is it neceſſary to dip into that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether it be altogether heterogeneous and incompetent, as well as it may be inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for the Civil Ruler to make Civil Laws and Conſtitutions about the Circumſtances, Order, and Exerciſe of matters of Religion, without the previous cognizance and pre-determination of the Church thereupon; And that even in the moſt broken and ruined State of the Church, when there is no Governing-Church exiſtent, that can
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65758:41"/>
be owned. Paſſing alſo to conſider, whether or no this Act be properly an Act of Paſtoral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (ſuch as only Chriſt Jeſus, and no mortal man can give to his Embaſſadors)? or, whether they be properly Eccleſiaſtical Canons (of the ſame formal and ſpecifical Nature with Church-Decrees, about matters of Order)? Or, whether, they be only improperly and abuſively called Inſtructions and Rules: As in ſome ſenſe, all Laws, even Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, are ſaid to be Regulative and Directive of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice? Whatever may be ſaid to theſe Queſtions, upon the one ſide or the other, to excuſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Magiſtrates Deed, ſeemeth little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the purpoſe in hand, ſeeing your Indulged Miniſters, looking upon theſe Statuted Rules, at leaſt ways, as unjuſt upon their matter, have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver embraced nor obſerved them, except it be in ſome civil points (inflicted on them as penal); and that only ſo far as they judged might be lawfully ſubmitted unto, however unjuſtly impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. What ground then is there, of ſtumbling at them, upon this Head? Does not their non-accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and non-obſervance, of theſe Rules, free them of all crime ſuppoſed to be therein?</p>
            <p>But to ſatisfie the Objection more fully, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſerious ſobriety, That, be this Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation as cenſurable as you will, yet was and is it quite <hi>extrinſick</hi> and <hi>accidental</hi> to the granting and accepting of the Indulgence; and therefore the vitiouſneſs of the one, cannot defile the other; nay nor be ſo much as the Miniſters <hi>perſonal</hi> guilt, unleſs they had cloſed with it, which ye know they did not. But to evidence this conſideration
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65758:42"/>
to be true and conſiderable, ponder theſe two things which ſerves to clear the point of this Act of Regulation its being extrinſick and accidental to the Indulgence.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That Act of Rules is no part of the Act of Indulgence, but a diſtinct Act by it ſelf, Enacted after the Indulgence, even in another meeting of the Council (as is informed) though the ſame day: nor was it at all legally intimated to the indulged (but lay dormant in the Council-Books) until a conſiderable time after their entry to their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Now who can with reaſon think, that a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterior Law, impoſed only ſubſequently to their acceptance of their Liberty (for how ſoon ſo ever it was paſt in the Council-Books, is nothing to them, ſeeing <hi>Lex non promulgata eſt quaſi non lata,</hi> a Law not legally intimated ſignifies nothing) how can it, we ſay, be thought to affect, burthen, and prejudice their acceptance of their Liberty, and to conſtitute it ſinful, which was long in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before that Act of Rules came forth by Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication into the world? Hence plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it is no <hi>Conſtituent part</hi> of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, nor an <hi>Inſeparable attendant</hi>; much leſs <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of the ſame, as ſome invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly call them. Had it been intimated to them conjunctly with the Act of Indulgence, there had been ſome more appearance of its being an <hi>Onus Libertatis</hi>; but ſince it was not ſo, who can ſay with any ſhew of reaſon, that it was a burthen affecting their liberty, and that their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the one was a compliance with the other? Suppoſe a man purpoſed to diſpone his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65758:42"/>
Eſtate to another, with ſuch or ſuch a proviſion or burden of Legacy, Debt, or ſervice upon it; if this Clauſe was not inſerted into the Diſpoſition, nor therewith delivered in a Paper apart unto the Succeſſor; but the Diſpoſition was at firſt <hi>ſine onere,</hi> pure, free, and unconditional, as it was drawn up, ſubſcribed and delivered unto the man; yet ſometime the Reſter, the Cedent, thinks fit to add in a new Paper apart, ſuch a burden and clog to his former diſpoſition, intending to affect his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee with it. Now who will not think ſuch a Poſterior oneration altogether extrinſick to the diſpoſition, and no ways to affect the Eſtate or Succeſſor? And that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee's acceptance of, or adherence to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid diſpoſition, does no ways Homologate that ſubſequent addition, nor oblige him in Law to own it (if gratitude and kindneſs conſtrain him not thereto); but ſtill he ſtands free of, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in that new-added burden? It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing here to ſay, that the Diſponent never intended to diſpone his Eſtate otherwiſe than with that burden; but in his mind, or ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſonal deed lying by him, he <hi>purpoſed</hi> from the beginning to have his Succeſſor affected with it, as a condition annexed to the diſpoſition; yea, and perhaps talked of it to many; ſo that the Ceſſioner was not Phyſically ignorant of his mind and matter. What then? does his purpoſe, or private ſeparate deed, infer any obligation upon his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee? or private ſignifications of his mind, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any thing in Law without Legal and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Intimation? No ſurely. The Ceſſioner is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65758:43"/>
ſtill free. Is it not juſt ſo in your Brethrens caſe? How can they be ſaid to have accepted their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>cum onere,</hi> ſeeing there was no ſuch terms propoſed to them <hi>in</hi> the Act of Indulgence deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them, nor <hi>with it</hi> at their acceptance? (as the extracts of their Licenſes ſent to them will teſtifie.) And theſe Inſtructions (ſo called) was not intimated to them, till long after they were in poſſeſſion of their liberty; and when intimated, refuſed; nor was it equitable they ſhould have abandoned the favour of their liberty, upon the intimation of theſe Rules to them; becauſe not propoſed (even then) as terms, but impoſed as Laws. And alſo being ſupervenient, like a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foetation, and conſequently extrinſick and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the favour. If ye <hi>ſay,</hi> The Magiſtrates im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them by way of Laws, was but out of State, as counting it below him to ſeek their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> May ye not ſay the ſame of all Laws? and ſo threap upon the ſubjects, that they are terms, though no conſent be explicitely ſought? which were abſurd. Again, know, that when the Council minds to deal with any, even a ſingle perſon, by way of terms, they do not count it below them to require conſent, yea ſubſcription: As in ſome of your baniſhed Miniſters caſe, who was required to, and did ſubſcribe their own Act of Baniſhment; and ſome others of you at home, for redeeming their Liberty from Proceſs, were required, and did take the Oath of Supremacy. But to leave this: we only add, If ye by your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and bold alledging the Indulgence to be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65758:43"/>
granted and accepted upon the terms of obſerving their Rules, do teach the Biſhops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (who will like well to confirm you in your Arguments and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, thereby to blow at the coal of your Animoſities and Contentions) and put it in their heads to ſpeak in the ſame language, blame your ſelves for it, but uſe it not as a Teſtimony againſt your Brethren, not being witneſſes (in the caſe) without juſt exception.</p>
            <p>If, finally, ye <hi>Object,</hi> that the Kings Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt Indulgence, comprehended in the boſom of it an order alſo concerning the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which after followed; and conſequently theſe Inſtructions cannot be divided from the Act of Indulgence, in conſidering Miniſters accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That Letter of his Majeſties to the Council, was to them directed (not to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) as the Councils Rule and Warrant, not the Miniſters Legal Act of Indulgence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (whatever was in it) it did concern the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters no further than was legally communicate unto them; and this at firſt was only in a very ſimple and unconditionate, or unclogged Act of Licenſe, as the Copies thereof under the Clerks hand ſent unto them, evidenceth. The Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not intimated unto them till upwards of a year thereafter. Now it's only the Councils Act put into the Miniſters hand, which is the publick legal deed wherein they are concerned; the Kings Letter, though Regiſtrate in the Council-Books, is a private matter as to them, as for any thing not intimate unto them. Whatever they did
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65758:44"/>
Phyſically know thereof (by private information), which theſe not indulged alſo knew) ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; at leaſt no more to them than to others. So that ſtill it is plain the Indulgence was <hi>ſine onere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, The Kings Letter was read to the firſt Ten indulged, when they were called before the Council; and did not their ſilence, and not bearing Teſtimony againſt theſe Injunctions, and other things of the like nature, import an Homologation thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Beſides that the matter of fact alledged is much queſtioned, yea plainly denied as falſe, let us ſuppoſe the Letter to have been <hi>all</hi> and whole read to them, yet the ſpeech delivered by one in name of the reſt, by ſhewing poſitively how they held their Miniſtry, did (in all ſober mens judgment) ſufficiently (though indirectly) intimate their diſallowance of all things repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant thereunto; for, <hi>Rectum eſt norma, &amp; index ſui &amp; obliqui.</hi> But ſuppoſe they failed in not being plain, full and free enough in their Teſtimony, is that a ground ſufficient to charge the odious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Eraſtianiſm on them? or to illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their indulged Liberty, or their Miniſtry, ſo as it were unlawful to hear them? or what is it to the reſt of the Brethren, who were never call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Council, nor the Letter and its Contents read to them? muſt the failing of ſome few be caſt upon all? and all alike condemned as guilty? what partial and unjuſt dealing is this?</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Conſider the form or quality of theſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Rules; <hi>viz.</hi> That they were not <hi>propoſed</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65758:44"/>
to them, as prerequired, or ſimultaneous, or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>conditions</hi> of their Liberty; but <hi>impoſed as Laws,</hi> and authoritatively enjoined under Civil pains, Penalties and Certifications, like other Laws.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then they had been antecedently unto, or conjunctly with the grant of their Liberty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated unto them (which yet was not); yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were not propoſed as terms, by way of Bargain required to be approved and conſented unto, or obſerved as <hi>Irritant conditions</hi> of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, nor promiſe to obſerve them, ſought or given, nor at that time pretended or declared to be Conditions upon which the Indulgence was granted; but were ſimply impoſed upon them <hi>as Laws,</hi> but not conſented unto, nor accepted by them: Who can think the very making and being of ſuch an Act, did juſtly bar them up from making uſe of the liberty granted? or doth now ſo affect it, or the Exerciſe of their Miniſtry by it, as that they are wholly polluted thereby? or, that the bare acceptance of that Liberty, doth neceſſarily and natively involve them in the guilt of that Act, and of all comprehended in it, even albeit they obſerve it not? Will not equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judges think theſe Rules ſo Enacted, were and are only the Law-givers, not the Miniſters ſin, no more than the Law enjoining and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the <hi>Declaration,</hi> or Abjuration of your Covenants, to be taken by all Magiſtrates of Burghs, can be juſtly interpreted to ſix guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one that happeneth to bear that Office, albeit he conform not to that Law? Who will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65758:45"/>
charge ſuch a Magiſtrate as guilty of accepting the Office <hi>cum onere,</hi> with the burden of the legally annexed Declaration? and that his ſeparating between the Office and the Declaration, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible, and but a cheat? or, that his bearing Office in this caſe is an Homologating the Act anent the taking of the Declaration, as ye do charge your Brethrens acceptance of the indulged liberty, in reference to that Act of Rules? Certainly it were no ſmall wrong to ſuch honeſt Magiſtrates, your ſelves being judges, to charge them with that guilt. And is not your Brethrens caſe juſt the ſame? Add hereto, put the caſe the Council emitted an Edict licenſing and allowing Conventicles to be kept in Houſe or Fields (while there is no acceſs to your Churches) adding withall, certain Rules and Reſtrictions of an Eraſtian nature, and ſavouring of the aſſerted Supremacy, in its moſt ſpiritual part; would ye therefore have judged your ſelves obliged to have forborn Conventicling upon that account, or yet to give it over? or, that ye ſinned if ye did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle, meerly becauſe of the Injunction of thoſe Rules, albeit ye obſerved them not? We ſuppoſe not. And is not this a like caſe with your Brethrens, as to the point in hand? pray you then, have not divers weights, and divers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>And yet the more ſtrongly does this defence militate for your Brethren, that theſe reſtrictive and encroaching Impoſitions were not antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto, nay nor concomitant with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, (as is before ſaid) but ſubſequent even
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65758:45"/>
to their entry, and long after, even for ſome years after the firſt Indulgence, and many a Month after the ſecond. And do ye think in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that upon the intimation thereof unto them at that after-time, they ſhould have given over their Miniſtry for that very cauſe? If that were a Relevant reaſon, then were it eaſie for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, when he pleaſed, to lay aſide all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, you as well as them, by making and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſuch kind of Laws and Acts of Rules upon you. Was and is not non-obedience ſufficient to diſcharge them of compliance therewith, as is reckoned in the caſe of other Laws, albeit pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and ſolemnly promulgated? Yea, to this non-obſervance of theſe Inſtructions, remember to add this, that in <hi>July—Anno</hi>— 1673, in face of Council, when thoſe Rules were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated unto many of them, it was declared by them, that they could not obſerve them, but ſhould rather ſubmit to whatſoever penalty or puniſhment, as the written Narrative of their carriage at that time doth atteſt. So that when they were intimated unto them, if ye call them the condition of their Liberty, you ſee that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſabant onus &amp; conditionem repudiabant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which things impartially conſidered, it is hoped whatever evil be in that Act, ye will let it reſt upon the Authors, and not impute it to the Miniſters, being ſo innocent of compliance with it by any Rule of Scripture or right reaſon. Oh then away with theſe hideous out-crys, which are made amongſt the people upon this ſcore, by ſome Trafficking Novices, and their Pragmatical
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65758:46"/>
Followers; who teazle up this Act to the height of all imaginable wickedneſs, and then Applyes it to the Miniſters, to make them odious; dealing herein with them, as the Heathen did with ſome Chriſtians in the Primitive Perſecutions, who firſt clothed them up in Wolves Skins and Bears Skins, and then hunted their Maſtives at them, which did run upon them, as not men, but wild Beaſts of the Wilderneſs, and ſo did tear them into pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Ah ſad! to ſee the like done to honeſt men, by pretending Friends, but herein real Foes, dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them up in ſoul miſ-repreſentations, to egg on peoples envy and wrath againſt them, and all to break and tear their Miniſtry down! Is there any perſecution or grief like to this? Oh that our Heads were Rivers of Tears, to mourn for ſuch unparallel'd Animoſities, which, all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, hath ſcarce ever had its like!</p>
            <p>The Third Objection is, Some alledge this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Preaching with the Magiſtrates permiſſion and allowance, to be a Renouncing their former Commiſſion from Jeſus Chriſt, and their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, and a taking from the Magiſtrate a new Commiſſion, and an holding of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of him, with ſubjection to him, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him, like other Civil Judges of the Land, and Miniſters of State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ah bitter and groundleſs Cenſure! nor could we have believed ſuch an Imputation would have been laid upon the Indulged by any Perſon of a ſpark of Reaſon and Religion, yea or of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, had not our Eyes ſeen, and our Ears heard it. But to the matter we ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65758:46"/>1. Dear Friends, How prove ye this charge? Is confident aſſerting, enough to ground ſuch an heavy Accuſation? If your Brethren have una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares committed ſuch an Abomination, O why do ye not run to them, and plead with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, to ſave them from the Error of their Way? Why have ye not ere now ſeriouſly Remonſtrated this dreadful guilt to themſelves, and not whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered it in corners unto others? Certainly, to deal with them at this rate behind theit backs, to ſpeak or write this of them unto others, Firſt, for a long time by private Suggeſtions and Surmiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, then by Miſſive Letters and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellous Papers; and yet never to have waired a Word or Line upon themſelves, with any reaſon, to evince the Charge: What Spirit ſavoureth this of, and to what good can it tend, even your ſelves being Judges? And till the Charge be proved, is it not a ſufficient anſwer to deny it? But for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vindication and Satisfaction (for we hope it is but a miſtake, there are ſuch hard thoughts taken up of them) we humbly propoſe to you,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Were the Prieſts and Levites in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s days guilty of this Charge, becauſe they had, by the Magiſtrates Authority, acceſs to their ſervice of the Temple, and did make uſe of the ſame? Was their Office altered or innovate, and quite ſpoiled thereby, as if they renounced their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, their Lord, and Head, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſubjected their Function to the Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and took it holden of him, becauſe of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervenient Civil Liberty granted them?

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65758:47"/>
Civil Judges, becauſe of his, not only permitting, but appointing them to go Preach through the Land? And does not your Miniſters hold as little of the Magiſtrate as theſe did?

            <p n="4">4. Diſtinguiſh (as <hi>Apollonius</hi> and other Anti-Eraſtian Divines do) betwixt the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Miniſtry, or the Function it ſelf, and the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> thereof. Your Miniſters, by their Indulgence, has not their Function or Office derived from the Magiſtrate; by it they do not Renounce their old Office, Maſter, and Head, Jeſus Chriſt, nor get any new Office, or Miniſterial Power conferred upon them by the Magiſtrate, prove the contrary if ye can: Yea, the Tenor of the Act of Indulgence will declare it; being a <hi>permitting</hi> them to Preach,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65758:47"/>
not a <hi>giving</hi> them <hi>power</hi> to Preach; and therefore falſe is the Charge above alledged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All that they hold of the Magiſtrate, is only ſomewhat about the exerciſe of their Function; ſomewhat like an Embaſſadors getting a Paſs from another Prince, to paſs through or ſtay in his Territories without Lett or Moleſtation; or to diſcharge his Embaſſy within that Dominion, unto ſome certain Perſons he is ſent unto. Does that Embaſſador, by taking this ſafe Conduct or Leave of the Prince of the Bounds, quit his own proper Maſter, and take Commiſſion-power of that other Prince? No, no. Now as to this ſort of Dependance which Miniſters have upon the Magiſtrate, in the Actual Diſcharge of their Office, for clearing thereof, diſtinguiſh next between the exerciſe of the Miniſtry <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>in it ſelf</hi> conſidered, and the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of that Exerciſe: Or, Diſtinguiſh Subordination into that which is <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and that which is only <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> or in ſome certain reſpects. Now, as by this Indulgence, your Miniſters do not depend upon the Prince <hi>Eſſentially</hi> and <hi>Derivatively,</hi> as to their <hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; ſo neither <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> for the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi> of it (both theſe they have and hold immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately of Chriſt alone) but only and merely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Circumſtance</hi> and Adjunct of the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and <hi>Legal Immunity</hi> of the publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it in ſuch and ſuch places of his Realm: Even as the exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion, being Authorized by Law, dependeth upon him; and as the exerciſe of your Miniſtry within any Family, dependeth upon the Maſter of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65758:48"/>
And your ſelves, in your Papers upon this Subject, acknowledge this kind of Subordination and Dependance (<hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of the publick, free, peaceable, exerciſe of the Miniſtry) to be not unlawful. To this <hi>Apollonius</hi> alſo accordeth, <hi>Part laſt, Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. Neither is it to be thought that this does ſubject the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> but the <hi>Man</hi>; not the Function, but the Perſon, to the Civil Power; except it be (as ſome of your ſelves ſay) <hi>in obliquo,</hi> Indirectly, and Objectively, even as the other matters of God are, being Objects about which his Imperative and Coercive Power is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee that it is only in reſpect of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the exerciſe of their Miniſtry (at moſt) wherein the Indulged depend upon the Magiſtrate, and that that is no abſurdity, nor no ground for your objected Alledgance: being not unlike to this caſe; as if an Embaſſador of another King or State, were ſent to your King, or any part of his People; albeit in his Authority and Embaſſy he depend not upon your King, but allanerly upon his own Maſter; yet is it not in your King's power, and dependeth upon him, whether he will admit him in his Territories to diſcharge that Meſſage? Or, when and where he ſhall have Audience, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Ay, but your Parallel of Civil Judges and their Offices depending on the King, correſponds not adequately unto this, but is of a different nature and wider extent, being otherwiſe ſubordinate unto, and depending upon the Prince, <hi>viz. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and Derivatively</hi> as well as <hi>Objectively</hi>; and conſequently he hath a power over them, which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65758:48"/>
he hath not over Indulged Miniſters, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>ex auctorate</hi> and <hi>diveſt</hi> them of their Office at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as well as to thruſt them from the <hi>exerciſe</hi> thereof within his Dominions; whereas, as he doth not make the Indulged to be Miniſters, ſo neither can he unmake and unminiſter them: All he can take from them is, what he giveth, <hi>viz.</hi> his own Civil Toleration.</p>
            <p>From all which it is apparent, How groundleſs this Objection is; They retaining and exerciſing their very former Miniſtry which they had of Chriſt; and getting no other, no new Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate, no more than your ſelves do, and conſequently are Chriſts Embaſſadors and Sent-ſervants ſtill, even as you are; only they have the peaceableneſs and civil freedom of the publick exerciſe of their Function from the Ruler: A thing they were and are bound to pray for, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2.—<hi>That under him they may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, or by parity of Reaſon, <hi>in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry.</hi> And if this may and ſhould be prayed for, as it is his duty to grant it, ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be their crime to accept it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Objection is, From the Magiſtrates deſign in granting this Indulgence, which deſign ye ſuppoſe to have been evil, and conſequently its fruit evil, and not to be medled with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What is that Project ye ſuſpect? And how is your Alledgance verified and made out? Surely, Liberty to Preach the Goſpel, <hi>in it ſelf</hi> (and <hi>ex conditione operis</hi>) could be of no ill tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, natively. Whatever then may be deemed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65758:49"/>
to have been the <hi>Finis Operantis,</hi> or Siniſter Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Granter, what is that to the thing it ſelf, being ſo good, ſo neceſſary? And the Agents Deſign being altogether extrinſick to it? Doth the Permitters Latent Intention defile the mercy, that it might not be touched? Or, what is it to any that takes the favour, and makes good uſe of it, and concurreth not with the alledged ill Deſign? When <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate gave an univerſal illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Toleration to all Religions, and among the reſt, to all Sects of Chriſtians, on purpoſe that the ſeveral parties among the Chriſtians, being hot in their Differences and Animoſities amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, might by their mutual Digladiations and Conteſts, weaken and wear out one another, and ſo conſume the Chriſtian Religion at laſt with their own hands; did the Orthodox Chriſtians ever ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or ought they to have refuſed, to take their ſhare of that Tolerated Liberty, either becauſe of the Sin of the vaſt extent of it to all Sects, or becauſe of the evil deſign thereof? No, no, but accepted and improved what was their part, not being concerned in the Emperors part (further than to ſympathize with Gods Honour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt wronged by him) but leaving the ſin of his ill deſigns upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>But to be more particular: What ſuppoſe ye the Evil Deſign to be? And why do ye not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince your Brethren of it? And of their Acceſſion to it, if any be? We find ſome talk of three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deſigns: Let us conſider them ſeverally.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some ſay, It was deſigned to be a Wedg of Diviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:65758:49"/>To this we <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1. How could a thing, in it ſelf ſo innocent, have any juſt and native ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to ſuch an end? Doth the permitting or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Liberty to Preach the Goſpel, <hi>intrinſically,</hi> and <hi>ex natura Rei,</hi> level at dividing the Miniſters and Profeſſors of the Goſpel? What a Paradox were it to aſſert that? Any Tendency then if might be ſuppoſed to have hereunto, muſt be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ex Accidenti,</hi> through your Corruptions, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and Diſcontents, which might have been imagined likely to ſtir thereupon; at leaſt, through the weakneſs and proneneſs to miſtake, that ſome of you might be under. And thus the beſt of things may be an occaſion to mens humors and miſtakes to work upon, and ſo become a Ball of Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But ſhould the innocent Object bear the blame of your Corruptions riſing? Moreover, If ye took this to be the Deſign, Why were and are ye ſo unwiſe and unjuſt, as your ſelves to co-operate with that deſign with both your hands, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it on ſo eagerly by Renting and Separation? Why are ye ſo ſubſervient thereunto by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and contention about the Indulgence? Had it not been as well your wiſdom as duty, to have defeated their Deſign by your conſtant <hi>Unity,</hi> (though ye could not be of Unanimity?) Sith then, this Indulged Liberty is not properly a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> but ſimply an <hi>Occaſion</hi> of dividing (as Chriſt our Lord himſelf ſometime was, <hi>John</hi> 9.16.) but the true and proper cauſe is your Corruptions, ſuch as Male-content, Short-ſightedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who can juſtly quarrel at that which in it ſelf is a mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ill uſe Dividers and their ill humors
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65758:50"/>
make of it, more than at the Goſpel, which is oft a Stumbling-ſtone and Rock of Offence, ſet for the falling of many? And who are moſt to be blamed? whether theſe who are <hi>Active</hi> in Dividing upon this occaſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. or, the Indulged, who are more <hi>paſſive,</hi> and an innocent occaſion of the ſame, through their neceſſary uſe-making of the liberty of the exerciſe of their Calling? <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.12. Certainly, the Indulged and Unindulged might well have abode in Unity, notwithſtanding of the difference of their Lots, and various capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Acting in the Goſpel, as well as thoſe that go abroad Conventicling; and thoſe that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſtay at home, may and ſhould remain never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs one in the Lord, and in Chriſtian Love and Peace.</p>
            <p>But to remove the Objection further, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, 2. How does it appear that this was the ſcope of granting the Indulgence? May every man abound in his own Senſe, and faſten that upon it which his roving Fancy leads him to dream to have been the purpoſe of it? <hi>De occultis non judicat Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia</hi>; Secret things belong to the Lord, revealed things only to us; <hi>De non-entibus &amp; non-apparentibus, idem judicum:</hi> Surely, the Ruler profeſſed no ſuch end, as the Act declares; and ſecret ends fall not under our Judgment, nor alters the nature of things. Since then, the <hi>Patent,</hi> not the <hi>Latent</hi> ends of things; their certain and declared Scope, and not our imaginary, fictitious, or conjectural Suſpicions, are the juſt meaſure of Judging and Acting; it is hoped that upon ſerious review of this, ye will ceaſe quarrelling your Brethren
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65758:50"/>
upon this Head. Otherwiſe, if ſtill you make the latent and conjectured ends of Agents, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring-line of the goodneſs of things, as to others uſe-making thereof, what if ſome ſagacious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Miniſters ſhould take up that ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt your ſelves, and tell you they are jealous (not without pregnant preſumptions) of no good ends in ſome of your Preachers and their Preachings, and therefore judgeth it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to hear them, join with them, or any way countenance them therein? Would you think it valid reaſoning? And were ye not but met with your own Ell-wand?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some are bold to <hi>ſay,</hi> The intent of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence was to ſubject the Miniſtry and things of God unto, and bring them all into dependance upon the Civil Magiſtrate; and, therefore not lawful to meddle with that that ſerves for ſuch an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Had this been ſaid of the Outing of you, it might had more colour; the Exerciſe of, and ſubmitting unto the Magiſtrates <hi>privative</hi> power, <hi>circa ſacra,</hi> tending more natively hereunto. But how this can be juſtly alledged of the Exerciſe and acceptance of the benefit of his <hi>Auxiliary</hi> power and act of his Nurſe-Fatherſhip, in indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of that liberty formerly taken from you, we ſee not.</p>
            <p>Again, as <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> it puts Miniſters into ſubjection unto, and dependance upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, not in regard of their Function, nor of the Exerciſe of it ſimply; but only in regard of the free and undiſturbed Exerciſe thereof,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65758:51"/>
(which the Objectors themſelves grant to be not incongruous), ſo neither doth this end <hi>appear</hi> (by any Demonſtrative Evidence) to have been the Project. No mans gueſſing, and Magiſterial Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgances, ſufficeth here for proof. <hi>Non-conſtat's</hi> and <hi>Non-liquet's</hi> may very well be repell'd as <hi>Non-entities,</hi> ſpecially if there are preſumptions to the contrary, as here there are.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Some more colourably <hi>Object,</hi> That the very profeſſed end of this Indulgence (as the Act beareth) is to remedy (or remove) Conventicles, which the Act calls Diſorders. And is not this an evil end? And to accept that Indulgence, is it not to comply with that end?</p>
            <p>For <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this, conſider, (1) That the Act calleth Conventicles Diſorders, only in a <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> ſenſe, or in point of Law, being againſt the ſtanding Laws; not in a <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe, or in point of Conſcience, this is abſtracted from; as the former cannot be denied to be <hi>de facto</hi> true, though the Law forbidding them is not indeed to be juſtified.</p>
            <p>Conſider (2) that this excluding of Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by the Act, ſeems rather the intent of the Confinement, as the Tenor of the Act manifeſts; but the intent of the Indulgence plainly appears to be, to mollifie the confinement. And therefore though the Argument might plead againſt ſtrict obſerving of the confinement, yet no ways againſt the Indulgence.</p>
            <p>Conſider, (3) That ſuppoſe this to have been the intention of the <hi>Granter</hi> of the Indulged Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, yet it cannot be the native tendency of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65758:51"/>
               <hi>thing</hi> granted, ſeeing Liberty of publick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not contrary unto, but may well conſiſt with private Conventicling too, when need and occaſion requireth. <hi>Subordinata non pugnant.</hi> If any aſſert them incompatible and deſtructive the one to the other, either in the ſame perſon, or in divers, do they not injure and reflect upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticling, as well as upon the indulged free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of publick Preaching?</p>
            <p n="4">(4) Giving and not granting, that this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Liberty did exclude Conventicling <hi>pro tanto,</hi> that is, in ſo far as it gets place, (and further it cannot be ſuppoſed to be intended to ſec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ude them than in theſe places who get the benefit of it), what prejudice were this to the Paſtor or people who enjoy it? being no other but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation or exchange of a leſſer good for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? For clearing this, remember that Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling (ſo called) and Indulged Preaching differ, not in ſubſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in mode, accidents, and circumſtances only, <hi>viz.</hi> the one is a publick, peaceable, free, allowed way of Preaching, without hazard of the Law or violence; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a private way; or if publick, lyable to the laſh of the Law, and the violence and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance that may happen thereupon: the one hath the conveniency of a publick Meeting-houſe; the other hampered in a private corner, or expoſed in the fields to the injuries of the weather. The one has acceſs to the legal maintenance; the other is caſt upon peoples benevolence, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome to their private purſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now which of theſe Circumſtances are moſt eligible to enjoy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65758:52"/>
the Goſpel in? Who will ſay then, that there is any wrong done to a Miniſter or people, if in lieu of their hazardous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Conventicling, they get Indulgence of free, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Preaching?</p>
            <p>The fault then here ſeems to be, not that there is an Indulgence inſtead of Conventicling in ſome places, but that the Indulgence is not extended to all perſons and places without exception, that ſo all might enjoy the liberty of publick, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Preaching and Hearing of the Goſpel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moleſtation or hazard, as theſe few do. And thus your ſelves ſay, in your Profeſſions and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to the Magiſtrate for a General Liberty, that that granted, Conventicles would ceaſe a while; meaning in ſo far as they are in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not in ſubordination unto the publick Ordinances, according to the Rule, <hi>Deſiderium boni imperfectioris ceſſat, acquiſito perfectiori.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, when publick liberty is denied, Houſe-Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (rightly gone about) cannot be condemned. But if any take up the conceit, that as theſe Modes of Preaching are in themſelves lawful, and in ſome caſes neceſſary; ſo are they always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yea and perferable to the moſt extended Indulged Liberty: who will not think them under ſome dotage? And indeed, if Conventicling (ſo called) were ſo preferable, much more if it were the only bleſſed way (as ſome talk), then would it follow, that the Magiſtrate had done you no wrong in thruſting you from your publick ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into corners and trouble; nor yet did they you wrong in keeping you there, caſting you thereby upon the neceſſity of ſo Conventicling;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65758:52"/>
nor ſhould he do well to reſtore you and the Church to your former ſtate, becauſe it would infer a wearing out of Conventicles. How unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable then muſt this principle and exception of yours be, judg ye your ſelves!</p>
            <p n="5">(5) Conſider, that howbeit this <hi>Remedying</hi> of Conventicles as <hi>Legal Diſorders,</hi> be put into the Narrative of the Act, and ſuppoſe it were ill, (as indeed we will be far from juſtifying any that condemn thoſe honeſt meetings of the Lords people, which have been ſo much owned of him), yet Miniſters compliance with that part of the Statutary part of the Act, which permits them liberty of Preaching, cannot rationally be judged to involve them in the guilt of what is in the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. Becauſe Narratives of Laws expreſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the grounds and reaſons moving the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to enact ſuch a Law, not the reaſon of the ſubjects. And conſequently, if the <hi>Ratio motiva,</hi> or motive inducing the Legiſlator to ſuch a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute be ſinful, the guilt thereof reſts with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but doth not reflect upon the ſubject; as might be cleared by ſeveral examples. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, otherwiſe it were eaſie for the Magiſtrate to bind you up in Conſcience from all neceſſary Duties of Religion, by commanding or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them upon bad Narratives and ends. Know, that the Law tells us, <hi>Quod continetur in Lemma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te legis, ad Caeſarem, non ad ſubditum proprie ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat.</hi> It ſufficeth then to warrant the ſubject to give obedience, if the Statutary part be lawful as to the <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> enjoining the ſame be competent. Specially if withal they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65758:53"/>
declare and teſtifie their diſallowance of theſe grounds the Magiſtrate goes upon.</p>
            <p n="6">(6) This holds yet more ſtrongly, when the caſe is not of a preceptive, but a permiſſive Law: and the thing permitted, not an indifferent thing, but a neceſſary duty, as in this caſe it is. For example, let us ſuppoſe the Ruler had made an Act, like that of <hi>Darius</hi>'s, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.7. diſcharging all Preaching, (as he did Prayer to God), and the Reſter ſhould grant liberty of all ſort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticling, upon this ground and intent, to wear out and put away all Preaching in a ſetled way, would ye think he that ſhould Preach, were it but in a corner, were guilty of this ſinful Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and end? we ſuppoſe not. Or, if he ſhould diſcharge all Family-prayer, and the Reſter li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe it, upon this Narrative, and with reſpect to this end, that it might ſatisfie people, and exclude all ſeeking after publick Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would it in that caſe be unlawful to perform Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Prayer? Or, would doing the ſame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude you under the guilt of compliance with the Narrative and grounds whereupon the Ruler permits it? we ſuppoſe ye will not ſay it. And why any more ſhould ye aver it in this caſe of the indulged Preaching, which is no leſs a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and commanded duty, than that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Praying, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how little ground there is to ſcruple at the Indulgence, or queſtion the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged upon this ſcore, of a ſuppoſed all deſign in it.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <hi>Objection</hi> is, The narrowneſs of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65758:53"/>
Indulged Liberty, both as to <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>; not all the outed Miniſters being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that favour, nor all <hi>places</hi> made partakers, nor liberty of the whole <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government had; but only a part of Miniſters and people has it vouchſafed on them; and no more of the Government reſtored, but only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationl Seſſions at moſt. And is it not a fault to accept of ſuch a ſtraitned liberty?</p>
            <p>To this we ſay theſe five things: (1) This Objection ſupponeth the Indulgence in its nature not unlawful: elſe, how can the Objectors plead for its inlargement, or complain of its ſtraitned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? for, were it intrinſecally evil, the more ample it were, the worſe it were.</p>
            <p>But (2) know, that its ſtraitnedneſs is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates fault, but the Miniſters affliction only; and ſhould not the Magiſtrates fault reſt with himſelf, and not be imputed to the Miniſters? <hi>Let every man bear his own burden,</hi> Gal. 6.5.</p>
            <p>And (3) as his not granting all he ſhould, did not make it ſimply unlawful to grant a part; ſo who can rationally ſay, that Miniſters might not take, and make uſe of that part, till God ſhould incline him to grant more? Grieved was their ſouls that the liberty was not univerſal, and all perſons and places concerned not, made ſharers, all their own rights not fully reſtored. And their hearts deſire to God, and endeavour with man, was and is to have it extended. They ſit not down upon their priviledg, careleſs of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who were ſecluded and debarred for the time; but ſympathizes and laments their hard

lot, praying for redreſs, even as they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of the Captivity before the reſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not thoſe who were detain'd in <hi>Babylon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1, 2, with 4. But who will ſay, that becauſe in Providence others bonds are not taken off, therefore they ſhould have caſten at the mercy of their liberty? or, that it was their ſin to take hold of it and improve it? no more than it was <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Butlers fault to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his Liberty and Reſtauration, though the Baker and <hi>Joſeph</hi> were left ſtill in priſon behind him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40? Did <hi>Joſeph</hi> quarrel or diſcharge the Butler to accept of his liberty, unleſs all his fellow-priſoners were partakers of the like? no, but only ſays, <hi>When it is well with thee, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſtate this for a Principle, That it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any man to preach the Goſpel, having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, while his neighbour gets not the like liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or, to preach in any one place, becauſe he is not licenſed equally to all places; or, that one place ſhould ſay, I will not be rained upon while other places and fleeces are dry; it ſeemeth to ſavour more of humour than of ſolid and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reaſon. Was it a crime for the Children of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> to come up out of their Captivity to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and build the Temple, offer Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.5.) becauſe their Brethren of the Ten Tribes were not alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return to their land, and concur in the Building? yea, or that part of the <hi>Jews</hi> who came up at firſt with <hi>Zerubabel,</hi> did they ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they returned, while others ſtayed ſtill in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65758:54"/>
               <hi>Babylon,</hi> (perhaps detained, notwithſtanding <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his Proclamation) till afterwards <hi>Eſdra</hi> obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> liberty for himſelf and them? (as <hi>Eſdra</hi> 7.6, 7.) or, if twenty of you were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carcerate for the Goſpel, and in providence the Civil Power were moved to liberate ten of them, ought theſe ten neceſſarily to reject their offered Liberty; or were it their ſin to go forth of Priſon, becauſe their Fellow Priſoners obtain not the like? Or might, and ſhould one Nation refuſe the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Goſpel, becauſe all other Nations has not the like? In a word, <hi>where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion</hi>; and what Divine Precept is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in accepting Liberty to Preach in the Weſt, becauſe <hi>Orkney, Shetland,</hi> and the High-Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not provided for, nor priviledged with the liberty of a Presbyterian Miniſtry? But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Conſider, (4.) That it is not left at Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Option or Choice, to Preach or not (having liberty) as they pleaſe. <hi>A Diſpenſation is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16, 17. <hi>and wo apon them if they preach not,</hi> having an open door from the Lord ſet before them, by the means of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who had ſhut it. It was and is therefore not indifferent unto them, to accept or reject the liberty and open-door of Preaching, as ſeemed beſt to them; but was, and is a neceſſary, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty to take hold of it. Hence it follows, that whatever Neighbourlineſs and Kindlineſs might ſeem to plead for Refuſing, yet ſurely it was and is no breach of Conſcience to accept, nay rather were it not a ſinful, fond Affection, to ſlight ſuch an opportunity of ſerving God in the Goſpel
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65758:55"/>
of his Son? Becauſe, forſooth, ſome Neighbours get not the like liberty, were not this too high a complement of kindneſs to your Neighbour, to prefer the taking an unneceſſary ſhare in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſuffering with them, unto a ſinleſs liberty of neceſſary ſerving of God in the higheſt Sphere of Goſpel-acting? In like manner, (5.) As for taking the liberty of all Chriſts Ordinances, competent to a Congregation, without liberty of Claſſical Presbyteries, Provincial Synods, or General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies? What Scripture or Reaſon pleads againſt this, or proveth the Accepters Sin? Namely, what is withheld; being their Involuntary, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented-unto want. Muſt ye have all, or will ye take nothing? Yea, and count it an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crime to accept of a <hi>Day of ſmall things,</hi> till God incline the hearts of Rulers to condeſcend to further? Had it been unlawful to <hi>Zerubabel,</hi> to have accepted a conſiderable part of the Veſſels of the Temple, if the other part had been kept back? By this ground was not <hi>Eſdra</hi> in a miſtake, when he bleſſed God for a Nail in the Holy Place? <hi>Eſdra</hi> 9. And was not your own Church far out, when in the late Uſurpers time, and afterwards, her liberty of General Aſſemblies was broken; yet kept Synods, Presbyteries, and Seſſions, holding faſt what of her Liberty ſhe could, while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part was infringed? Is <hi>aut Caeſar, aut nihil,</hi> your Principle? We hope ſuch Axioms ye will not own; nor charge the contravention thereof, as a fault upon your Brethren. Were Chriſts Cloaths taken from him, what forbids, but ye might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receive back his Coat to put upon him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65758:55"/>
ye get his Cloak alſo? Remember here, that what part of the Churches Liberties is kept back from your Miniſters, is not diſcharged nor quail by them; nor what they have got accepted in lieu of the whole; but only taken as a part of the Churches right, till more come: Like a Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's receiving part of his Sum, to be doing with, for the time, until he get the reſt. In all this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, are not your Miniſters merely paſſive? And what they receive, is <hi>cumulative,</hi> and but <hi>praejudice,</hi> not <hi>privative</hi> unto what remains to be ſought and granted thereafter, when God giveth occaſion.</p>
            <p>From all theſe Conſiderations, is it not plain, what a groundleſs ſtumbling there is at Miniſters accepting this ſtraitned Liberty, Lame and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as it is? which imperfection of it, ſhould be, and is indeed a <hi>Gravamen,</hi> a grief of heart, and burden to their Spirits; but could be no juſt <hi>Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Conſcientiae,</hi> a thing to have hedged up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from making uſe of it, or that imports a violation of the Law of God, and a Breach upon the Conſcience, if it be made uſe of.</p>
            <p>If any <hi>ſay,</hi> The accepting of this partia<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence precludes from, and ſtands in the way of a more general; and if this had been refuſed, a full Liberty would have been granted e're now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We confeſs theſe are Politicks ſtrongly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by ſome who would ſeem very prying; but founded upon ſo little Reaſon or Religion, yea or common Senſe, that it tranſcends our capacity to comprehend them. What probability or ground of Aſſurance can ye produce for ſuch an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65758:56"/>
By what Almanack do ye Divine this? yea, ſuppoſe ſome weak probables might be adduced for it, yet how can it be thought that ſuch uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, conjectural Politicks, relating unto Future Contingencies, ſhould juſtly have debarred theſe Miniſters from entertaining a preſent, certain Mercy and Duty? But, Dear Friends, Did ye find the firſt Indulgence bar the door upon, and not rather make way for, the ſecond? And if we might take a liberty to foretel, as you do, might it not be ſaid upon no leſs Reaſon, that, had the Second been kindly entertained and well impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the good effects thereof might have induced many to ſeek, and the Magiſtrate to grant, a third, more ample than any of the former: But your carping diſobligeth him, and your reeling makes you contemptible, and thought unworthy of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>If again any <hi>ſay,</hi> How can we be content, when ſome are thus favoured, and get leave to dwell at eaſe under their Vine, while others are hunted and haraſſed? We will never be right, till all be in one condition again, either all out, or all in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> May not people object the ſame againſt one another, to whom Providence carves out va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lots? And what, Shall there be, ſhould there be no peace, until all be of the ſame out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Lot and Condition? O Salamandrin Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox! And what is this elſe but the very foam of envy, like the Patriarchs envying <hi>Joſeph</hi> for their Fathers kindneſs unto him beyond them? or, as if <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould have grudged at the Butler his get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and accepting of Liberty, while himſelf lay
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65758:56"/>
ſtill in priſon, till the Irons entred into his Soul? Or, as if the reſt of the Children of the Captivity ſhould have quarrelled at <hi>Daniel</hi> and his Fellows promotion, while their Brethren ſate by the Banks of <hi>Babel</hi> weeping? <hi>Why ſhould your eye be evil where the Lords Hand is good?</hi> Are ye worſe that it's well, or any whit better with others? Count ye what is granted to your Brethren, detracted from you? and their Liberty, your Miſery? Why grudge ye? <hi>Do ye well to be angry?</hi> might not the ſuffering part of the people grudg and quarrel in like manner, that all their Neighbours are not in Priſon with them? or, that one or more gets out of Priſon, while others are detained? Should there be no peace among you, unleſs all be in the ſame caſe, and have the ſame Lot? Is not this much like the fault of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized and rent the Body of Chriſt, becauſe of their different places and employments in the Church, that all was not Eye, or Ear, or Hand; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9, 10, 11. with 15, 16, 17, 18, 25? And ſhall there be no concord, but a ſtanding mutiny in an Army, becauſe ſome are put up into Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, others in Gariſon, ſome to lye in the Fields, others to range abroad in parties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1. we read, <hi>There was a great perſecution at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem againſt the Church, and all were ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad except the Apoſtles:</hi> And v. 4. <hi>They that were ſcattered abroad, went every where preaching the word.</hi> Here are different Lots, and different em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; ſome perſecuted, ſome ſpared; ſome going abroad to preach at their peril, others ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in a more fixed way, as <hi>James</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:65758:57"/>
and other Brethren did, as is clear by comparing this place with <hi>Acts</hi> 21.18. yet who finds any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among them upon this account? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it is the Magiſtrates fault, not your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns, that ye are not all equal ſharers: Why then do ye let forth your Crab at the Innocent? O look higher than Man in this! Is it not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſpenſation of his Soveraign Providence, who is not countable to us of any of his matters, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.18. and may do with his own what he will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. may ſet up one Star to ſhine, and let another better lye by? Who may ſay to him what doſt thou? Is not this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of dealing to be ſtooped unto and adored, and not to be quarrelled? <hi>Tolle quod tuum eſt, ut vade, Matth.</hi> 20.13, 14. Submiſſion unto, and Improvement of, your own Lot and Caſe, and not to dive much into others, is your bleſſed Duty, <hi>John laſt. v.</hi> 21, 22. But to ſay no more, not a few, and theſe none of the ſimpleſt, do judge, if your fierce Diviſions and brisk Animoſities did not ſo much ſerve the bad Deſigns of ſome, who bear ſway in Affairs (who therefore love to cheriſh them, by fretting you with excluſion from favours, while others get) belike you might ſoon have your deſire of a general liberty. But your contendings are too good a game (for promoting their ends) to let them die out for want of fewel: O then let not this defectiveneſs and lameneſs of the favour, be a bone of Contention any more!</p>
            <p>The Sixth Objection is, the manner of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try unto theſe Charges, wherein they Officiate, not being called by the people (as is alledged)
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65758:57"/>
nor admitted by the Presbytery, as wont to be, and ſo they ſeem not to come in at the door, (in an orderly way) but at the Window, or by a by-way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here indeed, there are ſtrange, but groundleſs, and unjuſt outcryes made againſt them: For evincing whereof, and ſatisfying the miſ-informed, let theſe following Conſiderations be pondered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to the alledged want of the peoples previous Election and Call, we ſay theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What needed theſe Miniſters any new Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Call, who were, by the Indulgence, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their own former Charges?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for theſe who were licenſed unto other parts, we affirm, it is a great miſtake to ſay they came without the call and conſent of the people: For, in the firſt Indulgence, Licenſes paſſed not but upon Addreſs firſt made to the Council for the ſame, by ſome in Name of the Pariſh; and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting them, which after the Licenſe paſſed, was backed by a ſecond and more ample Call, and moſt ſerious Invitation by the Elders, Gentlemen, Maſters of Families, and other ſuch moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable parts of the people, in their own name, and of the reſt of the Pariſh; earneſtly beſeeching theſe Indulged Miniſters to come and labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in the Goſpel, till God ſhould open a door for their return to their former Charges: So that they had the Election of the People dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, both Prior and Poſterior, unto the Councils Licenſe; and always anterior to their own mint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the leaſt, to come to the Charges they were Licenſed unto. Sic like in the ſecond Indulgence,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65758:58"/>
albeitt the Magiſtrate waited not upon Peoples Election, but ſupponing all theſe outed Miniſters men of approved qualifications, (being formerly ordained by Presbytery, and in no leſs eminent charges, than he allocated them unto; and alſo much flocked after by people, when they Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticled:) And thinking his Grant of Licenſe or Act of Toleration, did no more <hi>(ſtricto jure)</hi> depend upon peoples call, than their call doth upon his Toleration; did therefore do his part anteriorly to the Peoples call, (a method indeed, though not ſimply and intrinſecally ſinful, yet full of hazard, and liable to many inconvenients in a conſtitute Church;) yet none of theſe ſo indulged did offer to come to beſtow their labours in theſe Pariſhes, without the Pariſhes call firſt had. Now, what doth it import to the Miniſters, whether the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples call did precede or follow the Prince his Civil Licenſe? Or what reaſon hath any to object, if the people was ſatisfied with the Miniſter Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and did cordially call him? If any think the Prince his Nomination, was a taking upon him the peoples right of Calling, it is a great miſtake; being only a Civil and Legal Licentiating, not an Eccleſiaſtick Calling.</p>
            <p>If ye ſay, It praelimited the people in their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not at all: They were ſtill left to their freedom, as well as when a Presbytery giveth them a Liſt, as often wont to be. Hence ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called others, and obtained the Licenſing of them too, and paſſed by ſuch as the Council did nominate for them, as leſs fit for them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65758:58"/>
if the Prince did in this method prelimit, and incroach upon the peoples freedom; as ye will readily find it an Act of Oppreſſion only, not of Uſurpation; ſo is it his fault alone, but doth not cencern the Miniſter, nor can be any juſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt him whom the People acquieſced in, and cordially called; and hitherto we have heard of none of them repenting of their choice. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Suppoſe the Magiſtrate had nominated and elected ſuch and ſuch Miniſters to ſuch and ſuch places (which yet he did not) in this <hi>broken State</hi> of the Church, we deſire to know what wrong were done thereby, more than when your States and Council did nominate and chuſe the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents for ſuch and ſuch Provinces, as your Church alloweth in her ſhattered caſe, in the <hi>firſt Book of Diſcipline, p.</hi> 37. Sic like, did not all the Miniſters in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before the year 1649. enter by Preſentations from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, without the Election or Call of the People? But was this ever counted a Relevant Objection againſt their Miniſtry, or for ſeparating from them againſt the lawfulneſs of hearing them? Why then are the Indulged mens entry quarrelled as ſinful, and their Miniſtry as defiled, who yet wanted not the peoples full call? Thus ye ſee it is a miſtake, to alledg their want of a due and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid call: And for the quibbles about the method of it, how weak a ground are they to caſt at them, and plead for Separation from them, for the ſame; ſith they militate only againſt the Magiſtrates pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitant or prepoſterous proceeding (if ſo you judg it) but makes nothing againſt the Miniſters; it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65758:59"/>
being all one to them (as to the validity of their Call) whether the Peoples Election was antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or ſubſequent to the Rulers Licenſe: See <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſ. Caſ. Conſc. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. <hi>Th.</hi> 29. Yea, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines tell us, that peoples conſent ſubſequent to a Miniſters entry (though it abſolve him not of diſorderlineſs, yet) doth <hi>ratifie</hi> and make good his right to labour among them as their Paſtor; even as <hi>Leah</hi> (unjuſtly obtruded upon <hi>Jacob</hi>) did by his conſequent conſent become his Wife; and might no more after that be repudiate, than his beloved <hi>Rachel,</hi> whom he choiſed before he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her.</p>
            <p>But here, ſome as we underſtand, <hi>Object,</hi> How can Miniſters having another people, to whom they have a prior ſtanding relation, be counted, though elected and called, the Paſtors of theſe people, to whom they are indulged? Can a man have two charges at once? To this we <hi>anſwer,</hi> (1) That they may very well be called, counted, and ſubmitted unto by the indulged people, as their own Miniſters, juſt as your honeſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Mr. <hi>Robert Blair,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Livingston,</hi> and others, became Paſtors of Churches in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> notwithſtanding their relation to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer charges in <hi>Ireland,</hi> from which they were driven away by the violence of the time. And as famous Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> did take charge of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in <hi>France,</hi> being baniſhed <hi>Scotland.</hi> And as we ſuppoſe your baniſhed Brethren in <hi>Holland</hi> would not ſcruple to take charges there, if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence offered the ſame, even as others of your number has accepted of Charges in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65758:59"/>
that without the conſent of your Church in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and alſo without your quarreling at them. We wonder why ye impugn thoſe indulged men ſo briskly, when others of the ſame practice as to this are allowed. Shall it be counted vice in the one, which is counted virtue in the other?</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Not to debate, if when by violence of a time, a Miniſter is incapacitate to exerciſe his Miniſtry among his people, (as your Miniſters were <hi>by Law,</hi> and that backed with <hi>force</hi>), and ſo it became morally impoſſible to diſcharge his Office unto them; whether in that caſe he be <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliter mortuus,</hi> dead in Law unto them, and his Miniſterial tye and relation, <hi>Divino nutu</hi> looſed, or Providentially broken and diſſolved, as <hi>Ameſ.</hi> aſſerts in his <hi>Caſ. conſc. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. §. 35. We are made to underſtand that ſome of theſe who impugn their Brethren moſt hotly, are of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and therefore count not themſelves obliged to look after their old Charges, more than after any other. Whereupon we wonder at their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Brethren men of Pluralities of Charges, whilſt themſelves take the whole Church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal for their charge, at leaſt all the Pariſhes in <hi>Scotland</hi> indefinitely, <hi>&amp; aequo jure.</hi> But let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the relation to ſtand undiſſolved <hi>quo ad ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum,</hi> or <hi>jus ad rem</hi>; yet ſeeing there is a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeas</hi> put, by the times to the <hi>actual exerciſe</hi> of it, what hinders but they may and ſhould law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beſtow their labours in any other part of the Lords Vineyard, being called thereunto, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Providence open a door of regreſs to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Charge? In which caſe, though they be not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65758:60"/>
               <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> and abſolutely the fixed, ſtated Paſtors of theſe people, yet are they conditionally, and for that <hi>interim</hi>; and not like meer itinerant and occaſional Preachers. Their call determineth them unto, and ſtateth their relation to theſe people, until occaſion of regreſs. Nor is it abſurd for them to have relation to two different flocks at the ſame time in a <hi>different manner,</hi> viz. to the one <hi>habi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> as to the plea of their not being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theſe places by the Presbytery, as wont to be. For taking off this, know (1) that they being Miniſters already, needed no new Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Miſſion. As for that ſolemnity of admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uſed formerly in Tranſportations, what is it as to the ſtating the man Paſtor of that people, but a publick ſolemn Declaration of the peoples conſent and ſubjection unto him? and a ſolemn Introduction of him into his work? and was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially had by the indulged in the peoples expreſs and full calling of them, and practical ſubjection to their Miniſtry:<note place="margin">Which they did exhibit, not only <hi>de futuro,</hi> as when they call an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant; but <hi>de preſenti.</hi>
               </note> That ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity therefore of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (ſo called) being at moſt, and in beſt times, not <hi>neceſſary ad eſſe,</hi> but only <hi>expedient ad bene eſſe,</hi> that is to ſay, not eſſential and abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but only for ſolemnity and conveniency of ſtating the relation, (as learned <hi>Voetius</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his <hi>Deſperata cauſa Papatus,</hi> pag. 263.)
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65758:60"/>
What hinders but it may be wanted without any detriment to the relation? like marriage conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate without ſome of the Rites and Solemnities, ordinary, and fit when they may be had. Can any with reaſon ſay, that Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by actual Ordained Miniſters, invited and earneſtly called thereto by people, dependeth ſo abſolutely and eſſentially upon that punctilio of order; and Subſtance is ſuch an underling to Form, that if this be not (nor poſſible to be had) that ſhould not, may not be in no caſe, no not of much extremity, and urgent neceſſity, as this was? Sure what Divines ſay of Baptiſm, may be applied here, <hi>Non privatio, ſed contemptus damnat,</hi> ſo not the bare want, but the neglect of Admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a fault and marring defect, being only a point of order, which in ſuch a broken time could not be had. And therefore the want of it dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates nothing from the validity of their intereſt in that people, nor from the lawfulneſs of their labouring among them. And to object it againſt them, ſeems to favour more of prejudice than of any real ſcruple.</p>
            <p>But (2) remember this was a <hi>broken ſtate</hi> of the Church wherein ordinary Formalities and Solemnities (fit to be obſerved in a <hi>conſtituted</hi> Church) could not be obtained; for, ſeeing there were no Presbyteries in being, who can juſtly quarrel theſe Miniſters for want of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſolemn concurrence? Namely, if Brethrens conſent and approbation was generally had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly (as far as there was acceſs to acquaint them with the matter in the ſcattered condition
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65758:61"/>
they were in) either formally and expreſly, or tacitely and in ſome equivalent way. What more could have been done in ſuch an extraordinary caſe? and the extraordinarineſs of the caſe, did it not ſufficiently diſpenſe with, and excuſe the want of that uſual point of Order? which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this caſe is no irregularity and diſorder, <hi>privative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3) It meriteth Conſideration, that the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged did not come unto theſe Pariſhes like tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Miniſters, to fix with them without an eye of return to their former Charges; but only for an <hi>interim,</hi> till acceſs to their old flocks be granted; and conſequently there was no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Solemnities uſual in the admiſſion of tranſported men.</p>
            <p>From all this is it not plain, that their manner of entry is not ſo culpable as it is by ſome repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be? and we hope theſe probationers and others who come and Conventicle within the Indulged mens bounds, or in other places, not only without, but perhaps againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or due call of the Miniſters or Elders, and people of theſe bounds, let be without any Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries Miſſion, as wont regularly to be, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Acts of your General Aſſemblies, will not think it fair and juſt to make uſe of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, leſt it fall heavier upon themſelves. Shall it be a right door for the one to enter in at, which is reckoned wrong in the other? or contrary?</p>
            <p>The Seventh <hi>Objection</hi> is, The want of a full and free Teſtimony (as is alledged) againſt the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65758:61"/>
Incroachments and Uſurpations made upon the Churches Rights, and Chriſts Prerogative, in and by this Indulgence, and otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> (1) Sith the Indulgence as accepted by the Brethren, is free of all Eraſtianiſm, or Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logation of the Supremacy, as is already clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; what are theſe Incroachments where anent the Indulged were concerned to bear witneſs more, than the reſt of you? why then ſingle ye them out, and make them the Butt of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection?</p>
            <p n="2">(2) We are informed, that at the firſt Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſufficient was ſaid by one of their number, in name of himſelf and the reſt, before the Kings Council, to clear that they hold their Miniſtry only of Chriſt, and did not at all allow of, or comply with any jot of Eraſtianiſm. And further, that all of them, both of the firſt and ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence (the moſt part having no immediate acceſs to declare before the Magiſtrate) did at their entry to their ſeveral Charges, publickly declare to their people to the ſame purpoſe. As alſo, that divers of them being convented before the Council in <hi>June—Anno</hi>— 1673, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their ſenſe of that Act of Rules then inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to them, to the ſatisfaction of all ſober and unprejudiced perſons, as the Narrative of their carriage at that time at more length bears. Though it be true, we grant, enough was not ſaid to ſtop the mouths of all Cavillers, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſatisfie, except it had amounted to have produced the effect of Impriſonment, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell one of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet ſure it was more than
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65758:62"/>
any others of you did, when ye were Convented before the Council for not repairing to the places of your Confinement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Does it not then ſavour of prejudice and partiality to accuſe only the Licenſed Brethren as deficient in a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, when no others had done ſo much, let be out-ſtripped them, except it be in a corner among ſome vulgar people?</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is credibly informed, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged upon all competent occaſions, teſtifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the iniquities of the times in their Sermons, as well as others do; (though not indiſcreetly to irritate, rather than edifie); and particularly, they have not been wanting to teſtifie againſt all things contrary to Chriſts Prerogative of being the alone King and Head of his Church; as their conſtant Hearers can witneſs. Whence it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent they are not ſo ſinfully ſilent (as ſome alledg) though they make it not their ordinary Theme as ſome others do. Neither are they involved in any Interpretative compliance, or ſymbolizing with the evils under conſideration, ſo far as a juſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony can exonerate them thereof. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are not wanting to give <hi>Practical Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> for God againſt the evils of the time, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing all practical conforming thereunto, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance therewith; and is not this more than much <hi>Verbal</hi> Teſtimony?</p>
            <p>Yet (3) becauſe many do force miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon their accepted liberty, and have been ready to take offence that ſo little has been ſaid or done by way of Teſtimony againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the time, it could have been
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65758:62"/>
wiſhed, that (beſides your Nonconformity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and ſuffering upon that ſcore which the ſober cannot but think a real, material, great, practical Teſtimony of far more importance and ſignificancy than much verbal; as is plain from <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.12, 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.17, 18.) We wiſh there had alſo been, or yet were, a formal, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, expreſs Teſtimony, in ample and diſcreet form, agreed upon, and publiſhed by both the indulged and unindulged Miniſters and people jointly, being jointly concerned therein as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of common intereſt, that the world might ſee plainly your mind and harmony in this. And this ye know the Indulged were never refractory unto, more than others; yea, was forward for it; but ye know by whom it was obſtructed, and who did draw back and decline to concur with them, and ſo by deſerting them, diſcouraged them from proceeding in ſo choice a duty. But albeit this general concurrence in a full Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſeems neceſſary for ſundry grave Reaſons, namely for the benefit of poſterity and after-ages; yet ſeeing nothing of this kind is done, yea coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome ſcarce practicable in the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ye are in, let all of you join in lamenting the defect; and ſeeing the unindulged are no leſs ſhort in giving the Magiſtrate a true information and juſt repreſentation of the ſinfulneſs of theſe matters, and have ſtood as little up to witneſs and plead for God before the Ruler as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, let both the one ſort and the other, lay their hand on their mouth, and confeſs fainting and failing, and pity and pray for one another.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65758:63"/>
But none to upbraid it to another. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, be it ſuppoſed, the Indulgent were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in this point of duty, even beyond others, yet what were that but their perſonal failing, but nothing juſtly to reflect upon their liberty, nor to caſt at their Miniſtry, unleſs ye make every perſonal failing of that conſequence; which were a wild and dangerous principle?</p>
            <p>The Eighth <hi>Objection</hi> is taken from their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their Confinement (as is alledged), yea, their ſetling at all in a fixed Miniſtry, and not rather continuing looſe of all particular charge to ſerve the Church in an indefinite itinerant way, as others do in this time of her need.</p>
            <p>As to the matter of their Confinement, we ſay, (1) The Act of Confinement, being not of a Spiritual, but of a Civil nature, like Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however unjuſt it be, yet we hope ye will not call it Eraſtianiſm, nor Spiritual Supremacy in the Magiſtrate to impoſe it; nor an Homolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that Supremacy, if Miniſters ſubmit to it; it being in its kind not <hi>extra f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rum civile,</hi> or illegal and incompetent; no more nor other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil puniſhments and preſſures unjuſtly inflicted upon, and ſubmitted unto by the Godly in all Generations. And ſurely, to confine one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Miniſter, or the whole party, is all of one kind, differing only in <hi>magis &amp; minus,</hi> which varieth not the kind, whatever <hi>Incommoda</hi> or ill conſequents follow upon the one more than on the other, that alſo makes no Intrinſecal differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:65758:63"/>(2) We would fain know why ye quarrel your Brethrens ſubmitting unto, and obſerving of their confinement (though exerciſing their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in the place, to the edification and ſervice of this poor Church not a little), more than ye quarrel others ſubmitting unto, and obſerving inviolably their Baniſhment from their former Charge, yea and others their Baniſhment from <hi>Scotland,</hi> by which means this Church is wholly deprived of their ſervice?</p>
            <p n="3">(3) We hope, ye will not ſay, that it is ſimply and abſolutely unlawful to ſubmit, even to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt confinement, or to obſerve it for any time; for that were both againſt Scripture and Reaſon, and to condemn the Generation of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who have ſubmitted to the like, yea to more hard and prejudicial ſufferings. Did not <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle ſubmit to his Confinement unto <hi>Patmos? Rev.</hi> 1. and <hi>Paul</hi> to his at <hi>Rome,</hi> Act. 28. Did not your worthy Mr. <hi>R. Bruce</hi> ſubmit to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement unto <hi>Innerneſs</hi>? Others alſo to theirs, in <hi>Kintyre, Boot, Arran, &amp;c?</hi> and Mr. <hi>D. Dickson,</hi> to his at <hi>Toraff?</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> to his at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?</hi> when yet their Miniſtry was no leſs need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed elſe-where, yea much more than your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns is now. And if any Confinement or other prejudice redound to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint laid upon their <hi>perſons,</hi> they being paſſive therein, and only the Magiſtrate active, what guilt lyes at their door, more than if they were impriſoned? are not ſufferers to be held inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent? Is not Confinement (upon their part) a ſad piece of ſuffering? and ſhall they be counted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65758:64"/>
ſinners for ſuffering? Look on it then henceforth as their affliction, not their ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) Whatever ſinfulneſs might be alledged in ſubmitting unto this ſentence of Confinement <hi>in an abſolute way,</hi> as being obſtructive to ſeveral neceſſary duties that lye upon them, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be followed with a <hi>peremptory</hi> obſervation of Confinement; yet what doth that ſay againſt a <hi>limited</hi> obſervation thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſo far as may be conſiſtent with neceſſary Duties to the Church and Goſpel, and in as far as they are not called by any duty to break it? what fault is it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, while it doth not compet with any duty? that is, while no duty occurs which cannot be gone about without tranſgreſſing it? And who of all the indulged did ever ſubmit further unto it? being ready to diſobſerve it, when ever duty otherwiſe called them ſo to do. Only they love not to trample upon the Magiſtrates Authority, to tranſgreſs without juſt cauſe his hardeſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. Yet ſo far only, and no further, do they regard ſuch ſentences, as that when the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God interpoſes, diſobliging them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, they ſcruple not to ſay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Better obey God than man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5) Seeing the Confinement is a Civil ſentence, though mollified with a liberty of Preaching, queſtionleſs the transferring that Confinement to another place with the ſame liberty, is of the ſame very nature; and no pure exerciſe of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power and Government; whence it is evident that it is a great miſtake to ſay, it is a planting and tranſplanting of Miniſters Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65758:64"/>
but a meer civil and local mutation of their Perſonal abode, which only conſequently draws along with it the Exerciſe of their Miniſtry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever their perſons go; even as if they were tranſlated from one Priſon to another. And who but <hi>Papiſts</hi> will ſay, but Miniſters bodies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are under the Magiſtrates Juriſdiction as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens? and that it is no Eraſtianiſm at all to diſpoſe of them?</p>
            <p n="6">(6) What reaſon is there to ſay this Cantoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of thoſe places and Miniſters, and confining of the Goſpel, is their ſin? for, albeit it be the Magiſtrates fault to ſhut them up thus into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet who can juſtly lay it to Miniſters charge being ſufferers therein? and albeit they be put under chains and fetters of Corporal confinement, as <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Patmos,</hi> yet the word of God is not bound, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. but may have, and has free courſe, notwithſtanding people not being debarred from coming to them, though they like <hi>Jeremiah</hi> be ſhut up (as it were) in the Court of the Priſon that they cannot go far abroad among people, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 28.30, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know, that Miniſters (as above ſaid) ſubmit no further to their Confinement than may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the duties of their calling; ſo that when God calls them to go viſit or Preach to other parts, in that caſe they obſerve it not, nor ſtick to tranſgreſs it, God calling them thereto, as he did <hi>Peter</hi> to go forth out of Priſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.19, 20. when yet <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> having the ſame open doors, but not the ſame call to go forth, lay ſtill till Authority put them forth, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 26, 28, 37.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65758:65"/>
As to all this, that it ſeems a ſtrange conceit, to ſay the Goſpel is quite confined and ſhut up where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the perſons of ſo many Miniſters are confined; as if there were no Goſpel to be had in the Land, but from them; no not from the hand of the reſt of Non-Conform Miniſters not comprehended in this confinement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> As to their fixing, and that in this caſe, when there is ſuch paucity of honeſt Miniſters, and the neceſſity of the Church is great, calling for mens labours to be extended throughout all the Land; obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Objection militates nothing againſt the uſe-making of the Indulged Liberty, in the general, but only againſt the containing the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Miniſtry within theſe Pariſhes; an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection common againſt all fixed Miniſters, what way ſoever they enjoy it: And therefore it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that the Indulged only ſhould be preſſed with it, and all the out-cry made upon them; when they are not alone in the fault, if a fault it be. How many of the outed Miniſters lye by in corners, leſs extenſive in their uſefulneſs to the Church, than the Indulged? And yet the edge of the Objection is whetted only againſt the Licenſed Brethren: what this ſavoureth of, we leave to your ſelves to judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We demand, What is this great neceſſity, ſo much decantated and objected againſt the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged's Fixing? What, are ther<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not enow of hands beſides to overtake that work, were they all put to it, and regularly diſpoſed of? Sure, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Objectors, however they make clamour of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65758:65"/>
neceſſity of deſolate and indigent parts, to caſt <hi>odium</hi> upon fixed Miniſters, yet ſeem they to be able enough of themſelves alone for that work; yea and to ſpare now and then a viſit alſo to Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mens bounds, or near their Confines, whither their People may reſort. What neceſſity is there of this? And why do not theſe Objectors go and labour in a more permanent way, in theſe needy places, and not be ſo oft where there is ſo little need?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the Harveſt be great, and Labourers few; Chriſts Direction is, Pray the Lord of the Harveſt to raiſe up, and thruſt out Labourers into his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. But where doth he adviſe, that till all the Vineyard be cultivated and dreſſed equally well in all its parts, at leaſt provided with Labourers, none ſhould fix to a particular Station or Charge? Do we not know, that in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times there were no leſs neceſſities of the People, and paucity of Miniſters; the Church then being but in her Infancy, and much of the Countrey Pagan? Yet did they not ſettle Paſtors in every Church and every City, as they could have acceſs? As in <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. And in the times of your firſt Reformation, was it not your Church her care (though her need was ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold more than now) to ſettle and fix a Miniſtry, by degrees, as it could be attained? Settling, and not unſettling, being ever accounted the great<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> perfection of the Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider, That the Indulged, as upon the one hand, they look upon themſelves not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>actually</hi> univerſal Miniſters of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65758:66"/>
Univerſal Church (though Miniſters of the Church Univerſal, <hi>habitu &amp; actu primo</hi>;) neither as <hi>Paſtors at large,</hi> in the Prelatick way, to take a whole Province for their Charge and Diocy, as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates do; but for ordinary, and ſtatedly, they are Watchmen, to ſtand at a particular Poſt; or like Shepherds, to feed a particular flock, of which the Holy Ghoſt hath made them Overſeers, (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.) And conſequently, that the charge of all the Churches doth not lye equally upon them; Paſtors being, by Office, fixed Stars: And it being proper to the great Luminaries, Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Evangeliſts, to have no definite Sphere to move in; ſo upon the other hand, they do not fix in their Charges in the <hi>Independent</hi> way, as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily tyed and limited to that particular People; but they fix in the good old <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way, <hi>viz.</hi> ordinarily, and in a ſtated way, to labour in a particular charge; yet ſo as they may, and will, upon a ſufficient occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and call, go and Preach any where for a time, for the Church's good. And who can look upon this qualified and ſcriptural fixing, as a fault?</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Indulged (we judg) do exceedingly compaſſionate the need of other places, ſo dark and deſolate; and are willing to concur to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Goſpel in theſe places, ſo far as may be competent unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14, 15. But they may perhaps humbly deſire to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe few things, which ſeem to plead excuſe for their not going ſo much abroad, as ſome would have them, who complain of their not doing as others do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:65758:66"/>Firſt, Until all the Miniſters out of charge (who have no other work to do) be put to it, to ſupply needy places in a way of watering, at leaſt; and that done, it be apparent, that the work of the Goſpel cannot otherwiſe be carried on, unleſs the Indulged relinquiſh their preſent Station, and go forth and Travel in an Evangeliſtical way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it: They think the need of them not ſo very great.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It would be conſidered, they are not idle where they are, they are at work in the Lords Vineyard in this Land; (not wholly uſeleſs to this needy Church, as ſome worthy Brethren in exile are) yea and in a peculiar ſort, tyed to labour in theſe places before others; and theſe places needing and deſiring all they can do and more, How then can it be any other, than to Rob <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul</hi>; to put them from their preſent nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy people (who think they cannot, without loſs and prejudice, want them almoſt a day) to go and travel among others? And would it not give Miniſters juſt ground of complaining in the words of the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6. <hi>My mothers children were angry with me, and made me keeper of the Vineyards, but mine own Vineyard have I not kept.</hi> Look what advantage ye think their going abroad would do to other places; would it not damnifie their own people as much? And ſhould they rob their own, to ſupply others?</p>
            <p>Add to this, Thirdly, That the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſtand in ſuch Circumſtances, that if they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, were it but to go for a time, to labour among other people, contrary to the Rulers leave;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65758:67"/>
ye know what inevitable hazard they are in, not only of perſonal prejudice, as others are, but of loſs of that publick peaceable exerciſe of their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> they now enjoy: A priviledge, which all the good may be done by their excurſions to preach here and there, will not countervail the damage of loſing it; ſpecially, ſith many of the Indulged, were they deprived of their Liberty, and laid by, would be certainly rendred uſeleſs and unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Church, at leaſt much leſs capable; being unable to traverſe up and down, and preach in the Fields, as others do. And what advantage will redound to the Church, by hudling them up again in a corner, who now are ſteadable in their publick Station to whole Country-ſides about them, who reſort to hear them, though they go not forth unto them? Since therefore it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, if it be <hi>in majus bonum Eccleſiae,</hi> for the greater good, and not rather for the greater detriment, of the Church, to adventure upon that which inevitably draweth the ruin of their preſent liberty along with it; who can blame them not to be raſh therein? Namely, conſidering, that if <hi>Hazard</hi> be a ſufficient argument to excuſe the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Miniſters their not returning to the work, and others their lurking when looked after by the Magiſtrate; certainly it cannot but plead as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more, for excuſing the Indulged for not going to preach otherwhere; their hazard being more than any's, <hi>viz.</hi> not only Perſonal, but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial. And further, the people over whom they now are, being particularly intereſſed in them, it ſeems they are not <hi>ſui juris, i. e.</hi> not free to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65758:67"/>
of themſelves to preach where they may (upon all perils, as other Miniſters are) without their Flocks conſent, to whom they owe all they can do, as Miniſters; and whom they may not adventure to rob of their Miniſtry, by expoſing themſelves to the danger of that itinerant preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without their leave: Till therefore their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples conſent be had, pardon them to be ſhy of this matter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Since this general way of Preaching, which ſome would put them unto, if practiſed by them, would doubtleſly infer the forfaultry and loſs of their preſent Liberty; and they may Preach their Valedictory to their preſent Charge that day they go forth to the new: We would fain know <hi>who</hi> ſhall <hi>put</hi> them to run this Risk? And <hi>who</hi> ſhall direct them <hi>where</hi> to go unto? or for <hi>how long?</hi> We think ye will not ſay, they ſhould run at random uncalled or unſent. Sure, they need ſuch a Relevant Call and Miſſion as may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them to hazard their preſent freedom, and may quiet their Conſcience in caſe of ſuffering the loſs of it, beſides perſonal ſufferings, which may by and attour happen them. Now, what is the call or miſſion they have to that work? Will ye ſay they ſhould go <hi>proprio motu,</hi> of their own heads? What a door might that open to Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? And will that ſatisfie their Conſcience, when it is ſaid to them, as to <hi>Elijah, What doſt thou here?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ye ſay, they ſhould go to ſatisfie their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who grudgeth at their tarrying at home, and be diſpoſed of, and ordered by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:65758:68"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who made theſe Rulers over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? And were not this to ſet them up as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Dictators to their Brethren? And to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute their Miniſtry to gratifie the humors of men, even to ſacrifice it to their diſcontents? Wherein what peace or anſwer of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they would have, namely, if ſuffering come, we ſee not.</p>
            <p>All which Premiſes being ſeriouſly weighed in the Ballance of Chriſtian Sobriety, who can juſtly wonder that they ſtick ſo cloſely by their preſent Stations? Neither need this difference of practiſe make any Diviſion, no more than the different employments of Soldiers in an Army, allows them to mutiny; ſome being allocate to ſtay in Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſome to lie in the Fields, others to ſcout forth here and there, as the Prince pleaſes to order. As the Indulged wiſhes a bleſſing upon the Labours of their honeſt Brethren, who viſit needy places; ſo it were fit thoſe, who, in providence, are looſe of all particular charge, would be doing at that general, indefinite, itinerant way of Preaching, unto theſe needy parts, till God otherwiſe provide; and not grudge at their Brethren, who are not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle at home, though they be not free to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with them. And, leaſt of all, ſhould peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make it an exception againſt hearing them; to ſay I will not, ſhould not, hear ſuch a man Preach within his Pariſh, becauſe I get him not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo abroad elſewhere to hear, How ridiculous were that!</p>
            <p>If it be <hi>ſaid,</hi> Then what ſhall be done to ſupply the needy parts of the Land?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:65758:68"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If there be not enow of hands among the Unindulged (who ſeems lyes neareſt that work, wanting other work) then let an orderly way be taken, by common conſent, to provide for that; and it is not (we judg) to be doubted, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged will ſubmit unto whatever ſhall, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon counſel and conſent, be determined and laid upon them, as competent unto them, and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with their preſent Miniſtry; yea and albeit it tend to undo their preſent Liberty, if it be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Judicatory more for the good of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; they are willing to be Ruled by the common advice and determination of Brethren. But to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge and caſt themſelves looſe upon no other war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, than to pleaſe ſome male-contented Spirits, will ye not think it very pardonable in them to forbear it? Specially, while all others not in their condition, are not put to work; who ſeem to be more nearly concerned in that itinerant way of Miniſtry, having no acceſs unto a ſettled Miniſtry, as your Brethren have.</p>
            <p>If ye <hi>ſay,</hi> Peoples Neceſſity is Call enough to determine Miniſters to go and Preach to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Then muſt ye go to the <hi>Indies</hi> rather than ſtay in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and to the <hi>Highlands,</hi> rather than <hi>Lowlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe the neceſſity there is greater, yea and acceſs alſo, if ye will but try it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neceſſity alone is only Relevant to determine idle men, or Freemen, that are at their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal; ſuch as the Indulged are not, being tyed to particular charges, as others are not. Should they commit Injuſtice, in robbing other Churches
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65758:69"/>
of their Labours, (whoſe debtors they are in a ſpecial way) to the intent they may charitably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the neceſſities of others? Ought not Juſtice to preponderate to works of <hi>Charity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Ninthly and Laſtly, It is <hi>Objected,</hi> That this Indulged Liberty is, and could not but be, of direful conſequence and effects; and the Indulged in accepting it, have done more ill than all the Biſhops and Curates in <hi>Scotland:</hi> What an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, unhallowed Hemlock muſt it then be? Not a plant of Gods planting?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Pitiful it is, what a deal of <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry</hi> is here ſet againſt honeſt men by virulent paſſion! We are aſtoniſhed at ſuch rage and raving! why, what are theſe bad effects the acceptance of their liberty doth natively produce? Ye <hi>ſay,</hi> more ill have they done thereby to the Church, than all the Prelates and their Party. Were this true, why then has the Prelates and their Friends ſuch an antipathy againſt it? Do not all know it was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over their Bellies, and ſore againſt their Mind? It is their eye-ſore as it is yours; and to this day never did they like it, except in ſo far as ye made it an Apple of Contention among your ſelves, and thereby diverted your edge of them. Did not many of them ſay, it was the high way to break, undermine, and wear out their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Thinking that as <hi>Dagon</hi> could not ſtand before the Ark, neither Prelacy beſide any little of Presbytery, without loſing ground daily? Did they not exclaim againſt it as a reviving, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating, and rivetting the Presbyterian Intereſt, which they thought had been quite broken and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65758:69"/>
bvried? Sure they have other thoughts of it, than you.</p>
            <p>Again, What one point of the received Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> has your Brethren, by their Indulgence receded from? whilſt the Prelatick party have overturned the whole Fabrick of her Government, and bears down all that joyn not iſſues with them therein? Does your Brethren per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you as they do? do they not rather plead for you, excuſe your extravagancies; protect and ſhelter and feed you, ſo far as they can? Or is the pure and free Preaching of the Goſpel by them, any harm to the Church? Is the reſtoring of ſo much of an honeſt Miniſtry to the free exerciſe of their Miniſtry, a Nail of the Lords Intereſt, in the Holy Place, ſuch an intollerable evil? The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates indeed count it no ſmall evil, and are you and they in ſo far agreed? But while ye charge them ſo heavily, what if they ſhould retort and tell you, that as Hereticks deſtroy the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia Doctrinae</hi>; ſo do Schiſmaticks and Dividers, <hi>Fundamentalia Eccleſiae,</hi> by diſſolving the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Chriſts Myſtical Body into ſo many fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that a Mutiny in an Army is no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, than Treachery; and cutting and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mans body, may be no leſs fatal to his life, than ſtripping him of his Cloaths and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea or ſome grains of poiſon.</p>
            <p>But becauſe <hi>Dolus verſatur in Generalibus,</hi> we pray you condeſcend upon the evils particularly, which their acceptance of this Liberty hath done: And becauſe <hi>Si accuſaſſe ſatis eſſet, quis erit innocens,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:65758:70"/>
we pray you prove what ye aſſert and alledge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. If ye ſtrike upon the old ſtring of their ſetting up Eraſtianiſm, homologating the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is refuted, and they vindicated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from already. But there are three Inſtances fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we hear ſomewhat of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Say</hi> ye, By this means the reſt of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are expoſed to ſuffering, who are not free to accept that liberty, or are ſecluded from it; did all ſtick together, it might be more ſafe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is ſtrange Policy, inſtead of ſound Divinity: What trouble cometh on any for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or not getting a ſhare in the Liberty? On this ſcore who are put to ſuffering? What acceſſion then hath Brethrens acceptance, to the trouble of the Refuſers? If trouble befal them upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, what is that to the Indulgence? Or, would the Indulged, their refuſal of their Liberty, leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Magiſtrates offence, and protected all the reſt from ſuffering? or rather irritated him more, and drawn on ſuffering on themſelves with others? Who will ſay, thoſe of the Children of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, who returned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when Liberty was granted, did expoſe the reſt who ſtayed ſtill, or were detained in <hi>Babylon,</hi> to further bondage and ſuffering? Will ye not be pleaſed if ſuffering befal you, unleſs all drink of that ſame Cup; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in Providence they be not called unto it? Muſt your Brethren tarry and take part with you, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for company-ſake, and let the Lords work, to which they have a call and free acceſs, ſtand? and refuſe a lawful Liberty of a neceſſary duty, only becauſe others are not pleaſed, or not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers?
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65758:70"/>
But, as we think they wrong the Indulged who look upon them as altogether free of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeing their very Liberty is annexed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement; ſo we bleſs God to ſee the Generality of other Miniſters as yet meeting with ſo eaſie a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and ſome of thoſe that make the greateſt noiſe of complaint, enjoying their own accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations (God ſo providing) every way compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if not preferable, to theſe ſo much magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, falling to the ſhare of the Indulged. But in fine, while ye ſpeak of their expoſing you to the Magiſtrates diſpleaſure by their acceptance of the favour, think how ye can clear your ſelves of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing your Brethren to the Peoples obloquy and fury, by your non-acceptance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some <hi>ſay,</hi> It tends to ſhut up the Goſpel in a corner, and to harden the Magiſtrate in his Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Incroachments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for the former of theſe, it is taken off already in anſwer to the Eighth Objection: Sure their confinement is a grievance, an affliction, but not their ſin: If the Magiſtrate, who has power over their perſons, do ſhut them up not only in one Province, but in one Pariſh, yea in one Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and if they ſubmit and yield their bodies to the power of the Magiſtrate, what fault in all this can be charged upon them, who are merely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers in the caſe? And as for the alledged hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Magiſtrate; unleſs ye prove that their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Liberty is either in it ſelf ſinful, or at leaſt but indifferent, and no ways neceſſary; what doth your <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> and arguing reprove? Muſt duty be deſerted becauſe any ſtumble on it?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65758:71"/>
But beſides, your <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> we humbly ſuppoſe, is groundleſs, and merely alledged by you, who pick quarrels at, and ſtrain all Topicks to ſugillat their foreſaid acceptance: Sure it hath no native tendency to ſuch an effect. But ſee if your refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to accept, do not harden the Magiſtrate in his hard thoughts of you, and of the perſwaſion ye own, and in the ſevere reſolutions and courſes uſed, or may be uſed, toward you and the Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some do criminate the accepted Liberty, as a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, has occaſioned much Diviſion and Difference, and is much diſliked by many godly; and therefore cannot be ſonſy, but ſome woful, unhappy thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was briefly cleared before in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the fourth Objection; and therefore we ſhall now ſay no more to it, but theſe five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there are as many, and far more, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not againſt it, as are againſt it: Is it not too Phariſaical a Cenſure, to monopolize the Title and Reputation of Godlineſs to you and your party that be againſt it, and to condemn all as ungodly and backſlidden that are for it? Good Information ſays, the generality of the grave, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, ſerious, and ſober godly, are not againſt it, as it is accepted by your Brethren; yea and that fewer are for dividing and renting from their Brethren upon that ſcore. It is by good hands ſaid, there are not above ten or twelve Miniſters, and but few alſo of the old Chriſtians, in all the Land, againſt the liberty as it is accepted, but only againſt the Complex of the Buſineſs, which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65758:71"/>
the Indulged are not for either, as was cleared in ſtating of the Queſtion: Neither are there many of theſe Ten or Twelve for making it a ground of Diviſion or Separation.</p>
            <p>The only perſons that be <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> againſt it, and for dividing, (ſo far as we can learn) are a very few, and thoſe moſtly of the younger incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderater ſort, both of Preachers and Profeſſors.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) As for difference of practice, that needs no more breed diviſion or animoſity, nor <hi>Jephtha's</hi> was a juſt ground of <hi>Ephraims</hi> quarrel, <hi>Judg.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3. Or theſe Diſciples was for the reſt their ſnarling at it, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.49, 50. When ſome of the Children of <hi>Judah</hi> returned to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Proclamation, and others ſtayed ſtill, or were ſome way detain'd in <hi>Babylon,</hi> what ground of diviſion or out-caſt was this? or ſhould difference of lots divide your hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? See what was ſaid to this before in anſwer to the fifth Objection. And further, ſuffer us to tell you, that as when the generality of Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Miniſters were ejected, ſome were in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence overlooked and ſpared, and that without the envious eye or grudg of heart of thoſe who were thruſt out; ſo we wonder how this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of lots when ſome are favoured with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, others not, ſhould make any breach among ſober men.</p>
            <p>Is not God to be eyed and ſtooped unto in this, and to be waited on by faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till it be otherwiſe?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:65758:72"/>(3) Do we not find our Lord Jeſus himſelf, his Goſpel, and Gracious Miracles, ſometimes a ſtone of ſtumbling, and rock of offence, matter of diviſion to many viſible profeſſors of Religion? as <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34, 35. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.19, 20, 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34, 35, 36. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.49, 51, 52, 53. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.40, 41, 42, 43. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.45. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.22, 24, 25. But who will therefore ſay, they were not of God, but unhappy things being the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch diſturbances, obloquy and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, every where ſpoken againſt, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſad conſequents? they that <hi>take</hi> offence, when no juſt ground of offence is <hi>given,</hi> let them ſee to it, the blame lyes at their own door, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.12, 13. Suffer us to ſay, like as Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.6. Bleſſed is he whoſoever ſhall not be offended at a thing ſo innocent, ſo neceſſary as this permitted liberty (in ſo far as it is accepted) is.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) Sith, as was ſaid before, your Brethrens acceptance of that liberty is in it ſelf a guiltleſs practice, then ſure, however it be an <hi>occaſion,</hi> yet can it be no culpable <hi>cauſe</hi> of diviſion. The only cauſe (that ſhould bear the blame) is mens mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes and corruptions, whereof even profeſſors are not free. Theſe are the wedges of Diviſion which actively rents you aſunder.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) We are made to underſtand that any of the truly ſerious Godly their being againſt this matter, is through want of <hi>right Information,</hi> yea ſome's induſtrious practiſing upon, and daubing them with moſt <hi>injurious repreſentations</hi> of the ſtate of the matter, and <hi>odious calumnies</hi> of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65758:72"/>
done on purpoſe to draw honeſt people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after them, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. Who (almoſt) of all theſe good people underſtand the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or true ſtate of the Queſtion, but are led, not by light, but prejudices, and byaſſed affection? Are they not made to believe that the Indulged have cloſed with all the whole Complex of the Magiſtrates Acts forementioned, and have Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logated the Spiritual Supremacy, and joined iſſues with Eraſtian Incroachments, and other ſuch like falſe and foul alledgances, whereof the Brethren are free, as is above cleared? How have we oft been aſhamed upon your behalfs, to find in your writings, private diſcourſes, and publick Sermons, your greateſt Topick, and <hi>Achillean</hi> Arguments to be Reproaches, and groundleſs Accuſations of your Brethren? and theſe born in upon people as Divine Oracles, and certain Truths? Thus good people have been and are abuſed by ſome <hi>Ardelio's,</hi> who make it their work to infuſe into their minds prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the Brethren, as guilty of a defection, and then to work upon their miſinformed zeal, to turn their edg againſt the Brethren? How many can atteſt theſe undeniable Verities? whence it is evident how much honeſt peoples caſe is to be pitied and lamented, as hugely abuſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon for ſtrengthening of a party, and making up a faction, the tendency whereof is not ſeen by well-meaning people, who are led like <hi>Abſaloms</hi> followers in the ſimplicity of their hearts. And had not the indulged Brethren been too ſilent for peace-ſake, to ſpeak for themſelves,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65758:73"/>
expecting that God and Time would have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people of their miſtakes and miſapprehenſions, much of all this miſleading of people into ſuch rancors and rage, might have been happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a full and true ſtating and vindicating of their practice. And if this mean Eſſay of ours do contribute clearing unto any one, even the leaſt of Saints, and ſhall provoke ſome of theſe Brethren to do ſuch a neceſſary work better and more fully, being better able for it, we ſhall not repent our adventure, but bleſs the Father of Lights for it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.19, 20.</p>
            <p>Now, Dear Friends, all theſe things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how little ground ſeems there to be for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo great a ſtir, as ye do? as if the <hi>All</hi> of Religion lay at the ſtake in all this matter, and theſe honeſt men had made the vileſt defection! Whereas lay aſide prejudice, byaſs, and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſlanders, and let any weigh their cauſe in an even Ballance, the Ballance of the Sanctuary, they will be found in it not ſo black by far, as ſome take them to be. Be intreated therefore in the Lord to hearken to that warning, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.15. <hi>What God hath cleanſed, that call not ye common or unclean.</hi> We hope ye will tremble to be found perverters of the right ways of the Lord. Call not light darkneſs, no more than darkneſs light. Is not as well he that condemneth the juſt, as he that juſtifieth the wicked, an abomination to the Lord? <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſe all that is ſaid, do not meet with, nor fully clear every ſcruple (it being hard to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie where prejudice is great; and a quibling
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65758:73"/>
wit may ſtart more Objections than we have heard of, or has leiſure to ſpeak unto), yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by what is ſaid (though weakly), more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable thoughts of your Brethren, and of what they have done; and let them not ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with you under ſo groſs a character as hitherto; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.30. But u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in the Lord, notwithſtanding your Differences, the Grounds thereof being ſo inconſiderable as hath been ſeen.</p>
            <p>We doubt not but themſelves could, and would, give you a more convincing vindication, were not their averſation even from ſeeming to contend, and their hopes that their Integrity will defend it ſelf, makes them loth to enter the liſts. However our ardent deſire to beget a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding between you, has thus far carried us forth unto, not an Eriſtick debate, but a ſerious diſquiſition for diſcovery and removal of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>
            <p>To return then to our propoſed courſe of Advices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Advice</hi> 6. In the ſixth place, let us lay this before you, That however your judgment ſtand in the matter contraverted (for we are to impoſe upon no bodies judgment, but to leave every one to their own light), yet ye who are againſt the Indulgence, as accepted, and fomenters of the Diviſion, conſider, though ye be but few, yet the ſtir ye make is great, and one man will eaſily raiſe more fire than twenty will be able to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65758:74"/>
Therefore be <hi>exhorted in the fear of God to carry the difference more ſoberly.</hi> Are your Brethren willing to let you enjoy your judgments, and ſerve your light in your own practice? and to live in peace with you, notwithſtanding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? And as to things wherein ye and they are agreed to join with you therein, till God in his time clear up the miſtake that is betwixt you, and ſhew upon whoſe ſide it is? and will not ye be content, unleſs ye impoſe your apprehenſions upon them, and have them conform unto, and lackey after your opinion and practice? muſt your judgment be the Standard and Canon to every bodies elſe? and all be Anathematized that differ in the leaſt from you? Can there be no peace with you, unleſs ye have leave to trail them at your heels? will ye agree with none that are not of your mind in every thing? then <hi>Actum eſt de pace,</hi> peace is gone for ever on this ſide of time; for, <hi>Non datur intellectus Averroiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> mens minds to jump to an Ace in all things is hardly to be expected. While we know only in part, will there not be perpetually different meaſures of light? and diverſity of Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in many things? Theology having its own Problems, even in greater points than this, which calleth for ſobriety and mutual Tolerance.</p>
            <p>As we are not for Scepticiſm, nor ſinful Syncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms; ſo we tremble at the vanity of Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing in things of this nature. But whatever ye deem it, Treat not your Brethren undiſcreetly. Speak or write <hi>to</hi> them, rather than <hi>of</hi> them. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the caſe with them, convince them if ye can,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65758:74"/>
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.17. But uſurp not a Magiſtery over them; preſume not to be Dictators to them more, than ye would take it well they ſhould impoſe on you, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.1. Remember they muſt ſerve their own Conſciences, and be guided by their own light, and not yours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. Ye think them wrong, ſo do they, no doubt, you: But how would ye take it, if they ſerved you as ye do them, with outrageous out-crys, virulent Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and <hi>Philippick</hi> Declamations? What if they did Preach againſt you, your Diviſive Principles, and unbrotherly practices, as Erroneous and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſtical (if not worſe), as ye call theirs Eraſtian? What a pitiful taking would ye and they be in by ſuch Contradictions and Invectives? Do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no otherwiſe than ye would be done unto, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. Think ye are but men fallible, and may be miſtaken in not a few of your confident notions; and that it is poſſible they may have as much of the mind of Chriſt as you. Therefore reverence their Judgments, ſo far at leaſt as not lightly to trample upon the ſame: Or, if ye were ſure they were in the wrong, yet think, ſurely they mind honeſtly (as they judg ye do) and <hi>have not wickedly departed from the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 18.21. If they be ſtept aſide, it is but for want of light, which ye (who think ye ſee more) ſhould pity and bemoan to God, and labour to diſcover their miſtake unto them, (for as yet ye cannot charge them with contumacy, ſufficient convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never being yet held forth unto them.)</p>
            <p>But, O! reproach them not; rate them not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs; go not to Preach them down,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65758:75"/>
nor out of the hearts of honeſt people, much leſs to Preach their own people from them! What ſervice were that to Chriſt, or his Kingdom? or what edification unto people? Sure ye do more hurt than ye are aware of by this courſe, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering and unſetling people, weakening your honeſt Brethrens hands in the Goſpel, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſucceſs of their labours what ye can. See <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14, 15. But what? are not ye and they agreed in chiefeſt Principles and Theſes? What's your difference then but about the application of Principles to ſome Hyp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O fall not into a ſtated Schiſm upon ſo ſmall and diſputable a matter! nor lift up your ſelves in conceit above your fellows! Are ye Preachers of Chriſt? ſo are they: Have ye the ſeal of your labours, ſo have they; and that they have not more, is perhaps through your fault, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with them, thereby confounding and diſtracting their people; and taking them off their ſouls eaſe, by your perplexing controverſies and exceptions againſt their Miniſters. And if ye continue by this contending, to diſcourage your Brethren, and enervate the work of God in their hands, fear leſt ye be found guilty of deſtroying ſo much of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, and countable for the blood of theſe ſouls whoſe edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ye mar, by abuſing and amuſing them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65758:75"/>
with your bartering at their Miniſters, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them and their Preaching into diſeſteem, ſo far as ye can, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Smite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered.</hi> And what have ye gained when this is done? What advantage is it to the Goſpel, to break ſo many faithful mens Miniſtry? And what peace will it yield you when accompliſhed? <hi>Bella geri placuit, nullos ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitura triumphos.</hi> It were but a <hi>Cadmean</hi> victory. What! may ſtill the old queſtion be put unto you, <hi>Does your piety aed zeal lye all in Negatives?</hi> (as theirs in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.21.) Are ye only skilful to deſtroy? and bold to treat the friends of Chriſt like foes? Preach the Goſpel, and propagate real Godlineſs as much as ye can: but O! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of hurting the Lords work and vineyard in your Brethrens hands!

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Brethren, while ye ſhould preach up Chriſt? and to propagate your private opinions more than the power of Piety? or to draw Diſciples after you more than after Chriſt? Were it not better make one real Chriſtian, then proſelyte twenty to your ſide and party? Ye complain of your Brethrens want of ſucceſs, as <hi>Peninnah</hi> upbraided <hi>Hannah</hi> with her barrenneſs; but do not ye much mar their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs? O be tender of them, for the Goſpel's ſake! Go, we pray you, convert the prophane to Piety, rather than preach Profeſſors into faction and parties. Mind the great intereſt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel more than your particular debates, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal intereſts. Away with ſelfiſh deſigns under a ſpiritual mask! Beware of giving ground for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65758:76"/>
that old complaint, <hi>Faciunt cauſam ſuam, cauſam publicam.</hi> Let not not your excellent parts, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, zeal and ſpitits, be ſpent upon ſo unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a task, as this of jangling, plunging, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding is. And tempt not people to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy courſes, which your ſelves may repent of in the end, and come off with that inconſiderate Warriours word in your mouth, <hi>Non putarum</hi>— It is eaſie to kindle a fire, but not ſo eaſie to ſet bounds unto it, when and where ye liſt, ſaying, Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no further. Nay, once kindled, it may rage whither ſoever the winds and aptneſs of the matter to take with it, may carry it, till all be burned down to aſhes.— And finally, let not your Brethren have cauſe to take up that ſad regrate of the Pſalmiſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.12, 13, 14. <hi>Had it been an enemy, &amp;c.</hi> How bitter is this? Were it Rampant <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> or Inimical Prelatiſts, or foul mouth'd Sectaries, who thus battered at honeſt Miniſters, it were more tolerable? But to ſee Brethren at ſuch odds, tearing the fleſh (as it were) off the bones of their Brethren, by bitter railings and reproaches, (which are as drawn ſwords, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.4.) how incongruous and unkindly is that? and may not the world wonder at it? What! ſhall all your edg and ſting be turned againſt them, no leſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right than your ſelves? Shall they have no ſuch Adverſaries as you whom they love and deſire to be at peace with? and with whom they agree in all things (almoſt) elſe? Will ye do the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates work for them, in breaking that little liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which at firſt they trembled at, till they ſaw
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65758:76"/>
you made it a bone of contention? and ſo more likely to break your ſelves and it both than to hurt them, while ye ſtumble ſo upon it. What thanks will ye get for joining iſſues with them? See <hi>Obad.</hi> v. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. And will ye ſo poſitively condemn your Brethren unheard, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 7.51.) and perſecute them as Apoſtates, before ever ye wair an admonition on them? It is our admiration and aſtoniſhment, that ſome of you (as is informed) takes the confidence to baffle them in Sermons, Letters, and private Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the people and others; and yet to this day never uſed the brotherlineſs to write or ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, what might have ſufficed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their error, if any be. The groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Hereticks are not allowed by the rules of the word to be ſo hardly dealt with, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. Pronounce no <hi>Anathema</hi> upon them, till ye firſt take pains ſufficient to reclaim them, and find them obſtinate. Shall ye be ſharper ſcourges in their ſides, and thorns in their eyes, than any others? Do ye like it, to put them to cry to God againſt you, and (like <hi>Job</hi>) to complain of their friends mockage, injuſtice, and cruel uſage? Shall not God viſit for theſe things? <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Obad. v.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Beware of inventing, or venting Stories and Reproaches of ſuch friends of Chriſt! And make not calumnies the ſtrongeſt Arguments you plead againſt them with. Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize not the reputation of honeſty to your ſelves; give your Brethren charity, and treat them not diſreſpectively.

            <p>Upon all theſe Grounds, and many more which might be added, be intreated (in the bowels of Chriſt) to remit and relent of your Acrid fervor, and bring your diſpoſitions and differences to ſome temper, and manage your diſcord with more ſobriety. We think we may ſay, the two part of your differences lyes more in the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your ſpirits and alienation of affection, than in the diſtance of your Principles. Would ye let go the miſunderſtanding and prejudices that are between you, and God heal your diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and diſtempers, the two part of your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe were away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Advice</hi> 7. Ye who are Indulged, a word next to you: <hi>O bear with your Brethrens differing from you; and judg charitably of them, as to the moſt part at leaſt.</hi> Conſtruct it want of light, not ſiniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs of intention or affection. He that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a day, keepeth it to the Lord; and he that keepeth it not to the Lord, he keepeth it not. In Problematick queſtions not defined by the Church, allow others a latitude, and continue your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly forbearance. If even with Infidels and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25.) how much leſs with ſick and feveriſh Brethren? If any mans inconſiderate and opinionative zeal carry them unto any unbrotherly word or deed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you, be not ye overcome of their evil, but overcome their evil with your good. Pack up
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65758:77"/>
their Reproachings, and ſay, <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they are doing.</hi> Let not their vexing you fret you into a wearying of your work, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.6, 7, 8.) nor unto any diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or leſſening of your reſpect unto them. Love them as Brethren, notwithſtanding all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did his), and honour their zeal in the Lord, and pray he may channel it right, and ſet its bounds; for ſo it might do him excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſervice.</p>
            <p>Tolerate alſo good peoples Infirmities; let none of their capricious humours (which theſe reeling times tempts them unto) diminiſh your tender care of them. Seek that which ſtrayeth, heal the diſeaſed, and by gentle dealing convince them that ye walk in the Spirit of Jeſus, whom ye ſerve.</p>
            <p>Hard things (we confeſs) are cut out for you; but put on patience and holy reſolution, ſtand your ground notwithſtanding all Batteries, and do your work over the belly of all diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, 3.) What though ye be the Witneſſes Propheſying in Sackcloth, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.) your Crown will be the maſſier.</p>
            <p>Serve the Lord through good report, and ill report, honour and diſhonour; and make full proof of your Miniſtry, which is thought ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable by Satan, elſe he would not oppugn and oppoſe it ſo, upon the right hand and the left. You are the eye-ſore of the Prelates and their party, and the Butt of thoſe your Brethrens mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken zeal. Be ſtrong therefore in the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our ſoul pities you, being as the ſpeckled Bird
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65758:78"/>
among the Birds of the field, laid at upon all hands, and grinded as betwixt two Mill-ſtones, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prelatick parties enmity upon the one hand, and the fierceneſs of theſe male-contented friends upon the other, (and <hi>who may ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore envy?</hi> Prov. 27.4.) But learn of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to endure Contradiction, and to be ſet for a ſign to be ſpoken againſt, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34, 35.) Endure the Croſs, and deſpiſe the ſhame. Wounds in the houſe of Friends as well as of foes, muſt be born till he ariſe and plead your cauſe, and bring forth your Righteouſneſs as the light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the day of your trial, and theſe are the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments choſen of the Lord for that end; acquit your ſelves like men, like Chriſtians, like Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in it. Bear the indignation of the Lord pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, becauſe perhaps ye have ſinned. If <hi>Shimei</hi> rail, he may be a good Monitor, though a bad Judg.</p>
            <p>Take your vexations as ſo many whetſtones, to keep you in an holy edg, that ye blunt not in theſe up-ſitting times, and as ſpurs in your ſides, to prick you up to diligence in duty; and ſo may you get meat out of the eater, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Stoop to your lot, there may be a bleſſing in it, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10, 11, 12.) But bitter though your life and labour be, yet faint not, O faint not! but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your ſelves to God and man in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſervice; and by piety, painfulneſs and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfulneſs in the Goſpel, convince gain-ſayers, ſtop the mouths of thoſe that ſpeak evil of you falſly, and Preach home again all the reſpect and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65758:78"/>
which theſe times of difference has deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from you. What? have ye not the ſeal of your Miniſtry (a witneſs of Gods approbation) upon the hearts of many? even of ſome who perhaps are now alienated from you, who once ſpake of a bleſſedneſs in your Miniſtry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived you as Angels, though now in the hour of tentation, they are become as an enemy? <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15, 16.</p>
            <p>Though Converſion of Sinners be not ſo frequent (and yet ſome there is) yet has not God been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently with you for Confirmation and building up of the Saints, and for Conviction upon all, who, whether they be better of you or not, yet are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſay, God is in you and with you, and a Prophet hath been among them? as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.4, 5. Now, may not theſe eminent Divine Aſſiſtances, Succeſſes, and Proofs of acceptance, abundantly compenſe all your tears, ſufferings, and ſorrows? and anſwer the queſtioning of your being ſent of God, being proofs of Chriſt ſpeaking in you? Conſider, the priviledge of your liberty, and think, is not ſervice to God and his people (which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye get done) well worth the enduring much contradiction, obloquy and heart-breaking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach?</p>
            <p>Remember alſo your Brethrens ſufferings are ſad at other hands, though none at yours; and let your ſympathizing with them ſweeten your own at their hands.</p>
            <p>And Oh! be ſtirred up to make good uſe of your Liberty which coſts you ſo dear. Let your people find through Gods help, that it has been
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65758:79"/>
their mercy, that ever ye were ſent among them; or whether they hear or forbear, that there has been a Prophet among them. Keep in good terms with your Maſter, ſtand in his counſel, know the Times, and tell what of the Night, and what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do; be faithful in all his houſe as ſervants; and good Stewards of the Myſteries of God.</p>
            <p>Bear burden with your Brethren in their tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſufferings conſtantly. And pray for a bleſſing upon their Preaching of the Goſpel, albeit ſome of them would ruin yours: And whoſoever of them may preach Chriſt out of contention, or faſt for ſtrife and debate, ſuppoſing to add affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to your griefs, and to detract from your eſteem, yet rejoice ye that Chriſt is Preached, and that ſincerely by the moſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Both of you, <hi>Take heed ye bring not your differences any more unto publick, nor otherwiſe put them among the people:</hi> Keep them amongſt your ſelves, where they may abide with leſs hurt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1, 22. Conſidering the miſchiefs of evulgating them, it will evidently appear happy to bury them in ſilence or oblivion. If ye intereſs and engage the people therein, then are ye gone; and beſide other inconvenients thereof, ye ſhall not get leave to unite again without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which may be hard to gain. How long ſhall any affect popularity, and thereby ſubject their Miniſterial Authority to the humours of men and women, for drawing them to their ſide, to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65758:79"/>
ſtrengthen their party? by which means people are taught to domineer over Miniſters, and may fore-run you, and caſt at your ſelves next, when ye begin to ſit up and not go along with all their notions and inclinations. Ye may perhaps find no ſmall difficulty to regulate and bridle their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, being once aloft, <hi>Fortur equis auriga, non audit currus habenas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, what do ye by filling peoples heads with ſuch intangling controverſies, but divert their minds, and take them off the main thing? and turn Religion into factions and debates? and wear them out of heart-tenderneſs, real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Conſcience, and the ſerious ſtudy of univerſal Holineſs? If any make it their work to kindle in Religious Hearers, a factious, opinion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative zeal, you may thereby trouble their heads, not better their hearts; and may ſooner make them fire-brands to burn down the peace, purity, and order of the Church, than living poliſhed ſtones for the New Jeruſalem. Yea, likely you may unhinge them ſo, as to tempt them to caſt at all Miniſters, at all Religion, and turn either Atheiſts, or Seekers, and Sectarians, as woful experience hath many times proved, even in our own days; ſo ſmall a friend to the promoting of piety, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.</p>
            <p>Avoid then carefully to diſcover your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine jars and animoſities before the people in publick or private. Bear not your nakedneſs to their eyes.—Teach them not to meddle with things above their ſphere, and beyond their line, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1, 2.) and turn them not aſide unto
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65758:80"/>
vain janglings, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17, 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.4, 5. Make it rather your work to edifie them in the Subſtantials of Religion, and Vitals of Piety, ſuch as Faith, and Repentance, Humility, Sobriety, Mortification, Self-denial, Love and new Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were it to fire their hearts with the love of God and man, than to heat their heads with puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling debates, which do but perplex, not edifie, and are far out of the way of their Salvation or Duty, and doth not at all concern their practice. What profit reap they by being inveigled into ſuch quick-ſands? we have ſeen many unfleeced of their wool, yea torn in their fleſh, by being involved in ſuch thorns, but never any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged?</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Study Moderation in all things:</hi> Let not Chriſtian prudence paſs with you for wiſdom of the fleſh, nor Chriſtian Moderation for <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean</hi> lukewarmneſs. <hi>Let your moderation be known to all men</hi>; let it be viſible and apparent, both in your paſſions, opinions, and diſcourſes.</p>

Therefore let every one be mourning as the Doves of the Valleys, each one for his own iniquity (perſons and families apart) as well as keeping publick Faſts for the Abominations of the Land. What a Token for good would this be? and would put you in caſe to ſigh and cry, and wreſtle with God for the Nations ſins.

and running with your Cenſer in your hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the living and the dead, for Atonement, crying, <hi>Spare, O Lord, &amp;c.</hi> we doubt not but your heats and animoſities among your ſelves would ſoon cool and calm.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, <hi>Guide wiſely and tenderly honeſt people, yet ſo as ſtill to keep your own place; to be their Guides, and not let them guide you.</hi> Cheriſh their good, bear with their infirmities; but humour them not in their conceits and follies. Let never Popularity be your ſnare. Spare not to admoniſh and rebuke with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and authority, when need is. Take pains as well to inform their Conſciences rightly, as to raiſe their affections keenly. Study prudently to croſs and cure what may be healed, and patiently to endure what cannot be cured. But clap no perſons heads in their miſtakes, or irregularities, for fear ye loſe them if ye croſs them; elſe ye may be made to loſe them upon a worſe account, with an ill conſcience to boot. Deſpiſe not the counſel or admonition of any, <hi>Job</hi> 31.13.) Yet if you permit them to turn Dictators and Leaders to you, your well-days and peace are gone, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 29.21.) <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, there is a Pope in every mans belly; ye may find a Biſhop in every man and womans breaſt; each inclineth to think themſelves infallible, and would be a Lawgiver unto others, and cannot endure others not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to their mind in every thing: Which uſurping diſpoſition in people would be checked. Be ſure if once ye give up your ſelves to ſerve humours, as it will put you out of Service to God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. ſo will your ſervitude be a ſort of Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; and if ye ſing not to every tune of theirs, the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65758:83"/>
upſhot will be as bad, as if ye had never gratified them at all. O be tender of their Conſciences, and wiſely regulate their humours, not by ſervile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, but by happy conviction, or canny diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Auſterity and fondneſs are (almoſt) equally dangerous. And that ye may manage them rightly, not only ſeek Gods good guiding, but alſo be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their applauſe, and dead to their cenſure. The ſober and wiſe will approve you, when perhaps the peeviſh or proud kick at you. But it is enough if wiſdom be juſtified of her children.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, <hi>Live daily in the proſpect of further ſufferings, and therefore unite ſo far as ye can</hi>; leſt the enemy finding you in a divided, diſtracted condition, prey eaſily upon you. Doubtleſs your trial is not at an end. The furnace is heating ſevenfold more. Think not at every reſpite the bitterneſs of death is over, and the worſt is paſt; and ſo begin to pluck up your Criſt, and wax wanton and ſecure; if ye do, it ſays a new ſtorm is near, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6, 7. The Prelatick violence is indeed ſad enough; but what in compariſon of the Papiſtick, which is at your door? And is dividing, biting, and devouring one another, fit providing for ſuch a ſtorm? Were it not more your wiſdom and happineſs to be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to the Apoſtles Rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. to be compoſing rather than heightening differences; and wherein ye agree, uniting, and forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in points of difference, till the Lord decide the Controverſie? otherwiſe the enemy may perhaps decide it with the broad ſword. Will ye be like <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes,</hi> who while he was buſie at his Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Lines, the Enemy entered the Town, and killed him at his Skeams? Or like the Zealots in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

who while they waſted one another within the Walls, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and his Army are ready without to invade and deſtroy both? Shall it be that <hi>Dum aguntur partes, perit Saguntum?</hi> How weak are ye, and a ready prey to every beaſt of the field that pleaſeth to devour, while thus disjointed and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate! <hi>Vis unita, fortior.</hi> If ever ye mind to ſtand effectually to the maintenance of the Goſpel, unite in time, it will be too late when the <hi>Papiſt</hi> is got upon your back.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, <hi>Notwithſtanding the ſeverity of thoſe in Authority, unto you, be not ye tempted to ſlight duty unto them.</hi> Let not their commanding unlawful things diminiſh your readineſs of obedience in things lawful. Remember they are the Ordinance of God, and reverence them accordingly, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 4.) Pray for them, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4.) Elſe if ye caſt them out of your prayers, God may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave them to be a ſadder ſcourge unto you; and ye may have little peace of Conſcience there-under, conſidering how little ye wreſtle with God upon their behalf, that he would guide them right. Ye might perhaps rule your Kings heart, Counſels and Courſes, were ye <hi>Nehemiah</hi>-like, or <hi>Ezra</hi>-like, high in Court with God, and plying the Throne of Grace hard for him. Be admoniſhed withal not to ſpeak evil of Dignities, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.5.) Deſpiſe not Dominions, (<hi>Jud.</hi> v. 8.) However they miſcarry, lament ye that to God, yet ſpeak not diſreſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them. Bear all due reverence to them, for the Lords ſake, as the fifth Command obligeth; and while they gall you, do not ye fret your ſelves to any reciprocal exorbitancy. Let not ſharp ſufferings canker and imbitter you. Learn to be ſubject and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65758:84"/>
reſpective, not only to the good and gentle, but to the bad and afflictive, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. Obey none of their unlawful commands, yet ſubmit (not uncheerfully) moleſting of you, bearing the Croſs patiently, meekly, contentedly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. And who knows what mollifying influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the heart of Rulers, your meekneſs in ſuffering might have? ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.15. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.4. However, we are perſwaded in the Lord, your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Chriſtian bearing of hardeſt things, will adorn the Goſpel, and in end be victory to your <hi>cauſe,</hi> come of <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>particular intereſts</hi> what will, ſee <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36, 37. Often has the Church and Truth of God conquered more by ſufferings, than by actings. <hi>Sanguis Martyrum, ſemen Eccleſiae. Creſcit ſub pondere virtus.</hi> But beyond many other things, beware of wronging your Conſcience and Cauſe by being tempted by your ſufferings to take up either ill Principles, or ill practices againſt the Magiſtrate. Let none dare to think, as we hear ſome one or two begins to muſſitate, that the Magiſtrates miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges about the matters of Religion, does forfault him of his right to govern, and ſo <hi>cadens titulo,</hi> is no more to be owned as King. A principle which all ſound <hi>Presbyterians</hi> abominate, as witneſs your Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>cap.</hi> 23. §. 4. Sure none but <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pizantes,</hi> or <hi>Novaturientes,</hi> will own ſuch unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Principles. O let no ſeverities byaſs your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto error, nor tempt you to put forth your hand to iniquity; if any unhappy one or other, by ſo doing, bring an <hi>odium</hi> upon an honeſt cauſe and party, whoſe ſoul hateth to eſpouſe ſuch things, they have much to anſwer to God for. And no leſs inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice will it be for any to lay the dotages of one or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65758:84"/>
two bearing your name, to the charge of the whole. We heartily wiſh in ſo far as may be without ſin, (and farther we deſire it not), that Friends of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (as you pretend highly to be) would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of irritating, ſtretch themſelves to inſinuate upon the Magiſtrate; and to ſet what value they lawfully may upon any thing of favour from him. Whatever the Rulers have done, or are, (for which ye are to beg repentance and remiſſion, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to them), nevertheleſs they are the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God to be ſubmitted unto, tendered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected for Conſcience-ſake. And though we are not to ſet limits to the Soveraign Grace, Wiſdom and Power of God, who can deliver his people and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts <hi>when</hi> and by <hi>what means</hi> he pleaſes; yet we are ſure ye are in the way of your duty, when ye look to God for deliverance by their means, by the returning of Judgment to Righteouſneſs; being ſenſible that if he take not that method readily, he will plead both with Rulers and people, which will rather increaſe ſpiritual Plagues than diminiſh them. And in order to this, it is your duty and wiſdom not to foſter the Magiſtrates jealouſie that Chriſts inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts cannot riſe but to their prejudice, which (it is feared) hath no ſmall influence upon them; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by all your deportment, to convince them, that they do well conſiſt together, and that the promoting of Chriſts intereſt, and ſhewing favour to the friends thereof, is the ſecurity and ſtability of the Throne. Dear Brethren! we doubt not but all theſe counſels are your ſtudy and care, yet pardon us to ſtir your pure minds, and let that of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12, 13. be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for our preſumption. And hoping God writeth his Laws in your hearts, and after the hour and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65758:85"/>
power of darkneſs is over, will recover you from your diſtempers, we ſhall therefore ſupercede to ſay any more, a word to wiſe men being enough.</p>
            <p>Only in the laſt place we would ſpeak a word or two to you the good people, who adhers to the Truth, and labours to keep your Garments clean of the publick pollutions. Verily, your reſolution, courage, conſtancy, and zeal for God, your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the purity and power of Ordinances, your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to an honeſt Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are moſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; your adventuring to ſuffer hardeſt things, rather than ſtain your integrity in the meaneſt point; your taking joyfully the ſpoiling of your Goods, and tedious Impriſonments, exile from your Native land, and other ſeverities, and all for the ſake of Chriſt; is no ſmall document of much good in you. Pity it were ſuch a choice Generation of forward Chriſtians were not always rightly acted, or did in any thing ſtumble. Yet alaſs! who that looks with an impartial eye, may not ſee ſeveral things to be lamented in you? To meet with, and amend which, ſuffer us, dear friends, to propoſe a few coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels unto you, in like manner. We hope ye ſhall not find them diſſonant from the mind of Chriſt, nor find cauſe to refuſe to follow them, as cauſing to err.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, <hi>Let not all your Religion conſiſt in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick matters.</hi> Make ſure your perſonal intereſt in God; neglect not your own Vineyard, your own ſouls caſe; and werr not out of Heart-exerciſe, and ſelf-judging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while ye are ſo much taken up about the publick; but let Perſonal Godlineſs be happily joined with publick-mindedneſs; elſe your ſelves may be caſt-aways, after ye have done and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65758:85"/>
ſuffered much for the name of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2, 3. Particularly, let never your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſufferings, or the Righteouſneſs of your Cauſe (as to man) hide from you your Perſonal failings and guiltineſſes before God. Neither pride your ſelf in being ſtrict and tender in publick matters, and mean time lax enough in your Perſonal Walk and Moral Duties. Will ye not hear a Conformiſt? and yet make no conſcience of lying, ſlandering your Neighbour? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will ye run after Preaching? and yet make little conſcience to practiſe what ye hear? O place not the ſum of your Religion in publick things, though true it be, they are much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Beware alſo of ſpending your time and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in debates, and vain janglings one with another, to be tentations one to another, raiſing your own and others paſſions and corruptions, inſtead of holy Conference that might miniſter Grace to the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Mind well the Apoſtles Caveats in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16, 17. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.11. Is it not obſervable, that the greateſt ſticklers in differences, the greateſt diſputers and contenders are uſually the moſt diſtempered and barren hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? like the mountains of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> high and hot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but dry and unfruitful; warm, but withered; the unkindly, fooliſh, heat of diviſion and debate, eating out the life, ſap, and native heat of real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which evaniſheth then into airy notions and litigious ſtrivings, whereof no edification cometh. O let not Religion fly up from your hearts to your heads, and evaporate into airy foams and forms, and turn vappid and inſipid. Be ſure by Queſtions and Diſputes, as well the power of Religion is ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, as the Majeſty of it infringed. The many
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65758:86"/>
Diſputes about Religion, commonly overthrows the practice of it, which conſiſteth not in Diſcourſes, but in doing. It is eaſie for a Formal, moth-eaten Chriſtian to hold up in the one, while he cannot bear up in the other, as <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerved anent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtue, <hi>Omnes diſputare malunt, quam vivere,</hi> more prone are people to debate about the things of God, than to practiſe what is uncontroverted. If Heaven could be obtained, and God pleaſed with jangling and debates, a prophane Sophiſter ſhould ſooner have the one, and do the other, than a holy Chriſtian, who knows that it is not talking of, but walking in the ways of Gods Commandments, that is moſt acceptable in his ſight. But to ſay no more, liſten to the Apoſtles Oracle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. <hi>If any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtom, nor the Churches of God.</hi> Love perverſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings who will, (which ever <hi>corrupteth the mind</hi>), flee ye them as death, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>See, that while ye reſiſt one evil, ye run not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another</hi>; and that fleeing one extremity, ye fall not upon another: Is it not prepoſterous to be hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Prelacy and Eraſtianiſm, (ſad ills indeed!) and yet friendly enough toward Schiſm, Error, and ſome other things repugnant to the Word of God, and your Covenants, as well as theſe?

            <p n="3">(3) It will be an <hi>evil ſign,</hi> both Diagnoſtick and Prognoſtick; will it not argue you to be much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of God, and left to your ſelves? and evidence much ſimplicity and weakneſs, if not inſtability and giddineſs, and ſpiritual diſtemper, <hi>Jud.</hi> v. 18, 19. Moreover, what a black <hi>Omen</hi> will it be of Gods forſaking the Land, and being about to give a Bill of Divorce to your Church? is it not as well a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal-like as an unkindly thing, to ſee the ſheep kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at, puſhing away, or running from their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds?

            </p>
            <p>Upon all which, and the like Conſiderations, we would obteſt, yea charge you in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by your appearing before
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65758:92"/>
him to beware of Schiſmatizing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. and 12.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25.</p>
            <p>And as ye would hold off ſplitting on this Rock, we make bold to preſent you with, and to intreat you to obſerve theſe rules, beſides what are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the preceeding Advices.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Take heed of leſſer differences:</hi> Small Wedges make way for great ones; petty differences (ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) grow up to ſtated Diviſions, and Diviſions to Schiſm and Separation. Therefore (as much as in you lyeth) be preciſe to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, and cruſh the Cockatrice in the Egg, leſt a little leaven neglected, leaven at length the whole lump.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Affect not, be not too much taken with novelties and new guiſes in Religion.</hi> Itch not after Singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor be dazled with the busked beauty of nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Truth and Piety is lovely in every dreſs, no leſs in her old coat than a new. Nothing more leads to ſeparation than new fangleneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>Be tender either of giving, or taking offence.</hi> Be not eaſily ſtumbled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.7. Study Charity, and be apt to conſtruct doubtful matters in your Miniſters, into the beſt part.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>Labour to ſee God in and with them.</hi> And if God be with them, Chriſt ſpeaking in them, how will ye dare to ſpurn at them, and kick them off? If ever ye heard them ordinarily, can ye deny but ye have ſeen it evident, that God was in them, and with them? How oft has ſome of you ſpoken of a bleſſedneſs in their Miniſtry, before ye were put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your dividing notions, and took up prejudices at them? Have ye not found a Divine preſence and aſſiſtance with them, which made you cry in your
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65758:93"/>
hearts, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Come ſee a man that has told me all things, &amp;c.</hi> And thereupon been made to honour them in your hearts, and ſay as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Of a truth God is in them?</hi> Have you not oft been made to ſay, the Indulged Miniſters Preached beſt to ſouls caſes, though ye ſaid the Field-Preachers ſpoke beſt to the Times? Now, how unchriſtian is it to depart from their Miniſtry, with which Chriſt continues yet his preſence? Have you any warrant to leave them before Chriſt leave them? Will ye be ſtricter and holier than he? Will ye caſt off whom the Lord caſts not off? When <hi>Jacob</hi> found God in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> he ſet up his Pillar there.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) <hi>Beware of having the perſons of men in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> either for gifts or grace, or becauſe of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, <hi>Jud.</hi> v. 16. This was it which occaſioned the Schiſms in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> admiring their Teachers, they were puffed up for one againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and one ſaid, <hi>I am of Paul, another, I of Apollo, others, I of Cephas, &amp;c.</hi> even according as their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and liking led them? take heed of being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſame ſnare. All fleſh is graſs, none infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and therefore none to be doted upon. <hi>Ne ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicemus ex perſonis fidem, ſed ex fide perſonas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Let not your eyes be ſo dazled with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eminency of Parts or Graces ye apprehend to be in any, as to ſet up their bare word for your Oracle, or their example for your rule. This was it which drew many of the <hi>Jews</hi> (and <hi>Barnabas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt) into a ſinful Separation, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12, 13.) becauſe they ſaw <hi>Peter</hi> a leading man, a prime and eminent Apoſtle, going that way before them. And yet that Pillar of the Church did therein halt, and walked not with a ſtraight foot, and was to be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65758:93"/>
blamed; and conſequently to be not imitated, but ſhun'd. It is dangerous to ſhape our courſe by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers compaſs; as many a Ship has been loſt and run on Banks by following their Admirals Lanthorn. Give eminent and godly men their due reſpect, but put them not in Gods room. It is Divine Rule, not Humane Example, we are to walk by. Follow no man further than he follows Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1.</p>
            <p n="6">(6) <hi>Take heed of pretending to greater purity and ſtrictneſs about Church-communion, than the word of God commends, or the examples of Chriſt, of the Apoſtles, and the Primitive Church commends.</hi> Nor be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly rigid as not to bear with things they have tolerated. Be not over-righteous, leſt by over-ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye both ſin and do harm; yea, and plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray it to be faction or humour, not Conſcience, which acteth you. <hi>Calvin c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">(7) <hi>Make nothing neceſſary to the unity of the Church, or to the Communion of Paſtors and people, but what God has made neceſſary in his word, or directed you to make.</hi> Put not every new opinion into your Creed, nor every new courſe be added to the Decalogue; as if ye were to impoſe them upon, or require them of others, as ſuch ſubſtantial Articles of Faith, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duties, that ye muſt renounce all Religious fellowſhip with them who are not of that way, <hi>Act.</hi>

15.10. There is not a greater divider or ſeparater than this tantizing or ſcrewing up of debateable points, wherein God has left us ſo much latitude, as not to make either the one or the other part of the Controverſie, a neceſſary condition of Church-communion. O take no burden of ſtrictneſs on you, that is not of his impoſing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24, 25.</p>
            <p n="8">(8) <hi>Enſlave not your ſelves to any perſon or party, ſo as to be over-deſirous to pleaſe them, or over-fearful of their cenſures.</hi> Is it not ſervile man-pleaſing, and cowardize to do ſo? and leads many to ſinful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with dividing courſes? when therefore any fervent ſelf-conceited perſon or people would carry all down by their cenſoriouſneſs and paſſions, it is high time for Paſtors, and the aged, graver, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer ſort of Chriſtians, openly to rebuke them, to appear againſt them, and ſtand their ground (as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11.) and not to comply with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided ſort (though well-meaning), and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous zeal, that by connivance or compliance ye may eſcape their Cenſures and Reproaches. He that thus ſaveth his name, ſhall loſe it, and perhaps on a worſe account. Be not therefore cowed to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or <hi>Amen</hi> to their way, for fear of the ſcourge of Tongues. Be valiant for the Truth, and againſt ſuch ills; elſe fainting will feed their humour, and invite them to be more inſolent. Put on Authority and Goſpel-auſterity to check their petulancy and untowardlineſs.</p>
            <p n="9">(9) <hi>As well ſhould ye beware of real ills, ſo be not ſcarred from good by the name of evil.</hi> What a trick has ſome of ſtigmatizing things with odious and terrifying names, thereby to boggle ſimple and well-meaning people? If the ratling and canting names of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65758:94"/>
               <hi>Eraſtianiſm, Supremacy, Homologate, &amp;c.</hi> falſly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſerve to fright you from Indulged Miniſters, your skittiſhneſs is to be lamented. And it may be ſaid of them as of old the Apologiſt ſaid of Chriſtianity, in like manner branded and bogled at, <hi>Tolle Nomen Criminis, &amp; nihil erit criminis, niſi Nomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">(10) <hi>Beware of ſuffering prejudice or fancy to be to you for Reaſon or Religion, or to raiſe in your minds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable diſtaſters at your Paſtors.</hi> Separation is a thing not to be lightly ventured upon. And yet what are oft-times peoples exceptions againſt union with, and pleas for dividing from their Miniſters, but light and frivolous, when weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary? yea, ſuppoſe ye ſeem to have Scripture to plead, what if you be miſtaken of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>application,</hi> or wreſt the ſame? Be not ſo arrogant as to ſet up your apprehenſions thereof for infallible Oracles. Humble, ſober, ſelf-jealous folk, get uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moſt of the mind of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9.

Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there be ſome faults in your Miniſters perſonal actings, or in their way of entry to their Miniſtry, or in their Miniſterial Adminiſtrations (ſuch as want of due freedom againſt the evils of the time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65758:95"/>
yet know ye will hardly find a ground in Scripture for it, that your ſimple hearing them, and not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off their Miniſtry, doth natively render you adopters of their ſin. It is not enough that you and others think ſo, unleſs the Lord conſtruct it ſo, and declare it ſo by the Rules of his word. Now ſearch all the Rules of the Word, wherein he declareth how men communicate in others ſins, and ye will find none of them quadrate with this caſe. Are their (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) failings meerly <hi>Perſonal?</hi> ſuch as neglect of duty to their Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe (ye know) doth not vitiate their Miniſtry, nor have ye any Communion therewith, in communicating in their Miniſtry; for as your own Divines teach, perſonal faults reſt on the perſon, and doth not pollute the Office. Or, are their faults ſome leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer failing in the <hi>diſcharge</hi> of their Miniſtry? ſuch as not being ſo free and full in Preaching and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing againſt the ſins of the time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not theſe alſo ſiſt upon themſelves? and not render it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for you to hear them Preach the Goſpel to good purpoſe? Is the Miniſters defect the Hearers ſin? Or, is it not lawful to own the Miniſter who cometh not up all the length we would, in teſtifying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt publick corruptions, but thorough puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity faints, and falls ſhort? What if you require more than is really expedient? or, what Scripture requireth you to ſeparate from one of that deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? To his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth; you will not be holden anſwerable to God for it, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for your joining in the Ordinances diſpenſed by him, though with that want, eſpecially if ye admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him of his ſhort-coming, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17. Do ye not read how defective many of the Angels in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65758:95"/>
of <hi>Aſia</hi> were, in fidelity againſt ſins of the time? yet not a word from our Lord to People to deſert them therefore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Chap.</hi> Or, are their (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) faults in the <hi>way</hi> of their coming to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, free exerciſe of their Miniſtry? ſuch as neglect of a teſtimony againſt the Eraſtian Uſurpations of the time, which ſome judg to involve them in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive compliance therewith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet is not that only their own perſonal guilt? but defileth not their Miniſtry to you. Nor does your joining with their Miniſtry involve you in the guilt of their (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) irregularities or Homologations committed in coming to the peaceable exerciſe of it by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. For your participating in the Acts of their Miniſtry does not terminate upon, intermedle with, or natively imply a joining with, or approving of theſe faults (which are altogether extrinſick and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental to their Miniſtry and its exerciſe, and reſts upon their perſons alone), for ye hear and join with them ſimply as <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and your <hi>Miniſters</hi> being called by you; but not <hi>as ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters reduplicatively under ſuch and ſuch Formalities and Conſiderations as ye apprehend to be faulty in them, (even as theſe who <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2, 3. heard them that ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, whom all know to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many Irregularities, nevertheleſs did not hear them under ſuch notions and reſpects, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as <hi>Moſes</hi> Succeſſors in the Chair); and therefore your deed involveth you not in any acceſſion unto, or participation in their (pretended) ſin; not infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or importing (in Gods conſtruction, ſignified in the Rules of the Word) your conſent unto, or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and approbation of that their ſin. It is no <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing</hi> of them in their (alledged) ſin, but in their

Miniſtry ſimply, which ye cannot deny to be ſound and lawful, abſtractly conſidered from theſe ſuppoſed diſorders or defects in their coming by the free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thereof with you. Ye communicate only with their function, in its <hi>ſubſtance</hi> (which is the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Chriſt) not in the <hi>naevi adnaſcentes,</hi> or ſinful <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</hi> And the more evident yet is the needleſneſs of your ſeparating in this caſe, if ye teſtifie to them your diſſatisfaction with, and diſowning of the (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) tranſgreſſions in their way of coming by the licenſed exerciſe of their Miniſtry; which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a line of Separation between you and thoſe ills; and conſequently ſtateth you guiltleſs, albeit ſtill ye imbrace the benefit of their Miniſtry in it ſelf. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this, as ye ſay, <hi>proteſtatio facto contraria,</hi> the proteſtation and deed being not <hi>ad idem,</hi> not relating to the ſame thing, and conſequently doth not croſs and deſtroy one another. Doubtleſs if bare hearing and joining with a Miniſtry, having ſuch <hi>Naevos,</hi> ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, adhering thereunto, doth make the people Homologaters of, and communicaters in theſe defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, our bleſſed Lord would never have inſinuate (in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2, 3.) his approbation of partaking in ſuch a Miniſtry. If further ye ſcruple and think your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Indulged Miniſters may <hi>harden</hi> them in their (deemed) ſin, which to be acceſſary unto thereby, ye judg would be your ſin. We <hi>anſwer,</hi> doth the ſpotleſs and holy Lords making his Sun to ſhine, and rain to fall as well upon the unjuſt as the juſt, tend to harden them? what more doth your hearing tend (natively) to harden and encourage thoſe Miniſters? We grant it may be abuſed thereunto (were they in a courſe of ſin as ye ſuppoſe) yet that is but accidental, not natural to your deed, and therefore you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65758:96"/>
eſpecially your deed being otherwiſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Surely it makes you no more guilty of their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening (in caſe they harden themſelves upon it) nor ſubjects loyalty and duty to their Prince (who having a righteous title, yet hath uſed ſome indirect means to attain poſſeſſion of the Crown and Government) does render them guilty of hardening him in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency for theſe evil arts uſed for getting into the Throne. Ought ye not to remember that whatever forbearance of matters of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Indifferency</hi> (ſuch as intimate perſonal unneceſſary converſe, or the like) another mans abuſe thereof calleth you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; yet neceſſary and weighty duties (ſuch as your keeping Church-communion is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25.) may not, muſt not, be omitted upon ſuch a ſcore, of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental emergency; for as evil is not to be done that good may come of it; ſo, nor duty to be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, for avoiding ſuch an accidental abuſe thereof; elſe it were in the power of others by their ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon, and abuſing of our doing of duties, might vacate us from them all, and ſo make all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God of non-effect; yea, the Scripture it ſelf ſhould be (on that reaſon) laid by, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wreſt it to their own deſtruction. If they will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelves upon your not ſeparating, your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of duty is meerly the innocent object and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereof; themſelves only are the tranſgreſſors, becauſe you are purely <hi>paſſive,</hi> they <hi>active</hi> in the caſe. Thus ye ſee, that ſuppoſing there were ſuch real faults in your Miniſters acceſs to the publick undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed exerciſe of their Miniſtry as ye talk of, (whereas in ſober and unprejudiced ſearch you will find none), albeit theſe ſhould call you to mourn to God for them, and endeavour their conviction and
