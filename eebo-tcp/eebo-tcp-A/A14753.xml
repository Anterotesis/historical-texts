            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11920:3"/>
performance of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Offices to his louing Mother. God hath so blessed the former part of your life aboue the lot of most women, with two such able guides, as haue so sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you with Spirituall and Temporall furniture, that you neede not the ayde of any your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

when hee found but a fewe Flowres, must bring them to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>LEAH.

Heere is a Posie gathered out of olde and new Gardens; this sauory meate hath God brought to hand, heere is sweete out of the strong. Let your soule eate and blesse.
<pb facs="tcp:11920:4"/>
The vse and fruit of them I wish to euery beleeuer, especially in age and sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: but the handsell and honor of them (if any be) to your selfe, whom the Law of God and Nature binds mee to honour aboue others. Long may you liue to blesse your Children with your daily Prayers, especially your sonnes in that worke which needes much watering. Yet euery good Christian in yeares cannot but desire to bee
<pb facs="tcp:11920:4"/>
forewarned against death approching, and that is the ayme of these endeuours. God prosper and blesse them as the former: and send mee my part in the benefit of these (as hee hath done of them) in the time of vse.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which hath bin already spoken of the Life of Faith, is to the naturall man aboue all Faith. And yet if that bee all it can doe, then is all little better then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Say it could fill the minde of man with all content, satiate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11920:6"/>
his life with all delight, and swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the bitternesse of all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet if for all this, there lurke in his breast a secret and slauish feare of Death, the least peece of this leauen but in a corner of the pecke, is enough to sowre the whole lumpe of his ioyes: the least dram of this Coloquintida will marre the relish of all his sweetes: and make him crie out, <hi>There is death in the pot.</hi> And, Oh Death, how bitter is thy mention and memory?</p>
            <p>Aske Nature, and call to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, and see if they can affoord any ayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must they not confesse themselues heere quite posed and plunged? hath not death set &amp; foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their whole army: for pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, shame; and sicknesse, and other such pettie Crosses, some poore cures, and lame shifts haue they found out: but when death comes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11920:6"/>
all their courage hath fayled, and all their rules haue left them in darke and desperate vncertainties. It is possible for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with much a do to stand out the stormes of Haile, the swarme of Flies and Lice: but when once the crie of Death is in the houses, then is there no way but yeelding: his Enchaunters and Mountebancks could abide the crie of Frogs and other such vermine; but this <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liske</hi> affrights them. Onely Faith takes it by the tayle, handles it, and turnes it into an harmlesse wand, yea into a rod budding with glory and immortalitie.</p>
            <p>Quartane agues are not so much the shame of Phisicke, as Death is of all naturall skill and valour. Death is Faiths euill. Faith onely professeth this Cure, vndertaketh and performeth it with the least touch of Christs hand: and that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11920:7"/>
as familiarly as the richest Balme doth the least cut of the finger. Faith turneth feares into hopes, sighings and groanings, into wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and longings, shaking and trembling into leaping and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of hands.</p>
            <p>Alas, all troubles are but as Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes<note place="margin">Dr. Tayler. Tho. Hawkes.</note> to this Gyant, who defies all the hoste of Infidels: holds them in bondage all the dayes of their liues: and makes their whole life no better then a liuing Death and dying life. Only Faith encounters this Gyant, singles him out for her chiefe prize, and grapples with him not as a match, but as with a vanquished vnderling: insulting ouer him as much as he doth ouer the sonnes of vnbeliefe: sets her foot vpon the necke of this King of feares, and so easily becomes Conquerour and Emperour of all pettie feares, which are therefore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11920:7"/>
onely fearefull, because they rend to Death; the last, the worst, the end and summe of all feared euils. Here, and here onely is the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable crowne of Faith: here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth she euidently and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour her followers, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them from all others with a noble liuery of true magnanimitie and alacritie.</p>
            <p>It is true, if wee had windowes into the breasts of men, a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence one might see in the inward bearing of aduersitie: but for the face and outside, both may seeme alike hardy, both may seeme alike resolute: But when it comes to the poynt of Death, then the speech, the behauiour, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, palpably distinguish the dull patience perforce of the worldling from the cheerfull wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Christian. Let Death put on her mildest vizards, come
<pb facs="tcp:11920:8"/>
in the habit of the greatest sicknes, to the stoutest Champion on his owne Downe bed, yet shall his heart tremble and his countenance waxe pale. Let her dresse her selfe like the cruellest Fury: Come with all her rackes, fires, strappadoes, wilde beasts, all her exquisite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Faith will set a woman, or a childe to make sport with her, to dare and to tyre her, and her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.</p>
            <p>Alas what doe they tell vs of their <hi>Socrates,</hi> their <hi>Cato,</hi> their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> and a few such thinne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which a breath will rehearse, a fewe lines containe their poore ragged handfull, to our Legions, whose names or number one may as soone reckon as the sand of the Sea shore: theirs a fewe choyce men of heroycall spirits trayned vp either in arts or armes: Our of the weakest sexes and sorts, onely
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11920:8"/>
strong in the Faith: theirs either out of windy vaine-glory childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckoning of a short death and a long fame, or out of blockish ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance venturing vpon Death as Children and mad men vpon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers without feare or wit: Ours out of mature deliberation and firme beliefe in Christ: who hath drunke out of Deaths bitter Cup an eternall health to all mankind, taken the gall and poyson out of it, and made it a wholesome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of immortalitie. Faith heere proclaimes her challenge and bids nature or arte out of all their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers or Schollers produce any one, who hauing free option to liue or die, and that vpon equall tearmes haue embraced Death: Whereas infinite of hers haue bin offered life with promotions, and yet would not bee deliuered expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a better resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:11920:9"/>If any shall challenge these for Thrasonicall flourishes, or Carpet vaunts, I appeale and call to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse not the Cloud now, but the whole skye of witnesses, such I meane as haue dyed either in the Lord, or for the Lord, who in the very poynt and Article of Death haue liued, and expressed liuely testimonies of this their life, partly in their incredible sufferings, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their admirable sayings. For their Acts and Monuments if they had all been penned, all the world would not haue conteined their Histories: the very summes would swell to large Volumes. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Patients, the sauage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Persecutours, striuing together, till both exceeding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and beleefe, bred wonder and astonishment in beholders and Readers. Christians haue shewed as glorious power in the faith of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11920:9"/>
Martyrdome as in the faith of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. As for their last Speaches, and Apothegmes, pitie it is no better marke hath been taken, and memory preserued of them. The choyce and the prime I haue cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of ancient Stories, and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyrologies, English, Dutch, and French. The profite and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure hath paid me for the labour of collecting, and the like gaine (I hope) shall quit the cost of thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Sweetly &amp; briefly they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise and couch in them the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the marrow of large &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold precepts, prescribed by the learned Diuines for preparation against Death. The Art of dying<note place="margin">Beza. Perbins. Hall. Byfield.</note> well is easier learned by examples then by directions. These chalk the way more plainely, these encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage more heartily, these perswade more powerfully, these chide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe with more authoritie: if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11920:10"/>
some worke not, others may: some will affect some, some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Read them ouer to a sicke or to a dying Christian, if they quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not, if they comfort not, it is because there is no life of Faith in them: if there be the least sparke, these will kindle it, cherish and maintaine it in the doore, in the valley, in the thought, in the act of Death.</p>

               <p>By all these which are but an handfull of Christs Campe Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it sufficiently appeares they had their Faith fresh and liuely in the face of this graund enemy, and by Vertue of their Faith, their Spirits, Wits, and Tongues, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled, vndismayed; insomuch that an auncient witnesse of the Christian Bishops, that they did more ambitiously desire the glory of Martyrdome, then others did Praelacies and Preferments. And a late mortall enemie of theirs, bade a vengeance on them, for hee thought they tooke delight in burning. What then shall wee gaine by them?

from the burning of one <hi>Austo,</hi> in Smithfield, being asked by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Farrar</hi> of Halifax, where he had beene, made answere, There where I would not but haue been, for one of my eyes, and would you knowe where?

Now if one President made him so good a Scholler: What dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards and non-proficients are we? if such a cloud of examples work not in vs a cheerefull abilitie to expect and encounter the same aduersary, so often foyled before our eyes. Yet least any should complaine, that examples with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rules, are but a dumbe and lame helpe: I will annexe vnto them a payre of Funerall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, opening a couple of Seales

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11920:29"/>
A Drum, a Trumpet, or the least call would serue the turne, to draw vs out to the sight: But these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing serious, yea to nature somwhat hideous and odious Voyces, like vnto Thunders, are giuen to the beasts to call beholders. The Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Wildernesse is willed to cry this Theme aloud in the deafe eares of men. A <hi>Boanerges</hi> with all the vehemency and contention of his voyce and affections, will bee too little, vnlesse God boare the eares, open the eyes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the hearts of men to <hi>Come and see.</hi> Yet is it but our folly to be so shye of this sight, for though it bee sad, yet is it of all the sights vnder the Sunne the most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the most profitable; Though we turne away our faces and close our eyes, yet see it wee must, and see it wee shall, neuer the lesse, neuer the sooner, neuer the later.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:11920:29"/>
Nay, the truth is, see it wee neuer shall, but with closed eyes. Thou tender faint-hearted man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that art so loath to meete with a Corps or Beere, to see a skull, or any thing that minds thee of Death, shalt thou by this meanes protract or escape thy Death? No, let mee tell thee praeuision is the best preuention, and praemonition the best praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. That which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued of the <hi>Basiliske,</hi> is here no conceited Story, but a serious truth. He that sees it before he be seene of it, may auoyd the deadly poyson of it. Hee that sees it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes, shall not see it when it comes. Hee that mannageth an horse at an armed stake, fits him to rush into the maine Battell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare. And wouldest thou with <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathaea,</hi> walke euery day a turne or two with
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11920:30"/>
Death in thy Garden, and well foreacquaint thy selfe therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, thou shouldest haue, if not <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochs,</hi> yet euery true beleeuers Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, not to see Death, not to taste of Death, viz. in that ougly forme, distastfull manner, which other the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> do, who because they will not see the face of it, must feele the sting of it. To dye well and cheerfully, is too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie a worke to be well done <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</hi> The Foundation of Death must bee layde in life. Hee that meanes, and desires to dye well, must dye daily. Hee that would ende his dayes well, must spend them well, the one will helpe the other. The thoughts of thy end as the trayne of the Foule and Rudder of a Shipp will guide thy life, and a good Life will leade thee to a peaceable end, that thou shalt neither shame or feare to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11920:30"/>
dye. In a word, <hi>Platoes</hi> Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy in this, is true Diuinitie: that the best meane, and whole summe of a wise mans life, is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Death, not euery fleet and flitting flash, but frequent and fixed contemplations. Death is the knownest and vnknownest thing in the world: that of which men haue the most thoughts and fewest Meditations. Be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perswaded to <hi>Come and see:</hi> that is, come that thou mayest see. Come from other obiects, infinite and vaine spectacles, with which the eye is neuer glutted. Drawe neere and close to this that thou mayest see it throughly. Wipe off the Clay, Spittle, and Scales of thine eyes, that thou mayest cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold the nature, quality, and consequents of Death. No mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wight but hath some blushes of mortality, such as go and come,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11920:31"/>
but if they would suffer them to lodge in their mindes, they must needes stirre some affection, and leaue some impression in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and produce some effects in their liues. <hi>Socrates</hi> had a gift that hee could fasten his eyes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny howers on one obiect without change or wearinesse: Halfe so stayed a thought of ones mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, might bring a man to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. It is not beautie seene, but looked on that wounds. I meet with a Story of one that gaue a young Prodigall a Ring with a Deaths head, with this condition, that he should one houre daily for seauen dayes together looke and thinke vpon it: which bred a strange alteration in his life, like that of <hi>Thesposius</hi> in <hi>Plutarke,</hi> or that more remarkable, of <hi>Waldus</hi> the rich Merchant in <hi>Lyons,</hi> who seeing one drop downe dead in

               <p>Behold, First the Seale opened.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This horse is vnder seale. Seales wee vse commonly to confirme and conceale, to make things sure and to keepe things secret. And thus death as all Gods iudgements are said to bee sealed. <hi>Iob.</hi> 35. and that with a firmer seale then of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians:</hi> In which sence this Horse <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. issueth from betweene two brasen mountaines, that is Gods ineuitable, vnalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Decree: hee rusheth not out, rangeth not abroad at the will of man or Satan, at hap or by blinde Destiny, but at the pleasure and by the appoyntment of the great

Master of these Gods horses, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> one of whose chiefe royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is to keepe the locke and key of Death and Hell, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. else would he be euer trampling vnder feete the sonnes of men. Looke how naturally, and continually the Sea would ouerwhelme the whole Earth, if the waues were not bounded by prouidence: So would this horse ouercome the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of it, were hee not tyed short, and restrained by his, and our Lord. You see him heere li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the fourth part of the Earth, else had not one been left aliue: For all are sentenced, and haue deserued to dye, and it's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour that all dye not. In a word, men dye not by chance, course of Nature, influence of Starres, but then, and therefore because it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. A million of <hi>Aethiopians</hi> perish in one day, in one battell,

2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14. not because all were borne vnder one aspect of Planets, but because such a slaughter was sealed of God. And though there be one way in, and twenty out of the world, yet all falls out as God determines and disposeth. That Christian which beleeues this, though hee may desire <hi>Dauids</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticke to number his dayes aright, that is, to know the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity of them: yet will hee neuer study the blacke and senselesse Art of calculating his birth and death. None but fooles are curious and inquisitiue to know that, which is vnder Gods priuy Signet. We are all as Souldiers sent to Sea with Commission vnder seale, not to be opened till wee come to such and such a point. To guesse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, we shall dye at such an age, in such a Climaterical yeere, what is it but to make a league with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11920:33"/>
Death, not vnlike to that frenzie Merchant that would make and strike vp matches of hundreds and thousands with parties absent as if they were present. A fond itching humour, and such as would for the most part (what euer wee thinke) doe vs hurt rather then good, if the day and houre were far off, it would breede securitie: if neere hand horror. Sicknesses are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent summons and warnings. Marke such as sentenced by Iudges and Physitians fore-know their death, yet without speciall grace fore-fit themselues neuer the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Some deaths indeede (as some Clockes giue warning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they strike) which symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes and signes infallible: and so extraordinarily God giues to some <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> a presage, and hearts to prepare: but generall God hath seene
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:11920:34"/>
this the best for vs, that it should be for the generall most certaine, for the perticular most vncertaine, to him sealed, to vs concealed: of which hee would haue vs make these vses.</p>
               <p>First, for our bodily health not to bee too carefull, nor too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: with all our Physicall dyet and miserable anxietie, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not adde one cubite to the length of our dayes, or measure of our health. Wee are all sealed vp no otherwise then the measure of our wealth, of our crosses and blessings, for the hauing or auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of which: the meanes wee must vse without carking care, or cowardly feare, cheerefully rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Christ, the Lord Keeper of the Seale, not wittingly and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately preuenting that sealed date by surfeits of toyle or pleasure, by wilfull neglect of dyet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11920:34"/>
of Physicke, by griefe or by melancholy: nay, not by haste to glory with <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or with hastie selfe-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Christians, such as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> times were full off: but with <hi>Iob</hi> patiently all the dayes of our life, during the terme of our sealed lease, till the very day and date ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and appointed time of dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and dissolution come.</p>
               <p>And secondly for our soules pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, not to do as most that haue set dayes of truce and peace, and in which they hang vp their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour a rusting, and their Beakons vnwatched: but as people that liue in perpetuall hazard of war, haue all things in a daily readinesse for seruice at halfe an howres war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, vpon the least Alarum: Who would liue one howre in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie or irrepentance, least in that hee bee taken napping as the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11920:35"/>
foolish Virgins, and that rich foole that reckoned of many yeares, and had not one night to continue. Grant it were enough to repent and belieue the last day of life, yet how can a man be sure to doe that, vnlesse he doe it euery day: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that euery day may for ought he knowes, be the last. The seale may be opened in a day and houre one least thinkes of it, as it is to most that dye.</p>
               <p>Lastly, when euer this Horse comes to fetch away vs, or any of ours children or friends: A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer stamps not, and rages not, as mad Marshall <hi>Birom:</hi> murmures not, repincs not as the wild Irish men without hope: expostulates not with Destenie, as <hi>Alexander</hi> for his <hi>Hephestion:</hi> but with <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> layes his hand on his heart and mouth for his sonnes suddaine Death, knowing what God hath
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11920:35"/>
sealed, shall be and must bee. If the Dreames of a blind fatall necessity could quiet Heathens, how much more should a Christian be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at the disposall of a wise and louing keeper of the Seale. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute sooner or later it shall not be, then hee hath fore-seene and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sealed for thy especiall good, who hath times, and seasons, and seales in his ordination. Worthy was the speech and resolution of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Diuine. If Christ hath the key and seale of Death, then a figge for Death. This though it be an ordinary notion, yet well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, it is a singular stay to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer.</p>
               <p>The Seale being thus opened, <hi>Come and see</hi> the Creature that is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues forth. <hi>Behold</hi> an Horse, a fierce a strong, a warlike, a speedy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so described by God himself, <hi>Iob</hi> 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:11920:36"/>Looke therefore how easily <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> stamped <hi>Iezabell</hi> into peeces: and <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> his Troupes of Horse the Turkish Foot-men, or as the sturdie Steede dashes out the little Whappets braines, so easily doth Death with the least kicke and spurne of his Heele the haylest Complexion, the stoutest Constitution, tryumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like an Emperour ouer all sorts of people, treading in the neckes of Kings and Princes, as <hi>Iosua</hi> ouer them in <hi>Cane</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting in the tearmes of <hi>Rabsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keh,</hi> Where is <hi>Hamath?</hi> the<note place="margin">2.

Elam, Meshech,</hi> and <hi>Tubal,</hi> whose feare was vpon the liuing, are they not descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the graue? made their bedds in the slimy valley, and layd their Swordes vnder their heads? Where is <hi>Goliah</hi> with his brazen

Bootes? Hath wisedome deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Strength rescued, or wealth ransomed any out of my fingers? For all their Confidence, haue they not gone to the King of Feare? How can it bee otherwise, seeing Death comes as an armed Horseman, vpon naked Footmen: no encountering, no resistance, no running away, no euasion by flight. This winged Pegasus, postes and speeds after men, easily giues them Law, fetches them vp againe, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops and swallowes the ground he goes, sets out after euery man as soone as he comes into the world, and playes with him, as the Cat with the Mouse, as the Grey hound with the Badger, somtimes hee followes faire and a farre off, lingers aloofe and out of sight: anon hee spurres after, and by and by is at the heeles in some sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and then it may bee giues
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11920:37"/>
vs some breath againe, but in the end ouertakes vs, and is vpon vs with a Ierke, as the snare ouer the Fish, or the Foule. <hi>Absolom</hi> could not outride him: <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot wheeles fell off in this chase. <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> swift as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, strong as the Lyon, yet how were they slaine with the mighty? What then is the course the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian takes? He neither foolishly thinkes to resist, or escape, nor yet cowardly swounds, or crauenly yeelds: but as a valiant Footman that espies an Horseman pursue him in a Champion, stayes not till he come vpon him, but addresseth himselfe for the encounter: so does a Christian in his best health and prosperity, put on his armour, get him the Helmet of Saluation, the Shield of Faith, and learneth the vse of them betimes, before he be vnapt to it in sicknesse or age
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11920:37"/>
As the Parthians teach their verie Children to handle the Bow, the Scythians the Dart, the Germans the Speare: and so it comes to passe, that belieuers are not surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as worldlings often are, with milke but in their breasts, without Oyle in their Lamps, &amp; all in vaine then fondly cry out to this Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to stay his stroake. As the rich Foole <hi>Gregorie</hi> relates of, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated Death to stay till the next morning, Truce but til to morrow, and I will bee ready for thee. A Christian wisely considereth, that hee hath no morrow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while it is called to day, is ready for this Horse, who neuer sets any certaine day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>Behold also the colour of this Horse <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the color of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering leafe, pale and wan: Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing and noting the effect hee
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11920:38"/>
hath first vpon the liuing, whom hee appalles, as hee did <hi>Baltashar,</hi> whome all his Concubines and Courtiers could not cheere, nor all his wine in the bowles of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fetch colour into his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. See wee not often Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at the Barre wanne away, and dye as white as a cloth at the Sentence of death pronounced on them. Many gulls and gallants we may heare sometimes flight off Death with a iest, when they think it out of hearing, and some wish it and call for it, as <hi>Gaal</hi> for <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> but when it comes in good earnest, they are not able to looke it in the face, with the bloud in their cheeks. Some foolishly set a face on the matter, on their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, lest neighbours should cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure when they are gone for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: hypocritically paynting their faces as <hi>Iezabel</hi> did, affronting

                  <hi>Iehu</hi> out of the windowe, God knowes with a cold heart, &amp; if her paint had bin off, a pale face should one haue seen vnderneth it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Christians hauing a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of faith to warme them at the hart, change not their countenance nor haue their colour any whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, but as is recorded of Mistris <hi>Ioyce Lewis</hi> at the stake, and sundry other Christians, euen of the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest by nature and sex, looked as fresh and cheerely at the houre of death, as at their mariage.</p>
               <p>A second effect of this pale horse is after death, bereauing the bodies of all bloud and colour, making them liuelesse &amp; wan carkases, and so layes them a rotting and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring among the wormes their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, till the fashion of them be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly altred, the beauty consumed, and shape turned into rottennesse.

Dust they were, and to dust they must returne. Fauour is deceitfull, and beautie is vanity, when the pale Horse comes, there is no remedy. Here only Faith hath an Antidote comforting her selfe with these sayings: This base and vile bodie of mine must bee thus serued, that it may bee transfigured and made conformable to the glorious Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart Christs body, more glorious then the Sunne in his brightest hew. It must thus bee sowne in pale ignomy, that it may rise in glorious beautie. VVhat if I lose a little Vermillion red mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fleame and Sanguine, shall I not recouer a radiant resplendant lustre? Can the Alchimist with

his Art, cause a dry withered floure to shew it selfe againe for a space, in it naturall verdant shape and colour: and cannot God that made mee first of Clay, and that Clay of nothing, reduce and refine the same after it hath beene in the Earth? as the Chynois doe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls of their curious dishes for many scores of yeares, that when it is throughly deficate, their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie may temper and frame some vessell of excellent seruice withall. Certainly my Redeemer liueth, and with these eyes I shall see him, as hee is most admirable to behold, and my selfe like vnto him in my degree.

Subtiltie, Agilitie.</p>
               <p>Oh, but heeres yet a more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Spectacle behind, then all that hath yet come in sight. Hell, euen Hell it selfe in the worst sense, not the graue of the body, but of the soule. For <hi>Iohn</hi> sees here principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Iudgement of the wicked, that were slaine for the contempt of the Gospell, by the pale Horse, for not yeelding to the White and his crowned Rider. And their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full state is heere opposed to the happy condition of the Martyrs vnder the Altar.</p>
               <p>Well then, behold also, euen Hell the Page and follower of Death, attending him where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hee goes among the wicked sort. Whence it is that they are so often coupled in this Booke, <hi>Death and Hell.</hi> Looke as the Foxes wayt vpon Lyons, Carrion Crowes vpon armies, Gaolers or

No fowler does more cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stalk behind the Horse, or creep behinde brakes and hedges, to get his ayme at the shye Fowles.

In which respect, how lamentable also is the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all selfe-murderers, who make Death the remedie of euery griefe, and cure of euery violent passion: If they finde themselues inwardly vexed, or perplexed in Conscience, they seeke Death as a present ease; not considering how they leape out of the smoake into the flame, out of the flame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, out of a curable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany disturbance, into an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse inrecouerable woe, (without the extraordinary mercy of God) to which vsually the Deuill speeds them, that hee might get them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his clutches, and so passe out of doubt, all meanes of preuention and euasion by Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

So doe Cowards

and Crauens shut their eyes, and chuse rather to feele blowes, then to see and shunne them. Little better is the common course that most people take. Scared some are with a confused, and preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous feare of Death, and flashes of Hell in their Consciences, and yet take no course to get pardon and Faith in CHRIST: but either taking it to bee some melancholly humour, send for merry compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to driue it away: or being giuen vp to hardnesse of heart and impenitencie, wilfully shake off all thoughts of repentance, shut their eyes and eares against all good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, and desperately put all at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures, and chop into the iawes of that roaring Lyon. Some of them ridiculously fearing Death, they knowe not why, more for the pangs of it (which often are lesse then of the Tooth-ake) then
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:11920:44"/>
for the Hell following: like fooles that feare the thunder Cracke, and not the Bolt; the Report of the Peece, and not the Bullet; the Serieants arrest, and not the Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Imprisonment: Labour to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape Death which they cannot, and Hell which they might. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them scarred with some terrible apparisions, affrighted, as Cardinall <hi>Crescentius</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, with a blacke Dog in his Chamber.

And so <hi>Spira</hi>-like, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately and disconsolately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in hellish horrour.

Oh how fearefull a thing is it to fall into the handes of God, who is a consuming fire. Thinke of it whiles there is hope, you that forget God, Heauen, and Hell, least you come there where there is no redemption, no hope of ease or end, which is that that makes Hell, Hell indeed: For if all these paines might haue an end, were it after million and millions of yeares, as many as there bee sands in the Sea shore, yet migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thou nourish some miserable comfort of a release in the long runne: But this night hath no day, this Ague no intermission,

               <p>What thinkest thou, are these things tales and fables, is Hell but a name and word, a scarbug for to keepe fooles in awe? Hath not God, thinkest thou, a day of recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a prison and power to punish

Rebels and Traitors, or are not his punishments like to his Iustice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and eternall? Know these things to be as true as God is truth, saue that they are short of the truth it selfe. Why dost thou not then take thy soule apart, and ruminate of these things by thy selfe, iudging thy selfe here, that thou mayst not bee condemned in the world to come. Art thou afraid of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy fit, and fearest thou not this gulfe, and whirlpoole, and sorrow? Art thou not loath to bee tormented before thy time, and fearest not to bee tormented time without end. I wonder how the soules of wicked men and vnbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers goe not out of their bodies, as the Diuels out of demoniaks, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, raging, tearing and foaming.

How faine would I snatch thy soule out of this fire? Vndoubtedlie know, that if this warning doe thee no good, it is because thou art of old, iustlie ordained to perish in thy impenetency, and to bee a fire-brand in these euerlasting flames. Now on the contrarie, if thou beest a vessell of mercie and honour, it will doe thee no hurt, but driue thee to Christ, in whom there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: who onelie is perfectlie able to saue and deliuer thee out of this Lake.

This, this is that which makes death so easie, so familiar and dreadlesse to a belieuer; he sees Death indeede, but Death is not Death without Hell follow him: and Hell he sees not, but onely as escaped and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, and therefore is said not to see Death.

comes death and the Prince of this world with him, but he hath no part in mee: all the bitternesse and teares of death lye in the feare of Hell, which, thanks be to Christ hath nothing to do with me, nor I with it, and therefore I taste not of death: now comes Gods Sergeant pale death, whom I know I cannot auoyde: but this I know, he comes not to arrest me to carry me to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but only to inuite me to a feast, attend and conuey me thither. Let such feare him as are in debt and danger, mine are all discharged and cancelled: he comes with his horse to take vp me behind him, and to fetch me to my fathers ioyes, to a Paradice as full of pleasures, as he carries the wicked to a prison full of paines. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Baker and Butler were sent for out of prison, the one to promotion, the other to execution: hee that had the ill

Antidotes, more liuely Cordialls, against the feare of Death, then in all the dead and drie precepts of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> doting Art of dying. For this part of the vision was shewed <hi>Iohn</hi> of purpose to sweeten the harshnesse of the former: that his spirit grieued and amazed with the sight of the calamities and mortalitie vnder the persecuting Butchers, rather then Emperours, might yet be relieued and refreshed with a sight of the blessed estate of such as died either in, or for the Lord.</p>
               <p>Wherein was proposed to his sight, and to our consideration these seuerals. First, the immortall subsistence of soules after their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from the body. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their sure and secure condition vnder the Altar. Thirdly, their dignity and felicitie clothed with white robes. Fourthly, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:11920:52"/>
happinesse at the last day, when the number of their brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren shall be accomplished.</p>
               <p>Of all these, Christ meant <hi>Iohn</hi> should take notice, and al beleeuers by his testimony to their full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Iohn</hi> being in the spirit could see spirits, men indeed clad in flesh, can hardly imagine how a soule can haue existence out of the flesh. Eagles can see that which Owles cannot: so is that visible and credible to a spirituall man, which to a naturall is inuisible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. And yet euen natures dimme eyes haue beene cleere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to see this truth. Nature I say, pure and meere nature, not only the Platonists and other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ones, who resolutely conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, and aptly resembled it, to the distinct being of the waggoner after the breaking of the Coach:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:11920:53"/>
the swimming out of the Mariner in the wreake of the ship, the cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the snayle out of the shell, the worme out of the case: not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the learned Grecians, and ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Romans: But euen the rudest Scythians and vnlettered Sauages; yea, though there bee many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and sundrie Dialects in the world, yet is, and hath this euer been the common voyce of them all, That soules die not with the body. And howeuer the bodies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection hath to them been a Problem and Paradoxe, yet is the soules eternitie an inbred instinct sucked from natures breast; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an indelible principle stamped in the soules of men by the finger of God. And indeed, to right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, what difficulty or absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is there in it. What lets mee to conceiue a being of it in the Ayre, in the Heauen, or in any other
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:11920:53"/>
place as well as in the compasse of my body, is not one substance as capable of it as another? Can it liue in the one, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>Hath it not, euen whiles it is in the bodie, thoughts, motiues, passions by it selfe, of it owne dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the body, many crosse and contrarie to the disposition of the body, chearefull ones when that is in paine or melancholie: Cholericke ones when that is flegmaticke. Doth it waite vpon the body for ioy, sorrow, anger, and the like? doth it not more often begin vnto it? Not to speake of Martyres innumerable, who haue beene exceedingly pleasant in the middest of torments, as if they had beene spirits without flesh. How many auncient stories and dailie examples haue wee of chereful minds in distempered,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:11920:54"/>
pained, languishing dying bodies? Reason will then conclude, that the Soule may well be, and be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible after death without the body, which euen in the body can bee wel, when that is ill, cheerely when that is hurt, or sicke, grieued and troubled when that is in perfect temper and health. And on the contrary, small reason haue wee to thinke it sleepes out of the bodie, which neuer slumbers in the body, or that it is seazed by death out of the body, which neuer was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by sleep, which is but deaths Image, and younger brother in the body, but euer was working and discoursing in the deepest and deadest sleepes of the body.</p>
               <p>Besides, is it likely God would enrich it with such noble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine dowries to bee salt onely to the bodie, to exhale with it as Bruits doe. The admirable inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:11920:54"/>
of Arts, Letters, Engines, the strange fore-casts, prospects and presages of the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part, the infinite lodgings, the firme reteinings of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, doe they not argue an immortalitie: Doe men ingraue curiously in Snow, Yce, or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient stuffe?</p>
               <p>What meanes the great anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of men about their suruiuing name, if the minde perished with the bodie, if Death were the cessation of the man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the whole substance. What should nature care for an ayery accident without a subiect, whereof no part of him should be sensible.</p>
               <p>What meanes the very feare of Death, if that were the end of all feares, and cares, and sorrowes, if nothing remained sensible, and capable of any
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:11920:55"/>
thing to bee feared.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the fresh vigor, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impayred abilitie, that nimble agilitie of the minde in sicknesse; yea, manie times the freer vse of the faculties of it in the confines, yea, in the act and Article of Death, then in former health, doe they not tell the body, the soule meanes not to fall with the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kase (which hath the name of falling) lyes not a dying with it, but errects it selfe, meanes onely to leaue it as an Inhabitant doth a ruinous House, or as a Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion layes downe a Lute whose strings are broken, a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a worne instrument vnfit any longer for seruice and imploiment: and as a Guest makes haste out of his Inne, to his long home and place of abode.</p>
               <p>Loath I am to mingle Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall Cordialls with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:11920:55"/>
as water with wine, least my Consolations should bee flash and dilute: yet, euen these and such like arguments haue taught all Phylosophie (the brutish schoole of the Epicure excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) to see and acknowledge that the soule is not a vapour, but a spirit, not an accident, but a substance, and elder and more excellent sister to the body im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt and seperable; a guest that dyes not with it, but diuerts out of it, intending to reuisite and reunite it againe vnto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> selfe. But Diuinitie certainely knowes all this to bee most certaine that it is a particle of diuine breath, inbreathed into the redde lome at the first, not arising out of it, but infused from heauen into it, and therefore may as wel exist without the clay after it, as it did before it: and when the dust returnes to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11920:56"/>
the dust, heauen goes to heauen, both to their originals, the soule first, because first and principall in euery action, the body after as an accessary and second, and so the day of death to the body, is the birth day of eternity to the soule.</p>
               <p>This vndying, and euer-liuing condition of the soule, throughly rowled in the minde, firmely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and vndoubtedly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Faith, workes admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects as in life, so in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death. <hi>Seneca</hi> that saw it but through Clouds, cranies and creuises with yfs, and ands, yet professeth that when hee thought but a little of it, and some pleasant dreames of it, he loathed himselfe and all his trifling gratnes. But most diuinely, and resoluedly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Palmer:</hi> He that hath his soule linked and tyed to the body, as a thiefes feete to a Clogge with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:11920:56"/>
guyues and fetters, no maruell hee knowes not how to dye, is loath to endure a Diuision: but he that vseth, and can by Faith separate the spirit from the body, to him it is to drinke this: and with that drinkes off a Cup of Wine in his hand, and within a while after, as cheerefully drinks of Deaths cup in the sight of the same Witnesses. Euen <hi>Socrates</hi> himselfe sweetened his Cup of poyson, with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the soules immortalitie, to the amazement of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Such Soules indeede as place all their felicitie to bee in a full fedde, and well complexio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned body, and to partake of the senses corporeall delights, hath not accustomed it selfe to it owne retyred delights of obstracted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, knowes not how to bee merry without a play-fellow, no maruell though it bee as loath
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:11920:57"/>
to part with the body, as a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deformed body to part with rich robes and gorgeous apparell, which were it onely ornaments. But such noble and regenerate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as know their owne Dowries, haue inured themselues to subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate contemplations, and to haue their conuersation in Heauen, whiles they were in the body: such I say, though they do not Cynical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuile the body as a Clog, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a lumpe of myre, &amp;c. but know it to bee the Temple of the Holy Ghost, yet are they willing, yea and sigh to be vncloathed, to sowe it a while in the earth, being a dark and thick lanterne, hindering the cleare sight of it, till they may reassume it clarified, a spirituall, an Angelified body made apt and obsequious to all diuine seruices, to Celestiall Offices without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse, intermission, and such like
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11920:57"/>
vanitie, which here it is subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: as willing as <hi>Dauid</hi> to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side <hi>Sauls</hi> cumbersome Armour, and to betake him to such as hee could better weeld and command at pleasure.</p>
               <p>This is the first and lowest helpe Faith hath to comfort the soule withall in the approach of Death; when the strong men buckle, the Keepers of the house faile, they waxe dimme that looke out at the windowes, when the whole outward man decayes: that the inner man ages not, faints not, languisheth not, but rather lifts vp the head, is more fresh then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and excepts to bee vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and to bee at libertie, freed from Corporeall tedious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing workes of sleeping, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, drinking, and other meaner drudgery, that it may once come to higher and more spirituall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:11920:58"/>
better suiting with it natiue condition: euen as the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on longeth to bee out of the grate, and the Eagle out of the cage, that they may haue their free scope and fuller libertie.</p>

                  <p>Now if this much reuiued <hi>Iohn</hi> (as no doubt it did) to see the Soules continuance after Death, how much more to see their safety and rest vnder the Altar: that is vnder Christs protection &amp; custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, vnder the shadow of his wings. Who makes them gratefull to his Father, couers them from his wrath, safeguards them from all molestation, procures them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute quiet and security. The phrase alluding to the Altar in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which gaue the Offerings grace and acceptation: and partly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:11920:58"/>
to the safety of such as fled from the Auenger to the Altar. Christ is our Altar, and all the Soules of such as dye in his Faith, are as <hi>Stephan</hi> bequeathed to him: hee presents them to his Father, shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters them from accusation and condemnation, gathers them as the Henne her Chickens vnder his wings, being fully able to keepe what is committed to him from all disquiet. Hee that could keepe the three young men in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace with whom he walked, yea their very garments from the violence of fire: The Israelites and their apparell in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Whales bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: how much more easily now hee sits at the hand of his Father in Maiestie and Glorie, can hee defend saued and glorified soules from all Externall and Internall Annoyance, and settle them in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:11920:59"/>
absolute peace with him in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, according to his frequent promise to such as ouercome, <hi>they shall sit with me vpon thrones.</hi>

At feasts great persons were wont to change their guests ordinary clothes with a white Synthesis, a colour fit to expresse alacritie. Christians, the whole Easter weeke wore white apparell. All the graces the soules had heere in this their infancy of Regeneration, were but stayned and polluted clouts: their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge darke and obscured with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,

without disturbance or disorder: the superiour part of the Soule, pleasing it selfe in the blessed visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, and the inferior satiate with the fruition of riuers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, &amp; variety of monthly fruits. All this ioy increased by the aeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and magnificence of the place being Gods Palace, built and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for eternitie, for the honour of his Maiestie, and habitation of his Saints, all shining like precious Iasper: enchanted by the full quire of Angels and communion of holy men, excellent when they were on earth, now perfected in their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and freed from frailties, neuer mourning, but euer singing and lauding their Creator with <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiahs</hi> without defatigation or sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie: all this made vp and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate by the addition not of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yeares, but of eternitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, vnalterable: incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:11920:61"/>
What are the chiefe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of this life, but the sordid apparell of the Soule, the blacke thoughts, the speckled phantasies, darke obliuion, royled, soyled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, all the habite of it squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, iagged, and tattered. Now then was <hi>Ioseph</hi> loath to change his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-ragges, or <hi>Hester</hi> her olde and meane Cloathes with stately and royall array? Promise a Childe a new Satin suit, and see whether hee will not long for it, and call for it; see whether hee will crie when you bid him lay off his Russets? Whence is it then that men dye so dully, so vnwillingly, so heauily? or whence can it bee, but because they doe not liuely and certainely beleeue, and expect these white Robes for their soules. When the beautie of a mans minde is heere obfuscate and defaced with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Tentations, and opake
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:11920:61"/>
Imaginations, with yellow chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, with pallid feare, with ruddy shame, with sable dispaire; oh what would he giue for a candid calme, and serene state of his mind? and when againe it pleaseth God to affoord him sunshine holidayes of ioy and tranquilitie, wherein his mind is clad, and decked with gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, siluer, and precious ornaments of peace, meekenesse, temperance, patience, Oh what an Heauen would he thinke hee had heere on earth, if all his daies were but such dayes! whereas this a Christian may well assure himselfe of, that what euer grace doth here prepare and begin, there glory will absolue &amp; perpetuate for matter of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, purity, &amp; alacrity of the mind, typified in these white robes: yea further for matter of dignitie and tryumph, which then shall be most compleat, where they shall see

Christ at that day come in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Father with millions of his Angels descending &amp; bringing down his heauenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them halfe way in the clouds, and there auenging them of their enemies, sitting with them as asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors vpon thrones, to iudge the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, &amp; the world of wicked ones, &amp; such as haue insulted ouer them on the earth, in which they shall then without any malignity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, anger, or appetite of reuenge, take amirable and vnspeakeable content and comfort, yea reck on it as the accomplishment of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choate glory, for which they are here said to long for, &amp; groane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar, till the number of all their brethren being consummate, God shal openly acquit &amp; applaud them, condemne and confound their opposites. These, these are the only, stately, and Kingly dignities:

the meditations whereof are only<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to beget and foster true heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal &amp; Christian resolutions against the feare of Death and Hell, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vnuanquished. To conclude then, to the man that would both in health and sicknesse nourish euer in his breast vndaunted and more then conquering thoughts of these two enemies, instead of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> many friuolous and tedious rules: I prescribe but these two practises of Faith. The first is to worke in his minde a setled and vndoubted certaintie: and the second a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frequent representation of them.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:11920:63"/>
this world, sicke of owne sinfull imaginations, &amp; tyred with exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tentations. The happiest soule that euer hath sayled ouer this <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripus,</hi> in the best ship, in the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest body that euer was, neuer had so calme a passage, but that it hath had cause enough often to wish it selfe on shoare. What with selfe groaning phantasies, and inie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted temptations, how little respit or rest is here to be found? Is there any Palace or Tower here so high or strong, that can keepe diseases from the body: how much lesse cares, sorrows, feares, and Sathans assaults from the Soule? Were there but such an Iland, as some haue dreamed of heere on earth, that might free our bodies or mindes from disquiet, but for the space of the moment of this life, how would people couet to dwell in it? In the times of the late
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:11920:63"/>
warres in Netherlands, how did the Boares forsake their Farmes, and flye into walled Cities for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie from dangers? What vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence then should our heauenly Ierusalem suffer of our wishes and desires? were it but for the sweet and amiable name of peace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is denominated, hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the God of Peace for the King and Keeper of it: Wals ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cubits high, into which no <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> can shoote an arrow, nor the Dragon Beast, nor the false Prophet to seduce or to accuse: strong gates and barres excluding all enemies and annoyances, and so affording perfect tranquility to all the Inhabitants, out of which they insult ten times more saferly, then the Iebusites ouer the blinde and lame, ouer the pale horse and his riders, Death and Hell. Consider and compare a little the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:11920:64"/>
of the worldling with the wisdom of the Christian, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py stabilitie of the one, with the wofull vncertaintie of the other at the time of their departure. Euen Foxes and Hares, and other such vermine fore-acquaint themselues with Muses, Thickes and Burroes, into which when they are chased and hunted, they may repaire for safety: but these fooles while they liue in health and prosperity, neuer thinke of the euill day, and when away they see they must goe, how vnshystable are they? Some of the meaner sort, they take care for their winding-sheet: or if richer, for a marble or painted sepulchre, which yet cannot preserue their bodies or names from putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the superstitious sort to bee buryed in a Fryers Cowle, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Alter of stone: the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rater sort, wishing the Mountaines
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:11920:64"/>
might couer them from the wrath of the Lambe. An harbour or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for their soules they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinke of; whence it is that they are as loath to haue them tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of their bodies, as <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> to be out of doores, and exposed to misery and dangers; or rather as <hi>Cain,</hi> to be cast as a Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond out of Gods presence, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lest euery one that met him next, should cut his throat for a cursed Caitiffe. And indeed what else can they looke for, but instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee deuoured of the roaring Lyon, that waites at the doore of Death, to fetch away their soules into the place where there is no night nor day. Onely the wise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuer, he hath prouided a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, or Citie of refuge against time of danger, hath learned wisdome of the Conies, who though a little nation, yet wise and forecasting,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11920:65"/>
haue their refuge in the Rocks. Christ is the beleeuers Rocke, and his strong Tower, his Altar, and therfore he feares not what Death can doe vnto him. Christ hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured him on his word, that hee shall haue all, teares wiped away, and the Spirit secured him that he shall rest from his labors. In which regard he is so farre from lingring and hankering after a continuance in this <hi>Baca</hi> of teares, this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of feares, that he studies rather to enter into this rest, Cries out with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Wo is me that I dwell in, <hi>Meshek</hi> and <hi>Kedar,</hi> when I think of peace, there is warre at hand: With <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Woe is mee that I dwell with a contentious people. With <hi>Elias,</hi> I am weary of my life, an end good Lord. Or with bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Simeon,</hi> Now Lord let thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant depart in peace, into that land of peace; heere I haue seene that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11920:65"/>
there is no peace to bee had: all here is vanity &amp; vexation of spirit. For a minute of peace, moneths of vanity, for a dram of hony, pounds of aloes and gall.
