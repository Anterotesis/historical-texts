            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1 The <hi>World naturall</hi> is the Churches, that is, the frame of Heaven and Earth, all things are made for man, and he is made for GOD. As the wise Philosopher could say, that man is the end of all things in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-circle, that is, all things in the World are made for him. He is made for God in whom all things end. As all things come from a point and end there againe, so all things come from God and all end in God. <hi>We are Christs, and Christ is Gods,</hi> but the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17844:4"/>
World is ours, and wee are Gods, all things in the World are our servants, for they mourne in blacke, as it were, for our miseries, since the fall. And in our resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againe they shall bee restored, they waite for the day, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>For</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 21.</note> 
               <hi>the glorious liberty of the sons of God:</hi> they have their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and misery together with men.</p>
            <p>But there is another <hi>World</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The world of wicked men is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Churches. And there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in first the good of this world</note> 
               <hi>that is ours,</hi> take it in the worst sense, the World of wicked men; all their plotts and the Prince of the World are the Churches.</p>
            <p>How is this? He and all his instruments are under the command of him that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17844:5"/>
turnes all his designes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his owne intention, this is a hell to Satan, and one of the cheife torments he hath, that as his malice is limited by this power, so his power is limited by Gods power, who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shootes him in his owne bow: what ever he designes against the head Christ, and against his members the Church, it is overturned for the good of the Church. In the primitive Church some were <hi>given over to Satan, that they might learne not to blaspheme.</hi> Its a strange thing <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 20</note> that Satan should teach not to blaspheme who is the author of blasphemy. Yet by consequence hee afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17844:5"/>
their bodies, thereupon they came to be wise, and seemed to be moderate and sober, and to be Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, and not to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme. So the Prince of the World is ours in this, by an overcommanding power, that turnes all to good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his intentions. For there is but one grand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in the World. Every Kingdome is under a higher Kingdome, there is but one to whom all are subject, there is one grand Wheele that turnes all the other, and therefore Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is serviceable to Gods end, whether hee will or noe.</p>
            <p>And then for the World <note place="margin">2 All wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men.</note>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:17844:6"/>
of wicked men, all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent they seeme to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church, yet they are serviceable to the Church: for wicked men are but the Launderers of the Church <note place="margin">Simile.</note> (as it were) to wash the Church, to purge the church, to doe base services that God intends for the refyning of the Church, and all their hatred is for the good of the Church, for God suffers the World to hate his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. That his children <note place="margin">Iames 4 4.</note> might not love the World: for if the VVorld did not hate his, they would love the World, and it would be a dangerous love. <note n="a" place="margin">A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sectary from the former particulars</note> The Church is a strange corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

            <p>And therefore my life is yours, it is at your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for you I shall continue still.</p>

generation to stand up in the Church and state, and to serue God in his turne, and then God takes him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>And then the life of every <note place="margin">3 The life of every particular Christian.</note> particular christian is theirs, for God suffers them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it so long as life may be a benefit to gather the more assurance of salvation, and to doe their worke that he hath given them to doe here, and when they have done their worke they are gathered to their Fathers: so that life is the Churches.

VVhen Christ came to die to purchase life, he came not to die, to purchase a sorry life on earth: but he came to die to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase immortall glory, that is the life that Christ came to die for, and to purchase. The day of death is the first birth-day of that life; and for our bodies, they are but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by death, and fitted as Vessells cast into the fire to be moulded and fashioned to be most glorious Vessells after, so our bodies are fitted by the grave, till body and soule be for ever happy at the day of Resurrection, so that <hi>death is ours,</hi> and here upon it is that the <hi>Wiseman</hi> saith, that <hi>The day of death is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

imployment, the stripping of us of all earthly comforts, they will all meete in a cen ter, in a point, at death; a man had neede to gather the greater comfort against that houre, and can we have a greater comfort then this that now it is become our friend, that it is ours? now <hi>Blessed bee GOD, for Iesus Christ,</hi> that hath made in him, even death the bitterest <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 54.</note> thing of all to bee sweete unto us.</p>

            <p>The very judgement of <note place="margin">2 All evill</note> the wicked and the eternall sentence of them, it is the Churches, why?

a company of Reprobates in whom he hath noe delight, by reason of their sins; his mercy much appeares by that, even by the eternall sentence and punishment of wicked men. So all serves to set out the glory and excellency of Gods people. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.

an exuberancy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort above that, it is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent comfort <hi>that nothing shall separate,</hi> noe not <hi>Death</hi> it selfe: but this is more, death is ours, and in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, it shall not onely not separate us from Christ, though it separate soule and body, but joyne us to him, I beseech you take it as a Notion that may heple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>terror</hi> of that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration that is a meanes of conjunction, the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full separation of soule and body.

of all things, even death it selfe, is ours. There are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Vses</hi> but the grand <hi>Vse</hi> which the Apostle mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intends, is. <note place="margin">A Christian sure of the future.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That a Christian is as sure of the time to come, as of the time past, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: we are sure of what we have had, and what we have, but a Christian is in soe firme a condition and state; that he may be as sure of what is to come, as of what he hath, because God and Christ are not onely <hi>Alpha but Omega also.</hi> Christ <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 8.</note> is not only <hi>hee was, and is, but is to come,</hi> he is <hi>Jehova, the same for ever.</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17844:17"/>
and called, and things present cannot hurt us, but they are ours, so are things to come, because God and Christ who is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor under GOD hath the command of all things to come, and therefore we may be as sure of things to come as of things present; what comfort is this to a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; what should become of me if times of trouble and publique calamity should come, or personall to my selfe? what idle forecasts are these, why things to come? come what will come, all shall be for the best, all things <hi>to come are ours</hi> even all things <hi>to come are ours</hi> whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:17844:17"/>
The Apostle goes on and wrappes up all (as it is the manner of inductions) to save labour; for it is in vayne in that manner of reasoning that we call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, to goe over all particulers, because there is the same reason in all; as if he should say <hi>Paul, and the World, and all things are yours;</hi> what should I say more?

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17844:18"/>
It may seeme there is no distinction of propertyes, if all be a Christians, and <note place="margin">1.

            <p>I answer, undoubtedlie there is a distinction of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties <note place="margin">Ans.</note> in the things of this life, though all bee ours, because it is spoken of in another sense, <hi>all is ours,</hi> to helpe us to Heaven; <hi>all is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">How all is ours, and not ours.</note> 
               <hi>ours</hi> in an order to comfort and happinesse, but for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, so all things are not ours; for you know the distinction, some things are common <hi>jure naturae</hi> by the Law of nature, as the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17844:18"/>
Sunne and ayre, and many such like things, and some <hi>jure gentium,</hi> by the Law of nations, it is but some things are common <hi>jure gentium,</hi> but then there are some that by particular mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipall Lawes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>The distinction is establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <note place="margin">Read <hi>Iud</hi> 11. from. 12, <hi>vers.</hi> to 20.</note> both by the Law of God, and the Law of man; Now not to stand long in answering this question, though there be some fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke people that are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubled with those things, Anabaptists and the like, we see in Scripture a distinction of estates. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion takes not away the distinction of Master and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17844:19"/>
Servant, and therefore it takes not away distinction of goods which is lesse. It is a great burden to be a servant, but the Scripture stablisheth the distinction of Master and Servant, and therefore it establisheth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of goods. The Scripture stablisheth Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Almes, If there be not a distinction of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty where were Almes? <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loman</hi> sayth, the Rich, and Poore meete together, God is the maker of both, <hi>Pro.</hi> 22, 2. <hi>Vers.</hi> He meanes not, as men, but as Poore and Rich.</p>
            <p>If Riches be of God, then distinction of properties is of God; for what is Riches but a distinction of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17844:19"/>
if God make Poore, and Rich, then there must bee Poore and Rich. <hi>The Poore you have alwayes with you, Mat.</hi> 26, 11. Therefore the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is <hi>all is yours,</hi> that is all, that we possesse, and all that we neede to helpe us, is ours, in that order and carriage of things that may helpe us, to Heaven, And so the want of things is ours, as well as the having of them; the very things which a Christian wants, are his, not onely the grace of contentment to want but when God takes away those things that are hurtfull for him, that may hinder him in his course to Heaven, that is his; it is his, a part of his Fortion, not to have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17844:20"/>
things if God see it good; the want of things is a part of this Law. That which is commonly alleadged to the contrary is that in the <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 44. <hi>All things were common.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, first, it was partly upon neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, <note place="margin">Ans. 1.</note> if all things had not then been common, they had all been taken from them.</p>
            <p>And then it was, secondly, arbitrary also, <hi>was it thine</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>owne?</hi> sayth <hi>Peter Acts</hi> 5. 4 <hi>Thou mightest not have parted with it if thou wouldst,</hi> it was arbitrary, though it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>And then, thirdly, all things were not common, <note place="margin">3.</note> some good men kept their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17844:20"/>
houses, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. <hi>Mary</hi> had her House, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Vers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then fourthly, all <note place="margin">4.</note> things were common, but How? to distribute as they needed, not to catch who would and who can; but they were so common, as they had a care to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to every one that which they needed</p>
            <p>Another case is this, All <note place="margin">The 2. case concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the right of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill men.</note> is the Churches; all is good peoples, and therefore if a man bee naught, nothing is his. There is a great point of Popery grounded upon this mistake.</p>
            <p>For therefore if Kings be naught, say the Jesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Ob.</note> Papists, the Pope may
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17844:21"/>
excommunicate Princes in <note place="margin">In ordine ad spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia.</note> order to spirituall things, he is the Lord and Monarch of all, because they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill governours, and all is the Churches.</p>
            <p>But we must know, that <note place="margin">Ans.</note> politicall government is not founded upon Religion, that if a Prince be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious he is no King: but it is founded upon nature, so that the Heathen that have noe Religion, yet they may have a Lawfull government, and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; because it is not so built upon Religion, but where that is not, yet this may be, and Gods appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to uphold the World, so that let the King be any
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17844:21"/>
thing or nothing for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is a lawfull King.</p>
            <p>But its further objected, <note place="margin">Ob.</note> That they succeede Christ. &amp;c. and he was the Lord of the World, and they are the Vicars of CHRIST, and therefore they may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possesse and invest whom they will.</p>
            <p>But you must know Christ as man had no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <note place="margin">Ans.</note> at all, but Christ as God-man, Mediator, and so hee hath noe successor.

            <p>
               <hi>All are ours,</hi> doeth not <note place="margin">3. cas.</note>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:17844:22"/>
this hinder bounty? It is mine and therefore I doe not owe any bounty to others, it is mine owne.</p>
            <p>Noe, all things that we <note place="margin">Ans.</note> possesse in this World are ours for the service of the Church, and when Christ calls for any thing that is ours, we must give it: and if we were not lyable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes, if we doe not, yet we are lyable to Gods Law; and Almes, mercy, is Justice in Gods account, for we ought to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Christs. And in the Royall Law, the workes of love and Mercy are Justice, and we <hi>with hold good from the owners,</hi> if we bee not mercifull; for in Religion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17844:23"/>
the poore that by GODS providence are cast on us to provide for, they have a right, though not in Law to challenge it, yet in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: that which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne from them is theirs, we <hi>with-hold good from the owners,</hi> when wee give not: And therefore as <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayeth very well, if thou hast not nourished one, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever in the Law thou art not a murderer, yet before GOD thou art, it is a breach of the Law <hi>thou shalt not steale.</hi> Not to relieve, the very denyall of comfortable Almes, is stealth in Gods esteeme. And therefore though all be ours, yet it is so ours, as that we must
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17844:23"/>
be ready to part with it, when Christ in his members calls for it; for then it is not ours.</p>
            <p>Againe here is another <note place="margin">4 Case.</note> question, If <hi>all bee ours,</hi> we may use a liberty in all things, what and how we list, because <hi>all is ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, the following <note place="margin">Ans.</note> are good consectaries hence, <hi>all is ours,</hi> and therefore with thankefullnes we may use any good Creature of God. <hi>All is ours,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee should not bee scrupulous in the creatures, we should not superstitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly single out one creature from another, as if one were holier then another. <hi>All is ours,</hi> and therefore with a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17844:24"/>
good conscience we may use Gods bounty; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we must not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to use things as wee list, because <hi>all is ours,</hi> there is difference betweene right and the use of that right.</p>
            <p>And Gods children have right to that which God gives them, but they have not the use of that right at all times, at least it may bee suspended. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in case the Lawes forbid the use of this, or that which wee have a right to, and so in case of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall a man hath right to eate or not to eate, but if his eating offend his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he must suspend the use of his right. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17844:24"/>
9. So <hi>all things are ours</hi> in right, not in the use of that right, for then it is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a scandall to the weake brethren, there is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent place for this in the first Epistle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10 25.</note> where he gives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. <hi>Whatsoever is sold in the Shambles that eate asking noe question,</hi> that is, freely take all the creatures of God without scruple, <hi>for the Earth is the Lords and the fullnes thereof. Psal.</hi> 24. 1. GOD out of his bounty spreads a Table for all creatures, for men espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>the eyes of all things looke up unto thee, and thou givest them Meate in due season, Psalme</hi> 145. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:17844:25"/>
               <hi>The Earth is the Lords and the fullnes thereof,</hi> make noe scruple therefore: but marke in <hi>Verse</hi> 28. He restraynes the Vse of that liberty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Psalme</hi> 24. <hi>But if any man say this is offered to an Idoll, and take offence, eate not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake,</hi> till he be better satisfyed, <hi>for the Earth is the Lords and the fullnes thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can the same reasons be <note place="margin">Qu.</note> for contraries?</p>
            <p>Yes, that is for thy selfe, when thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, <note place="margin">Ans.</note> take all things bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God envies not thy liberty, take any refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet needst thou not to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17844:25"/>
eate to offend thy brother; GOD having given thee variety of creatures even in abundance, and hath not limited thee, or that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so that the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answereth both. <hi>The Earth is the LORDS and the fullnes thereof,</hi> Vse it then alone, and not to the scandall of thy Brother, for the Earth is the Lords and the fullnes thereof, why shouldst thou use this creature as if there were noe more but this? and therefore in case of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and offence, we should suspend our liberty, though all be ours.</p>
            <p>Againe though all bee ours, yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17844:26"/>
wee have not a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed Vse, but <hi>by the Word and Prayer,</hi> as it is. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD is good, &amp;c.</hi> his meaning is this, though wee have a right to all things to our comfort, to helpe us to Heaven, to cheere us in our way, to bee, as it were, Chariotts to carry us, yet in the use of that right wee must sanctify all by Prayer; wee must doe it in fayth that wee may apprehend our right, that wee doe not use them with a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous conscience, and then wee must sanctify it with Prayer, wee must take it with GODS leave, for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17844:26"/>
though wee have a right in the use of it, we must take it at his hand.</p>
            <p>And for instance. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives all to his sonne <note place="margin">Simi.</note> that hee needs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth his sonne that hee shall want nothing, but hee will have his Sonne write a <hi>Latter</hi> before hee have a particular right to any thing, hee will have his Sonne acknowledge his homage: you shall have all, but I will heare from you first, you shall have all but I will reach it to you from my hand: soe GOD deales with his children, they have a right to all, but hee reacheth it to them in the use of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17844:27"/>
meanes, wee must have a civill right by labour or by conctract, &amp;c. And then wee must have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious right sanctifyed by Prayer; we must not pull GODS blessings out of his Hands, for though he gives us a right in the thing, yet in the use of that right, he will have us holy men.</p>
            <p>If you aske what is the reason that good men <note place="margin">Qu.</note> oft fall to decay, and have a great many crosses in the World.</p>
            <p>VVhy surely (not to enter into Gods Mysteries, <note place="margin">Ans.</note> what the secret cause of this may be) one among many is, when they have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17844:27"/>
Gods blessings, they san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them not with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they pray not for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, they use them not religiously and holily, and they venture upon their right with scandall and offence to others.</p>
            <p>Well thus we see how all things are ours, with Answers to such Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as might bee moved, all things are ours, that is, howsoever we have a right to the thing yet we must have also a right in the thing.</p>
            <p>To make some use of <note place="margin">Vse.</note> all, and so an end of this Point <hi>All things are ours,</hi> in regard of right to all things, if it bee for our
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17844:28"/>
good, <hi>whether Paul,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas;</hi> here wee <note place="margin">The largnesse of the Churches Ioynture.</note> see then the Rich joynture of a Christian, that all things are his, that is, they are so farre his as shall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his journey to GOD; for though hee have a <hi>Jus,</hi> as I sayd before, to all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, hee shall have in particular nothing conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, but that, that may helpe him to Heaven, if a man say, why have I not the use of such things, GOD in Wisedome sees that it is not fit to bring him to Heaven.</p>
            <p>If poverty be good, I shall have it.</p>
            <p>If disgrace be good, I shall have it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:17844:28"/>
If the order of evill things will helpe me to Heaven, I shall have them.</p>
            <p>If crosse winds will blow me to Heaven, I shall have them.</p>
            <p>For I sayd before, the World and the miseries of the World, the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and afflictions <hi>all are ours,</hi> that is the worst things are commanded to serve for our maine good.</p>
            <p>And is not this a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull prerogative that a Christian hath; that turne him to what condition you <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Singular consolation</hi> For all true Christians</note> will, kill him or spare his life, you hurt him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing eyther wayes? If you spare his life, <hi>life is his,</hi> GOD sees his life is good
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17844:29"/>
for the Church; if you kill him, <hi>Death is his;</hi> kill him, save him, inrich him, beggar him, his happines is not at your command; there is a commanding Power to rule all things, for the good of Gods people that is not at the devotion of any creature in the World, eyther divells or men.</p>
            <p>And therefore let us comfort our selves in this, in regard of the large joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that wee have, wee have all things to be ours. And therefore when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian comes to bee religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to be a true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an indeede, a Member of CHRIST, what doth he loose, he looseth nothing,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17844:29"/>
all things are his, because Christ is his. But to goe on, in the second Branch sayth he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are Christs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is the Tenure we hold all things by, because <hi>wee are Christs,</hi> whatsoever the tenure <hi>in capite</hi> bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men (which you are better acquainted with then my selfe) I know not, I am sure it is the best tenure in Religion. <hi>All is ours,</hi> because <hi>wee are Christs,</hi> we hold all in that tenure, if wee be not Christs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ours comfortably, <hi>we are Christs</hi> and therefore <hi>all is ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:17844:30"/>
Those that are not Christs <note place="margin">Qu.</note> are not the things theirs that they have, because they are not Christs? have not wicked men title to what they have?</p>
            <p>I answer they have, and <note place="margin">Ans.</note> it is rigour in some, that say wicked men are usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of that they have, they have a Title, both a civill Title, and a Title before God. God gave <hi>Nebucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donessar Tirus</hi> as a reward, <note place="margin">Ezek. 29 18 19.</note> and God gives wicked men a Title of that they have, and they shall never bee called to account at the day of judgement for possessing of what they had, but for abusing that possession, and therefore properly they are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17844:30"/>
not usurpers in regard of possession, but they shall render an account of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of that bounty.</p>
            <p>It is in this, as it is in the Kings carriage to a Traitor: when a King gives a Traitor his life, he gives him meate and drinke that may maintayne his life by the same right that hee gives him his life; GOD will have wicked men to live so long, to doe so much service to the Church; for all are not extremely wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that are not CHRISTS Members, that goe to Hell, but there are many of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts, and indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to doe him great
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17844:31"/>
service, though they have an evill eye, and intend not his service, but to raise themselves in the World, yet GOD intends their service for much purpose, and he gives them incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, as hee will not be behind with the worst men, If they doe him service, they shall have their reward in that kinde, <hi>Psalme</hi> 62. 12. If it be in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of state, they shall have it in that, and they shall have commendations and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of men; if they looke for that: and if he give them not Heaven, they can not complayne, for they cared not for that, they did it not with an eye for that; now
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17844:31"/>
if God use the labour, and the industry, and the parts, and indowments of wicked men for excellent purposes, he will give them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for outward thinges, <hi>Verily you have your reward,</hi> sayth Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 2. when he gives them life he gives them outward liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore they are noe usurpers in that regard, yet those have not so full a Title as a Christian hath, to that they have.</p>
            <p>Now to come more directly to the Second <note place="margin">How wee are Christs.</note> Branch and to shew; how <hi>wee are Christs.</hi> I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded that Poynt upon another Text, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will but touch it here,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17844:32"/>
because there bee divers here that did not heare the unfolding of that Text. <hi>My beloved is mine and I am his, Can.</hi> 6. 3. <note place="margin">Cant. 6. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Not to speake of creation, <note place="margin">1. By his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he made all things, but we are Christs by his redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and purchase, <hi>he purchased his Church with his owne blood, Acts</hi> 20. 28.</p>
            <p>And secondly, wee are <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17844:32"/>
are his Schollers, as he is a Prophet; we are his Spouse, as he is a husband; we are Members, as he is an Head; you cannot name any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of subjection, if it be a sweete subjection and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, but we are that to Christ, and Christ is that to us, so that <hi>Christ is ours,</hi> and <hi>we are Christs</hi> in all the sweete relations that can be, we are his Members, we are his Spouse, we are his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for he is <hi>the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father Isa.</hi> 9. 6. He is all that can be to us, and we are all that can be to him that is lovely and good, we are Christs, and therefore all things are ours, because we are Christs, so that we
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17844:33"/>
see from this, that Christ comes in betweene GOD and us. GOD is a pure and holy GOD, <hi>A consuming fire,</hi> and we as chaffe and dust, and therefore CHRIST comes betweene, <hi>you are Christs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>Because God is <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming fire</hi> of himselfe, there <note place="margin">Christ is our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and Why.</note> must be a Mediator, to come betweene, who is a friend to both sides, to us as man, to him as <hi>GOD,</hi> So must bee a meanes of conveying all things from <hi>GOD;</hi> all things come originally from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all, <hi>God,</hi> they are <hi>Gods,</hi> and in <hi>God</hi> you know the three Persons

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17844:34"/>
boldnes, and that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine downe-ward might doe all things with due satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his justice, because we are as stuble, and <hi>God a consuming fire,</hi> were not Christ in the middle what entercourse could there be betweene the Lord and us? noe other than betweene the fire, and the stuble, Majesty on his side, and Misery and sinne on ours, there must be a Mediator, to bring these two contraries together. And therefore <hi>all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">All good comes to us from God through Christ.</note> 
               <hi>is ours,</hi> because <hi>we are Christs, and Christ is Gods;</hi> so all comes downeward through Christ, from God to us, <hi>God</hi> doth all in Christ to us, he chooseth us in Christ and

sanctifyes us in Christ, he bestowes all spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings on us in Christ, as Members of Christ, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes all through Christ.

            <p>Now all things come downeward from GOD <note place="margin">All must be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God through Christ.</note> through Christ, so from us to <hi>God</hi> upward, <hi>all is ours, and we are Christs, and Christ is Gods,</hi> and therefore we have noe entercourse with that great <hi>God,</hi> who is a consuming fire, if we be to deale with him in himselfe, but through Christ, and therefore we aske all in Christs name.

            <p>As the waters of the Sea, though they be salt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they are stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the Earth are sweete in the rivers, so though the justice of <hi>God</hi> be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing, yet when it comes through Christ to
