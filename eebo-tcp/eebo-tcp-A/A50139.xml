            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY the special Disposal and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Almighty God, there now comes abroad into the world, a little History of several very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing <hi>Witchcrafts and Possessions,</hi> which partly my own <hi>Ocular Observation,</hi> &amp; partly my <hi>undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Information,</hi> hath enabled me to offer unto the publick Notice of my Neighbours. It must be the <hi>Subject,</hi> and not the <hi>Manner</hi> or the <hi>Author</hi> of this Writing, that has made any people desire its Publication; For there are such obvious <hi>Defects</hi> in <hi>Both,</hi> as would render me very unreasonable if I should with about <hi>This</hi> or <hi>Any</hi> Composure of mine, <hi>O That it were printed in a book!</hi> But tho there want not <hi>Faults</hi> in the Discourse, to give me Discontent enough, my Displeasure at <hi>them</hi> will be recompensed by the Satisfaction I take in my <hi>Dedication</hi> of it; which I now, no less <hi>properly</hi> than <hi>cheerfully</hi> make unto Your Self; whom I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon among the <hi>Best</hi> of my <hi>Friends,</hi> and the <hi>Ablest</hi> of my <hi>Readers.</hi> Your <hi>Knowledge</hi> has <hi>Qualified</hi> You to make those Reflections on the following Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which <hi>few</hi> can <hi>Think,</hi> and tis not <hi>fit</hi> that <hi>all</hi> should <hi>See.</hi> How far the <hi>Platonic Notions</hi> of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> which were, it may be, much more espous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those <hi>primitive</hi> Christians and Scholars that we call <hi>The Fathers,</hi> than they seem countenanced in the ensuing <hi>Narratives;</hi> are to be allow'd by a serious man, your <hi>Scriptural Divinity,</hi> join'd with Your most <hi>Rational Philosophy,</hi> will help You to

judge at an <hi>uncommon</hi> rate.

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe old Heresy of the sensual <hi>Sadducees,</hi> denying the Being of Angels either good or evil, died not with them; nor <hi>will</hi> it, whiles men (abandoning both Faith &amp; Reason) count it their wisdom to credit nothing but what they see &amp; feel. How much this fond opinion has gotten ground in this debauched Age is aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully observable; and what a dangerous stroak it gives to settle men in Atheism, is not hard to discern. God is therefore pleased (besides the witness born to the Truth in Sacred Writ) to fuffer <hi>Devils</hi> sometimes to do such things in the world as shall stop the mouth of gain say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and extort a Confession from them.</p>
            <p>It has also been made a doubt by some, whether there are any such things as <hi>Witches,</hi> i. e. <hi>Such as by Contract or Explicit Covenant with the Devil, improve, or rather are improved by him to the doing of things strange in themselves, and besides their natural Course.</hi> But (besides that the <hi>Word of God</hi> assures us that there have been such, and given order about them) no Age passes without some apparent <hi>Demonstration</hi> of it. For, Though it be Folly to impute every dubious Accident, or unwonted Effect of Providence, to <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> yet there are <hi>some</hi> things which cannot be excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, but must be ascribed <hi>hither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Angels &amp; Men</hi> not being made for civil Converse together in this world; and all <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>Devils</hi> being interdicted us; their Nature also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>spiritual,</hi> and the Word of God having said so little in that particular concerning their way of <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49306:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hence it is that we can disclose but a <hi>little</hi> of those <hi>Mysteries of Darkness;</hi> all reports that are from <hi>themselves,</hi> or <hi>their Instruments,</hi> being to be esteemed as <hi>Illusions,</hi> or at least covered with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,</hi> filled with the Impostures of the <hi>Father of Lies;</hi> and the effects which come under our consideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mysterious,</hi> rather <hi>Posing</hi> than <hi>Informing</hi> us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Secrets</hi> also of God's <hi>Providence,</hi> in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Satan</hi> and his Instruments to molest His chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not in their Estates only, but in their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> and their <hi>Posterity</hi> too, are part of His <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are unsearchable, and His Wayes that are past finding out;</hi> only <hi>this</hi> we have good Assurance for, that they are among the <hi>All things that work together for their good.</hi> Their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are hereby <hi>tried,</hi> their Vnprightness is made <hi>known,</hi> their Faith and <hi>Patience have their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the many Instances that have been of this kind, <hi>That</hi> which is Recorded in this <hi>Narrative,</hi> is worthy to be commended to the Notice of Mankind, it being a thing in it self full of Memorable passages, and <hi>faithfully</hi> recorded, acording to the Truth in Matrer of Fact, scarce any Instance being asserted in it, but what hath the Evidence of <hi>many credible Witnesses,</hi> did need require. Among others who had frequent Occasions to observe these things, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author of this short History, was spirited to be more than ordinarily engaged in attending, and making
<pb facs="tcp:49306:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
particular <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the several passages occurr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein; and hath accordingly written, very little besides what <hi>Himself</hi> was an <hi>eye-witness</hi> of, together with others; and the rest was gathered up with much <hi>Accuracy</hi> and <hi>Caution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its needless for us to insist upon the <hi>Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> either of the <hi>Author</hi> or the <hi>Work;</hi> the <hi>former</hi> is known in the <hi>Churches;</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> will <hi>speak</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for it <hi>self.</hi> All that we shall offer to stay the Reader from passing over to satisfy himself in that which follows, is only thus much, <hi>Viz.</hi> That the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Account will afford to him that shall read with <hi>Observation,</hi> a further clear <hi>Confirmation,</hi> That, <hi>There is both a GOD, and a Devil, and Witchcraft:</hi> That, <hi>There is no out-ward Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, but what God may (and sometimes</hi> doth) <hi>permit Satan to trouble His people withal:</hi> That, <hi>The Malice of Satan and his Instruments, is very great against the Children of God:</hi> That, <hi>The clearest Gospel-Light shining in a place, will not keep some from entring</hi> hellish <hi>Contracts with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Spirits:</hi> That, <hi>Prayer is a powerful and effectual Remedy against the malicious practises of Devils and those in Covenant with them:</hi> That, <hi>They who will obtain such Mercies of God, must pray unto Perseverance:</hi> That, <hi>God often gives to His people some apparent Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their Faith in Prayer, tho He does not presently perfect the Deliverance sought for:</hi> That, <hi>God Grace is able to support His Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb facs="tcp:49306:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>IT was once the Mistake of one gone to the <hi>Congregation of the Dead,</hi> concerning the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivers, <hi>If one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</hi> The blessed God hath made some to <hi>come from the Damned,</hi> for the <hi>Conviction</hi> (may it also be for the <hi>Conversion</hi>) of us that are yet <hi>alive.</hi> The <hi>Devils</hi> themselves are by Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion come to consute the <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Sadducism,</hi> and to reprove the <hi>Madness</hi> of <hi>ungodly men.</hi> Those condemned prisoners of our <hi>Atmosphaere,</hi> have not <hi>really</hi> sent <hi>Letters of Thanks</hi> from <hi>Hell,</hi> to those that are on <hi>Earth,</hi> promoting of their Interest; yet they have been forced, as of old, <hi>To confess that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus was the Holy one of God,</hi> so of late, <hi>to declare that Sin &amp; Vice are the things which they are delighted in.</hi> But should one of those hideous <hi>Wights</hi> appear <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly</hi> with fiery <hi>chains</hi> upon him, &amp; utter <hi>audibly</hi> his <hi>roarings</hi> &amp; his <hi>warnings</hi> in one of our <hi>Congregations</hi> it would not produce <hi>new Hearts</hi> in those whom the <hi>Scriptures</hi> handled in <hi>our Ministry</hi> do not affect.

                  <hi>Section</hi> I. THere dwell at his time, in the <hi>south</hi> part of <hi>Boston,</hi> a sober &amp; pious man, whose Name is <hi>Iohn Goodwin,</hi> whose <hi>Trade</hi> is that of a <hi>Mason,</hi> and whose <hi>Wife</hi> (to which a <hi>Good Report</hi> gives a share with him in all the Characters of <hi>Vertue</hi>) has made him the Father of <hi>six</hi> (now living) <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Of these Children, all but the <hi>Eldest,</hi> who works with his Father at his Calling, and the <hi>Youngest,</hi> who lives yet upon the Breast of its mother, have laboured under the direful eff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ects of a (no less <hi>palpable</hi> than) stupendous <hi>WITCHCRAFT.</hi> Indeed that exempted <hi>Son</hi> had also, as was thought, some lighter <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> in unaccountable stabbs and pains now &amp; then upon him; as indeed every person in the Family at some time or other had, except the <hi>godly Father,</hi> and the <hi>sucking Infant,</hi> who never felt any impressions of it. But these <hi>Four</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren mentioned, were handled in so sad &amp; <hi>strange</hi> a manner, as has given matter of <hi>Discourse</hi> and <hi>Wonder</hi> to all the Countrey, and of <hi>History</hi> not unworthy to be considered by more than all the <hi>serious</hi> of the <hi>curious</hi> Readers in this <hi>New-English</hi> World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49306:7"/>SECT. II. The four Children (whereof the <hi>Eldest</hi> was about Thirteen, and the <hi>youngest</hi> was perhaps about a third part so many years of age) had enjoy'd a Religious Education, and <hi>answered</hi> it with a very towardly Ingenuity. They had an observable Affection unto <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Sacred</hi> things; and those of them that were capable of it, seem'd to have such a Resentment of their <hi>eternal</hi> Concernments as is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther usual. Their Parents also kept them to a continual Employment, which did <hi>more</hi> than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from the Temptations of <hi>Idleness,</hi> and as young as they were, they took a delight in it; It may be <hi>as much</hi> as they should have done. In a word, Such was the whole <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> of the Children, that there cannot easily be any thing more unreasonable, than to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that a <hi>Design to Dissemble</hi> could cause them to fall into any of their odd Fits; though there should not have happened, as there <hi>did,</hi> &amp; thousand Things, wherein it was perfectly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any <hi>Dissimulation</hi> of theirs to produce what scores of spectators were amazed at.</p>
               <p>SECT. III. About <hi>Midsummer,</hi> in the year 1688. the <hi>Eldest</hi> of these Children, who is a <hi>Daughter,</hi> saw cause to examine their Washer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, upon their missing of some <hi>Linnen,</hi> which twas fear'd she had stollen from them; and of what use this <hi>Linnen</hi> might bee to serve the <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> intended, <hi>the Theef's Tempter knows.</hi> This
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49306:7"/>
                  <hi>Laundress</hi> was the Daughter of an ignorant and a scandalous old Woman in the Neighbourhood; whose miserable Husband before he died, had sometimes complained of her, that she was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a <hi>Witch,</hi> and that whenever his Head was laid, she would quickly arrive unto the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments due to such an one. This Woman in her daughters Defence bestow'd very had Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage upon the <hi>Girl</hi> that put her to the question; immediately upon which, the poor child became variously indisposed in her health, and visited with <hi>strange Fits,</hi> beyond those that attend an <hi>Epilepsy,</hi> or a <hi>Catalepsy,</hi> or those that they call <hi>The Diseases of Astonishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECT. IV. It was not long before <hi>one</hi> of her Sisters, and <hi>two</hi> of her Brothers, were seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in Order one after another, with <hi>Affects</hi> like those that molested <hi>her.</hi> Within a few weeks, they were all <hi>four</hi> tortured every where in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner so very grievous, that it would have broke an heart of stone to have seen their Agonies. Skilful Physicians were consulted for their Help, and particularly our worthy and prudent Friend Dr. <hi>Thomas Oakes,</hi> who found himself fo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by the Distempers of the children, that he concluded nothing but an hellish <hi>Witchcraft</hi> could be the Original of these Maladies. And that which yet more confirmed such Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, That for one good while, the children were tormented just in the <hi>same part</hi> of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49306:8"/>
all at the <hi>same time</hi> together; and the they saw and heard not one anothers complaints, tho likewise their pains and sprains were swift like Lightening, yet when (suppose) the <hi>Neck,</hi> or the <hi>hand,</hi> or the <hi>Back</hi> of <hi>one</hi> was Rack't, so it was at that instant with t'<hi>other</hi> too.</p>
               <p>SECT. V. The variety of their tortures increased continually; and tho about Nine or Ten at Night they alwaies had a Release from their miseries, and <hi>ate</hi> &amp; <hi>slept</hi> all night for the most part indifferently well, yet in the <hi>day</hi> time they were handled with so many <hi>sorts</hi> of Ails, that it would require of us almost as much time to <hi>Relate</hi> them all, as it did of them to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure</hi> them. Sometimes they would be <hi>Deaf,</hi> sometimes <hi>Dumb,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Blind,</hi> and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>all this</hi> at once. One while their <hi>Tongues</hi> would be drawn down their Throats; another<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while they would be pull'd out upon their <hi>Chins,</hi> to a prodigious length. They would have their <hi>Mouths</hi> opened unto such a Wideness, that their <hi>Iaws</hi> went out of joint; and anon they would clap together again with a Force like that of a strong <hi>Spring-Lock.</hi> The same would happen to their <hi>Shoulder-Blades,</hi> and their <hi>Elbows,</hi> and <hi>Hand-wrists,</hi> and several of their joints. They would at times Iy in a benummed condition; and be drawn together as those that are ty'd <hi>Neck</hi> &amp; <hi>Heels;</hi> and presently be <hi>stretched out,</hi> yea, drawn <hi>Backwards,</hi> to such a degree that it was fear'd the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49306:8"/>
very skin of their Bellies would have crack'd. They would make most pitteous out-cries, that they were cut with <hi>Knives,</hi> and struck with <hi>Blows</hi> that they could not bear. Their <hi>Necks</hi> would be broken, so that their <hi>Neck-bone</hi> would seem dissolved unto them that felt after it; and yet on the sudden, it would become again so <hi>stiff</hi> that there was no stirring of their <hi>Heads;</hi> yea, their Heads would be twisted almost <hi>round;</hi> and if <unclear>main</unclear> Force at any time obstructed a dangerous motion which they seem'd to be upon, they would roar exceedingly. Thus they lay some weeks most pittiful Spectacles; and this while as a further Demonstration of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in these horrid Effects, when I went to <hi>Prayer</hi> by one of them, that was very desireous to hear what I said, the Child utterly <hi>lost</hi> her Hearing till our <hi>Prayer</hi> was over.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>VI.</hi> It was a <hi>Religious Family</hi> that these Afflictions happened unto; and none but a <hi>Religious Contrivance</hi> to obtain Releef, would have been welcome to them. Many <hi>superstitious</hi> proposals were made unto them, by persons that were I know not <hi>who,</hi> nor <hi>what,</hi> with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments fetch't from I know not how much <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> and <hi>Experience;</hi> but the distressed Parents rejected all such counsils, with a gracious Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to oppose <hi>Devils</hi> with no other weapons but <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears,</hi> unto HIM that has the Chaining of them; and to try first whether <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49306:9"/>
were not the best things to encounter <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts</hi> with. Accordingly they requested the fo<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Ministers of <hi>Boston,</hi> with the Minister of <hi>Charls<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>town</hi> to keep a <hi>Day of Prayer</hi> at their thus haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted house; which they did in the Company of some devout people there. Immediately upon <hi>this Day,</hi> the youngest of the four children was delivered, and never felt any trouble as asore. But there was yet a <hi>greater Effect</hi> of these our Applications unto our GOD!</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>VII.</hi> The Report of the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Family for which we were thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, arrived now unto the ears of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,</hi> who presently and prudently apply'd themselves, with a just vigour, to enquire into the story. The Father of the Children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his Neighbour, the suspected ill wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose name was <hi>Glover;</hi> and she being sent for by the Justices, gave such a wretched Account of her self, that they saw cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her unto the Gaolers Custody. <hi>Goodwin</hi> had no proof that could have done her any Hurt but the <hi>Hag</hi> had not power to deny her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the Enchantment of the Children; and when she was asked, <hi>Whether she believed there was a God?</hi> her Answer was too blasphemous and horrible for any Pen of mine to mention An Experiment was made, Whether she <hi>could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Lords Prayer;</hi> and it was found, that tho clause after clause was most carefully repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49306:9"/>
unto her, yet when she said it after them that prompted her, she could not possibly avoid making <hi>Nonsense</hi> of it, with some ridiculous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations. This Experiment I had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity since to see made upon <hi>two more,</hi> and it had the fame Event. Upon the Commitment of this <hi>extraordinary Woman,</hi> all the Children had some present ease; until one (related unto <hi>her</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally meeting one or two of them, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them with her <hi>Blessing,</hi> that is, <hi>Railing;</hi> upon which <hi>Three</hi> of them fell il again, as they were before.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>VIII.</hi> It was not long before the <hi>Witch</hi> thus in the Trap, was brought upon her <hi>Tryal;</hi> at which, thro' the Efficacy of a <hi>Charm,</hi> I suppose, used upon her, by <hi>one</hi> or <hi>some</hi> of her Crue, the Court could receive Answers from her in none but the <hi>Irish,</hi> which was her <hi>Native</hi> Language; altho she understood the <hi>English</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and had accustomed her whole Family to none but <hi>that</hi> Language in her former Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore the Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Bench</hi> and the <hi>Bar,</hi> was now cheefly convey'd by two honest and faithful men that were <hi>Interpreters.</hi> It was long before she could with any direct Answers plead unto her <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and when she <hi>did</hi> plead, it was with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> rather than <hi>Denial</hi> of her Guilt. Order was given to search the old womans house, from whence there were brought into the Court, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

small <hi>Images,</hi> or <hi>Puppets,</hi> or <hi>Babies,</hi> made of Raggs, and stuff't with <hi>Goats hair,</hi> and other such Ingredients. When these were produced, the vile Woman acknowledged, that her way to torment the Objects of her malice, was by wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her <hi>Finger</hi> with her <hi>Spittle,</hi> and stroaking of those little <hi>Images.</hi> The abused Children were then <unclear>present</unclear>, and the Woman still kept stooping and shrinking as one that was almost prest to Death with a mighty Weight upon her. But one of the <hi>Images</hi> being brought unto her, immediately she started up after an odd manner, and took it into her hand; but she had no sooner taken <hi>it,</hi> than <hi>one</hi> of the Children fell into sad <hi>Fits</hi> before the <hi>whole Assembly.</hi> This the Judges had their just Apprehensions at; and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly causing the Repetition of the Experiment, found again the same event of it. They asked her, <hi>Whether she had any to stand by her:</hi> She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>She had;</hi> and looking very pertly in the <hi>Air,</hi> she added, <hi>No, He's gone.</hi> And she then confessed, that she had <hi>One,</hi> who was her <hi>Prince,</hi> with whom she maintain'd, I know not what Communion. For which cause, the night after, she was heard expostulating with a <hi>Devil,</hi> for his thus deserting her; telling him that <hi>Because hee had served her so basely and falsly, she had confess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all.</hi> However to make all clear, The Court appointed five or six <hi>Physicians,</hi> one evening to examine her very strictly, whether she were not

one of her children, a fine boy, well grown towards Youth, was taken ill, just in the same woful and surprising manner that <hi>Goodmins</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were. One night particularly, The Boy said he saw a <hi>Black thing</hi> with a <hi>Blue Cap</hi> in the Room, Tormenting of him; and he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most bitterly of a <hi>Hand</hi> put into the Bed; to pull out his Bowels. The next day the mother of the boy went unto <hi>Glover,</hi> in the Prison, and asked her, <hi>Why she tortured her poor lad at such a wicked rate?</hi> This Witch replied, that she did it because of wrong done to her self &amp; her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Hughes</hi> denied (as well she might) that she had <hi>done her any wrong. Well then,</hi> sayes <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Let me see your child and he shall be well again.

I shall therefore add, That my Grandfather <hi>Cottons</hi> Catechism called <hi>Milk for Babes,</hi> and <hi>The Assemblies Catechism,</hi> would bring hideous <hi>Convulsions</hi> on the Child if she <hi>look't</hi> into them; tho she had once learn't them with all the love that could be.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>XXI.</hi> I was not unsensible that this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49306:18"/>
Girls Capacity or incapacity to read, was no <hi>Test</hi> for <hi>Truth</hi> to be determin'd by, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did not proceed much further in this <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Business,</hi> not knowing What snares the Devils might lay for us in the Tryals. A <hi>few</hi> further Tryals, I confess, I did make; but <hi>what</hi> the event of 'em was, I shall not relate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would not offend. But that which most made me to wonder was, That one bringing to her a certain <hi>Prayer Book,</hi> she not only <hi>could</hi> Read it very well, but also <hi>did</hi> read a large part of it over; and calling it <hi>Her Bible,</hi> she took in in a delight and put on it a Respect more than Ordinary. If she were going into her <hi>tortures,</hi> at the offer of this <hi>Book,</hi> she would come out of her sits, and read; and her Attendents were almost under a Temptation to use it as a <hi>Charm,</hi> to make and keep her <hi>quiet.</hi> Only, When she came to the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> (now and then oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing in this Book) she would have her eyes put out, so that she must turn over a new leaf, and then she could <hi>read again.</hi> Whereas also there are Scriptures in that Book, she could read them <hi>there,</hi> but if I show'd her the very <hi>same</hi> Scriptures in the <hi>Bible,</hi> she should soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Dy than read them. And she was likewise made unable to read the <hi>Psalms</hi> in an apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meeter, which this prayer book had in the same volumne with it. There were, I think I may say; no less than <hi>Multitudes</hi> of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49306:18"/>
to this odd thing; and I should not have been a faithful and honest Historian, if I had withheld from the World <hi>this part</hi> of my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: But I make no Reflections on it. Those inconsiderable men that are provoked at it (if any shall be of so little <hi>Sense</hi> as to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked) must be angry at the <hi>Devils,</hi> and not at <hi>me; their Malice,</hi> and not <hi>my Writing,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the Blame of any Aspersion which a <hi>true History,</hi> may seem to cast on a Book that some have enough manifested their Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>XXII.</hi> There was another most unaccountable Circumstance which now attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her; and until she came to our House, I think, she never had Experience of it. Ever now and then, an <hi>Invisible Horse</hi> would be brought unto her, by those whom she only called, <hi>them,</hi> and, <hi>Her Company:</hi> upon the Approach of Which, her eyes would be still closed up; for (said she) They say, I am a <hi>Tell-Tale,</hi> and therefore they will not let me see them. Upon this would she give a Spring as one mounting an <hi>Horse,</hi> and Settling her self in a <hi>Riding-Posture,</hi> she would in her Chair be agitated as one sometimes <hi>Amble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> sometimes <hi>Trotting,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping</hi> very furiously.

by the stress of her feet, upon the ground; for often she touch't it not; but she mostly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in her Chair, though sometimes in her <hi>hard Trott</hi> we doubted she would have been toss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the Back of it. Once being angry at his Dulness, When she said, she would cut off his head if she had a knife, I gave her my <hi>Sheath, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi> she suddenly gave <hi>her self</hi> a stroke on the Neck, but complain'd, <hi>it would not cut.</hi> When she had rode a minute or <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> shee'd pretend to be at a Rendezvous with <hi>Them,</hi> that were <hi>Her Company;</hi> there shee'd maintain a <hi>Discourse</hi> with them, and asking many Questions concerning <hi>her self,</hi> (for <hi>we</hi> gave her none of <hi>ours</hi>) shee'd <hi>Listen</hi> much, and Received <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers</hi> from them that indeed none but her self perceived.

and be carried odly <hi>on the Floor,</hi> from one part of the Room to another, in the postures of a Riding Woman. If any of us asked her, Who her Company were? She generally replyed, I don't know. But if we were instant in our Demand, she would with some <hi>witty</hi> Flout or other turn it off. Once I said, Child, if you can't tell their Names, pray tell me what Clothes they have on; and the Words were <hi>no sooner</hi> out of my <hi>mouth,</hi> but she was laid for <hi>dead</hi> upon the <hi>Floor.</hi>

Accordingly, when her <hi>Horse</hi> came to her again, to our Admiration she <hi>Ends</hi> (that is, was <hi>tossed</hi> as one that <hi>rode</hi> up the stairs: there then stood open the <hi>Stuay</hi> of one belonging to the Family, into <hi>which</hi> entring, she stood immediately upon her Feet, and cry'd out, They are gone; they are gone! They say, that they cannot,—God won't let 'em come here! She also added a Reason for it, which the <hi>Owner of the Study</hi> thought more <hi>kind</hi> than <hi>true.</hi> And she presently and perfectly came to her self, so that her <hi>whole Discourse</hi> &amp; Carriage was altered unto the greatest measure of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and she satt Reading of the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Good Books,</hi> for a good part of the Afternoon. Her Affairs calling her anon to go down again, the <hi>Daemons</hi> were in a quarter of a minute as bad
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49306:20"/>
upon her as before, and her <hi>Horse</hi> was Waiting for her. I understanding of it, <hi>immediately</hi> would have her up to the <hi>study</hi> of the young man where she had been at ease before; meerly to try Whether there had not been a Fallacy in what had newly happened: but she was now so <hi>twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and <hi>iprithen,</hi> that it gave me much trouble to get her into my Arms, and much more to drag her up the stairs. She was pulled out of my hands, and when I recovered my Hold, she was thrust so hard upon me, that I had almost fallen backwards, and her own breast was sore afterwards, by their Compressions to detain her; she seem'd heavier indeed that three of her self. With incredible Forcing (tho <hi>she</hi> kept Scream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, They say I must not go in!) at length we pull'd her in; <hi>where</hi> she was no sooner come, but she could stand on her Feet, and with an <hi>altered tone,</hi> could thank me, saying, <hi>now I am well.</hi> At first shee'd be somewhat faint, and say, She felt some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing go out of her; but in a <hi>minute</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> she could attend any Devotion, or Business as well as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in her Life; and both <hi>spoke</hi> and <hi>did</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a person of good Discretion.</p>
               <p>I was loth to make a <hi>Charm of</hi> the Room; yet some strangers that came to visit us, the Week after, desiring to see the <hi>Exporiment</hi> made, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted more than <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Repetitions of it; and it still succeded as I have declared. Once when I was assisting 'em in carrying of her u, she
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49306:20"/>
was torn out of all our hands; &amp; to my self, she cry'd out, Mr. <hi>M,— One of them is going to push you down the stairs, have a care.</hi> I remember not that I <hi>felt</hi> any Thrust or <hi>Blow;</hi> but I think I was unaccountably made to <hi>step down backward two or three stairs,</hi> and within a <hi>few</hi> hours she told me by <hi>whom</hi> it was.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>XXIV.</hi> One of those that had bin concerned for her <hi>Welfare,</hi> had newly implored the great GOD that the <hi>young woman</hi> might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to declare <hi>whom</hi> she apprehended her self troubled by. Presently upon this her Horse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, only it pestered her with such <hi>ugly paces,</hi> that she fell out with <hi>her Company,</hi> &amp; threatned now to tell all, for their so abusing her. <hi>I was</hi> going abroad, and she said unto them that were about her, <hi>Mr. M.— is gone abroad my horse won't come back, till he come home; and then I belieue</hi> (said she softly,) <hi>I shall tell him all.</hi> I staid abroad an hour or <hi>two,</hi> and then Returning, When I was just come to my Gate, before I had given the least <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Noise</hi> of my being there, she said, My Horse is come! and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that I was at the Door. When I came in, I found her mounted after her fashion, upon her <hi>Aerial Steed;</hi> which carried her Fancy to the Journeys end. There (or rather <hi>then</hi>) she maintained a considerable Discourse with <hi>Her Company,</hi> Listening very attentively when she had propounded any Question, and receiving the

                  <hi>Answers</hi> with impressions made upon her mind. She said; <hi>Well what do you say?

                  <hi>hurt: they</hi> try, <hi>but they say they can't.</hi> So she returns and at once, Dismissing her Horse, and opening her eyes, she call'd me to her, <hi>Now Sir,</hi> (said she) <hi>I'll tell you all.

The children were miserably tortured, while we laboured in our <hi>Prayers;</hi> but our good God was high unto us, in what we call'd upon Him for. From this day the power of the Enemy was broken; and the children, though Assaults after this were made upon them, yet were not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49306:22"/>
so cruelly handled as before. The <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Children encreased daily more and more, and their <hi>Vexation</hi> abated by degrees; till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little while they arrived to <hi>Perfect Ease,</hi> which for some <hi>weeks</hi> or <hi>months</hi> they <hi>cheerfully</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Thus <hi>Good it is for us to draw near to God.</hi>

               <p>SECT. <hi>XXVI.</hi> Within a day or <hi>two</hi> after the <hi>East,</hi> the young Woman had two remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attempts made upon her, by her invisible Adversaries. Once, <hi>they were Dragging her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Oven that was then heating,</hi> while there was none in the Room to help her. She clap't her hands on the <hi>Mantle-tree</hi> to save her self; but they were beaten off; and she had been burned, if at her Out-cryes one had not come in from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for her Relief. Another time, <hi>they</hi> putt an unseen <hi>Rope</hi> with a cruel <hi>Noose</hi> about her Neck, Whereby she was choaked, until she was black in the Face; and though it was taken off before it had kill'd her, yet there were the red Marks of <hi>it,</hi> and of a <hi>Finger</hi> &amp; a <hi>Thumb</hi> near it, remaining to be seen for a while afterwards.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>XXVII.</hi> This was the last Molest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that <hi>they</hi> gave her for a While; and she dwelt at my house the rest of the Winter, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an obliging and vertuous Conversation, made her self enough Welcome to the Family. But within about a Fortnight, she was visited with <hi>two dayes</hi> of as Extraordinary Obsessions as any we had been the Spectators of. I thought it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49306:22"/>
convenient for me to entertain my Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a <hi>Sermon</hi> upon the <hi>memorable Providences</hi> which these Children had been concerned in. When I had begun to study my Sermon, her <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors</hi> again seiz'd upon her; and all <hi>Fryday</hi> &amp; <hi>Saturday,</hi> did <hi>they</hi> manage her with a special De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, as was plain, to disturb me in what I was about. In the worst of her extravagancies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, she was more dutiful to my self than I had reason to Expect, but <hi>now</hi> her <hi>whole</hi> carriage to me, was with a Sauciness that I had not been us'd to be treated with. She would knock at my Study <hi>Door,</hi> affirming, <hi>That some below would be glad to see me;</hi> when there was none that ask't for me. She would call to me with multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Impertinencies, and throw small things at me wherewith she could not give me any hurt. Shee'd Hector me at a strange rate for the <hi>work</hi> I was at, and threaten me with <hi>I know not what</hi> mischief for it. She got a <hi>History</hi> that I had Written of this <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and tho she had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, readd it over and over, yet now she could not read (I believe) one entire Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of it; but she made of it the most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Travesty</hi> in the World, with such a Patness and excess of Fancy, to supply the sense that she put upon it, as I was amazed at. And she par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly told me, That <hi>I should quickly come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace by that History.</hi>

I was in <hi>Latin</hi> telling some young Gentlemen of the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> That if I should bid her <hi>Look</hi> to God, her <hi>Eyes</hi> would be put out, upon <hi>which</hi> her eyes were presently served so. I was in some surprize, When I saw that her <hi>Troublers</hi> understood <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> and it made me willing to try a little more of <hi>their</hi> Capacity. We continually found, that if an <hi>English Bible</hi> were in any part of the <hi>Room</hi> seriously look'd into, though she <hi>saw</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> nothing of it, she would immediately be in very dismal <hi>Agonies.</hi> We now made a Tryal more than once or twice, of the <hi>Greek</hi> New-Testament, and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Old Testament; and We still found, That if one should go to read in it never so secretly and silently, it would procure her that Anguish, Which there was no enduring of. But, I thought, (at length,) I fell upon one <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> Language which the <hi>Damons</hi> did not seem, <hi>so well</hi> to understand.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>XXIX. Devotion</hi> was now, as <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly</hi> the terriblest of all the provocations that could be given her. I could by no means bring her to <hi>own,</hi> That <hi>she desired the mercies of God and the prayers of good men.</hi> I would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a <hi>Sign</hi> of such a Desire, by her Listing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49306:23"/>
up of her hand; but she stirr'd it not: I then listed up her hand my self, and though the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by thought a more insignificant thing could not be propounded, I said, Child, If you desire those things, let your hand <hi>fall,</hi> when I take mine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: I took my hand away, and hers continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed strangely and <hi>stifly</hi> stretched out, so that for some time, she could not take it <hi>down.</hi> During these two dayes we had Prayers oftener in our Family than at other times; and this was her usual Behaviour at them. The man that prayed, usually began with <hi>Reading</hi> the <hi>Word of God;</hi> which once as he was going to do, she call'd to him, Read of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom the Lord cast seven Devils, During the time of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> she would be laid as one fast asleep; but when <hi>Prayer</hi> was begun, the Devils would still <hi>throw her on the Floor,</hi> at the feet of him, that prayed. There would she lye and Whistle and sing and roar, to <hi>drown</hi> the voice of the Prayer; but that being a little too audible for <hi>Them,</hi> they would shutt close her <hi>Mouth</hi> and her ears, and yet make such odd noises in her <hi>Throat</hi> as that she her self could not hear our Cries to God for her. Shee'd also fetch very terrible <hi>Blowes</hi> with her Fist, and <hi>Kicks</hi> with her Foot at the man that prayed; but still (for he had bid that none should hinder her) her <hi>Fist</hi> and <hi>Foot,</hi> would alwaies recoil, when they came within a few hairs breadths of him just as if Rebounding
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49306:24"/>
against a Wall; so that she touch'd him not, but then would beg hard of <hi>other people</hi> to strike him, and particularly she entreated them to take the <hi>Tongs</hi> and smite him; Which not being done, she cryed out of him, <hi>He has wounded me in the Head.</hi> But before Prayer was out, she would be laid for <hi>Dead,</hi> wholly <hi>sensless</hi> and (unless to a severe Trial) <hi>Breathless;</hi> with her Belly swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led like a <hi>Drum,</hi> and sometimes with croaking Noises in it; thus would she ly, most exactly with the stiffness and posture of one that had been two Days laid out for Dead. Once lying thus, as he that was praying, was alluding to the words of the <hi>Canaanitess,</hi> and saying, <hi>Lord, have mercy on a Daughter vexed with a Devil;</hi> there came a <hi>big,</hi> but <hi>low</hi> voice from her, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>There's Two or Three of them</hi> (or <hi>us!</hi>) and the standers-by, were under that Apprehension, as that they cannot relate whether her <hi>mouth mov'd</hi> in speaking of it. When Prayer was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, she would Revive in a minute or two, and continue as Frolicksome as before. She thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until <hi>Saturday</hi> towards the Evening; when, after this man had been at Prayer, I char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all my Family to admit of no Diversion by her Frolicks, from such exercises as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to begin the Sabbath with.

               <p>SECT. <hi>XXX.</hi> After this, we had no more such entertainments.

               <p>Whether the Devils know our Thoughts, or no?</p>
               <p>I will not give the Reader my <hi>Opinion</hi> of it, but only my <hi>Experiment.</hi> That they <hi>do not,</hi> was conjectured from <hi>this:</hi> We could <hi>cheat</hi> them when we <hi>spoke</hi> one thing, and <hi>mean't</hi> another. This was found when the Children <hi>were to be undressed.</hi> The <hi>Devils</hi> would still in waves beyond the Force of any Imposture, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully <hi>twist</hi> the part that was to be <hi>undress'd,</hi> so that there was no comming at it. But, if we said, <hi>untye his neckcloth,</hi> and the parties bidden, at the same time, understood our intent to be, unty his <hi>Shooe!</hi> The <hi>Neckcloth,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> the <hi>shooe,</hi> has
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49306:25"/>
been made strangely inaccessible. But on the other side; That they <hi>do,</hi> may be conjectured from This. I called the young Woman at my House by her Name, intending to mention unto her some <hi>Religious Expedient</hi> whereby she might, as I thought much relieve her self; presently her Neck was <hi>broke,</hi> and I continued watching my Opportunity to say what I designed. I could not get her to come out of her Fit, until I had laid aside my purpose of speaking what I thought, and then she reviv'd immediately. Moreover a young Gentleman visiting of me at my Study to ask my advice about curing the <hi>Atheism</hi> &amp; <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> which he complained, his <hi>Thoughts</hi> were more than ordinarily then infested <hi>with;</hi> after some Discourse I carried him down to see this Girl who was then molested with her unseen Fiends; but when he came, she treated him very coursly and rudely, asking him <hi>What she came to the house for?</hi> and seemed very angry at his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, urging him to be gone with a very impetuous Importunity. Perhaps all <hi>Devils</hi> are not alike sagacious.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>XXXII.</hi> The <hi>Last Fit</hi> that the young Woman had, was very peculiar. The <hi>Damons</hi> having once again seiz'd her, they made her pretend to be <hi>Dying;</hi> and Dying truly we fear'd at last she <hi>was:</hi> She lay, she tossed, she pull'd just like one <hi>Dying,</hi> and urged hard for some one to dy <hi>with</hi> her, seeming loth to <hi>dy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49306:26"/>
She argued concerning <hi>Death,</hi> in straine that quite amazed us; and concluded, That though she was <hi>luth to dy,</hi> yet if God said she must, <hi>she must;</hi> adding something about the state of the Countrey, which we <hi>wondred</hi> at Anon, the Fit went over; and as I guessed it would be, it was the <hi>last</hi> Fit she had at our House. But all my Library never afforded me any Commentary on those Paragraphs of the <hi>Gospels,</hi> which speak of <hi>Demoniacs,</hi> equal to that which the passions of this Child have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me.</p>
               <p>SECT. XXXIII. This is the Story of <hi>Goodwins</hi> Children, a Story all made up of <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders!</hi> I have related nothing but what I judge to be true. I was my self an <hi>Eye-witness</hi> to a large part of what I tell; and I hope my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have long thought, That I have otherwise <hi>learned Christ,</hi> than to <hi>ly</hi> unto the World. Yea, there is, I believe scarce any one particular, in this Narrative, which more than one credible Witness will not be ready to make Oath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The things of most Concernment in it, were before many Critical Observers; and the <hi>Whole</hi> happened in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the <hi>English America,</hi> unto a religious and industrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily which was visited by all sorts of Persons, that had a mind to <hi>satisfy</hi> themselves. I do now likewise publish the History, While the thing is yet fresh and <hi>New;</hi> and I challenge all men

to detect so much as one designed <hi>Falshood,</hi> yea, or so much as one important <hi>Mistake,</hi> from the <hi>Egg</hi> to the <hi>Apple</hi> of it, I have Writ as <hi>plainly</hi> as becomes an Historian, as <hi>truly</hi> as becomes a Christian, tho perhaps not so <hi>profitably</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Divine. But I am resolv'd after this, never to use but just one grain of patience with any man that shall go to impose upon me, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of <hi>Devils,</hi> or of <hi>Witches.</hi> I shall count that man <hi>Ignorant</hi> who shall <hi>suspect,</hi> but I shall count him down-right <hi>Impudent</hi> if he <hi>Assert</hi> the <hi>Non-Existence</hi> of things which we have had such palpable Convictions of.

                  <p>YOU have seen the <hi>Trouble</hi> and the <hi>Relief</hi> of <hi>Iohn Goodwins</hi> Children, After which the <hi>Daemons</hi> were let loose to make a fresh At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque upon them, tho not in a manner altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so terrible &amp; afflictive, as what they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore susteined. All the <hi>Three</hi> Children were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited with some Return of their Calamities; but the <hi>Boy</hi> was the Child which endured <hi>most</hi> in this <hi>New</hi> Assault. He had been for some While kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained, with Mr. <hi>Baily</hi> at <hi>Watertown</hi> where he had enjoyed a long time of ease; the Devils having given him but little Disburbance, except what was for a short while after his first coming there. He no sooner came <hi>Home,</hi> but he began to be ill again, with diverse pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Circumstances attending of him. There was this particularly remarkable: That the Boy dream't he had a <hi>Bone</hi> within his skin growing cross his <hi>Ribs;</hi> and when he awaked, he <hi>felt</hi> and found a thing there which was esteem'd a <hi>Bone,</hi> by them that handled it; only every one wondered how it should be lodged there. An expert Chirurgeon, Dr. <hi>Iohn Clark,</hi> being advis'd with about it, very dexterously <hi>took it out;</hi> and it prov'd not the imagined <hi>Bone,</hi> but a considerable <hi>Pin;</hi> a brass <hi>Pin,</hi> which could not possibly have come to ly there as it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49306:27"/>
did, withont the <hi>Prestigious Conveyance</hi> of a <hi>Misterious Witchcraft.</hi> Another time, on a <hi>Lord's Day</hi> his Father would have taken him to Meeting with him; and when his Father spoke of going to <hi>some</hi> of the <hi>Assemblies</hi> in the Town (particularly both the <hi>North</hi> and the <hi>South</hi>) the Boy would be cast into such <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>Postures,</hi> that he would sooner <hi>Dy</hi> than go out of <hi>doors;</hi> but if his Father spoke of going to <hi>others</hi> of the Assemblies in the Town, particularly the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the boy in a moment would be as well as could be. The tryal of this was more than <hi>five</hi> times repeated, and were it fully related, would be more than <hi>ten</hi> times Admired.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Prayers</hi> for the Children were justly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,</hi> and I hope not altogether <hi>unanswered.</hi> Upon <hi>one</hi> Prayer over <hi>two</hi> of them, they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a <hi>Fortnights</hi> ease; and their Ails again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, Prayer was again <hi>awakened;</hi> with some Circumstances not proper to be exposed unto the World. God gave a present Abatement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to the Maladies of the Children, and caused their <hi>Invaders</hi> to retire; so that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they were fully and quickly Delivered. <hi>Two days</hi> of Prayer obtained the Deliverance of <hi>two.</hi> The <hi>Third,</hi> namely the <hi>Boy,</hi> Remaining under some Annoyance by the evil spirits, a <hi>third Day</hi> was employ'd for him and he soon found the blessed effects of it in <hi>his</hi> Deliverance
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49306:28"/>
There were several very <hi>memorable</hi> things atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Deliverance of the Children, and the <hi>Vowes,</hi> and the <hi>Pleas,</hi> used in the Prayers which were thereby answerd, but they were all <hi>Private,</hi> yea, in a sort, <hi>Secret; Non est Religio ubi omnia patent;</hi> and I understand, (for I have some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him) That the Friend of the Children, whom God gave to be thus concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and <hi>successful</hi> for them, desires me not to let Reports of those things go out of the Walls of a Study, but to leave them rather for the Notice of the <hi>other World.</hi> I think it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to tell the World, that one thing in the Childrens Deliverance was the strange. Death of an horrible <hi>old Woman,</hi> who was presum'd to have a great hand in their Affliction. Before her Death &amp; <hi>at</hi> it, the <hi>Alms-House</hi> where she lived was terrified with <hi>fearful noises,</hi> and she seem'd to have her Death hastened by dismal <hi>Blowes</hi> reveived from the invisible World. But having mentioned this: all that I have now to publish is That <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> was the thing which drove the <hi>Divels</hi> from the <hi>Children;</hi> and I am to bear this Testimony unto the world, <hi>That the Lord is nigh to all them, who call upon him in truth, and, That blessed are all they that wait for Him.</hi>

                  <p>TO the foregoing Narrative, we have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an account given us, by the Godly <hi>Father</hi> of these Haunted Children; who upon his Reading over so much of our History, as was written of their Exercise before their full deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, was willing to express his Attestation to the <hi>Truth</hi> of it; with this further Declaration of the <hi>Sense,</hi> which he had of the unusual Miseries, that then lay upon his Family.

                              <p>IN the year 1688. about Midsummer, it pleased the Lord to visit one of my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren with a sore Visitation; and she was not only tormented in her <hi>Body,</hi> but was in great distress of <hi>Mind,</hi> Crying out, That she was in the <hi>dark</hi> concerning her Souls estate, and that she had mispent her precious time; She and we thinking her time was near at an end Hearing those Shrieks and Groans which did not only pierce the <hi>ears,</hi> but <hi>Hearts</hi> of her poor <hi>Parents;</hi> now was a time for me to <hi>Consider</hi> with my self, and to look into my <hi>own</hi> heart and and life, and see how matters did there stand between God and my own soul, and see <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord was thus contending with me.</hi> And upon Enquiry I found cause to <hi>judge</hi> my self, &amp; to <hi>justify</hi> the Lord. This Affliction continuing some time, the Lord saw good then to <hi>double</hi> the affliction in <hi>smiting down</hi> another Child, and that which was most heart breaking of all, and did <hi>double</hi> this double affliction was, it was apparent and judged by all that saw them, that the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Instruments, had a hand in it.</p>
                              <p>The consideration of this was most dreadful: I thought of what <hi>David</hi> said, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14. if he feared so to fall into the hands of <hi>Men,</hi>
                                 <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49306:29"/>
oh! then to think of the Horror of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be in the Hands of <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Witches!</hi> This our doleful condition moved us to call to our Friends to have <hi>pity</hi> on us, for <hi>Gods Hand had touched us.</hi> I was ready to say, that no ones affliction was like mine; That my <hi>little House</hi> that should be a little <hi>Bethel</hi> for <hi>God</hi> to dwell in, should be made a <hi>Den</hi> for <hi>Devils;</hi> that those <hi>little Bodies,</hi> that should be <hi>Temples</hi> for the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to dwell in, should be thus harrassed and abused by the <hi>Devil</hi> and his cursed Brood. But how this <hi>twice doubled</hi> affliction is <hi>doubled</hi> again. <hi>Two</hi> more of my Children are smitten down, oh! the Cries, the Shrieks, the Tortures of these poor Children! <hi>Doctors</hi> cannot help, <hi>Parents</hi> weep and lament over them, but cannot ease them. Now I considering my affliction to be <hi>more than ordinary,</hi> it did certainly call for <hi>more than ordinary</hi> Prayer. I acquainted Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Moodey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Willard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>C. Mather,</hi> the four Ministers of the Town with it, and Mr. <hi>Morton</hi> of <hi>Charlstown;</hi> earnestly desiring them, that they, with some other <hi>praying people</hi> of God, would meet at my house, and there be earnest with God, on the behalf of us and our Children; which they (I thank them for it) readily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with great servency of Spirit; but as for my part, my heart was ready to sink to hear and see those <hi>doleful-Sights.</hi> Now I thought that I had greatly neglected my duty to my <hi>Children,</hi>
                                 <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49306:30"/>
in not admonishing and instructing of them; and that God was hereby calling my sins to mind, to slay my <hi>Children,</hi> Then I pondered of that place in Numb. 23. 23. <hi>Surely there is no Inchanment against Iacob, neither is there any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination against Israel.</hi> And now I thought I had broke <hi>Covenant with God,</hi> not only in <hi>one</hi> respect but in <hi>many,</hi> but it pleased the Lord to bring that to mind in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>For I will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to their unrighteousness, and their Sins &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities will I remember no more.</hi> The Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how the Lord did deal with <hi>Iob,</hi> and his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> and the <hi>End the Lord made with him</hi> was some support to me. I thought also, on what <hi>David</hi> said, that He had sinned, but what have these poor <hi>Lambs</hi> done? But yet in the midds't of my tumultous Thoughts within me, it was <hi>Gods Comforts that did delight my soul. That in the</hi> 18 of <hi>Luke,</hi> and the Beginning, Where Christ <hi>spake the Parable for that end,</hi> that men ought <hi>alwaies to pray and not</hi> faint. <hi>This,</hi> with many other places bore up my spirit. I thought with <hi>Ionah</hi> that I <hi>would yet again Look towards God's holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And I did greatly desire to find the <hi>Son of God</hi> with me in this <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Affliction,</hi> knowing thereby that no harm shall befall me. But now this solemn <hi>day of Prayer and Fasting</hi> being at an <hi>End,</hi> there was an <hi>Eminent</hi> Answer of it: for one of my Children was delivered, and <hi>one</hi> of the wicked instruments
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49306:30"/>
of the Devil discovered, <hi>and her own mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned her,</hi> and so accordingly Executed. Here was <hi>Food for Faith,</hi> and great encouragement still to <hi>hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord;</hi> the Ministers still counselling and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging me to labour to be found in <hi>Gods way,</hi> committing my case to him, and not to use any way not allowed in Gods Word. It was a thing not a little comfortable to us, to see that the people of God was so much concerned about our lamentable condition, remembring us <hi>at all times</hi> in their <hi>prayers,</hi> which I did look at as a token for good; but you must think it was a time of sore Temptation with us, for <hi>many</hi> did say; (yea, and some <hi>good</hi> people too) were it their case, that they would <hi>try some Tricks,</hi> that should give ease to their Children: But I thought for us to forsake the counsel of <hi>good old men,</hi> and to take the counsel of the <hi>young ones,</hi> it might ensnare our <hi>Souls,</hi> though for the present it might <hi>offer</hi> some relief to our <hi>Bodies;</hi> which was a thing I greatly feared; and <hi>my Children</hi> were not at any time free for doing any such thing. It was a time of sore <hi>affliction,</hi> but it was mixed with abundance of <hi>mercy,</hi> for my heart was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a time made glad in the <hi>house of Prayer.</hi> The <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> pitied us; and were very helpful to us: Moreover, though my Children were thus in every Limb and Joynt tormented by those Children of the Devil, they also using their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49306:31"/>
tongues at their pleasure, sometimes one way, sometimes another; yet the Lord did herein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them, that they <hi>could not make them speak wicked words,</hi> though they did many times hinder them from speaking <hi>good ones;</hi> had they in these Fits <hi>blasphemed</hi> the Name of the Holy God, this you may think would have been an heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing to us the poor Parents; but God in his mercy prevented them, a thing worth taking notice of. Likewise they <hi>slept well</hi> a nights: And the <hi>Ministers</hi> did often visit us, and pray with us, and for us; and their love and pity was so great, their Prayers so earnest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, that I could not but admire at it. <hi>Mr. Mather</hi> particularly; now his bowels so yearned towards us in this sad condition, that he not only <hi>pray's</hi> with us, and for us, but he taketh one of my Children home to his own house; which indeed was but a troublesome <hi>guest,</hi> for such an one that had so much work lying upon his hands and heart: He took much pains in this great Service, to pull <hi>this Child,</hi> and her Brother and Sister out of the hand of the <hi>Devil.</hi> Let us now admire and adore that <hi>Fountain</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ, from whence those <hi>streams</hi> come. The Lord himself will requite his labour of love. Our case is yet very sad, and doth call for more <hi>Prayer;</hi> and the good Ministers of this Town, and <hi>Charlstown</hi> readily came, with some other good praying people to my house, to keep ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49306:31"/>
Day of solemn Fasting and Prayer; which our Lord saith <hi>this kind goeth out by.</hi> My Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren being all at home, the two biggest lying on the bed, one of them would fain have <hi>Kicked</hi> the good men while they were wrestling with God for them, had not I held him with all my power and might; and sometimes he would stop his <hi>own</hi> ears. This you must needs think was a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thing to the poor parents. Now our hearts were ready to sink, had not God put under his everlasting arms of Mercy and helped us still to hope in his mercy, and to <hi>be quiet,</hi> knowing that <hi>He is God,</hi> and that it was not for the <hi>potsheards</hi> of the earth to strive with their Maker. Well might <hi>David</hi> say, that had not the <hi>Law of his God been his delight, he had perished in his Affliction.</hi> Now the <hi>Promises of God</hi> are sweet; God having promised, to <hi>hear the prayer of the destitute,</hi> and <hi>not to despise their prayer;</hi> and <hi>He will not fail the Expectation of those that wait on Him;</hi> but He <hi>heareth the cry of the poor and needy.</hi> These <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> came and <hi>wrestled</hi> with God for a <hi>Blessing</hi> on this poor Family, which indeed I hope they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and may be now worthy of the Name <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> who prevailed with God, and <hi>would not let Him go till He had blessed us.</hi> For <hi>soon</hi> after this, there were <hi>two more</hi> of my children delivered out of this <hi>horrible pit.</hi> Here was now a <hi>double mercy,</hi> and how <hi>sweet</hi> was it, knowing it came in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of Prayer!</hi> Now we see and know,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49306:32"/>
                                 <hi>it is not a vain thing to call on the name of the Lord.</hi> For He is a <hi>present help in the time of trouble;</hi> and we may boldly say <hi>the Lord has been our helper,</hi> I had <hi>sunk,</hi> but Jesus put forth His hand &amp; bore me up. My <hi>Faith</hi> was ready to fail, but this was a support to me that Christ said to <hi>Peter, I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.</hi> And many other <hi>Promises</hi> were as <hi>Cordials</hi> to my dropping soul. And the Consideration of all those that ever came to Christ Jesus for Healing, that He healed their bodies, pardoned their Sins, and healed their <hi>Souls</hi> too; which I hope in God may be the fruit of this present Affliction. If God be pleased to make the Fruit of this Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be to <hi>take away our sin,</hi> and cleanse us from iniquity, and to put us on with greater <hi>diligence</hi> to <hi>make our Calling &amp; election sure,</hi> then, <hi>happy</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction!

               <p>SECT. <hi>VIII.</hi> There was a strong smell of something like <hi>Musk,</hi> which was divers times in the Room where he was, and in the other Rooms, and without the House; of which no cause could be rendred.

give <hi>Disturbance</hi> to the Woman that we have spoken of: all the while they were doing of it, the good man was at ease, and slept as a weary man; and these were all the times they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to take any sleep at all.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>X.</hi> A small Galley-Pot of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> that was near full, and carefully look't after, yet unto the surprize of the people, was quite emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, so that the sick man could not have the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it.</p>

               <p>SECT. <hi>XII.</hi> Sometimes <hi>Fire</hi> was seen on the Bed, or the Covering, and when the Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders began to discourse of it, it would vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>XIII.</hi> Diverse people felt <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> often <hi>stir</hi> in the Bed, at some distance from his <hi>Body.</hi> To appearance, the thing that stirr'd was as big as a <hi>Cat:</hi> some try'd to lay hold on it with their hands, but under the Covering nothing could be found. A discreet and sober Woman, resting on the Beds Feet, felt as it were a <hi>Hand,</hi> the <hi>Thumb</hi> and the <hi>Finger</hi> of it, taking her by the side, and giving her a Pinch; but turning to see What it might be, nothing was to be seen.</p>

Also, the sick man lying too near the <hi>side</hi> of the Bed, a very strong and stout man, try'd to life him a little further into the Bed; but with all his might he could not; tho' trying by 'nd by, he could lift a <hi>Bed-stead,</hi> with a <hi>Bed,</hi> and <hi>man</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, all, <hi>without</hi> any strain to himself at all.</p>

Thus he remained from <hi>Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureday</hi> morning about Sun-rise, till <hi>Sabbath-Day</hi> in the After-noon. When those that took him out of the Bed found him still <hi>Warm;</hi> though the the Season was as <hi>Cold</hi> as had almost been known in an Age. On the Night after the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> his Countenance was yet as fresh as before; but on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, they found the <hi>face</hi> extremely

                  <hi>tumified</hi> and <hi>discoloured;</hi> 'twas black and blue, &amp; fresh blood seem'd to run down his Cheek in the Hairs.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>XVII.</hi> The night after he died, a very credible person, watching of the Corpse, perceived the <hi>Bed</hi> to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>stir,</hi> more than once; but by no means could find out the cause of it.</p>
               <p>SECT. <hi>XVIII.</hi> The second night, some that were preparing for the <hi>Funeral,</hi> do say, That they heard diverse Noises in the Room, where the <hi>Corpse</hi> lay; as though there had been a great <hi>Removing</hi> and Clattering of <hi>stools</hi> &amp; <hi>chairs.</hi>
               </p>

From thence to eleven year old, he used the Trade of <hi>inventing Lyes,</hi> and <hi>Stealing mony,</hi> Running away from his Father, spending of it at <hi>Dice,</hi> and with the vilest <hi>Company</hi> and this Trade he used in that space (he confessed) above Forty times at least, and many strange Instances he gives of it. His <hi>Father</hi> following him with constant <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> and <hi>Correction,</hi> he was despertely harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under all, and his heart sett in a way of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49306:38"/>
Malice against the <hi>Word of God; &amp; all</hi> his Father did to restrain him. When he was about ten or eleven years old, he ran away from <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> to <hi>Delph;</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> appeared to him there in the shape of a <hi>Boy,</hi> counselling him not to hearken to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> nor unto any of his <hi>Father<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>s Instructions,</hi> and propounding to him, to Enter into a Covenant with him. Being somewhat fearful at first, desired that he would not appear to him in a <hi>shape,</hi> but by a <hi>voice,</hi> and though his heart did <hi>inwardly consent,</hi> to what the Devil said, yet he was <hi>withheld</hi> that he could not then Enter into a Covenant with him. His Father not knowing this, but of his <hi>other</hi> Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, being a <hi>godly Minister,</hi> procured many Christians to join with him in a day of <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> confessed and bewailed his Sins, prayed for him, &amp; sent him to <hi>New-E.</hi> and so <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to God.</hi> From that time to this being now about Sixteen years old, the Devil hath constantly come to him by a <hi>voice;</hi> and he held a constant Discourse with him; and all about <hi>Entring into a Covenant with him:</hi> and still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to have it <hi>written</hi> and <hi>sealed,</hi> making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>promises</hi> to allure him, and telling him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stories of Dr. <hi>Faultus,</hi> and other <hi>Witches</hi> how bravely they have lived, and how he should live deliciously, and have <hi>Ease, Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> and sometimes threatning to <hi>tear him in pieces if he would not.</hi> But ordinarily his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49306:39"/>
was as loving &amp; friendly as could be. He hath been strangely kept, by an hand of God, from <hi>making a Covenant</hi> to this day. For he still propounded many <hi>Difficulties</hi> to the Devil, which he could not satisfie his Reason in: and though, he saith, he was <hi>never well</hi> but when he was <hi>Discoursing with the devil,</hi> and his heart was strangely enclined to <hi>write</hi> and <hi>seal</hi> an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet such dreadfull horrour did seiz upon him, at the very time, from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and such fears of his Eternal Perishing, that he could not do it <hi>then.</hi> He put off the Devil still, that he was not in a <hi>sit Frame,</hi> but desired him to come again that he might have <hi>more</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and he would consider of it. The Devil appeared to him a <hi>second</hi> time at <hi>New-haven,</hi> in the shape of a <hi>Boy,</hi> and a <hi>third</hi> time at <hi>Tocutt</hi> in the shape of a <hi>Fox;</hi> at which time, at first, they had <hi>loving discourse,</hi> as formerly; but at last, the Devil was urgent upon him, and told him, he had <hi>baffled</hi> with him <hi>so long,</hi> now he <hi>must</hi> enter into an <hi>agreement,</hi> or he would tear him in pieces: he saying, How should I do it? would you have me write upon my <hi>hands?</hi> No, (saith the Devil) Look here, and with that, set <hi>Paper,</hi> and <hi>Pen,</hi> and <hi>Ink</hi> like <hi>Blood</hi> before him. The former hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and <hi>special passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> which he named, set in upon him so that he could not do it. Only before they parted, the Devil being so urgent upon him, telling him he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49306:39"/>
had baffled with him, he set <hi>a year and half</hi> time for Consideration. The <hi>last</hi> quarter of a year is yet to come. The Devil told him, if he let him alone so long, he would baffle with him <hi>still:</hi> he answered, if he did not yeild <hi>then,</hi> he would give him leave to torment him whilst he lived. Still the Devil would not away, nor could <hi>he</hi> get from him. Then out of Fear he cryed out, <hi>Lord, Iesus, rebuke the devil!</hi> at which, the <hi>Fox, Pen, Ink</hi> and <hi>Paper</hi> vanished. Yet he continued in his course of unheard-of Wickedness, and still his <hi>Will</hi> was bent to <hi>write &amp; seal</hi> the Agreement, having his Discourse yet with <hi>Satan</hi> by <hi>Voice.</hi> His Brother with whom he lives at <hi>Tocut,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Convulsion Fits,</hi> he laughed and mocked at him, and acted the <hi>Convulsion Fits.</hi> A while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God sent <hi>Convulsion Fits</hi> on himself; in which time, his former Terrours, the Wrath of God, <hi>Death, Hell, Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him. He would fain then have confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his sins, but when he was about to do it, the <hi>Devil</hi> still held his mouth, that he could not. He <hi>entreated</hi> God, to <hi>release</hi> him, promising to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess &amp; forsake</hi> his Sins, and the Lord did so; but he being <hi>well,</hi> grew as bad, or worse than ever. About six weeks since, his <hi>Convulsion Fits</hi> came again three times most dreadfully, with some Intermissions, and his former Horrours &amp; Fears. He would have confessed his Sins but could not. It pleased God to put it into the heart of one to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49306:40"/>
ask him, <hi>Whether he had any Familiarity with the Devil?</hi> he got out so much then as, <hi>Yes.</hi> He fetching Mr. <hi>Pierson,</hi> the Convulsion Fits <hi>left</hi> him, and he confessed all, how it had been with him. That very night the Devil came to him, and told him, <hi>Had he blabbed out such things? He would teach him to blabb!</hi> and if he would not <hi>then write</hi> and <hi>seal</hi> the Agreement, he would tear him in pieces, and he refusing, the Devil took a <hi>corporal Possession</hi> of him, and hath not ceased to torment him extremely ever since. If any thing be spoken to him, the <hi>Devil</hi> answereth (and many times he <hi>barks</hi> like a <hi>Fox,</hi> and <hi>hisseth</hi> like a <hi>Serpent</hi>) sometimes with horrible <hi>Blasphemies</hi> against the Name of Christ; and at some other times the Boy is sensible. When he hath the Libertie of his <hi>Voice,</hi> he tells what the Devil saith to him, urging him to <hi>seal</hi> the Covenant still, and that he will bring <hi>Paper, Pen</hi> and <hi>Ink</hi> in the night, when none shall see, pleading, that <hi>God hath oust him off,</hi> that <hi>Christ cannot save him.</hi> That When He was upon <hi>earth</hi> He could cast out devils, but now He is in <hi>Heaven</hi> He cannot. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is ready to yeild to all in a <hi>desperate</hi> way. Sometimes he breaks out into <hi>Confession</hi> of his former sins, as they come into his mind; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly <hi>judging</hi> himself, and <hi>justifying</hi> GOD in His for ever leaving of him in the hands of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> Once he was heard to <hi>Pray</hi> in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner so sutable to his Condition, so Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49306:40"/>
his Sin, and pleading with God for mercy, and in such a strange, high, enlarged manner, as judicious godly persons then present, affirm <hi>they never heard the like in their lives,</hi> that it drew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of tears from the eyes of all present, being about twenty persons. But his torment increased upon him worse after such a time; or if any thing were spoken to him from the <hi>Word of God</hi> by others or they pray with him. The last week after he had confessed one strange Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, namely that once in Discourse he told the Devil, that if <hi>he</hi> would make his <hi>Spittle to scald a dog,</hi> he would then go on in a way of <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Dissembling,</hi> and believe that he <hi>should</hi> do it, which he said, <hi>he did</hi> with all his heart, and so <hi>spit</hi> on the <hi>dog,</hi> and with that a deal of <hi>Scald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water</hi> did poure on the Dog. In pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Promise, he went on in a way of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Dissembling:</hi> That when he was urged about it, that he had done some mischief to the <hi>dog,</hi> then he fell down into a Swound as if he had been dead. As soon as he had confessed <hi>this,</hi> the Devil went out of him with an astonishing <hi>Noise,</hi> to the terrour of those then, present: and so he continued <hi>one day.</hi> The next day being much troubled in himself for one special passage in his Discourse with the Devil, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him as a <hi>Fox;</hi> saith he to he Devil, <hi>I have formerly sought to God, an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HAd there been Diligence enough used by them that have <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>seen</hi> amazing Instances of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> our Number of <hi>Memorable Providences</hi> under this Head, had reached beyond the <hi>Perfect.</hi> However, before I have done Writing, I will insert an Example or two, communicated unto me by a Gentleman of sufficient <hi>Fidelity</hi> to make a Story of his Relating <hi>Credible.</hi> The Things were such as happened in the <hi>Town</hi> whereof himself is Minister; and they are but <hi>some</hi> of <hi>more</hi> which he favoured me with the Communication of. But, it seems, I must be obliged, to <hi>conceal</hi> the <hi>Names</hi> of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned, lest <hi>some</hi> should be <hi>Offended,</hi> tho <hi>None</hi> could be <hi>Injured</hi> by the mention of them.</p>
               <p>¶In a <hi>Town</hi> which is none of the <hi>yóungest</hi> in this Countrey, there dwelt a very Godly and honest Man, who upon some Provocation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very Angry and Threatning Expressions, from <hi>two women</hi> in the Neighbourhood; soon upon this, diverse of his <hi>Cattel</hi> in a strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dyed; and the man himself sometimes was haunted with <hi>sights</hi> of the women as he thought, encountring of him. He grew indisposed in his <hi>Body</hi> very unaccountably; and one day repaired unto a <hi>Church Meeting</hi> then held in the place, with a Resolution there to declare what he had
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49306:42"/>
met withal. The man was one of such Figure and Respect among them, that the <hi>Pastor</hi> singled out <hi>him</hi> for to <hi>pray</hi> in the Assembly before their breaking up. He pray'd with a more than usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al measure of both Devotion and Discretion, but just as he was coming to that part of his Prayer, wherein he intended to petition Heaven for the <hi>Discovery of Witchcrafts</hi> which had been among them, he sank down <hi>Speechless</hi> and <hi>Sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;</hi> and was by his Friends carried away to a <hi>Bed;</hi> where he lay for two or three hours in horrible Distress, fearfully starting, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and crying out <hi>Lord, I am stab'd!</hi> and now looking whistly to and fro, he said, <hi>O here are wicked persons among us, even among VS;</hi> and he complained, <hi>I came hither with a full purpose to tell what I knew, but now</hi> (said he) <hi>I ly like a Fool!</hi> Thus he continued until the Meeting was over, and then his Fits left him; only he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained very sore. One or two more such Fits he had after that; but afterwards a more <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> sort of <hi>Torture</hi> was employ'd upon him. He was advised by a worthy man to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto a Magistrate; and warned, That he would shortly be murdered, if he did not. He took not the Counsil; but languished for some Weeks; yet able to Walk and Work; but <hi>Then,</hi> he had his Breath and <hi>Life</hi> suddenly taken taken away from him, in a manner of which no full Account could be given.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49306:43"/>The man had a Son invaded with the like <hi>First</hi> but God gave deliverance to him in answer to the Prayers of His people for him.</p>
               <p>¶In the same Town, there yet lives a very pious Woman, that from another Woman of ill Fame, received a small gift, which was <hi>eaten</hi> by her. Upon the <hi>Eating</hi> of it, she became strangely altered and afflicted; and hindred from Sleeping at Night, by the Pulls of some <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Hand</hi> for a long while together. A Shape or two of, I know not who, likewise haunted her, and gave her no little Trouble. At last, a Fit <hi>extraordinary Violent</hi> come upon her; wherein she pointed her <hi>Hand,</hi> and fixed her <hi>Eye,</hi> much upon the <hi>Chimney,</hi> and spake at a rate that asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished all about her. Anon, she broke forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and yet could bring out scarce more than a Syllable at a time. In her short <hi>Prayer</hi> she grew up to an <hi>high</hi> Act of <hi>Faith,</hi> and said, (by Syllables, and with Stammerings) <hi>Lord, Thou hast been my Hope, and in Thee will I put my Trust; Thou hast been my Salvation here, and wilt be so for ever and ever!</hi> Upon which her Fit left her; and she afterwads grew very well; still remaining so.</p>

A <hi>Devil</hi> is a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and a <hi>national</hi> Substance, full of all <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,</hi> confined by God unto our <hi>Air</hi> is his <hi>Gaob,</hi> for his Apostasy from the Company &amp; Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>holy Angels.</hi> His Title is that <hi>Eph</hi> 6. 12. a <hi>spiritual wickedness;</hi> that is a <hi>wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> A <hi>Devil</hi> was once an <hi>Angel,</hi> but Sin has brought him to be <hi>Fallen</hi> Angel; an Angel full of Enmity to God and man; an <hi>Angel</hi> made a <hi>Prisoner</hi> within the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> of the Earth which we tread upon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> of Truth, allow us these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions about the <hi>Devils</hi> of Hell.</p>
               <p>We may first conclude, That the Devils are not under meer <hi>Motions,</hi> or <hi>Qualities,</hi> or <hi>Distempers,</hi> as has been by some absurdly enough conceived. The fond <hi>Sadducee</hi> derides <hi>the Doctrine of Devils,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49306:45"/>
which we all embrace. But I pray, What things were those that <hi>left their first estate,</hi> being now <hi>reserved in chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day?</hi> What things be those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought our Lord of liberty to <hi>enter into the swine?</hi> But we have among our selves lately seen plain Demonstrations, That there are <hi>Spirits,</hi> which <hi>understand,</hi> and <hi>argue,</hi> and <hi>will;</hi> and which are the enemies of all that is <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> &amp; <hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may, Secondly, Conclude, That these <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> are an <hi>Army</hi> in our <hi>Air.</hi> They are called in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>the power</hi> (or the Army) <hi>of the air.</hi> There are diverse Miles of <hi>Air</hi> encompassing of this Terraqueous <hi>Globe;</hi> to that <hi>space</hi> it is that the <hi>Devils</hi> are limited, since their <hi>High-Treason</hi> against the God that made them. Here it is that they have a <hi>Play-house,</hi> as well as a <hi>Prison;</hi> here they play all their <hi>devillish Pranks</hi> until the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fire</hi> shall begin to flame. Indeed, <hi>some</hi> Devils may keep more constantly to <hi>one</hi> countrey, and some to <hi>another.</hi> Hence we read of some in <hi>Marc.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>They be sought our Lord much, that He would not send them away out of the Countrey.</hi> But still the <hi>High-Places</hi> of our <hi>air</hi> be the Receptacles of all the <hi>wicked Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may conclude, Thirdly, That these <hi>Devils</hi> are an <hi>Army</hi> under a <hi>Leader</hi> too. There is a <hi>Government,</hi> a <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the dark Regions; and hence in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 24. we read about Belzchub, the <hi>Prince</hi> of devils. There you have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49306:45"/>
the Name of the <hi>Grand-Segniour</hi> who is <hi>King over the children of pride.</hi> Probably, the <hi>Devils</hi> in their first <hi>Conspiracy</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> against God, had a notorious <hi>Ring-Leader;</hi> there was one of greater dignity and influence than the rest, by whom they were <hi>headed;</hi> and they are all now under his Command. We have Mention in the Sacred Oracles, of, <hi>the devil and his angels.</hi> This <hi>cheef devil</hi> is called by way of eminency, <hi>the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; but he has innumerable <hi>Slaves,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> and <hi>Emissaries,</hi> which are under an entire Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him. His Orders they all observe; and therefore, when we speak of <hi>the Devil,</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth each private <hi>Souldier</hi> as well as him that is <hi>principal Commander.</hi> We say, <hi>The Devil,</hi> as we say, <hi>The Turk,</hi> or <hi>The Spaniard;</hi> it means <hi>any</hi> or <hi>every</hi> part of that infernal <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous.</hi> As it is said in <hi>Ps.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encamps, i. e.</hi> the whole Host of Angels are as <hi>One</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> II. The <hi>Divels</hi> are the <hi>great Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of humane <hi>Souls.</hi> Tis here said about the <hi>devil,</hi> He is <hi>your</hi> Adversary; or as the Article in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, he is <hi>that</hi> your Adversary.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, <hi>How</hi> the Devils are our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries? In general they labour to do us all the mischief they can <hi>devise.</hi> They pursue our Hurt in all <hi>waies,</hi> and by all <hi>means.</hi> Yet in <hi>some</hi> sense they <hi>cannot</hi> come at us unless <hi>according to Law.</hi> Know, That the Greek word here notes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49306:46"/>
properly an <hi>Adversary at Law;</hi> tis a <hi>law-Term</hi> that is used here. Thus First, the Devils are our Adversaries as <hi>Accusers.</hi> Tis the Character of the Devil in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10. The <hi>Accuser</hi> of our Brethren, which <hi>accuseth</hi> them before God, day and night. He is called a <hi>Satan,</hi> and a <hi>Devil</hi> for this very Cause. The Devils are first our <hi>Tempters,</hi> and then our <hi>Accusers.</hi> They complain to God against us, that we do not <hi>fear</hi> Him, that we do not <hi>love</hi> Him, that we do not <hi>seek</hi> Him, as we ought to do: they represent our faults before the Lord, as things that make us unfit for any Mercy at His hands. There is a <hi>Court</hi> kept some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the <hi>Invisible world,</hi> at which, Devils endeavour to prefer as many <hi>Complaints</hi> as they they <hi>can</hi> against us. They first <hi>gett</hi> and then <hi>bring</hi> matters of Accusation which we might be <hi>Indicted</hi> and <hi>Condemned</hi> for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Devils are our Adversaries as <hi>Destroyers.</hi> They <hi>plead</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> as so many <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourneys,</hi> that a <hi>Iudgment</hi> may be granted against us all; and then they petition that <hi>they</hi> too may be the <hi>Executioners</hi> of it. Tis illustrated in <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 11. and 2. 5. <hi>Satan</hi> urges upon God against <hi>Iob, put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh.</hi> They would fain have all manner of Miseries to be inflicted on us; and they try all they can to gain <hi>Opportunities</hi> for doing <hi>their</hi> part that we may be miserable. A <hi>Devil</hi> is called a <hi>destroying Angel.</hi> They are <hi>Devils</hi> usually that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49306:46"/>
are the Instruments of Divine Vengeance on the world. If it be asked, <hi>Why</hi> the devils are our Adversaries? There is a double Reason to be Assigned of it. One Reason of it is,</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Hatred of God.</hi> The Devils have sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Rule</hi> of God; and they cannot hear that the <hi>Name</hi> of God should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the world. <hi>GOD</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> are sworn enemies to each other; and the Lord may say of them as in <hi>Zeb.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>My soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</hi> Now the poor Children of men, both do the <hi>Service</hi> of God, and have the <hi>Image</hi> of God. We do the <hi>Service</hi> of God. Man is the <hi>Priest</hi> of the whole <hi>visible Creation.</hi> Tis by our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> tis by our <hi>Words,</hi> that all things else pay their Homage un- the Lord. The <hi>Devil,</hi> that would be in the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, would ruine us, that God may no more have the <hi>Honour</hi> of a <hi>Father,</hi> or the <hi>Fear</hi> of a <hi>Master</hi> in the world. We also have the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of God. In our <hi>Nature</hi> there is <hi>much,</hi> in our <hi>Vertue</hi> there is <hi>more</hi> of God's Likeness. The Devil is a <hi>Tigre;</hi> they report of that wild beast, it will tear the <hi>picture</hi> of a man, when it cannot reach the <hi>person</hi> of a man. There is a <hi>lively shadow,</hi> as it were, of God, upon us; and this the Tigres of <hi>Hell</hi> cannot endure.</p>
               <p>A Second Reason of it is, their <hi>Envy</hi> at <hi>Man.</hi> The <hi>Devils</hi> behold <hi>Man</hi> exalted &amp; advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove themselves. Tis said of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49306:47"/>
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 41. 34. <hi>He beholdeth all high things.</hi> Tis ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the <hi>Pope</hi> also, and lastly in the <hi>Devil.</hi> He cannot brook it, that any should be <hi>higher</hi> than himself. The Apostle intimates, that <hi>Pride</hi> was at first, <hi>the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that the Devil being informed of God's decree to have a <hi>Man</hi> subsist in the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> this provoked him and his Accomplices to their Disobedience. However, the Devil now sees <hi>Man Saved</hi> and <hi>himself dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; Man</hi> in the Bosom of God, and <hi>himself</hi> in the Bottom of <hi>Hell; Well,</hi> now thinks he, I will do this <hi>Man</hi> all the spite I can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> III. The <hi>Devils</hi> are <hi>potent</hi> Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Souls.</p>
               <p>The Devil is a <hi>Lion,</hi> and as it was said in <hi>Judg.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>What is stronger than a Lion?</hi> He has a <hi>Power,</hi> an <hi>Interest,</hi> that may make us all to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his Roaring. Hence we read in <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. 19. about <hi>The power of the enemy:</hi> and he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. 21. unto, <hi>A strong Armed man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be <hi>three</hi> things that show the power of our Adversaries.</p>
               <p>First, The power of our Adversaries the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, lies in the <hi>Nature</hi> of them. Tis said in <hi>Zph.</hi> 6. 12, <hi>We fight not against flesh &amp; blood</hi> only, <hi>but against principalities, and Powers, and spiritual wickednesses.</hi> They are <hi>spiritual,</hi> and therefore <hi>powerful.</hi> The <hi>Spirituality</hi> of the <hi>Devils</hi> enables them to strike us when we can't <hi>see</hi> them; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49306:47"/>
makes 'em ready to attack us and surprise us at unspeakable Disadvantages. The <hi>Divels</hi> are <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and hence they count <hi>Iron but straw, &amp; brass as rotten wood;</hi> they are <hi>Spirits,</hi> and so they <hi>excel in strength;</hi> when they seem afraid of little <hi>Spels</hi> and <hi>Charms,</hi> it is only a stratagem by which they seek to decoy us into their dreadful <hi>Power</hi> more than before. <hi>One</hi> of them let loose, perhaps could <hi>slaughter</hi> an Army of an hundred thousand in a night.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Power</hi> of our Adversaries the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> lies in the <hi>Number</hi> of them. Even such little things as <hi>Mire,</hi> yea, and <hi>Lice</hi> have prov'd horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plagues by becoming numerous. What then may the <hi>Devils</hi> be, whose Troops amount unto many <hi>Legions:</hi> How many <hi>devils</hi> care sometimes be spared, for the Vexation of <hi>one man!</hi> In the bowels of one afflicted child, I have heard that murmur made, <hi>There are two or three of us!</hi> Yea, we read in <hi>Luc.</hi> 8. 30. of a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> that kept a <hi>Garrison</hi> in one single person a a <hi>Legion</hi> contain'd twelve <hi>Thousand</hi> and five <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> in it. Doubtless, there are far more <hi>Devils</hi> than there are <hi>Men</hi> in the world. They <hi>swarm</hi> like the Frogs of <hi>Egypt</hi> in every chamber of our houses. We can go, we can stir no where, but those wild <hi>Arabians</hi> will be upon us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Power</hi> of our Adversaries the <hi>Devils</hi> lies in their <hi>Confoederacies.</hi> The <hi>Devils</hi> are all as <hi>one</hi> themselves; their Unity,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49306:48"/>
their <hi>Agrement</hi> in their designs makes them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable. We are told in Mat. 12. 26. <hi>Satan is not divided against himself.</hi> But more than so, The <hi>devils</hi> have of their party among <hi>our selves,</hi> yea, <hi>within</hi> our selves. Devils have <hi>Men</hi> on their side. All wicked <hi>men</hi> promote the ends of the <hi>devils.</hi> Tis said, <hi>The lusts of the</hi> devil <hi>they will do;</hi> 'tis said. <hi>The divel works in the Children of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> And the Devils have <hi>Hearts</hi> on their side Our wicked <hi>hearts</hi> will favour and humour the <hi>devils</hi> in their attempts, and betray us into their hands. When they made their assault on our Saviour, tis said, <hi>They found nothing in Him.</hi> But they find <hi>something</hi> in <hi>us,</hi> they find in us, an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> by whose <hi>Treachery</hi> we become their <hi>prey.</hi> This is the <hi>Power of the Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> IV. The <hi>devils</hi> are also <hi>cruel</hi> Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our souls. The Divel is not only a <hi>Lion,</hi> but a <hi>roaring,</hi> an hungry, an <hi>angry</hi> Lion. Yes, according to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. he is not only a <hi>Lion,</hi> but a <hi>Dragon</hi> too. He will have no more mercy than a Lion, he will have no more mercy than a <hi>Dragon</hi> upon all that comes in the way of his cruel Clutches. 'Twas the description of the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> in Hab. 1. 6. <hi>That bitter and hasly nation.</hi> To the <hi>devils</hi> does it much more belong; they are a <hi>Bitter and a cruel nation.</hi> Never was there such a merciless and a pittiless <hi>Tyrant</hi> as the <hi>devil</hi> is, nothing so much pleases that bloody monster, as the <hi>pain</hi> and the <hi>death</hi> of our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49306:48"/>
souls; and he has no Musick like the <hi>groans of a deadly wounded man.</hi> What a Prodigy of Cruelty was the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, who wished that <hi>all his people had but one neck, that he might cut it off at a blow!</hi> Why the <hi>cruel Devil</hi> not only <hi>wished,</hi> but in Paradise he <hi>had</hi> &amp; he <hi>did</hi> such an horrid thing. And it is he that inspires vile men with all the <hi>Cruelty</hi> that their <hi>Inquisitions,</hi> and their <hi>Tortures</hi> give exemple of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> V. The Devils are likewise <hi>Restless</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of our souls. They <hi>go about,</hi> they are always in <hi>Action,</hi> always in <hi>Motion,</hi> that they may undo the souls of men.</p>
               <p>The Devil <hi>goes about.</hi> So could he say of himself, in Job, 1. 7. <hi>I come from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</hi> This Prince goes in <hi>Progress,</hi> rides the <hi>Circuit</hi> thro his whole Dominions to see how his work is carried on. And all that are under the Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this <hi>Prime Visier</hi> are continually travell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and labouring too for the destruction of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal souls. They <hi>go about,</hi> but <hi>how?</hi> We read in <hi>Iude</hi> 6. they are <hi>kept in chains;</hi> Tis by some rendered, they are kept <hi>for</hi> chains: but suppose them <hi>in</hi> chains; their chains are so <hi>lengthened,</hi> &amp; yet so <hi>limited</hi> that they <hi>go about,</hi> just where and when, and how far the Permission of God shall give them leave. As they are not now in all the <hi>Torment,</hi> so they are not now in all the <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> intended for them. Twas the Sentence of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49306:49"/>
wicked cursed <hi>Cain,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 14. A <hi>Fugitive</hi> and a <hi>Vagabond</hi> shalt thou be upon the earth.</p>
               <p>Tis the Case of every <hi>devil;</hi> he is A <hi>Fugitive</hi> and a <hi>Vagabond</hi> in our Air. They <hi>go about</hi> but <hi>Why!</hi> For no good, you may be sure. Tis with them as tis said to be with their <hi>Vassals,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 59. 15. <hi>They wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.</hi> They <hi>go about</hi> upon the <hi>Catch;</hi> they <hi>go about,</hi> that they may spy out objects to work upon; they <hi>go about,</hi> with a raging appetite after <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>Wages</hi> of it on the world. You shall see what the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures and Methods of the Devil are; they are drawn with a Pencil of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> in Psal. 10 4. <hi>He lyes in wait secretly, as a</hi> Lion <hi>in his den he lyes in wait to catch the poor; he does catch the poor when he drawes him into his net.</hi> Such a <hi>devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> Adversary have we to deal withal.</p>

                  <head>USE. I. <hi>INFORMATION.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>There are two Lessons that we may learn from these things. We may say after the Apostle in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Iob.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>In this the children of God are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest and the children of the</hi> Devil.</p>
                  <p>First. We may see from hence, <hi>who the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the devil</hi> are. <hi>Roaring</hi> Lions <hi>that go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seeking whom they may devour,</hi> what are they but the creatures whom the <hi>Devil</hi> is a <hi>Sire</hi> unto? We read of one in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19. 6. <hi>Who became a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49306:49"/>
young Lion and learned to catch the prey, &amp; devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men.</hi> Such Lions there often are in the world; sometimes there are men whose business, whose delight it is to <hi>devour</hi> their Neighbours; men who <hi>go about</hi> to impair the Estate, who <hi>go about</hi> to blemish the <hi>esteem,</hi> who <hi>go about</hi> to <hi>debanch</hi> the <hi>souls</hi> of other men. What shall be said of <hi>such men?</hi> Alas, the <hi>Devil</hi> is the Father of them all. I have no <hi>Blessing</hi> for any of them; but yet I may say to them, <hi>This is a lions whelp, to the prey, my son, thou art gone up.</hi> This is just like the great old <hi>Lion:</hi> with him, even with <hi>him</hi> shall they one day he punished, and undergo the doom in <hi>Ier.</hi> 51. 38. They shall roar together like <hi>Lions,</hi> they shall yell as <hi>Lions</hi> whelps. The great and the terible GOD will one day make the <hi>Sires</hi> and the <hi>Whelps</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to <hi>roar</hi> under the direful impressions of His everlasting wrath.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. From hence we may also see who are the Children of <hi>God.</hi> Tis said of our Lord Jesus Christ in <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 38. <hi>He went about doing good.</hi> There are some that <hi>go about</hi> seeking whom they may <hi>instruct,</hi> that <hi>go about</hi> seeking whom they may <hi>convert,</hi> that <hi>go about</hi> seeking whom they may <hi>relieve.</hi> The <hi>Lion of the tribe of Judah,</hi> is a Father to these holy men; Not the <hi>Devil</hi> but the <hi>Saviour</hi> is their pattern. The blessed, the glorious <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> the <hi>outragious Devils</hi> do thus improve themselves. <hi>Go on,</hi> Souls, go on thus to <hi>go about.</hi> I remember

old Mr. <hi>Latymer</hi> in a Sermon, has that sharp Reflection upon the lazy Bishops of his Time, that seldom or never preached in any one Pulpie of all their Diocess, <hi>For shame,</hi> (said he) <hi>you negligent Prelates, if you will not learn of</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> Christ, <hi>and</hi> good men, <hi>then learn of the</hi> Devil, <hi>learn of the</hi> Devil, <hi>who is alwaies at work in in his Diocess.</hi> Truly, we may <hi>learn of the Devil,</hi> to <hi>go about</hi> seeking the welfare of those whom he <hi>goes about</hi> seeking the Ruin of.</p>

                  <p>We have two things now incumbent on us.</p>

                  <p>First. Let us <hi>get</hi> from the <hi>Roaring Lion,</hi> by a sincere <hi>Turning</hi> to God in Christ. Hear &amp; quake all you that are yet in your unregenerate estate; you are in the mouth of the <hi>Roaring Lion:</hi> Oh, how can you be satisfyed or contented there? In <hi>Conversion,</hi> we are told in <hi>Act.</hi> 29. 18. men are turned <hi>from the power of satan unto God.</hi> Man, thou art under the <hi>under the power of satan,</hi> until thou art <hi>born again.</hi> O save thy self before it be <hi>too late.</hi> One once being ready to be devoured by a <hi>Lion,</hi> cry'd out, <hi>Help, help, I am yet alive! held, I am yet alive!</hi> O thou are <hi>yet alive,</hi> but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49306:50"/>
if thou art not quickly redeemed from the <hi>Lion,</hi> it will ere long be <hi>All too late! All too late!</hi> Quickly then Renounce the service of the <hi>Devil;</hi> Quickly loath, quickly leave all your Sins; Quickly run to God in Christ, and say unto Him as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 13. <hi>O Lord our God, other lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Thee have had dominion over us, but not we will make mention of Thy Name alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly. Let us <hi>Keep</hi> from the <hi>Roaring Lion,</hi> by a sincere <hi>Shunning</hi> of what will peculiarly bring us within his reach. Indeed every <hi>Lust,</hi> as it were surrenders us up unto the Devil: every time a man gratfies a <hi>Lust,</hi> a <hi>Devil</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited into the soul of that man; and by every <hi>new Act</hi> of it, he takes a <hi>new Hold</hi> of the soul. But some Vices there are which give the Devils <hi>peculiar</hi> opportunities to devour us Of these take heed with a more than ordinary Caution. Particularly,</p>
                  <p>First. Beware of <hi>Discontent.</hi> The devils are are wonderfully <hi>discontented Spirits;</hi> and none more than <hi>discontented Persons,</hi> ly open to their Invasion and Annoyance. The <hi>discontented</hi> man is angry at <hi>God;</hi> it is a rage at <hi>God,</hi> it is a Fret as <hi>God,</hi> which discomposes him. We are told about the man that is <hi>angry</hi> at his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 27. He <hi>gives place to the devil.</hi> How much more may this be said about the man who is <hi>angry at his maker?</hi> The <hi>devil finds a place</hi> in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49306:51"/>
the soul of such a man. Be not <hi>Angry</hi> at any <hi>Poverty,</hi> be not <hi>Angry</hi> at any <hi>Calumny,</hi> be not <hi>Angry</hi> at any <hi>Affliction</hi> whatsoever. <hi>Discontent</hi> opens the doors of the soul for all the <hi>devils</hi> of Hell to enter in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. Beware of <hi>Idleness,</hi> If <hi>thou</hi> art <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi> know that the <hi>devil</hi> is not so; the <hi>Idle soul</hi> is an <hi>empty House;</hi> there happens to it that thing in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44. <hi>The unclean spirit walks</hi> to and fro, and <hi>comes and finds the house empty, then gooth. He and taketh with himself seven other spirits, more wicked than himself, and they enter in.</hi> When the Devil finds an <hi>Idle</hi> person, he as in were, calls to more of his crue, <hi>Come here! come here! A brave prize for us all!</hi> When was a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> made a prize for a <hi>devil?</hi> It was when he rose from his <hi>Couch</hi> in the Afternoon, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his <hi>Balcony,</hi> as one that had nothing at all to do. Of <hi>Idleness comes</hi> no <hi>goodness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Beware of <hi>Bad Company.</hi> That is, (I had almost said) the greatest engine the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil has, to trepan the children of men withal, An evil Companion is a <hi>Gin</hi> for a soul. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils will have thee fast enough, if thou walkest in the counsil of the ungodly, and standest in the way of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and sittest in the seat of the scornful. The Devils, nay, and the <hi>Gallows</hi> too, at length often devour those that bad Company shall seduce Twas said to them of Old, <hi>Depart from the tents of the wisked men, left the earth swallow you up.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49306:51"/>
so, <hi>Depart</hi> from the <hi>Knots, depart</hi> from the <hi>Cups</hi> of wicked men, list the <hi>Devil</hi> swallow you up. Tis said in <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. <hi>A companion of fools shall be destroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. Let us <hi>Resist</hi> the <hi>Roaring Lion</hi> who <hi>goes about seeking whom he may devour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do you find the <hi>Devil</hi> ready to <hi>devour</hi> you? Be you as ready to <hi>oppose</hi> him. It is mentioned as a sore calamity in <hi>Psal.</hi> 109. 6. <hi>Let Satan stand at his right hand.</hi> Alas! This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our souls; we have <hi>Satan at hand,</hi> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gribe us in his hideous clawes.</p>
                  <p>How many <hi>Temptations</hi> does the <hi>Devil</hi> seek to to devour your souls withal? <hi>Temptations</hi> to <hi>Vncleanness</hi> and <hi>Worldliness</hi> are devouring of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Temptations</hi> to <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy</hi> are devouring of others. Perhaps, Temptations to <hi>Self-Murder</hi> have near devoured some unhappy souls. O Remember whence all these <hi>Temptations</hi> do arise. These things are the <hi>Roarings</hi> of the Hellish <hi>Lion;</hi> and will you hearken to <hi>him?</hi> Is there any thing in these cursed <hi>Roarings</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade your Hearkning thereunto? What Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, what Advantage, do you think these horrid <hi>Roarings</hi> can propound?</p>
                  <p>Come then, Resist the <hi>Temptations</hi> of this <hi>roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion.</hi> Tis said in <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 7. Resist <hi>the devil and he will flee from you.</hi> If you <hi>fly,</hi> he will be a <hi>Lion,</hi> if you <hi>fight,</hi> he will be a <hi>Gnat</hi> before you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Est</hi> Leo, <hi>si</hi> fugias; <hi>si</hi> stas, <hi>quasi</hi> musca <hi>recedit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49306:52"/>Your Encounters call for two Things.</p>
                  <p>One is, your <hi>Watch.</hi> Hence tis here said, <hi>Be vigilant, because your adversary the devil, as a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lion walketh about.</hi> When it was cry'd out unto the Champion of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16 20. <hi>The Philistines be upon thee, Sampson;</hi> Then <hi>he awoke out of his sleep.</hi> Thus it may be exclamed, The <hi>Lions</hi> are upon thee O soul. O how watchful, how wakeful should this cause thee to be. Be <hi>watchful</hi> against all <hi>the devices of the devil.</hi> Be <hi>watchful</hi> in every <hi>place,</hi> be <hi>watchful</hi> in every <hi>thing;</hi> be jealous alwaies, <hi>Has not the devil now some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is your <hi>Faith.</hi> Tis recorded in <hi>heb.</hi> 11. 33. some <hi>by</hi> Faith <hi>stopped the mouthes</hi> of <hi>Lions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho thou shouldst be in a <hi>Denful</hi> of them, yet <hi>Faith,</hi> true <hi>Faith</hi> would muzzle them <hi>all.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> repair to Christ, who is the true <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> which meets and slayes the Lions that roar upon our souls. By <hi>Faith</hi> repair to the <hi>Rock,</hi> even to the <hi>Rock that is higher than I!</hi> Where you may sit and shout and laugh at all the Lions that roar in the Wilderness, and say, Where I am, there you <hi>cannot</hi> come.</p>
                  <p>There are particularly two sorts of devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Temptations,</hi> which I would conclude this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sourse with some surable <hi>Reflections</hi> on.</p>
                  <p>Temptations to <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps do molest some among us; possibly, <hi>Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49306:52"/>
de DEO,</hi> and <hi>Horribilia de Fide:</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Suggestions about our <hi>God</hi> &amp; our <hi>Creed,</hi> may cast some of us into grievous Agonies: these things make many a good man to say, <hi>I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weary of my life!</hi> What shall in this case be done?</p>
                  <p>My Advice is,</p>
                  <p>Do not so much <hi>dispute,</hi> as <hi>deny</hi> the Injections of the wicked one. Don't glve the devil so much honour as to <hi>argue</hi> &amp; <hi>parley</hi> about his Iewd <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.</hi> Refuse them presently, refuse them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily; so you <hi>silence</hi> them. When once an <hi>Atheistic</hi> or <hi>Blasphemous</hi> Thought appears with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Minds, immediately hiss it away, as the Priests did <hi>Vzziah,</hi> when they first saw the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie in his <hi>Forehead.</hi> Let such Thoughts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately occasion in you the savory &amp; gracious Thoughts that shall be just contrary thereunto. If the devil would have you think, <hi>There is</hi> no <hi>God,</hi> then without any more a do, spite the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by such a Thought with an Ejaculation contradicting of it, Lord, I beleeve that thou art, and that thou art a <hi>Rewarder</hi> too. Don't object, What if there be <hi>no</hi> God? But suppose for once, That God <hi>is.</hi> Tis by far the <hi>sater</hi> Supposal of the two. And then try whether to <hi>Weary</hi> the devil be not the best way to <hi>Conquer</hi> him. Let every <hi>Fiery dart</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> fetch an <hi>holy dart</hi> of Prayer &amp; Grace from thee, and the devil will soon be weary of his Methods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49306:53"/>Temptations to <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> may likewise be fierce upon some unhappy people here. Tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unaccountable, that at some times in some places here, melancholy distempered Ragings toward <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> have been in a manner <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical.</hi> And it would make ones hair stand, to see or hear what manifest Assistence the Devils have given to these <hi>unnatural Self-executions</hi> when <hi>once</hi> they have been begun. Tis <hi>too</hi> evident, that persons are commonly <hi>bewitcth't</hi> or <hi>possess't</hi> into these unreasonable <hi>Phrensies.</hi> But What shall these hurried people do?</p>
                  <p>My Advice is,</p>
                  <p>Don't <hi>Conceal,</hi> much less <hi>Obey</hi> the motions of your Adversary. Failing in this, made a poor man, after a faithful Sermon in a Neighbouring Town, presently to drown himself in a pit that had not two foot of Water in it. If you will not <hi>Keep,</hi> that is the way not to <hi>Take</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Counsil. Let not him <hi>tye</hi> your <hi>Tongues,</hi> and it is likely he will not <hi>gain</hi> your <hi>Souls.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to a good <hi>God</hi> of the Dangers in which you find your selves; cry to Him, <hi>Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me.</hi> Complain also to a wise <hi>Friend.</hi> Let some prudent and faithful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour understand your Circumstances: Tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible you may thereby escape the <hi>Snares</hi> with which the cruel <hi>Fowlers</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> hope to trepan you into their dismal Clutches for evermore.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49306:53"/>
Your Neighbours may do much for you, and may prove your <hi>Keepers</hi> if God shall please. It may be the <hi>unkindness</hi> of some Friend, may have thrown you into your present Madness. Now the <hi>Kindness</hi> of some Friend may prove the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote. <hi>Manytimes,</hi> a <hi>Natural Destemper,</hi> is that by which the Devil takes advantage to get the souls of Self-Destroyers into his bloody hands. In this case, for the tempted persons to <hi>disclose</hi> their <hi>Griefs,</hi> will be the way to <hi>obtain</hi> their <hi>cures.</hi> Their Neighbours ought now to consult a <hi>skilful Physician</hi> for them; and <hi>oblige,</hi> yea, <hi>constrain</hi> them to follow his Directions. When the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> on &amp; by which the Devil works, are taken away, perhaps he may be starved out of doors. <hi>Many times,</hi> again, The sin of <hi>Slothfulness</hi> gives the Devil opportunity to procure the Self De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the sluggard. In this case too, the Tempted person may be succoured by the <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers-by</hi> becoming sensible of their Circumstances. Their Neighbours may now <hi>compel</hi> them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their business. A <hi>Calling,</hi> the <hi>Business</hi> of a <hi>Calling,</hi> is an Ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> sanctified by Him to deliver us from the evil spirits that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>empty house,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>most times,</hi> There may be some old and great <hi>Sin</hi> unrepented of, where Temptations to <hi>Self-Murder</hi> have a violence hardly to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, There was once a man among us, who in the horrours of Despair, uttered many dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49306:54"/>
speeches against himself, and would often particularly say, I am all on a <hi>light Fire</hi> under the wrath of God! This man yet never confess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any unusual sin, but this; that having gotten about Forty pounds by his Labour, he had <hi>spent</hi> it in <hi>wicked Company:</hi> but in his Anguish of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he hanged himself. There was once a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among us, who under Sickness hade made <hi>vowes</hi> of a <hi>New Life;</hi> but apprehending some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in her conversation afterward, she fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the distraction wherein she also hanged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And the Sin of <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness</hi> has more than once issued in such a destructive <hi>Desperation.</hi> In case of <hi>this</hi> or any <hi>such</hi> Guilt, <hi>Confession</hi> with <hi>Repentance</hi> affords a present Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. To fly from <hi>Soul-Terrour</hi> by <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> is to leap out of the <hi>Frying-pan</hi> into the <hi>Fire,</hi> Poor tempted People, I must like <hi>Paul</hi> in Prison, cry with a loud voice unto you. <hi>Do your selves no harm;</hi> all may be well yet, if you will hearken to the Counsils of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Do thou, O God of peace,</hi> bruise <hi>Satan under our feet world without end,</hi>

               <p>AS it is the Interest of all <hi>Christians</hi> to <hi>Consider the wondrous</hi> Works <hi>of God,</hi> so it is the Duty of all <hi>Ministers</hi> to study those of His <hi>Words,</hi> with a peculiar Application, at which His <hi>Works</hi> like <hi>Hands</hi> in the Margin thereof do point, with Endeavours to make their Hearers understand what <hi>Lessons</hi> of the former the <hi>Voices</hi> of the latter do more especially direct unto.</p>
               <p>A pious Family in this Town has lately had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling of it, a <hi>Providence</hi> full of many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances very astonishing; a <hi>Providence,</hi> wherein the <hi>Power</hi> of GOD, the <hi>Success</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Existence</hi> with the <hi>Operation</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> has been demonstrated in a manner truly extraordinary; a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49306:55"/>
                  <hi>Providence,</hi> whereof you have <hi>heard</hi> much, but I have <hi>seen</hi> more, and whereof neither <hi>you</hi> nor I can take a due Notice, without a solemn Discourse at this time upon it. 'Tis a <hi>Tribute</hi> owing to <hi>God</hi> that I <hi>Dispense,</hi> and 'tis a <hi>Revenge</hi> due unto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> that you should <hi>Attend</hi> the Truths proper to be delivered on an occasion so remarkable.</p>
               <p>When some poor people fell into the hands of a <hi>Pilate,</hi> our Saviour saw cause to preach a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> about <hi>Repentance</hi> thereupon: What less than a <hi>Sermon</hi> can be call'd for when some poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have lately fall'n into the hands of a <hi>Divel?</hi> tho' thanks be to our <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Lambs</hi> are like to be delivered from the Hellish Monsters to which they were become a Prey. And this may seem the rather convenient, because the <hi>godly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of the Children has desir'd it. For which cause the Text before us may be proper to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on.</p>
               <p>The Great GOD had <hi>three seueral times</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Nation of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> was to be destroyed and extirpated forevermore. King <hi>Saul</hi> was now employed in an Expedition against them, to <hi>accomplish</hi> that Prediction, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Vengeance of Heaven upon the present Generation of them, not only for their <hi>own Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi> and <hi>Villany,</hi> but also for the Wickedness of their <hi>Ancestors</hi> four hundred years before. The Soveraign God had <hi>Anathematiz'd</hi> every living thing among them, and ordered that both <hi>Man</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49306:55"/>
and <hi>Beast</hi> should fall in the day of <hi>Slaughter.</hi> The Army, on I know not what pretence, did not observe this <hi>Commission,</hi> for which reason <hi>Samuel</hi> is now sent unto their Leader with dismal <hi>Rebukes</hi> and heavy <hi>Tidings</hi> for his Disobedience. In the Text before us, the Prophet aggravates the Sin of <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By <hi>Describing</hi> of the Sin. The <hi>right Name</hi> is here put upon it; and it is called <hi>Rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God.</item>
                     <item>2. By <hi>Comparing</hi> of the Sin. It is resembled unto <hi>Witchraft</hi> it self: not an <hi>Equality,</hi> but a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</hi> between them is intended. It is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be as a <hi>great</hi> an Evil, but as <hi>true</hi> an Evil as <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is. That <hi>Witchcraft</hi> was a Sin far from venial, must be own'd by <hi>Saul,</hi> who had lately scow'red all the <hi>Witches</hi> out of <hi>Israel:</hi> It is now said, <hi>Such a Fault is thine.</hi> The following Expression carries on the same sense; and the meaning of <hi>that</hi> is, That they who adored and <hi>Idol,</hi> (for so I would rather translate the word here rendred <hi>Iniquity</hi>) or they who consulted at <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which was a sort of little <hi>Image</hi> from whence <hi>Daemons</hi> gave <hi>Answers</hi> to Enquirers; even these are not more <hi>unquestionable Sinners</hi> than those that add <hi>Stubbornness</hi> to <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the Lord.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>DOCTRINE</hi> which wee have now before us, is, <hi>That</hi> Witchcraft <hi>is a monstrous &amp; an horrid</hi> Evil.

                  <p>Such an Hellish thing there is as <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in the World. There are Two things which will be desired for the advantage of this Assertion. It should <hi>first</hi> be show'd,</p>

But from Accounts both by <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> I have learn'd to describe it so.</p>
                     <p>WITCHCRAFT is the Doing of <hi>Strange</hi> (and for the most part <hi>Ill</hi>) Things by the help of <hi>evil Spirits, Covenanting</hi> with (and usually <hi>Representing</hi> of) the wosul Children of men.</p>

But <hi>Wonders</hi> are often produced by them, though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49306:56"/>
chiefly such Wonders as the Apostle calls in 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Lying wonders.</hi> There are <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Storms</hi> in the <hi>great</hi> World, and <hi>wonderful Wounds in</hi> the <hi>little</hi> World, often effected by these <hi>evil Causes.</hi> They do things which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the ordinary <hi>Course</hi> of Nature, and which puzzle the ordinary <hi>Sense</hi> of Mankind. Some <hi>strange</hi> things are done by them in a way of <hi>Real Production.</hi> They do really <hi>Torment,</hi> they do really <hi>Afflict</hi> those that their Spite shall extend unto. Other <hi>Strange</hi> Things are done by them in a way of <hi>Crafty Illusion.</hi> They do craftily make of the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> of things that never can be truly created by them. All men might <hi>see,</hi> but, I believe, no man could <hi>feel</hi> some of the Things which the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> exhibited of old.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi> They are not only <hi>strange</hi> Things, but <hi>Ill</hi> Things, that <hi>Witches</hi> are the Doers of. In this regard also they are not the Authors of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:</hi> those are things <hi>commonly</hi> done for the <hi>Good</hi> of Man, <hi>alwaies</hi> done for the <hi>Praise</hi> of <hi>GOD.</hi> But of these <hi>Hell-hounds</hi> it may in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be said, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 52. 3. <hi>Thou lovest evil more than good.</hi> For the most part they labour to robb <hi>Man</hi> of his <hi>Ease</hi> or his <hi>Wealth;</hi> they labour to wrong <hi>God</hi> of His <hi>Glory.</hi> There is Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Creatures that they call <hi>White Whitches,</hi> which do only <hi>Good-Turns</hi> for their Neighbours. I suspect that there are none of that sort;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49306:57"/>
but rather think, <hi>There is none that doeth good no, not one.</hi> If they <hi>do good,</hi> it is only that they <hi>may</hi> do <hi>hurt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly.</hi> It is by virtue of <hi>evil Spirits</hi> that <hi>Witches</hi> do what they do. We read in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2, 2. about the <hi>Prince of the power of the air.</hi> There is confined unto the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> of our <hi>Air</hi> a vast <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> under the Government of a Prince who employes them in a continual Opposition to the Designs of GOD: The Name of that <hi>Leviathan</hi> who is the <hi>Grand-Segniour of Hell,</hi> we find in the Scripture to be <hi>Belzebub.</hi> Under the Command of that mighty Tyrant, there are vast <hi>Legions</hi> &amp; <hi>Myriads</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, whose <hi>Businesses</hi> &amp; <hi>Accomplishments</hi> are not all the same. Every one has his <hi>Post,</hi> and his <hi>Work;</hi> and they are all glad of an opportunity to be <hi>mischievous</hi> in the World. These are they by whom <hi>Witches</hi> do exert their Devillish and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Rage upon their <hi>Neighbours:</hi> And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Two Acts concur hereunto. The <hi>First</hi> is, Their <hi>Covenanting</hi> with the Witches. There is a most hellish <hi>League</hi> made between them, with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> The <hi>Witches</hi> promise to serve the <hi>Devils,</hi> and the <hi>Devils</hi> promise to <hi>help</hi> the Witches; <hi>How?</hi> It is not convenient to be related. The <hi>Second</hi> is, Their <hi>Representing</hi> of the Witches. And hereby indeed these are drawn into <hi>Snares</hi> and <hi>Cords</hi> of Death. The <hi>Devils,</hi> when they go upon the Errands of the <hi>Witches,</hi> do
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49306:57"/>
hear their <hi>Names;</hi> and hence do <hi>Harmes</hi> too come to be carried from the <hi>Devils</hi> to the <hi>Witches.</hi> We need not suppose such a wild thing as the <hi>Transforming</hi> of those Wretches into <hi>Bruits</hi> or <hi>Birds,</hi> as we too often do.</p>
                     <p>It should next be proved <hi>THAT</hi> Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft <hi>is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Being</hi> of such a thing is denied by many that place a <hi>great part</hi> of their <hi>small wit</hi> in deride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stories that are told of it. Their chief Argument is, That they never <hi>saw</hi> any Witches, therefore there are <hi>none.</hi> Just as if you or I should say, We never met with any <hi>Robbers</hi> on the Road, therefore there never was any <hi>Padding</hi> there.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the <hi>Devils</hi> are loath to have true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Witches</hi> entertained with us. I have beheld them to put out the eyes of an enchaunted Child, when a Book that proves, <hi>There is Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi> was laid before her. But there are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Two Demonstrations that evince the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Infernal mysterious thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First.</hi> We have the Testimony of <hi>Scripture</hi> for it. We find <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> often mentioned, sometimes by way of <hi>Assertion,</hi> sometimes by way of <hi>Allusion,</hi> in the Oracles of God. Besides that, We have there the History of diverse <hi>Witches</hi> in these infallible and inspired Writings Particularly, the Instance of the <hi>Witch</hi> at <hi>Endor,</hi> in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 7. is so plain and full that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49306:58"/>
                        <hi>Witchcraft</hi> it self is not a more amazing thing than any <hi>Dispute</hi> about the Being of it, after this. The Advocates of <hi>Witches</hi> must use more <hi>Tricks</hi> to make Nonsense of the <hi>Bible,</hi> than ever the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor</hi> used in her Magical Incantations, if they would evade the Force of that famous History. They that will believe no <hi>Witches,</hi> do imagine that <hi>Iugglers</hi> only are meant by them whom the Sacred Writ calleth so. But what do they think of that Law in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 18. <hi>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live?</hi> Methinks 'tis a little too hard to punish every silly <hi>Iuggler</hi> with so great Severity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi> We have the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Experience</hi> for it. What will those <hi>Incredulous,</hi> who must be the only <hi>Ingenious</hi> men say to This? Many <hi>Witches</hi> have like those in <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 18. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and shewed their Deeds.</hi> We see those things done, that it is impossible any <hi>Disease,</hi> or any <hi>Deceit</hi> should procure. We see some hideous <hi>Wretches</hi> in hideous <hi>Horrours</hi> confessing, <hi>That they did the Mischiefs.</hi> This Confession is often made by them that are owners of as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as the people that laugh at all <hi>Conceit</hi> of <hi>VVitchraft:</hi> the exactest Scrutiny of skilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians cannot find any Distraction in their minds. This <hi>Confession</hi> is often made by them that are apart One from another, and yet they <hi>agree</hi> in all the Circumstances of it. This <hi>Confession</hi> is often made by them that at the same time will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49306:58"/>
produce the <hi>Engines</hi> and <hi>Ensignes</hi> of their <hi>Hellish Trade,</hi> and give the standers-by an <hi>Ocular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> of <hi>what</hi> they do, and <hi>how.</hi> There can be no Judgment left of any <hi>Humane Affairs,</hi> if such <hi>Confessions</hi> must be Ridiculed to all the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> yea, and all he <hi>Bargains</hi> in the World must be meer <hi>Imaginations</hi> if such <hi>Confessions</hi> are of no Account.</p>

                  <p>WITCHCRAFT is a most Monstrous and Horrid <hi>Evil.</hi> Indeed there is a vast Heap of bloody roaring Impieties contained in the <hi>Bowels</hi> of it. <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> is a Renouncing of <hi>GOD,</hi> and Advancing of a filthy <hi>Devil</hi> into the Throne of the Most High; 'tis the most nefandous <hi>High-Treason</hi> against the MAJESTY on High. <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> is a Renouncing of <hi>Christ,</hi> and Preferring the Communion of a loathsome lying <hi>Devil</hi> before all the Salvation of the Lord Redeemer; 'tis a Trampling under foot that <hi>Blood</hi> which is more precious than <hi>Hills</hi> of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> or whole <hi>Mountains</hi> of <hi>Gold.</hi> There is in <hi>Witchraft,</hi> a most explicit <hi>Renouncing</hi> of all that is <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> given by <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Prayer</hi> taught by <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Creed</hi> left by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> is become Abominable where <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is embraced: The very Reciting of those blessed Things is commonly burdensome where <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is. All the <hi>sure Mercies</hi> of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49306:59"/>
                     <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and all the <hi>just Duties</hi> of it, are utterly abdicated by that <hi>cursed Covenant</hi> which <hi>Witchraft</hi> is Constituted with. <hi>Witchraft,</hi> is a Siding with <hi>Hell</hi> against <hi>Heaven</hi> &amp; <hi>Earth;</hi> and therefore a <hi>Witch</hi> is not to be endured in either of them. 'Tis a <hi>Capital</hi> Crime; and it is to be prosecuted as a piece of <hi>Devilism</hi> that would not only deprive <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> of all His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but also plunder <hi>Man</hi> of all his Comfort. <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> it's an impotent, but an impudent <hi>Essay</hi> to make an <hi>Hell</hi> of the Universe, and to allow Nothing but a <hi>Tophet</hi> in the World. <hi>Witchcraft,</hi>—What shall I say of it!

               <div n="3" type="proposition">
                  <head>PROP. III.</head>
                  <p>REBELLION against God has very much like to <hi>Witchraft</hi> in it. Something like to <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> there is in an <hi>Act</hi> of Rebellion; But a <hi>Course</hi> of Rebellion has much more like to <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> in it. Some persons there are whose <hi>way</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49306:59"/>
is that of <hi>wickedness,</hi> whose <hi>work</hi> is that of <hi>Iniquity.</hi> Those persons do what is <hi>like Witchcraft</hi> every day.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>First.</hi> In <hi>Rebellion,</hi> men cast off the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of God: The <hi>Witch</hi> declares a Will to be no more disposed &amp; ordered by the Will of <hi>God;</hi> she says, <hi>God shall not be my Governour.</hi> Such is the Language of <hi>Rebellion.</hi> When men <hi>rebel</hi> against God. They say like him in <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>I know not the Lord, and I will not obey His voice.</hi> They say like them in <hi>Ier.</hi> 44. 16. <hi>As for the word—spoken—in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken thereunto.</hi> There is indeed a sort of <hi>Atheism</hi> in <hi>Rebellion</hi> The Sinner is a <hi>Fool</hi> that wishes, <hi>O that there were no God!</hi> that resolves, <hi>God shall not be Lord over me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> In <hi>Rebellion</hi> men Refuse the <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> The <hi>Witch</hi> contemns all the Offers of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and prizes the dirty proffers that <hi>Satan</hi> makes before them all. This is the plain English of <hi>Rebellion;</hi> it sayes, What is tendred by the <hi>Devil,</hi> is better than what is tendred by the <hi>Saviour.</hi> The LORD said about <hi>Israel</hi> of old in <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 11. <hi>Israel</hi> would none of Me. Thus 'tis when men <hi>rebel</hi> against God. A <hi>Iesus</hi> may say, <hi>Those poor creatures will have none of Me, nor of My Bloud.</hi> A <hi>Pardon</hi> may say, <hi>Those guilty creatures will have none of me.</hi> A <hi>Kingdom</hi> may say, <hi>Those undone creatures will have none of me.</hi> Where <hi>Sin</hi> is committed, there <hi>Christ</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised. This doleful <hi>Phrensy</hi> is in all <hi>Rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49306:60"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> In <hi>Rebellion</hi> men <hi>choose</hi> and <hi>serve</hi> the the <hi>Devil</hi> as their Lord. The <hi>Witch</hi> makes an horrible Agreement with <hi>Devils,</hi> to be <hi>theirs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. This is the intent of all <hi>Rebellion</hi> too. It in short saies, Let the <hi>Devil</hi> rule; it sayes, Let the <hi>Devil</hi> be humour'd and gratify'd. As that cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly King said unto the <hi>Syrian,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>My Lord, O King, I am thine and all that I have.</hi> Thus the ungodly man sayes unto the Devil; <hi>Thou art my Lord and my King.</hi> All <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> against God, is in <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Devil.</hi> When men <hi>rebel,</hi> they lay their <hi>Wit,</hi> their <hi>Love,</hi> their <hi>Strength,</hi> and all the Instruments of that Rebellion before the Devil, and they say. <hi>This is</hi> thine, <hi>O Satan, and all that they have.</hi> They do even <hi>sell themselves to the Devil!</hi> as we read of one, <hi>He sold himself to work wickedness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> In <hi>Rebellion,</hi> Men cast the <hi>Bond</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> of their <hi>Baptism</hi> behind their Back. Among the Customs of <hi>Witches,</hi> this is one, They <hi>Renounce</hi> their <hi>Baptism</hi> in a manner very Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical. The same thing is done in the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of a wicked man. We are told in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. that the thing which renders <hi>Baptism</hi> available is <hi>The answer of a good Conscience.</hi> But in <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> against God, men give the answer of an <hi>Evil</hi> Conscience, and so make a <hi>Nullity</hi> of their Sacred, Baptism. The Demand of God is <hi>VVilt thou Beleeve as Baptised persons do profess to do?</hi> The <hi>Rebel</hi> answers, <hi>No, I will continue shutt up in my Vnbeleef.</hi> The Demand of God is, <hi>VVillt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49306:60"/>
thou put on Christ, as the Baptised profess to do?</hi> The <hi>Rebel</hi> answers, <hi>No, I will put on the old man.</hi> The Almighty God puts that Question, VVilt thou forsake the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> as thy <hi>Baptism</hi> dos oblige to do? In <hi>Rebellion</hi> the Answer of sinful man, is, <hi>No, I will serve them all; they shall all be the Idols of my Soul.</hi> With what Conscience can they answer so! But thus their <hi>Baptism</hi> is nothing with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly.</hi> All that <hi>rebel</hi> against God, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Mischievous</hi> in doing so. They are <hi>Mischiefs</hi> that <hi>VVitches</hi> are delighted in. Thus 'tis the end of <hi>Rebellion</hi> to bring <hi>destruction</hi> upon all that are near unto it. 'Tis said in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>One sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> destroyeth <hi>much good.</hi> It is the ill-Hap of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> like <hi>Witches</hi> to <hi>do hurt</hi> wherever they come; they <hi>hurt</hi> the <hi>souls</hi> of their Neighbours by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of their <hi>Evil Communication;</hi> they <hi>hurt</hi> the <hi>Names</hi> of their Neighbours by their <hi>slandrous Defamation;</hi> they <hi>hurt</hi> their <hi>Estates</hi> by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the fiery Judgments of Heaven upon all the Neighbourhood. Unto <hi>Rebellion</hi> against God, are owing all the Distresses and Miseries of a calamitous World. This is the <hi>Achan,</hi> this is the <hi>Troubler</hi> of us all.</p>
                  <p>The Improvement of these things now calls for our <hi>Earnest Heed;</hi> and unto each of our Three Propositions, we may annex <hi>Applications</hi> agreeable thereunto. I begin with</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>There are especially Two <hi>Inferences</hi> to be drawn from this Position, That, Such a thing there is as <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in the world.</p>
                        <p>[First.] Since there are <hi>VVitches,</hi> we are to suppose that there are <hi>Devils</hi> too. Those are the Objects that <hi>VVitches</hi> converse withal. It was the Heresy of the ancient <hi>Sadducees</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 8. <hi>The</hi> Sadducees <hi>do say, That there is neither Angel nor spirit.</hi> And there are multitudes of <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees</hi> yet in our dayes; <hi>Fools,</hi> that say, <hi>Seeing is Beleeving;</hi> and will <hi>beleeve</hi> nothing but what they <hi>see.</hi> A <hi>Devil,</hi> is in the apprehension of those Mighty acute Philosophers, no more than a <hi>Quality,</hi> or a <hi>Distemper.</hi> But, as <hi>Paul</hi> said unto Him of old, <hi>King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>Beleevest thou the Prophets?</hi> Thus <hi>I</hi> would say, <hi>Friend, Beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou the Scriptures?</hi> I pray, What sort of things were they, of whom we read in <hi>Iude.</hi> 6.? <hi>Angels that kept not their first estate, but left their own Habitation, and be reserved in chains unto the judgment of the great day.</hi> What sort of things were they, who in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16. Besought <hi>our Lord,</hi> If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine? What thing was that, which in <hi>Luc.</hi> 4. 33. cryed out unto the Lord Jesus with a loud voice, <hi>Let us alone?</hi> Surely, These things could be none but <hi>Spiritual and rational substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, full of all</hi> Wickeness <hi>against God, and</hi> Enmity <hi>against Man.</hi> We shall come to have no <hi>Christ</hi>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49306:61"/>
but a <hi>Light within,</hi> and no <hi>Heaven</hi> but a <hi>Frame of mind;</hi> if the Scriptures must be expounded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Rules of the modern <hi>Sadducees.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps tho' the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are <hi>Fables</hi> to that sort of men. Come then, thou <hi>Sadducee,</hi> What kind of thing is that which will so handle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ingenuous well-disposed persons, That if any <hi>Devotions</hi> be performed, they shall <hi>roar</hi> &amp; <hi>tear</hi> unreasonably, and have such <hi>Noises</hi> and such <hi>Tortures</hi> in them, as not only to hinder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>wholly,</hi> but others <hi>too much</hi> from joyning in the Service; and strive to <hi>kick</hi> or <hi>strike</hi> the Minister in his Prayers, but have their <hi>hands</hi> or <hi>feet</hi> strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stopt when they are just come at him, and yet be quiet before and after the <hi>VVorship?</hi> That if any <hi>Idle</hi> or <hi>Vseless</hi> Discourse be going, they shall be well, but at any <hi>serious</hi> Discourse they shall be tormented in all their Limbs? That If a portion of the <hi>Bible</hi> be readd, tho they <hi>see</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> nothing of it, and tho, it may be, in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> too, they shall fall into terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Agonies, which will be over when the <hi>Bible</hi> is laid aside?

Let me ask, <hi>Is not the hand of</hi> Joab <hi>in all this?</hi> or, Is there not a <hi>Divel</hi> whose Agency must account for things that are so extravagant?

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49306:62"/>
all these things,</hi> and many other more, no less amazing. Christian, There are <hi>Devils:</hi> and so many of them too, that sometimes a <hi>Legion</hi> of them are spar'd for the vexation of <hi>one man.</hi> The <hi>Air</hi> in which we breath is full of them. Be sensible of this, you that <hi>obey God:</hi> there are Troops of <hi>Tempters</hi> on every side of thee. <hi>Awake,</hi> O Soul, Awake, Those <hi>Philistines</hi> of Hell <hi>are upon thee.</hi> Upon the least affrightment in the dark, many simple people cry out, <hi>The Devil! The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil!</hi> Alas, there are <hi>Devils</hi> thronging about thee every day. O let the thought of it make thee a careful and a watchful man. And be sensible of this you that <hi>commit Sin:</hi> The Lord Jesus hath said of you, <hi>Ye will do the lusts of your father the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. How often do many of you make a <hi>Mock</hi> and a <hi>Ieer</hi> of the Devil while you are drudging for him? But know, that there are dreadful <hi>Devils</hi> to seize upon thy forlorn forsaken soul, at its departure hence. O become a new man at the thought of this.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Since there are <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> we may conclude that there are also <hi>Immortal Souls, Devils</hi> would never contract with <hi>Witches</hi> for their Souls if there were no such things to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey unto them. One of the <hi>Popas</hi> when he lay dying, said, <hi>I shall now quickly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have an</hi> Immortal Soul <hi>or no.</hi> Within less than a hundred years, you &amp; I shall be convinced of it, if we are not so before. We may truly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49306:62"/>
say, <hi>Devils</hi> &amp; <hi>Witches</hi> bear a witness against them that have any scruple of it. There are some dreaming Hereticks, that hold <hi>Man wholly mortal:</hi> I am sure the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was not of their <hi>breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Opinion, when he said in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.</hi> Nor was the Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> of their Opinion, when he expired saying, in <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 59. <hi>Lord Iesus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my spirit.</hi> Nor was our Lord Jesus Himself of that opinion, when He said unto Theef on the Cross in <hi>Luc.</hi> 23. 43. <hi>This day thou shalt the with Me in Paradise.</hi> 'Tis an Opinion unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a man that is owner of a <hi>Soul.</hi> The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken <hi>Indians,</hi> when first they saw a man on Horse-back, did conceit the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Horse</hi> to be <hi>one</hi> Creature: it is as soul an Error to conceit that it is but <hi>one thing</hi> which man consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of. No, 'Tis a right <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>The Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living</hi> SOUL. Remember, Thou hast in thee a <hi>living soul;</hi> or a <hi>Spirit,</hi> able to <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>argue</hi> so as nothing else in the <hi>visible Creation</hi> can. This <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving soul</hi> is the <hi>Candle of the Lord</hi> within thee, and no Wind, no Death can ever extinguish it.

                        </head>
                        <p>There is one thing to be now pressed upon us all.</p>
                        <p>Let us wisely endeavour to be preserved from the Molestations of all <hi>Witchraft</hi> whatsoever. Since there is a thing so dangerous, <hi>defend</hi> your selves, and <hi>shelter</hi> your selves by all <hi>right</hi> means against the annoyance of it.</p>
                        <p>Consider the <hi>Multitudes</hi> of them, whom <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> hath sometimes given <hi>Trouble to.</hi> Persons of <hi>all sorts</hi> have been racked and ruin'd by it; and not a <hi>few</hi> of them neither. It is hardly twenty years ago, that a whole Kingdom in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> was alarum'd by such potent <hi>Witchcrafts;</hi> that some hundreds of poor Children were inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them. Persons of great <hi>Honour</hi> have sometimes been cruelly <hi>bewitched.</hi> What lately besell a worthy <hi>Knight</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is well known unto the world. Persons of great <hi>Vertue</hi> too, have been bewitched, even into their Graves. But Four years are passed since a holy man was kill'd in this doleful way, after the <hi>Ioy</hi> as well as the <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD had been wonderfully fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him. This Consideration should keep us from <hi>censuring</hi> of those that <hi>Witchcraft</hi> may give Disturbance to: but it should put us on <hi>study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of our own security. <hi>Suppose ye</hi> that the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Family</hi> in the Town, were sinners above all <hi>the Town,</hi> because they have suffered such things I tell ye Nay, but except ye repent, ye may <hi>all</hi> be so dealt withall. The Father of <hi>Lies</hi> vttered an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

Truth when he said through the mouth of a possessed man, <hi>If God would give me leave, I would find enough in the best of you all, to make you all mine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Consider also, the <hi>Misery</hi> of them whom <hi>Witchcraft</hi> may be <hi>let loose</hi> upon. If <hi>David</hi> thought it a sad thing to <hi>fall into the hands of</hi> men; What is it to <hi>fall into the hands of</hi> Devils? The Hands of <hi>Turks,</hi> of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of <hi>Indians,</hi> are not so dreadful as those hands that <hi>Witches</hi> do their <hi>works of Darkness</hi> by. O what a diresh I thing is it, to be prick't with <hi>Pins,</hi> and stab'd with <hi>Knives</hi> all over, and to be fill'd over with <hi>broken Bones?</hi> 'Tis impossible to reckon up the Varieties of miseries which those Monsters inflict where they can have a Blow. No less than <hi>Death,</hi> and that a languishing and a terrible <hi>Death</hi> will satisfie the Rage of those sormidable Dragons. Indeed <hi>Witchcraft</hi> sometimes growes up into <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi> it self: the Devils that are permitted to <hi>torment,</hi> at last do possess the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched sufferers.</hi> But who can bear the thoughts of that! who can forbear crying out, <hi>O Lord, my flesh trembles for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of Thy Iudgements.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What shall then be done for our <hi>Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Away with all <hi>superstitious.</hi> Preservatives; about <hi>those</hi> Confidences the Word of God is that in <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Thou shalt not prosper in them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But there are Three admirable <hi>Amalets</hi> that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49306:64"/>
I can heartily recommend unto you all.</p>
                        <p>The First Preservative is, <hi>A fervent</hi> PRAYER. Pour out that <hi>Prayer</hi> before the Lord, in <hi>Psal,</hi> 59. 2, 3. <hi>Deliver me from the workers of</hi> Iniquity, <hi>and save me from the bloody ones; for lo, they lie in wait for my soul.</hi> And be much in Prayer every day. The Devils are <hi>afraid</hi> of our <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> they tremble and complain, and are in a sort of <hi>Anguish</hi> while our <hi>Prayers</hi> are going. There was a house of a Renowned Minister in <hi>France</hi> insested with <hi>evil Spirits;</hi> who tho' they had been very troublesome, yet when the good man was betaking himself to prayer, they would say, Now you are going to <hi>Prayer,</hi> I'll be gone. Let us <hi>pray</hi> much, and we need <hi>fear</hi> nothing. Particularly, Let <hi>Ejaculatory</hi> Prayers be almost continually in our minds, and so we shall never<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly open to the <hi>fiery darts of the wicked one.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second Preservative is <hi>A lively Faith.</hi> The Psalmist <hi>well</hi> said, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 2, 3, <hi>Mine enemies would daily swallow me up; At what time I am afraid I will trust in thee.</hi> Be not <hi>afraid</hi> of any <hi>Devils;</hi> If you are, turn the <hi>Fear</hi> into <hi>Faith.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> resign your selves to the Cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ody of Him that is <hi>the Keeper of Israel.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> perswade your selves that <hi>He is able to keep what you have committed unto Him.</hi> Thus, Run to the <hi>Rock,</hi> and there triumph over all the <hi>powers of darkness.</hi> Triumph and say, <hi>The Lord is on my side; I will not fear; What can Hell do unto me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49306:64"/>The Third Preservative is, <hi>A Holy Life.</hi> There was a very <hi>Holy</hi> Man of old, <hi>a man, that feared God &amp; eschewed evil;</hi> and the Devils mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd, in <hi>Iob,</hi> 1. 10. <hi>God has made an hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him.</hi> The same have the Devils confest, when they have plotted against other holy men. Do not thou break the hedge of God's <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> and perhaps he will not let any break the hedge of his <hi>Providence,</hi> by which thou art secured. The holy <hi>Angels</hi> are the Friends, the Guardians, the Companions, of all <hi>holy men;</hi> they may open their eyes, and see <hi>more with them than against them.</hi> A <hi>Camp,</hi> an <hi>Host</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> will fight against all the <hi>Harpies</hi> of Hell which may offer to devour a Saint of GOD.</p>
                        <p>Use these things as the <hi>Shields</hi> of the Lord; so you shall be <hi>preserved in Christ Iesus</hi> from the assaults of the <hi>Destroyer.</hi> Suppose now that any <hi>Witches</hi> may let fly their <hi>Curses</hi> at you, you are now like a <hi>Bird</hi> on the <hi>Wing,</hi> in such Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motions that they cannot hitt you. Now the <hi>Devils</hi> and their Creatures cannot say of you, as the <hi>Daemon</hi> said of the Christian woman whom, at a <hi>Stage-play</hi> he took <hi>Possission</hi> of, and being asked, gave this reason of his taking her, <hi>I found her on my own ground.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>And that must be a <hi>Counsel</hi> from God unto us all. Particularly,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49306:65"/>
Since <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is an <hi>Evil</hi> so horrible.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To them that may be <hi>Enticed</hi> unto the Sin of Witchcraft. To them we say,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Take heed that you be not by any <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> drawn into this <hi>monstrous</hi> and <hi>horrid</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                     <p>The best man that ever breathed was <hi>tempted</hi> hereunto; that man who was more than a <hi>meer</hi> Man, was assaulted by the <hi>Cheef Devil</hi> of the <hi>lowest Hell</hi> with this Temptation in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Fall down and worship me.</hi> But by the <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi> our Lord kept him off. If any of you are by any Devil so sollicited, thus <hi>resist,</hi> thus <hi>repel</hi> all the Motions of the <hi>wicked one.</hi> Don't give your selves away to those Deceivers that will become <hi>Tormentors</hi> of your soul in another world.</p>
                     <p>It may be the proposal of this Counsel may make some to say as he in 2. <hi>King.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>What? is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?</hi> I answer, Alas, we should every one of us be a <hi>dog</hi> and a <hi>Witch</hi> too, if God should have us to our selves. It is the meer <hi>Grace</hi> of God, the <hi>Chains</hi> of which restrain us from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Chains of darkness</hi> upon our Souls. The <hi>Humble</hi> and (therefore) <hi>Holy</hi> Martyr <hi>Bradford,</hi> when he heard of any Wickedness committed in the Neighbourhood, would lay his hand on his <hi>Breast</hi> and say, <hi>In this heart of mine, is that which should render me as wicked as the worst in the world,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49306:65"/>
If God should leave me to my self.</hi> When we see a forlorn wretch executed for <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> you and I may say the same. They that are Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ee <hi>now,</hi> once little dream't of ever becoming so. <hi>Let him that stands, take heed lest he fall.</hi> If we would not fall into that <hi>horrible pit,</hi> Let us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low these Directions.</p>

                        <p>Avoid those <hi>Ill Frames</hi> which are a <hi>Step</hi> to <hi>Witchcraft.</hi> There are especially <hi>Two</hi> ill Frames which do lead people on to the worst <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> in the world.

Down right <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is the up-shot of it. We find in <hi>Luc.</hi> 4. 2. our Lord, <hi>hungred,</hi> and then the Devil came in an <hi>audible</hi> or a <hi>visible</hi> manner to Him, tho he had been more spiritually <hi>long</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore assaulting of Him. They are <hi>needy</hi> persons whom Devils make the most <hi>likely</hi> attempts upon. And some persons are not only <hi>Hungry,</hi> but <hi>Angry</hi> too; but then every <hi>Fret,</hi> every <hi>Fume</hi> is as it were a Call to the <hi>Devils;</hi> it calls to them, <hi>Come and help me.</hi> Shun also a Frame of <hi>Ill-Wishing.</hi> There is a Witchcraft <hi>begun</hi> in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49306:66"/>
Imprecations of wicked people. Many profane persons will wish the <hi>Devil</hi> to take this &amp; that, or, the Devil to <hi>do</hi> this &amp; that; and when they <hi>call,</hi> at last he <hi>comes,</hi> or at least the Divel <hi>do's</hi> what they wish Observe this, We are by our Sins worthy to have <hi>Mischiefs</hi> befalling us every day; and the Devils are alwaies ready to inflict what we deserve. I am also apt to think that the Devils are seldome able to hurt us in any of our <hi>exteriour</hi> Concerns without a Commission from some of our <hi>fellow-worms.</hi> It is intimated in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 9.

                        <p>First, There are some that make use of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Charms</hi> for the <hi>curing</hi> of <hi>Mischiefs.</hi> It is too common a thing for persons to <hi>oppose Witchcraft</hi> it <hi>self</hi> with Witchcraft.

Compact it is, as it were, to say, O De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>Thou hast agreed with such a person that they shall be expos'd unto Torments by the use of such or such a Caeremony, we do now use the Caeremony, and expect thy blessing upon it.</hi> This is the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage foamed out by this foolish <hi>Magic.</hi> Do's not thy Conscience <hi>tremble</hi> at such Iniquity and Impiety? This may be to <hi>heal</hi> a <hi>Body,</hi> but it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49306:67"/>
is to destroy a soul. These persons give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>Devils</hi> to be deliver'd from the <hi>Witches.</hi> And the people that are eas'd &amp; help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such meanes, they say, do usually come to unhappy <hi>Ends.</hi> Let me say as in 2. <hi>King.</hi> 1. 3. Is there not a God in <hi>Israel,</hi> that you go to <hi>Belzebub?</hi> What? will not <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> do, but must the <hi>Black Art</hi> be used against our enemies?</p>
                        <p>It is likewise <hi>too common</hi> a thing in almost <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Disease</hi> to seek an <hi>unlawful Medicine.</hi> Thus for the <hi>Ague,</hi> for the <hi>Tooth-ach,</hi> and for what not? a <hi>Mumbling</hi> of some <hi>words</hi> must be made, or a <hi>Paper</hi> of some <hi>words</hi> must be <hi>worn.</hi> From what can the Efficacy of these <hi>words</hi> proceed, but from the <hi>Consent</hi> and the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils?</hi> The Witches have their <hi>Watch-words,</hi> which I list not to recite: upon those Watch-words the <hi>devils</hi> do their Commands.

There are some that make Use of wicked Charms, for the <hi>Finding of Secrets.</hi> The Lord hath told us, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. Secret <hi>things belong to God.</hi> But these impious people must needs have a <hi>Tast</hi> of them. They will ask the <hi>Devils</hi> to inform their <hi>minds,</hi> and resolve their <hi>doubts.</hi> This is the Witchcraft of them, that with a <hi>Sieve,</hi> or a <hi>Key</hi> will go to discover how their <hi>lost Goods</hi> are disposed of. This is the Witchcraft of them that with <hi>Glasses</hi> and <hi>Basons</hi> will go to discover how they shall be <hi>Related</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they dy. They are a sort of <hi>Witches</hi> that thus employ themselves. And this is the Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft of the <hi>Iudicial Astrologer.</hi> That Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger is a Cousin-German to a <hi>Conjurer.</hi> I think I know his Rules, and I am satisfied that his <hi>Iudgment</hi> must at last be determined by his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse,</hi> or it is not worth an hundredth part of what the silly Enquirer payes him for it: and from <hi>whom,</hi> from <hi>what</hi> shall that Impulse <hi>come?</hi> Behold the Energy of <hi>Devils</hi> in it. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a sort of <hi>Sorcery,</hi> for persons to let their <hi>Bibles fall open,</hi> on purpose to determine what the state of their <hi>souls</hi> is, from the first <hi>word</hi> they light upon. And some among us, they say, are so extremely sinful, as to consult one whom they count a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> when they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they know not otherwise. 'Tis hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that in this <hi>Land of Vprightness</hi> there should be any such <hi>Prank of wickedness.</hi> I do earnestly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49306:68"/>
testifie unto you that these things are <hi>abominables</hi> the voice of our God is, <hi>O do them not, my soul hates them.</hi> I do warn and charge you, Shun these execrable things, lest you he left unto the furthest Witchcraft committed by the <hi>abhorted of the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Take heed that you do not <hi>wrongfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi> any other person, of this horrid and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous evil. It is the Character of a Godly man, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 3. He taketh not up a <hi>Reproach</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Neighbour. What more dirty <hi>Reproach</hi> than that of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> can there be? Yet it is most readily dast upon <hi>worthy</hi> persons, when their is hardly a shadow of any reason for it. An <hi>Ill-look,</hi> or a <hi>cross word</hi> will make a Witch with many people who may on more ground be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so themselves. There has been a fearful deal of Injury done in <hi>this way</hi> in <hi>this Town,</hi> to the <hi>Good-name</hi> of the most credible persons in it. Persons of more Goodness and Esteem than any of their calumnious Abusers have been defamed for <hi>Witches</hi> about this Countrey, <hi>A Countrey full of lyes.</hi> I beseech you, Let all <hi>Back-biting,</hi> and all <hi>Evil-surmising</hi> be put away from among you: do not, on small grounds <hi>Fly-blow</hi> the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ointment</hi> of the <hi>good-name</hi> that thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour should have. On the least provocation, <hi>I will never beleeve but such an one is a witch</hi> —that is presently the Sentence of some that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49306:68"/>
might speak more warily than so. Alas, thou might'st with as much Honesty break open the House, or take away the purse of thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: His <hi>Good Name</hi> is of more Account. They that indulge themselves in this course of <hi>Evil-Iudging,</hi> are usually paid home for it before they dy; the just God <hi>sue's</hi> them in an <hi>Action of Defamation,</hi> and makes <hi>their</hi> Names to be <hi>up</hi> too, before they leave world.</p>
                        <p>Wee'l suppose the most probable Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
                        <p>Suppose that a Person <hi>bewitched</hi> should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to see the Apparition of <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> an one, yet this may be no infallible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their being Naughty people, it seems possible that the Devils may so traduce the most <hi>Innocent,</hi> the most praise-worthy. Why may not <hi>spiritual</hi> Devils, as well as Devils <hi>Incarnate</hi> get leave to do it? There was at <hi>Groton,</hi> a while since, a very memorable Instance of such a thing; and what should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them that can Imitate the <hi>Angels of Light</hi> but that they may likewise personate the <hi>Children</hi> of Light, in their Delusions?</p>
                        <p n="2">II. To them that have been <hi>seduced</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sin of <hi>Witchcraft.</hi> And under this Rack, there are <hi>two</hi> sorts of persons to be addressed unto.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49306:69"/>First. Let them that have been guilty of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Witchcraft,</hi> now repent of their <hi>monstrous</hi> and <hi>horrid</hi> evil in it. I fear that I speak to some Scores, that may lay their hands on their mouths, and cry, <hi>Guilty, Guilty!</hi> before the Lord, in this particular. Let these now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and bewail their own sin in the fight of God; and as it was said in <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 8. <hi>What have I any more to do with Idols?</hi> Thus let them say, <hi>What have I any more to do with</hi> Devils? The things that you have done, have been <hi>payments of Respects</hi> unto <hi>Devils;</hi> and it becomes you to <hi>abhor your selves in dust and ashes</hi> for your Folly. The great and terrible God sayes of you, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 21. <hi>They have provoked me to anger with their</hi> Vanities. Let the things that did <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi> Him to <hi>anger,</hi> now <hi>provoke</hi> you to <hi>sorrow.</hi> Retire this evening, and humble your selves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deeply, in that you have been so <hi>foolish and unwise.</hi> Lament all your Acquaintance with <hi>Hell;</hi> and let your Acquaintance with <hi>God</hi> be more. Let your <hi>Lamentations</hi> be more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your <hi>Divinations</hi> were.</p>
                        <p>Let them that have been guilty of <hi>Explicit</hi> Witchcraft, now also <hi>repent</hi> of their <hi>monstrous</hi> and <hi>horrid</hi> evil in it. If any of you have (I hope <hi>none</hi> of you have) made an <hi>Express Contract</hi> with <hi>Devils,</hi> know that your promise is better <hi>broke</hi> than <hi>kept;</hi> it concerns you that you. Turn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the <hi>Power of Satan unto God.</hi>
                           <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49306:69"/>
Albeit your sin be beyond all Expression or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception <hi>Heinous,</hi> yet it is not <hi>unpardonable.</hi> We read of <hi>Menasseh</hi> in 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>6. He used <hi>Enchantments,</hi> &amp; used <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and deale with a <hi>Famillar Spirit,</hi> and wrought <hi>much Evil</hi> in the sight of the Lord. But that <hi>great</hi> Wizzard found Mercy with <hi>God,</hi> upon his deep Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for it: Such a <hi>Boundless</hi> thing is the <hi>Grace</hi> of our God! The <hi>Prey</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> may become the <hi>Ioy</hi> of <hi>Angels:</hi> The <hi>Confederates</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> may become the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> upon their sincere Turning unto God. A <hi>Witch</hi> may be <hi>penitent</hi> in <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> in <hi>another</hi> world. There was one <hi>Hartford</hi> here, who did with much Brokenness of heart <hi>own</hi> her <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and <hi>leave</hi> her <hi>Master,</hi> and expire depending on the <hi>Free-Grace</hi> of God in Christ, and on that word of His, <hi>Come to me, ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest;</hi> and on that, <hi>There is a fountain open for sin and for uncleanness.</hi> Come then, Renounce the Slavery and the Interest of the Devils, Renounce your mad <hi>League</hi> with 'em. Come and give up your selves unto the <hi>Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> loathing your selves exceedingly for your so siding with the black enemies of His Throne. O come away from the <hi>doleful</hi> estate you are in. Come away from <hi>serving</hi> of the <hi>Devils</hi> that have ensnared your Souls. What <hi>Wages</hi> have you from those Hellish <hi>Task-masters?</hi> Alas you are <hi>here</hi> among the <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>

ragged Beggars upon Earth. When did Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft ever make any person <hi>Rub?</hi> And <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after</hi> you must be Objects for the intolerable <hi>in silence</hi> and Cruelty of those <hi>Cannibals,</hi> and be <hi>broken sore in the place of Dragons for evermore.</hi> Be take your selves then to Instant and Constant <hi>Prayer,</hi> and unto your old filthy Rulers now say, <q>Depart from me, ye Evil Spirit, for I will keep the Commandments of God.</q>
                        </p>

                     <p>And <hi>that</hi> may be a <hi>Caution</hi> to every one of us. <hi>This</hi> in short, Since <hi>Rebellion</hi> is like <hi>VVitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O Let us not make light of any Rebellion against the Almighty <hi>GOD.</hi> Particularly,</p>
                     <p>First, Let not a <hi>Course</hi> of Rebellion be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed-by us. It is the <hi>Course</hi> of unregenerate men, to be daily doing those things, for which <hi>the wrath of God comes upon the children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</hi> When God requires, <hi>Repent of Sin,</hi> they do <hi>rebel</hi> and reply, <hi>No, I have loved Idols, and after them I</hi> will <hi>go.</hi> When God requires, <hi>Beleeve on Christ,</hi> they do <hi>rebel</hi> and reply. <hi>No, I will not have this man to reign over me.</hi> They <hi>rebel</hi> against all the divine Commands of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> to Man; They <hi>rebel</hi> against all the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Lords, which are to be <hi>esteemed</hi> concerning all things to be Right. And they <hi>love
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49306:70"/>
every false way.</hi> O Consider of this, ye strangere to the <hi>new-Birth;</hi> Consider <hi>what</hi> you are doing, consider <hi>where</hi> you are going every day. I would now say, alluding to that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. <hi>O soul, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins.</hi> You have been doing of <hi>Iniquity;</hi> O now say, <hi>I will do so no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Consider, First, There is a sort of <hi>VVitchcraft</hi> charg'd on you. You shall as undoubtedly perish as any <hi>VVitch</hi> in the world, except you reform. Can you imagine that an obstinate <hi>Witch</hi> will have Admission into the <hi>Kingdom of God.?</hi> Behold, &amp; be astonish't, ye unrenewed ones; as impossible it is for <hi>you</hi> to <hi>see the Lord.</hi> It is said in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</hi> That <hi>verily verily,</hi> which like a <hi>flaming Sword,</hi> stands to keep the vil oft <hi>Witches</hi> out of Paradise, the <hi>same</hi> there is to keep every <hi>unbeleever</hi> out. The Lord said unto some confident pretenders of old, Ye are as <hi>AEthiopians</hi> unto me. This doth God say unto all them that obey Him not; <hi>this</hi> doth He say to every one of you that do not <hi>fear Him</hi> &amp; <hi>keep His Commandment;</hi> He saith, Ye are as <hi>Witches</hi> unto me; though thy Birth be of godly or genteel <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> tho' thy Parts &amp; Gifts may be <hi>extraordinary,</hi> tho' thy <hi>Prayers</hi> may be <hi>twice a week,</hi> &amp; thy <hi>Alms</hi> enough to fill a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> yet become a <hi>new-creature;</hi> otherwise ye are as <hi>witches</hi> unto me, saith the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Consider, Secondly, There is a sort of Witch.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49306:71"/>
craft <hi>come</hi> on you too. All that leave the <hi>way e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting,</hi> and take a <hi>way of wickedness,</hi> they are <hi>bewitched;</hi> a grievous <hi>Witchcraft</hi> has siez'd upon them. The Apostle said to some in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. O foolish <hi>Galatians,</hi> who hath <hi>bewitched</hi> you, that you should not obey the Truth? This may be an Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulation us'd with all ungodly men; O foolish Transgressors, who has <hi>bewitched</hi> you? I'le tell you <hi>who:</hi> Not an <hi>Hog,</hi> but a <hi>Lust</hi> has bewitched 'em. They that are bewitched, have a marvellous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of calamity upon them. One while they can't <hi>see;</hi> that is <hi>thy</hi> case; <hi>Thou</hi> art wretched, but thou canst not <hi>see</hi> it; Christ is lovely, but thou canst not <hi>see</hi> him. One while they cannot <hi>hear;</hi> that is <hi>thy</hi> case; God calls, <hi>Look unto me and be saved;</hi> but thou <hi>hearest</hi> nothing of it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother while they can't <hi>stirr;</hi> that is <hi>thy</hi> case; The Lord Jesus calls, <hi>Come unto me,</hi> but thou <hi>movest</hi> not. Sometimes they are as it were, <hi>cut,</hi> &amp; <hi>prick't,</hi> and <hi>distorted</hi> in their Limbs; the very same art thou in all the <hi>Faculties</hi> of thy soul. At <hi>othertimes</hi> they are pulled into the <hi>Fire,</hi> or into the <hi>Water,</hi> or thrown with violence upon the <hi>Ground;</hi> the like happens to thy unhappy soul; it is hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thither, where the <hi>sire is not quenched;</hi> it is hurried thither where they <hi>groan under, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> it is also made to <hi>pant after the dust of the earth.</hi> The <hi>Drunken</hi> man is <hi>bewitched</hi> with strong Drink; the <hi>unclean</hi> man is <hi>bewitch't</hi> with strange <hi>Flesh;</hi> the tongue of a <hi>Swearer</hi> is acted worse
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49306:71"/>
than the tongue of a <hi>bewitch't</hi> man; the <hi>covetous</hi> man is hideously <hi>bewitched</hi> with <hi>Bags</hi> &amp; <hi>Lands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O pity thine own soul; and <hi>give no sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eye lids,</hi> until thine immortal soul be deliver'd from thy <hi>natural state.</hi> Let not <hi>VVitchcraft</hi> it felf be a more frightful thing to thee, than thy own present Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy. Turn ye, turn ye, why <hi>will</hi> ye dye?</p>
                     <p>Secondly. Let not an Act of <hi>Rebellion</hi> be allowed by us. When <hi>Ioseph</hi> was incited unto an <hi>Ill Act,</hi> he said, in <hi>Gen,</hi> 39. 9. <hi>How shall I do this</hi> wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>and sin against God?</hi> Thus, when we are urged unto any <hi>Ill Act,</hi> Let us refuse it so, <hi>No, this is like</hi> Wicthcraft, <hi>shall I by such</hi> wickedness <hi>make my self as a</hi> Witch <hi>before the Lord?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Three Things are to be Recommend here</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Arm</hi> yourselves against all the <hi>Devices,</hi> with which the <hi>Devils</hi> would hook you into any <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the Lord. For Rebellion against <hi>God,</hi> there will be that clause in our <hi>Indictment.</hi> They <hi>were moved by the Instigation of the</hi> Devil. Now furnish yourselves with <hi>Armour</hi> to keep off the Dint of the <hi>Devils Instigations;</hi> in short, <hi>put on the whole Armour of God.</hi> There is specially a <hi>double Care</hi> that will be of great use in your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters.</p>
                     <p>First. Use your <hi>Watch</hi> well. We read in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11. about the <hi>Wiles</hi> of the <hi>Devil.</hi> When the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil would engage us in a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Wily Methods</hi> by which he doth accomplish
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49306:72"/>
it. He works more by <hi>Fraud</hi> then by <hi>Forts;</hi> and there is a <hi>cryptic method</hi> by which he doth gain us over to himself. A crafty Sophister has a <hi>three-fold Method,</hi> with which he prevails upon his Auditors; and such the Method of the <hi>Devil</hi> is. <hi>Watch,</hi> First against the <hi>Deficient</hi> method of the Devil. The Devil will show us the Sin <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Curse,</hi> the Bait <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Hook:</hi> So he saies <hi>Eat the pleasant Fruit:</hi> but he saies not, Thou shalt <hi>dye</hi> if thou do it. The Devil will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present unto us the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of a Duty, but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal</hi> the <hi>recompence</hi> of it. So he says, <hi>It's a hard thing to pray</hi> in <hi>secret every day;</hi> but he says not, Thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will <hi>Reward</hi> thee. And he will represent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the <hi>Excuse</hi> of a Sin, but <hi>conceal</hi> the <hi>Ill shape</hi> of it: So he saies, <hi>Many others have done this and that;</hi> but he saies not, <hi>God was</hi> provoked at it. These are Tricks to be <hi>watched</hi> against.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Watch,</hi> Secondly, against the <hi>Redundant</hi> Method of the Devil. Sometimes the devil will use a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi> He will seem to give over his <hi>Intent</hi> in one thing, but make sure of his Intent in another. Such a Stratagem he uses as what <hi>Ioshua</hi> took <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> withal; he <hi>retires,</hi> and so he <hi>conquers.</hi> He will make <hi>Haughtiness</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> undo the soul, that he could not make of his party for <hi>grosser Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Sometimes the devil will use a <hi>Commoration.</hi> He will dog a man, and bring Perswasion upon perswasion, as <hi>Delilah</hi> did with <hi>Sampson;</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49306:72"/>
like a cnuning <hi>Fencer,</hi> he <hi>repeats</hi> blow after blow, till he smite home. These are Dangers to be <hi>Watched</hi> against.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Watch,</hi> Thirdly, against the <hi>Inverting</hi> Method of the Devil. One while the Devil will endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to carry us on from <hi>Lesser</hi> sins to <hi>Greater</hi> sins. He will go to make our miscarriages like <hi>Elijah'</hi>s cloud; at first as an <hi>Hands-breadth,</hi> but anon so as to hide the whole <hi>Heaven</hi> from us. So <hi>Solomon</hi> multiplies first <hi>Horses,</hi> &amp; afterward <hi>worse</hi> things against the command of God. Another while, the Devil will decoy us from <hi>lawful</hi> things to <hi>un</hi>lawful things. Thus from a <hi>Good-husband,</hi> a man shall grow a meer <hi>Muck-worm.</hi> Now and then also, the Devil will try to spoil <hi>Good works</hi> with <hi>Ill ends:</hi> Thus the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Iebu</hi> shall be swell'd by the <hi>Zeal</hi> of <hi>Iebu.</hi> He will try to make our Duties <hi>Interfere;</hi> the <hi>general Calling</hi> shall be regarded in the season of the <hi>particular,</hi> and the <hi>particular calling</hi> shall be attended in the season of the <hi>general.</hi> He will try to lead us from one <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme</hi> to another; We shall be excessively <hi>merry,</hi> and ere long excessively <hi>melancholly,</hi> if we hearken to him. O keep up your <hi>Watch.</hi> Well did the Apostle say, in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. Be <hi>vigilant,</hi> for the <hi>Devil</hi> as a roaring lion, seeketh whom he may devour.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. Use your <hi>Sword</hi> well. Tis said in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17. Take the <hi>Sword</hi> of the Spirit which is the <hi>Word</hi> of God. The Devil cannot stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Brandishings of this <hi>Two-edged Sword.</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49306:73"/>
Our Saviour overcame the devil by making that Return, <hi>It is written,</hi> and <hi>It is written,</hi> against all his lewd attempts. Would he get you into any <hi>Rebellion?</hi> One <hi>Text</hi> well managed will make him fly before you. Would he have you be <hi>unjust?</hi> Then answer, It is written, The <hi>inrighteous</hi> shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Would he have you be <hi>unclean?</hi> Then answer, It is written, <hi>God reserves to be punished them that walk in uncleanness.</hi> Would he have you be immoderately <hi>careful?</hi> Say then, It is <hi>written,</hi> Cast thy burden on the Lord.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Warefare</hi> is directly contrary to that <hi>Witchcraft</hi> which the Devils are daily driving or drawing us unto.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. Beware of <hi>that</hi> Rebellion against God particularly, which the <hi>Devils</hi> are <hi>most</hi> gratified withal. It is said in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 40. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</hi> The <hi>unclean devils</hi> are pleased most with such things as that <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is most <hi>grieved</hi> with. Sometimes the Devils have been forced as it were, to discover their own <hi>Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> thro the mouths of <hi>possessed</hi> persons, they have declar'd what was very grateful to them. The Children that have lately been under a <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Fascination</hi> in this Town, have given us diverse Intimations, which we might make use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Observations on. I observed, that tho they had much <hi>delight in prayer</hi> when they were <hi>well;</hi> yet when they were <hi>ill,</hi> they could not endure it. The <hi>Damons</hi> would make them sing, &amp; roar, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49306:73"/>
stop their ears, and plague them, and at last lay them for <hi>dead,</hi> if any prayer were in the Room. Whence it may be inferred, That you who can go without <hi>Prayer</hi> from day to day, do just as the <hi>Devils</hi> would have you. The Devils have an horrible <hi>Rendezvous</hi> in that <hi>Family,</hi> in that <hi>Closet,</hi> where <hi>Prayer</hi> is not maintained. I observed, that tho the <hi>Word of God</hi> were their Companion &amp; <hi>Counsellor</hi> at other times, yet <hi>now</hi> they would fall into <hi>Convulsions,</hi> if one did but look into a <hi>Bible.</hi> Whence it may be suppos'd that you who <hi>read</hi> not the <hi>Scripture,</hi> for the most part every day, do humour the <hi>devils</hi> in it. The <hi>Devils</hi> are glad to see the <hi>Bibles</hi> that have <hi>dust</hi> upon them. I observed, that <hi>Haeretical,</hi> or <hi>Superstitious</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi> Books, might be perused by some of them, when <hi>serious</hi> &amp; <hi>Orthodox</hi> Books would <hi>put out their Eyes.</hi> Whence it may be suggested, That you who converse much with <hi>ill</hi> books, do as the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> would: The Devils would willingly be where <hi>Iest-books,</hi> &amp; <hi>Play-books,</hi> &amp; <hi>Romances,</hi> and <hi>Haeresies</hi> or <hi>Superstitions</hi> are made a Library. I observed, that tho they were exemplary for <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi> &amp; <hi>Sobriety,</hi> yet now their Wishes to <hi>steal</hi> &amp; <hi>be drunk,</hi> were frequently expressed; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were made very <hi>drunk</hi> tho no intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icating <hi>Drink</hi> had bin in the least an occasion of it. Whence it may be gathered, That the <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> has a <hi>devil</hi> in him, the <hi>Stealer</hi> has a <hi>devil</hi> in him. The Devils have sport enough, when they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49306:74"/>
see a man Reeling in the streets; the <hi>divels</hi> are the Comrades of them that go to <hi>take what is none of their own.</hi> I observed, That tho <hi>few</hi> in the place were so <hi>diligent</hi> as <hi>they,</hi> nevertheless in their <hi>Fits</hi> they might not do any <hi>work</hi> at all. Whence it may be concluded, That of <hi>Idleness comes no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> The <hi>devils</hi> are the <hi>Play-mates</hi> of them that are <hi>Gaming</hi> when they should be <hi>working.</hi> An <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> person is a <hi>Prentice</hi> of a <hi>divel.</hi> These things have been <hi>observed;</hi> and now let these <hi>Vices</hi> be <hi>avoided.</hi> There is <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in them.</p>
                     <p>O that the <hi>Divels</hi> might be <hi>out-shot in their own Bow,</hi> and that these <hi>Vices</hi> might be made odious by their Affection for them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly. Instead of <hi>Rebellion against</hi> God, let <hi>Obedience to</hi> God fill your lives. Make unto God that <hi>vow</hi> in <hi>ps.</hi> 116. 16. <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly <hi>serve God with all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Yea, <hi>often</hi> ask yourselves, <hi>What service may I do for God?</hi> And let a respect of <hi>Obedience</hi> to God make even the <hi>meanest</hi> of your Actions <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable:</hi> even when you <hi>eat</hi> &amp; <hi>drink</hi> &amp; <hi>trade</hi> &amp; <hi>visit</hi> &amp; <hi>recreate</hi> yourselves, let there be some <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God</hi> in it <hi>all.</hi> The <hi>Employments</hi> of a poor <hi>Carpenter</hi> or <hi>Shooemaker</hi> will hereby be rendred <hi>more noble things</hi> than the <hi>Victories</hi> of an <hi>Alexander</hi> or a <hi>Caesar.</hi> Not the <hi>devils</hi> but the <hi>Angels</hi> will have a most <hi>intimate Fellowship</hi> with a man <hi>thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient.</hi> Not <hi>witchcraft,</hi> but rather <hi>Inspiration</hi> will be in <hi>the man who does this, and the son of man who layeth hold on it.</hi>

            <p>SInce the Finishing of the History which concerns <hi>Goodwin'</hi>s Children, there has been a very wonderful Attempt made (brobably by <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> on another Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the Town. There is a poor Boy at this time under very terrible and amazing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which are a <hi>Repetition</hi> of, with not much <hi>Variation</hi> from those of the Children formerly molested. The person under vehement Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to be the Authoress this Boy's Calamities, is one that was complain'd of by those Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>their</hi> Ails and accordingly one or two of those Children has at this time some Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of their Afflictions also; which perhaps may be permitted by the Great God, not to dissap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point our Expectations of their Deliverance, but for the <hi>Detection</hi> and the <hi>Destruction</hi> of more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that hellish Knot, that has not yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished as others of the Crue has done, before the poor prayers of them that <hi>Hope in God.</hi>

            <head>APPENDIX</head>
            <p>THere are one or two passages in the first of our foregoing Histories, which I fore-see, (those usually no less <hi>Absurd</hi> than <hi>Angry</hi> people) the <hi>Quakers,</hi> will <hi>come upon me with great wrath,</hi> for my writing of and the Incivilities lately shown to my Father, for a piece of one Chapter in his Book of <hi>Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Providences,</hi> by one <hi>Keith,</hi> in a sort of a thing newly published at <hi>Pen-silvania,</hi> have made it necessary for me, not only to <hi>explain</hi> my self, but to <hi>defend</hi> him, upon the occasion that is now before me.</p>
            <p>As for what I have related concerning the strange liberty which the <hi>Devils</hi> gave unto <hi>Iohn Goodwin'</hi>s Children, to enjoy both the <hi>Writings</hi> and the <hi>Meetings</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> when offers thereof were (it may be too needlessly) made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49306:76"/>
to them, I need only acquaint the world, that I shall procuce good, legal, &amp; sufficient Evidence to <hi>Confront</hi> what I do <hi>Affirm,</hi> whenever any man shall demand it of me; And that the Books with which the Tyral happned to he made, were more than <hi>one,</hi> and such, as the <hi>Quickers</hi> give as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral an Allowance to, as to their own <hi>Primers</hi> and their <hi>Catechisms.</hi> But undoubtedly, the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Candour and Sweetness of the <hi>Quakers</hi> will inspire them, with Inclinations to give me some of <hi>their</hi> public Thanks for the notice I have taken of them; and in the mean time I must let my Neighbours understand, what ridiculous as well as odious Calumnies the <hi>Quakers</hi> have bestowed upon my absent <hi>Father,</hi> for his being an Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (they think) unto their Prejudice.</p>
            <p>One would think, That if an <hi>Historian,</hi> did but secure his <hi>Veracity</hi> from being Impeached, most of his other Faults were pardonable; and so tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would be accounted, by any, besides <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> who are a people <hi>by themselves.</hi> But my Father had published a Book entituled, <hi>Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providences;</hi> in one part of which, he has a Narrative of several very marvellous Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that certain deluded and possessed <hi>Quakers,</hi> in this Countrey were concerned in. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, never could be dispured; yet one <hi>Keith</hi> a Quaker, who had been <hi>compassing <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>und to make pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>selytes,</hi> visits <hi>New-Eng.</hi> in his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,</hi> where meeting with small <hi>Applause,</hi> &amp; less
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49306:76"/>
               <hi>Success,</hi> instead of <hi>Converts,</hi> he picks up what <hi>Quarrels</hi> our Countrey could afford him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Rest, this book of <hi>Providences.</hi> At his Return to <hi>Pen-silvania,</hi> he blesses the world with a little Volumn of Haeresies and Blasphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> the principle Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles whereof, he endeavours to undermine, with some farther Improvements of <hi>Nonsense,</hi> than the Abilities of the <hi>Quakers</hi> had heretofore help'd 'em to; but, tho tis almost pitty that any <hi>Eagle</hi> (pardon the Comparison, he himself calls us <hi>Night-birds</hi>) should lose his time, by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of such a <hi>Fly;</hi> yet I suppose, he will not be long, without the Castigations of a <hi>full,</hi> tho' <hi>short</hi> Answer to the Ipertinences with which he has been craftily assaving to <hi>spoyl out Vines.</hi> He entitles his Harrangues, <hi>The Churches in New-England brought to the Test;</hi> and it might be expected; that one so willing to be a Servant of those Churches as <hi>Increase Mather,</hi> would not escape the Vengeance of those whom these Churches are an eye-sore unto. Accordingly, the Title-page of his <hi>Discourses</hi> (for truly-Reader, he will not now give us a <hi>Silent Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>) promises to us, <hi>An Answer to the gross Abuses, Lyes and Slanders of</hi> Increase Mather; which he afterwards detects, just as one of his Predecessours after a Con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ersation with <unclear>Hogis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</unclear>, Trampled upon <hi>Plato'</hi>s pride; while he cannot instance in any one <hi>Abuse, Lye,</hi> or <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49306:77"/>
of <hi>Increase Mather,</hi> without committing more than a few himself. However, he is pleas'd to say, when he comes to talk, <hi>Let any of his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred answer for him in his absence;</hi> and because I am <hi>somewhat a kin</hi> to the said <hi>Increase Mather,</hi> whom the <hi>Ani-mad-versions</hi> of this <hi>Keith</hi> have made such an Assault upon, that were I more dumb than the Son of <hi>Croesus</hi> himself, yet I must have <hi>spoken</hi> at the Provocation, I am willing to satisfie our little Authour so far as to Answer these <hi>Three</hi> Things upon him: Yet I would so far observe one of <hi>Solomon'</hi>s Rules in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, as not to use upon him some Terms of <hi>his</hi> Art which as a <hi>Specimen</hi> of his breeding he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon <hi>Increase Mather;</hi> but offer a few just Reflections on this <hi>new Apostle</hi> (no doubt a Successor to <hi>one</hi> of the old ones) unto the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> He charges my absent Father, with <hi>Gross Abuses, Lyes, and Slanders;</hi> and yet he denies not the Truth of the Stories, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of which flings him into this foaming Rage. He charges him just as last year he did the rest of the Ministers of <hi>Boston.</hi> He sent us a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Challenge, which begins, <hi>I being well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Spirit of God, that the Doctrine ye preach to the People</hi> is <hi>false</hi>—and he then rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up Twelve Articles (he says) of our Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the <hi>Twelfth</hi> of which is directly contrary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49306:77"/>
to what we assert, and maintain and preach eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. This was his <hi>Inspiration</hi> then! and such is his <hi>Narration</hi> now. <hi>Increase Mather</hi> penns <hi>Truths,</hi> and yet, it seems writes <hi>Lyes.</hi> But where is <hi>Increase Mather'</hi>s Crime? Why, our Animadvertor tells us, <hi>I. M. relates these stories on purpose to abuse the honest and sober people called</hi> Quakers, <hi>without making any Distinction</hi>—But what <hi>Metal</hi> is this man's Forehead made of? Reader, you shall find my Fathers intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to his Histories to be, <hi>All wise men that are acquainted therewith, observe the blasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of Heaven upon the late SINGING and Dancing Quakers.</hi> And his Inference from them is, That <hi>The Quakers are</hi> SOME <hi>of them undoubtedly possessed with evil spirits;</hi> and his Conclusion is, <hi>We may, by this, judge whose servants the</hi> Singing <hi>Quakers are.</hi> Behold how carefully he has Repeated the very <hi>Distinction</hi> which this waspish man complains at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of! Besides, he had no need of making <hi>any</hi> Distinction at all. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> fall out among themselves, is but a natural Consequence of their <hi>Tempers</hi> and <hi>Errours,</hi> which cannot be otherwise than <hi>Incohaerent;</hi> and sometimes, their Credit forces them to <hi>Explode</hi> in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another, what they (wish they could but) can't <hi>Excuse.</hi> Tho it seems if a Woman dress her self like a <hi>Devil,</hi> and fright some of her Sex almost out of their Lives, on a <hi>Lords Day,</hi> in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49306:78"/>
one of our biggest Assemblies, <hi>G. K.</hi> can here canonize her for a <hi>Saint. Case'</hi>s Crew are substantially of the same Drove with <hi>Keith'</hi>s Crue; <hi>both</hi> Mad, tho with some variety of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in their Phrensies. What if those <hi>Ranters,</hi> and these <hi>Quakers</hi> be shaken together in a Bag? 'Tis a more allowable method of Sorting, that of this <hi>G. K.'</hi>s, who would make us a Crew of <hi>Ranters,</hi> because we hold, <hi>That God hath fore-ordained infallibly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably, whatever comes to pass.</hi> And whereas our <hi>Answerer</hi> tells <hi>us,</hi> that when those <hi>horrid mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> were whipt at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> for their wonderful hideous Devilism, <hi>Some of the honest people called</hi> Quakers, <hi>openly declared before the people, that the</hi> Quakers <hi>did not at all own them to he of their Society,</hi> I am to ask him, Who of this <hi>honest people</hi> then it was, That then declared them to be, <hi>The dear Children of God?</hi> But Reader, pray observe, Tho he will not leave Urging, that for a <hi>Quaker</hi> to be Possessed, is no more than for a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or an <hi>Independent</hi> so to be; There is <hi>Difference</hi> enough, where our notable Disputant would contrive a <hi>Parallel.</hi> Because a <hi>Possession</hi> by evil Spirits, may besal one of our Communion, <hi>What then?</hi> The Possession does not move any to be of <hi>that</hi> Communion: we see the contrary. But the Stories Recorded by my Father, (plainly enough) demonstrate, That
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49306:78"/>
Diabolical <hi>Possession</hi> was the Thing which did <hi>dispose</hi> and <hi>encline</hi> men unto <hi>Quakerism;</hi> Their <hi>Quakerism</hi> was the <hi>proper Effect</hi> of their <hi>Possession;</hi> and not an <hi>unconcern'd Consequent.</hi> 'Tis our Logicians Fault here, that he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils <hi>without making any Distinction;</hi> if he would have pleased to <hi>distinguish</hi> a little, he might have spared the pains of his tedious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions, about Charging the <hi>innocent</hi> with the crimes of the guilty. But from such a <hi>G. K.</hi> what better Dealing might have been look'd for?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I think, I may rather charge this <hi>G. K.</hi> with <hi>Gross Abuses, Lyes and Slanders,</hi> by <hi>him</hi> offer'd unto that <hi>Increase Mather</hi> whom he shows himself so much (beyond the cure of <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore</hi>) inflamed at. He <hi>saies,</hi> Increase Mather <hi>hath shew'd his Rashness and Folly in some other pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of his life, if not Malice, that hath occasion'd him for some time past to abscond, and depart from the place where he preached at Boston.</hi> I am sorry that this man obliges me to trouble the World with Stories about such Domestick and personal matters as these are. For me to <hi>Commend</hi> my yet living Father would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be counted an Indecency. But if I should not now <hi>Defend</hi> him from such unhandsome Imputations, I were worse than the worse of the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and it must be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Malice</hi> than what <hi>G. K.</hi> ever pretended to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49306:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
discover in <hi>Increase Mather,</hi> that shall criminate my Vindication of an absent and a wronged Parent. My Reader's Patience must then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to tell him, that all <hi>New-England</hi> well knows, That <hi>Increase Mather</hi> never departed from hence, through any <hi>Rashness</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi> of his <hi>ewn,</hi> but through the <hi>Malice</hi> of <hi>unreasonable men.</hi> Our Charter being unjustly Vacated (which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>G. K.</hi> reckons among the Judgments of God upon us) the Government of this Territory was fallen into the hands of men that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took all sorts of measures to make us mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. A knot of people, that had no design but to enrich themselves on to the <hi>ruines</hi> of this <hi>flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> plantation, were placed over us, &amp; <hi>our Land strangers devoured in our presence.</hi> The sight of our <hi>Calamities</hi> made my Father willing to undertake a Voyage uuto <hi>England,</hi> for no other cause but meerly to endeavour the Service of his afflicted Countrey; and not a few among the principal Gentlemen of the place, did both <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vize</hi> and <hi>Assist</hi> his Undertaking. His Intent <hi>in</hi> Going he did not publish, but his Intent of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did; and he had no sooner done it, but one <hi>Randolph,</hi> the late <hi>Secretary,</hi> whom (like a <hi>Scavenger</hi>) our late Oppressors cheefly used in their more dirty Businesses, gave Trouble unto him to obstruct and prevent his Voyage. The Circumstances of it were these: This <hi>Randolph</hi> some time since, carried unto Sr. <hi>Lionel Ienklns,</hi> a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49306:79"/>
Letter which he assur'd him was Mr. <hi>Mather'</hi>s; Tho the Letter was a most Villanous Forgery, Filled with Treason and Madness in the <hi>Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, and never was one line of it written by my Father. The Letter-Forger had so fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly drawn it up, That <hi>Randolph</hi> could not get the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Gentlemen, whom he (after his manner, that is) <hi>falsly</hi> Charged with being the <hi>Authour</hi> it, yet care was taken thereby to blast his <hi>Name:</hi> The <hi>Observator,</hi> (whom one calls <hi>The Father of Lyes</hi>) here became <hi>Nurse,</hi> &amp; printed it, with not a few scurrilous <hi>Observations</hi> on it. So that in all the Taverns and Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houses throughout Three-Kingdoms, this innocent Person was made a Ridicule, and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados</hi> too, with other of the <hi>Lee-ward Islands,</hi> took this opportunity to spit their venome on one who had never done any thing to deserve it, but by being (in the account of some that are <hi>Both</hi>) somewhat of a Learned and Honest man. My Father to Vindicate himself, while our old Government yet lasted, wrote a Letter to Mr. <hi>Dudley,</hi> who had from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Copy of that bloody Forgery; and in this Vindication, he intimates that several shrowd things would make him suspect <hi>Randolph</hi> himself to be the Director of it. It was Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto him That the whole Forgery was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for <hi>Randolph</hi>'s advantage; tis almost all of him and <hi>for</hi> him; but could any rational man imagine, that <hi>he</hi> was then wholly a stranger
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49306:80"/>
to it? Besides there were in it several other Expressions, which (twas then thought) no man in his <hi>Wits</hi> can dream that any without <hi>
                  <unclear>him</unclear>
               </hi> should have. But <hi>Randolph</hi> upon his arrival here with our New Government getting a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of my Fathers Vindication, dos after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months now sue him in an <hi>Action of Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> to Embarass the Affairs he had before him. The Jury which consisted partly of Church of <hi>E.</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>Found for</hi> my Father against the Plaintiffe. And yet just within a Week or two before his Voyage, <hi>Randolph</hi> renewed his Action; his Abetters resolving (as I am credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informed) That having laid the Arrest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, they would have secur'd his Person in the Goal, as the worse of Traytors; for what <hi>Illegality</hi> would they stick at? He happily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, what they would be <hi>at,</hi> by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of his Friends withdrew, for about a week; and then, tho both by Day and Night, both by <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> the late <hi>Spirits</hi> among us way-laid him, God carried him safely thro them all; and when he came to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> what Favours the Greatest Men in the Kingdom have heap'd upon him, 'tis not proper for <hi>me</hi> to tell.

that harmless Book <hi>Reader,</hi> inasmuch as none of <hi>Increase Mathers</hi> enemies were <hi>able</hi> to <hi>attain</hi> their ends upon him; and inasmuch as this <hi>Increase Mather</hi> has in his whole Negotiation for <hi>New-England,</hi> been favoured by the merciful God, beyond the imagination of our fondest hopes; pray count it, <hi>A Remarkable Iudgment of God upon him, for his Injustice to the Quakers.</hi> This <hi>G.

            <p>Thirdly, Not <hi>Increase Mather</hi> alone, but all <hi>New-England,</hi> especially the <hi>Shepherds</hi> of the the Churches here, must thro the <hi>Lycanthropy</hi> of this man, be Barked at. One while his <hi>False-Histories</hi> misrepresent us to the world; and he raises dismal <hi>Tragedies</hi> upon the Persecution which his Friends here have met withal. For my own part, I have long wished; That the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistrate</hi> would never inflict a <hi>Civil Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> on an <hi>Heretick,</hi> until <hi>Humane Society</hi> receive such a Disturbance from him, as in one of mine, or any other perswasion were <hi>Intollerable.</hi> Yet there is more, far more to be said for the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication

of our ancient <hi>Severities</hi> on two or three <hi>Quakers</hi> here, than the world has yet been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> himself, whose <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>Sectaries</hi> was notorious euough, yet would speak in the justification of what was here done to <hi>them.</hi> Since our <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was come to such a Consistence, that the <hi>going up of every Fox</hi> would not <hi>break down our stone wall,</hi> who ever meddled with 'em? And since <hi>That,</hi> Though a Quaker-woman came (as sometimes they have) stark naked, into some of our Solemn <hi>Assemblies,</hi> declaring her self to be a <hi>Sign;</hi> yet the <hi>Bruit</hi> has not been thought fit to be <hi>Hang'd up:</hi> but the Generality of the people are enough, &amp; alwaies <hi>were,</hi> averse to the inflicting of Saecular Punishments on these doting <hi>Haereticks.</hi> Indeed a <hi>Grave Magistrate</hi> once (tis said) propounded unto the <hi>General Court</hi> at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> a Law that every <hi>Quaker might have his head shaved;</hi> because they were distracted, &amp; this would both <hi>shame</hi> &amp; <hi>cure</hi> them. I believe this is all the <hi>Law</hi> that ever will be offered for the Suppressing of them here; by long experience, we find, <hi>They perish by being let alone.</hi> But whereas, he twits the Ministers here, for their Accepting of <hi>Maintenance,</hi> with <hi>goods unjustly taken from the true owners;</hi> I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the world, the Ministers here are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit than so; their voluntary <hi>Poverty</hi> and transcendent <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> has scarce its parallel in the Christian world. If any <hi>maintenance</hi> extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

from <hi>Quakers</hi> hath ever been paid unto them, I am confident it was without their <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>consent.</hi> The chief Complaints of this kind are in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony; but let the Reader consider, That the <hi>Grants of Lands</hi> there made by the <hi>Court,</hi> have still been with an <hi>Express Condition</hi> &amp; <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> that the allowed Ministry be therewith sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. <hi>Quakers</hi> come and Accept &amp; Improve these Grants, and then refuse the Duty annexed thereunto. Let all mankind judge whether they might not justly be <hi>compel'd</hi> unto the payment of it? yet how rarely was it ever done? <hi>G. K's. Barnstable</hi> Story is (I hear) a <hi>Romance</hi> of the same peice with the <hi>rest.</hi> But we must be terrified with his <hi>False Prophecies</hi> too. He pretends to <hi>Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> &amp; foretells <hi>the utter Removing, Vndoing, &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of all our Babylonish Buildings;</hi> that is, our Churches; and he adds, <hi>The time hastens, &amp; bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall he be who receiveth the Warning;</hi> and some pages after he praedicts, that <hi>In due time our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houses shall no more receive us into them.</hi> Ay, no doubt of it, <hi>in due time!</hi> But, I pray Friend <hi>George,</hi> when is this <hi>due time</hi> to <hi>bee?</hi> Our late <hi>persecutors,</hi> who did <hi>last year</hi> admit thee to so much familiarity with them, did not so wisely to let <hi>thee</hi> know what they were driving at, for it seems thou art a <hi>Blab of thy tongue.</hi> When thy <hi>private Conversation</hi> with 'em, as well as their <hi>public Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi> here, gave thee cause to griefs, That, our <hi>Churches</hi> were quickly to be over turned, &amp;
