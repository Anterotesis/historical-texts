            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is not ſo much for the ſake of the departed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of theſe Sermons, as for thy ſelf, that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face doth recommend them to thy acceptance and peruſal: Though in order hereunto it is meet that thou have ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count both of the Author, and of the reaſons of their publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Author was a perſon with whom I had long much communication by Letters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ever ſaw his face. By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:43855:3"/>
of which, and by the full teſtimony of his flock, I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly give thee this true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him: When he was placed for the exerciſe of the Sacred Miniſtry at <hi>Newington-Butts,</hi> near <hi>Southwark,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himſelf entirely to the winning and edifying of Souls; believing the great things of the unſeen world, and life to come; the obtaining of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by faith and holineſs, was the end and work of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Life. He took heed to himſelf and to Doctrine, and continued therein, that he might ſave himſelf, and thoſe that heard him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Queſtions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
<pb facs="tcp:43855:3"/>
he avoided: In thoſe that he was conſtrained to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with, he much lookt at the end, and adhered to the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine which is according to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; carefully ſhunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and extreams, and that manner of diſputing or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which deſtroyeth Chriſtian love. In the common Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about Predeſtination, Grace, and Free-will, he held to the middle way of <hi>Auguſtine, Proſper,</hi> &amp;c. contenting himſelf to prove and teach, That all evil is of our ſelves, and all good is of God; that God is no author of Sin, but yet is the Governour of all the World, whoſe abſolute Will cannot be
<pb facs="tcp:43855:4"/>
fruſtrate; and that Chriſt hath procured that univerſal conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal gift of pardon and life which is found in the Goſpel, and commanded his Miniſters to preach and offer it to all; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
            <p>But the Errors which ſubvert Faith, Hope, or Obedience, he would not make light of; and therefore lately wrote that very conſiderable Treatiſe of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul</hi>; eſpecially for the uſe of ſuch as reject not Scripture-proof, leaving out moſt of the Philoſophical Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which Infidels expect; but adding ſome few of them which are of weight, though not a large performance of that part of the work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43855:4"/>He was happily too young to be engaged in the military or uncivil quarrels of this Age. He knew that Chriſts Miniſters have work enough of their own, in preaching, promoting and practiſing the Chriſtian Faith, and hope of Glory, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves and others in obedience, love and peace.</p>
            <p>When the Changes had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned great contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Church-Worſhip, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, Communion and Diſcipline, the City of <hi>London</hi> where he lived attempting to ſet up the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but finding it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, becauſe of the number of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
<pb facs="tcp:43855:5"/>
and becauſe the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would give <hi>Presbytery</hi> no more than a Toleration and Recommendation, he reſolved to join with no party in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, but to look ſimply to Gods Word, and to do that which there he found paſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, an unqueſtionable duty. At that time the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> had entred into an Aſſociation:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In their Worſhip, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration and Diſcipline, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly to practice ſo much as the then parties, <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> are agreed in; believing that the faithful practice of ſo much, would better reconcile them,
<pb facs="tcp:43855:5"/>
than ſtrangeneſs and diſputes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſet up a regular courſe of Perſonal Conference by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing &amp; loving-inſtructions, and exhortations, to prepare them for death and eternity, with all the Families in our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, in order, who would vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſubmit to it.</p>
            <p>In the practice of theſe two, we had great experience of Gods bleſſing. And Mr. <hi>Wadſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> deſiring (as many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did) to do the like, ſent to me for the draught of our Agreement: And becauſe he would avoid temerity and needleſs ſingularity, he addreſt himſelf to the Claſſes of the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, and asked
<pb facs="tcp:43855:6"/>
their Advice; who told him to this purpoſe, That they were under many hinderances from doing it themſelves, but they would not diſſwade nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him from attempting it: Which hereupon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently did. To his conſtant Publick Preaching he added this work of Perſonal and Family Inſtruction; not only to viſit the Sick, but to Teach and Exhort his Flock, in health, to prepare for death, <hi>and work out their Salvation.</hi> To Catechize them, and help them to underſtand the words, and to get down the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and power of the matter upon their hearts: Behaving
<pb facs="tcp:43855:6"/>
himſelf with convincing Light, with melting Love, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſeriouſneſs, to thoſe that he converſed with; that none might be left as <hi>dark, diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,</hi> or <hi>dead,</hi> as they were found.</p>
            <p>He alſo gave <hi>Catechiſms</hi> and <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> and ſome other Books moſt ſuited to their ſtate, to the poor people of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, engaging them to read them, and taking an account of their performance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</p>
            <p>If you ask where he had Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to do all this, he lived fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally himſelf? He took nothing to be ſo much his own, as to be laid out on himſelf any further
<pb facs="tcp:43855:7"/>
than it maintained him in his Maſters work. The reſt he took himſelf to be but a ſteward of, to diſtribute it prudently to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. What was not neceſſary to his perſonal maintenance and work, he gave to others, in the way and on the terms which might beſt further their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And what he was unable to do himſelf, he beg'd from ſuch as were more able.</p>
            <p>And as to the aforeſaid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exerciſing his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, and Church-diſcipline, he and the Church choſe many Deacons, and certain of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt and moſt prudent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who ſhould not be Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as unordained Elders, but
<pb facs="tcp:43855:7"/>
only the Churches Delegates, to take ſuch cognizance of the action, and give ſuch aſſiſtance as the Laity may do; himſelf with theſe Deacons and Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of the people, met once a Month to hear what cauſes required their open admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when private reproofs had been rejected; when offenders were to be humbly and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately admoniſhed, and by moving-arguments perſwaded to repent: And if they yet were obſtinate, more earneſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by them all, and by clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt reaſons convinced of the evil of their ſin, and the great neceſſity of true repentance. And if yet they remained obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb facs="tcp:43855:8"/>
(with us, they were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to hear the convincing reaſons of an Aſſembly of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors that ſhortly after met, and their humble Exhortations and Prayers for their Repentance; but Mr. <hi>Wadſworth</hi> had not ſo much of that aſſiſtance) the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was next to publiſh the crime and impenitence to the Aſſembly, and there publickly beſeech the Sinner to repent, and the Congregation to join in prayer for his Repentance (and this uſually three days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther). And if ſtill he were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, to declare him unfit for Communion with the Church, and require the people to avoid him, and binding him
<pb facs="tcp:43855:8"/>
over to the judgment of God, who will not pardon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.</p>
            <p>I will recite part of a ſhort Writing which his Hearers gave me now ſince his death, in their own words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At his firſt coming to</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington-Butts, <hi>which was about</hi> 1653, <hi>He preached conſtantly twice every Lords-day; And had monthly meetings with us, where he prayed and preached: In the Summer, for half a year, he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Lecture: And in the winter, every day of the week, except Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays, neither cold nor wet did keep him from his work; which was Praying and Expounding, which he conſtantly performed at
<pb facs="tcp:43855:9"/>
ſeven a Clock in the morning: And on Saturdays he ſpent the afternoon in Catechizing: And finding much ignorance in the Pariſh, he was the more laborious for their inſtruction; and once every week in the Winter, he would be-ſpeak a houſe in the Street at the end of an Alley, and thither he would ſend for the poor people out of the Alleys, and ſpend much time in inſtructing them, and praying with them: the next week he would do the ſame in another place; and where he himſelf had been the former week, he would appoint one that could write well, to follow him, and repeat a Sermon, and pray with the people in the ſame place,
<pb facs="tcp:43855:9"/>
to keep on their hearts what had been wrought; and ſuch of the willing perſons as could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat ſufficiently, he appointed to read ſome fit Book to the hearers, uſually the book called,</hi> A Call to the Unconverted. <hi>And that againſt</hi> Making Light of Chriſt, <hi>which in a great meaſure anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ends. And finding by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus through all his Pariſh, that not only Children, but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Ancient perſons, were very ignorant; and the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not read: he ſent to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity for a young man</hi> (<hi>who is now a Miniſter in</hi> Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex) <hi>and gave him his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, to go three days a week, to teach people to read; by
<pb facs="tcp:43855:10"/>
which means aged perſons, ſome of ſixty years of age, and ſome more, did learn to read, to their great comfort: And to farther their underſtanding of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, he Printed a ſhort</hi> Catechiſm <hi>of Twelve Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and Anſwers, and gave them freely to all the Pariſhioners that would come for them; and for them that were poor, and old, he bought a great number of</hi> Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>and gave them to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der poor people and ſervants that could not buy them: and when he asked many poor people why they came not to the Publick Worſhip of God, and they would anſwer, becauſe they had not cloaths; he would ſtir up ſome
<pb facs="tcp:43855:10"/>
friends which he had in</hi> London, <hi>to relieve them, and ſo got cloth, and clothed them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His health calling him to abide moſt in the Country at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> he got a grave Miniſter Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> to be his Aſſiſtant in <hi>Southwark</hi>; and ſo divided his labours to Two Congregations, being one day with one, and the next with the other. And having a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of his own, he never took any Stipend or Maintenance from either of them; but lived as believing that it is more honourable to <hi>give</hi> than to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>: That very ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which was Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he left his Aſſiſtant, who
<pb facs="tcp:43855:11"/>
needed it, to receive.</p>
            <p>This faithful Servant of Chriſt did for many years perform theſe hard but pleaſing labours, under that ſore diſeaſe, the <hi>Stone in the Reins</hi> (which ſome think was <hi>Paul</hi>'s prick in the fleſh, though others rather take it for Reproach or Perſecution). And though by the ordinary uſe of <hi>North-hall</hi>-Waters he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med long to keep it under; yet leaving the Country, &amp; coming to abide again at <hi>London,</hi> after twice preaching with very great fervency, he fell into that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of pain, which in a ſhort time brought him to his Death; which how peaceably and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably he underwent to the

laſt, Mr. <hi>Brag</hi> hath told you in his Funeral-Sermon. His diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected body ſhewed that a Stone in the Bladder as well as his calculous and corrupted Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, was his Death.</p>
            <p>The affection of his Flock to their departed Paſtor, made them deſirous that his laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons might be publiſhed; not becauſe they excelled all the reſt (for in theſe you may ſee his ordinary fervency and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity in preaching); but the laſt words of our friends affect us moſt; and as we remember them beſt, ſo we are deſirous to commemorate them to others.</p>
            <p>It will be thought by ſome an injury to the deceaſed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb facs="tcp:43855:12"/>
that ſuch popular and plain Exhortations ſhould be publiſhed, when no doubt had he lived to publiſh them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they would have appeared in a leſs homely dreſs. But I take it for no diſgrace but a great and neceſſary duty, to ſpeak the important matters of Salvation (not in a ſlovenly, but) in as plain, and familiar, and fervent a manner, as (its well known) the common ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and dullneſs of moſt Hearers do require. Who can ſpeak too <hi>plainly</hi> or too <hi>earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to ſuch? And <hi>Writings</hi> muſt be ſuited to ſuch <hi>Readers Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> as well as <hi>Sermons</hi> to ſuch <hi>hearers.</hi> Two inſtances <hi>encourage</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:43855:12"/>
me to this recommendation, <hi>viz.</hi> The works of Mr. <hi>William Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> which were popularly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken from their mouths in ſo broken and rude a manner as greatly injured the Authors, (and are not to paſs as the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their judgments in points of Controverſie) yet did more good by their <hi>plainness and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar earneſtness,</hi> than moſt Books that I have known: But thoſe that the <hi>ſame men</hi> publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in a <hi>cloſer ſtile,</hi> have far leſs <hi>profited</hi> the world of ordinary Readers. That is good, which doth good.</p>
            <p>To ſhew the reaſonableneſs that all Miniſters ſhould deal
<pb facs="tcp:43855:13"/>
thus faithfully and plainly with ſuch as are under their Miniſtry, I will lay open ſomewhat of the caſe before you, and then judg reaſonably of it as you are men. The Eternal God delighting in the wonderful diverſity of his Creatures, hath made man of a middle nature, between Bruits and Angels, giving him Vital-power, Reaſon and Free will. He hath placed him in this World as for a race or warfare, reſolving that as he behaveth himſelf, it ſhall go with him in another World for ever: For though his body be duſt, and muſt to duſt return, his ſoul is from above, and liveth in bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs or miſery for ever. By
<pb facs="tcp:43855:13"/>
Sin we have all forfeited our right to Heaven: But Eternal Love hath given us a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who is God and Man, who as our Surety became a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for our ſins, and by his Merits hath purchaſed a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Grant of free forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of renewing Grace, and endleſs Glory. And being aſcended into Heaven, poſſeſſeth it in our nature, and interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for us, being now as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, Lord of all. And as the Sun above us ſendeth down its beams on Earth, ſo doth our Glorified Lord his Spirit, to <hi>quicken, enlighten</hi> and <hi>ſanctifie</hi> Souls, who were <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>dark,</hi> and <hi>diſaffected</hi> to God, to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:43855:14"/>
and Heavenly perfection. And he hath appointed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office, that men might be his meſſengers to men, to acquaint them with his Grace, and with the Glory which he prepareth for them, that they may truly <hi>believe</hi> it, ſoberly <hi>think</hi> of it, duly <hi>value</hi> it, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily chuſe it, and diligently ſeek it, and live and die in the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation of it. And as our Souls converſe not with our neighbours immediately, but in and by our bodies in which they work; ſo the Spirit of Chriſt doth not ordinarily work on mens Souls without any means, but by his Word and Works which his Miniſters muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
<pb facs="tcp:43855:14"/>
Man is not now put upon ſatisfying Gods Juſtice, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing his Salvation by a price. Chriſt hath done theſe, and made a free gift of Grace and Glory to all that will but peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently and believingly accept it. Under Gods Grace, mens ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation now lieth on their own <hi>wills</hi>; no men or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils can damn or undo any one ſoul, but by his own conſent to the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his damnation. No men or devils can keep our ſouls from the <hi>Heavenly Glory,</hi> but by tempting him to refuſe it, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value and neglect it, and prefer the pleaſures of ſin before it, and by keeping him from loving, deſiring and ſeeking it: For
<pb facs="tcp:43855:15"/>
every one ſhall certainly have it, who had rather be a holy Chriſtian on earth, and live in perfect love and joy with God in Heaven for ever, than for his filthly pleaſure to enjoy the proſperity of this world. To acquaint men with this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is our Miniſterial Office; we are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſet before them the great Salvation which Chriſt hath procured, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to beſeech them to mind it, believe it, and accept it, that it may be theirs for ever: we believe God, and therefore we ſpeak to men as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us: We intreat them in his Name, to turn from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enmity and folly, and to be
<pb facs="tcp:43855:15"/>
reconciled to God, and be wiſe for their Salvation: We tell them but what Gods word ſent from heaven, telleth us and them, That holineſs is the love of God and goodneſs, and the hatred of ſin; that the <hi>pure in heart are bleſſed, for they ſhall ſee God. But without holineſs none can ſee him:</hi> We tell them from God, That heaven is won or loſt on earth; and that none ſhall have it but ſuch as hence learn to love a holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life; and that the diſlike of holineſs is the forfeiture of happineſs, and the beginning, or forerunner of Hell: We aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them, That God will never ſay, <hi>Depart from me ye workers
<pb facs="tcp:43855:16"/>
of iniquity,</hi> if they do not firſt by iniquity depart from God; and that God will not damn them, except they damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by the obſtinate final refuſing and reſiſting of his mercy. We intreat men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but to live as men ſhould do that <hi>love themſelves,</hi> and that are not indifferent whether they live in Heaven or Hell for ever. We intreat them not to be worſe to themſelves, than the Devil and all their enemies are, who cannot make them commit one ſin againſt their wills: And yet after all this warning, intreaty, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, there are thouſands, and ten thouſands that will not be
<pb facs="tcp:43855:16"/>
perſwaded, nor regard the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given them from God; ſome will not believe but that a man dies like a Dog (and what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if ſuch live like Dogs): And ſome will not believe but that they may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regenerating-grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, though Chriſts own mouth hath proteſted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and told us <hi>verily</hi> that it cannot be, <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5, 18, 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8, 9, 13, &amp;c. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes will not be brought to underſtand what we ſay; but when we talk of Redemption, Sanctification, and Salvation, they hear us as if we ſpake Greek or Hebrew to them, and
<pb facs="tcp:43855:17"/>
under teaching, grow old in ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh groſſeſt ignorance; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are taken up with the love of proſperity, &amp; the love of this deceiving world: multitudes are carried away with aſpiring ambition and fooliſh pride; and more, with the love of fleſhly pleaſures, and ſatisfying their appetites and luſts. Many poor people (who every where are the moſt) are ſo oppreſt with want, and wearied with their daily labour, and taken up with cares to pay their Rents and Debts, and maintain their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that they think it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in them if they little mind the pleaſing of God, and ſaving of their ſouls; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb facs="tcp:43855:17"/>
that they have no leiſure for it, and God requireth it not at their hands. And the ſame moſt ſervants think, who have time little enough for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters work. Multitudes have ſuch dead and hardened hearts, that when we tell them that they muſt ſhortly be in Heaven or Hell, as they are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, we ſpeak almoſt as to blocks, or men aſleep: they feel not what we ſay, as if they did not hear us.</p>
            <p>We are bid, <hi>cry aloud,</hi> and tell them of their ſin and danger, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.1, 2. and yet we cannot get them to regard and feel; God ſaith, <hi>Awake thou that ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and Chriſt ſhall give thee
<pb facs="tcp:43855:18"/>
light</hi>; and yet we cannot get them to awake, nor hear us like men that have the uſe of reaſon, and love themſelves. Alas, how many thouſands are there whom we could never perſwade to conſider with deep and ſerious thoughts, what will become of their Souls when they are dead, nor to ſeek to be reſolved of it from the infallible Word of God! that never ſet a part one hour in their lives to conſider ſeriouſly, Whether they have any title to Salvation, which they can make good by the Word of God by which they muſt be judged!</p>
            <p>Sirs, This, this is the caſe of multitudes of our neighbours;
<pb facs="tcp:43855:18"/>
and what would you have a Miniſter to do in ſuch a caſe? ſhould we flatter and ſmooth them up in an unholy life, what thanks would they give us for this ere long, when they find themſelves in hell?</p>
            <p>Would you have us ſtand by in ſilence, and look on, while Satan thus leadeth thouſands to perdition? Would you have us let them quietly go to hell, for fear of diſpleaſing them or others, or ſeeming to be unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly or uncivil with them? Would you have us whiſper to men that muſt be awakened or undone for ever, whom thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightening will not awake?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43855:19"/>Alas, we ſee men dying daily, and we are dying our ſelves, and daily look when we ſpeak our laſt, and when they hear their laſt, even all that ever they ſhall hear more for their Salvation: We ſee how Time doth paſs away! much is loſt already, the reſt is ſhort, and utterly uncertain<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and the ignorance, unbelief, hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs, fleſhlineſs, worldlineſs, pride, malignity and unholineſs of ſinners, are deep-rooted, ſtrong and damnable evils. We ſee men when they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that they muſt <hi>repent</hi> or <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi> Luk. 13.3, 5, putting it off from day to day; when they are certainly to be gone
<pb facs="tcp:43855:19"/>
ere long, and never certain of one more hour: And alas, a long life is little enough for a willing awakened ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to work out his Salvation, and make his Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure.</p>
            <p>Sirs, tell us as Chriſtians, or at leaſt as men, what faith, and reaſon, and humane love command us to do in ſuch a caſe? ſhall we forbear, or ſpeak to them in formality as on a ſtage, as if we were Players, and not Preachers, and would perſwade them not to believe what we ſay; ſhould we let them alone, be damned, and take it for our excuſe, that they or others were unwilling of our
<pb facs="tcp:43855:20"/>
labours? Shall we pretend cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and hope that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enough to ſave them, while we ſee not ſo much as knowledg, or any love to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor forſaking of mortal ſin, nor any ſerious care of their Salvation? Is it the office of Charity to further mens deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and damnation? If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not another life our ſelves, and that there is a God who will reward them (and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly them) that diligently ſeek him, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.) we would quickly renounce this ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſtry and Work; we would wiſh that all the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the world were ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and that the people would
<pb facs="tcp:43855:20"/>
better uſe their Tythes, than to maintain ſuch troublers of the world. But God hath ſhined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our minds with the heavenly convincing light. He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us the firſt fruits and pledg of Glory: <hi>We believe</hi> a Heaven and a Hell, and the abſolute neceſſity of a holy and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind and life; and we <hi>know why</hi> we do believe it. Here we have upon our ſober conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid up all our hopes and comforts; and what ſhould we perſwade our neighbours to chuſe, but that which God hath taught us to chuſe our ſelves? And wo to him that ever he was born, that maketh not this choice, and taketh not the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

Glory for his portion!</p>
            <p>And now, Reader, I have told thee why ſuch Miniſters ſo live and labour, as our Brother did, and why I commend to thee his Example, and theſe Sermons: The Lord perſwade you to uſe what is given thee.</p>

My friends whom I love, pity and pray for; 'tis true, we have now no new Revelations, no infallible predictions; but <hi>Verba noviſſima,</hi> the laſt words of ſo well qualified a Watchman, a man ſo ſolid, ſelf-denying, ſo holy and heavenly, that it was even natural to him to be ſo: I ſay the words of ſuch a dying Miniſter methinks ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

ſounding in your ears; My friends, get you into the Ark, for the flood is a coming; repent quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; elſe, if you be not drowned, you may be burnt, you will be damned. Read ſeriouſly theſe Sermons, and give ſlumber to thine eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt ſmote upon thy breaſt, and cried God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to thee a ſinner, if thou canſt.</p>
            <p>The great wonder-working God, who of old ſmote the Rock, to fetch water in abundance, reward thee, who ever thou art, that wilt ſeriouſly read over and over this warm diſcourſe, with ſmiting thy rocky heart, till thou canſt read no longer for weeping bitterly.</p>
            <p>I have called it a <hi>warm</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which is no impertinent or inſignificant adjunct: when people
<pb facs="tcp:43855:23"/>
are in bed, and the houſe the while a fire about their ears, I think he ſpeaketh beſt who ſpeaks loudeſt to awaken them. This ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God now knows and feels whether ſpeaking as he ſpake, to reach hearts, not tickle ears, or humour fancies, was not better than the rareſt compoſure of any <hi>Tertullus</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>Sinners, ſinners, it is more than two Months ſince this holy Saint, (who hath turn'd preaching to men into praiſing God with Angels, and with the heavenly Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants) preached theſe Sermons. Are you yet in your ſins? could you have thought you ſhould live ſo long, and not be cut down like dead trees for the fire of Tophet? and do you preſume ſtill? what,
<pb facs="tcp:43855:24"/>
curſe and ſwear, be drunk and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched ſtill! What, is the ſpirit of the old world in you! will ye take no warning! you do not take your ſelves to be bruits, not to have immortal ſouls; and yet you will not act like men; Reaſon, as well as the Word of God, doth tell you, you are the worſt and deareſt purchaſers in all the world; to give a ſoul for ſin, is the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt bargain that ever was made; the eternal happineſs of the ſoul, for the dirty pleaſure of ſin for a ſeaſon. O let not the Devil jear and reproach you in hell for this folly.</p>
            <p>Is there not a merciful God that would forgive and forget all that is paſt, if you would even now to day fully, without any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,
<pb facs="tcp:43855:24"/>
return to him? would not his boſom be open to receive you? ſhould not you find a father that would fall upon your neck, and kiſs you, as well as the prodigal did? To you God crys, upon you God waits that he may be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to you. <hi>O ye ſimple ones, how long will ye love ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! Turn ye at my rebuke, and I will pour out my ſpirit upon you; though your ſins were as ſcarlet, I'le make them as white as ſnow. Turn ye, turn ye, why will you die</hi>? Will you not be made clean? when ſhall it once be? What would you have God ſay more to encourage penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? to perſwade men to ceaſe loving their luſts, which will elſe damn their ſouls?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43855:25"/>But if you will be deceived by the Devil, and will gratifie your luſts for a moment, though you die eternally for it: I muſt tell you, ſuch a reſolution is like theirs, <hi>who have made a covenant with hell, and with death,</hi> and cry a ſhort life and a ſweet; who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get they have ſouls, while they thus ſpeak, and reſolve; and will not believe there is a God, till they wiſh for rocks and, mountains to fall upon them, to hide them from him; nor believe there is a hell, till they feel it.</p>
            <p>O what a deep ſenſe had the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> of the miſery and immergent ruins of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Rom. 10.1, His hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire unto God for them was, that they might be ſaved; he
<pb facs="tcp:43855:25"/>
could wiſh himſelf accurſed that they might eſcape.</hi> I know no man more like-minded to him than this Servant of God, who is with the Lord, who delighted in nothing, no work in the world, like plucking brands out of the fire, ſaving men from hell, and ſending men and women before him to heaven, if he could.</p>
            <p>I hope the impreſſion upon my heart from the conſideration of that incomparable tranſport of his Soul in the Preaching the laſt Sermon (as if he had known his time was ſo ſhort, and that Sermon his laſt) ſhall ſtill remain freſh upon me. After Sermon, I told him of it; and he told me, <hi>His heart was carried out with zeal and pity, that he could
<pb facs="tcp:43855:26"/>
not keep to method, but he could not help it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that knew him, can bear him witneſs, that he was able to write or ſpeak for matter and form gratefully to any; but he ſtudied plainneſs; and therefore purpoſely declined great Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to my knowledg; a clear proof of his meek and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ſpirit: Gain-ſay it who can. He ſought not honour from men whilſt alive; and now he is dead, let his own Works praiſe him in the gates.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould enquire why, or who call'd me to interpoſe theſe few rude lines? I only ſay, It is <hi>pia fraus,</hi> to ſteal an opportunity to teſtifie more publickly the great veneration I have for the name of
<pb facs="tcp:43855:26"/>
this holy man, who indeed was one of the Sons of <hi>Davids</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies. As alſo to ſignifie my long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Souls happineſs of all that were his ordinary Hearers: Whom again I beſeech to read, and afterwards to ponder, who and what moved him to ſpeak his heart in theſe laſt words unto them, if peradventure God may give them repentance unto life by the Miniſtry of him who not only ſaved himſelf, but ſhall then ſave alſo them that heard him.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43855:30"/>As for the Scope of them (in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the 18 <hi>Verſe</hi>), I have ſhewed you how the Apoſtle was acquainting us with the great benefit that ſinners do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the death of Chriſt; that I have (already) opened to you. <hi>Chriſt hath once ſufferd for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (in the following <hi>Verſes</hi>) the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle paſſeth on from the death of Chriſt, unto the life of Chriſt; and ſhews that we have not only benefit by a Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but by a Chriſt living: For, Chriſt is our Saviour both ways. We are ſaved by his death, meritoriouſly; we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his life, as he lives for to ſee the purchaſed-bleſſings of his death made good to us. Now the Apoſtle in theſe words (I have already read) conſidereth the life of Chriſt two ways:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> With reſpect to the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came in the fleſh; with reſpect to the old World, above Two thouſand years before he came in the fleſh; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Eternal Son of God was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43855:30"/>
alive then: yea, before the World was, he was alive, and was God bleſſed for ever; by him the World was made. To the old World, even that world that was deſtroyed by the Flood, to that world he was a Saviour by deſignation; and he took care of them: The care of mankind, from the fall hath been depoſited in the hands of Chriſt, he hath taken care of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the fall of man into ſin. Then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Apoſtle does ſpeak of the advantages that the Church hath by a living-Chriſt, upon his Reſurrection from the dead (as he ſpeaks in the 21 <hi>v.</hi>) <hi>The figure whereunto, even Baptiſm, doth alſo now ſave us,</hi> (then there comes in a Parentheſis). How does Baptiſm ſave us? Why, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. When he was on earth he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel, promiſed pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the penitent believing ſinner, and died for him when he had done preaching; and aroſe from the dead, and is gone to Heaven to make good every word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43855:31"/>We are now upon the conſideration of the benefits that the old World had from Chriſt, above two thouſand years before Chriſt was born in the fleſh. Why, what was the benefit that the old World had? Why, Chriſt by his Spirit did ſend <hi>Noah,</hi> a Preacher of righteouſneſs to preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to the old Word: the Spirit of Chriſt was in <hi>Noah,</hi> by which Spirit <hi>Noah</hi> Propheſied of the deſtruction of the world. By which Spirit he was directed to build the <hi>Ark,</hi> to prepare for himſelf and thoſe that ſhould repent, for that time that the Floold ſhould come upon the world. Chriſt by his Spirit preached then, to that world of ſinners that were drowned then; and not only drowned, but their ſpirits damn'd: which was for diſobeying Chriſt, for diſobeying the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt in <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now given you the Scope of the place, we ſhall proceed (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that light I have) to give you the underſtanding of the words and phraſes of this Scripture: for it ſeemeth to be a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43855:31"/>
Scripture that is not without its difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. We will begin at the Firſt:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is to be <hi>put to death in the fleſh?</hi> (that we muſt enquire into).</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is it to be <hi>quickned by the Spirit?</hi> What does the Apoſtle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand hereby?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What is this <hi>preaching</hi>? What are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Theſe <hi>Spirits that are in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi> And what's the <hi>priſon?</hi> And ſo we ſhall take in what follows in its order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being put to death in the fleſh:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who <hi>put to death</hi>? Chriſt. By whom? By the unbelieving wicked <hi>Jews,</hi> they were his accuſers. <hi>Put to death in the fleſh,</hi> by whom? By <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> as his Judg. <hi>Put to death in the fleſh,</hi> by whom? Why, by thoſe Executioners that were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> to ſee him Crucified; The <hi>Jews, Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers put him to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Put to death in the fleſh,</hi> What's that? That is after he was made fleſh, he was <hi>put to death</hi>; as he was man, he hung
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43855:32"/>
upon the Croſs: The loſs of blood, and the anguiſh and pain, the nails in his feet, and in his hands kill'd him; he died there, his ſoul ſeparated from his body; <hi>he cryed with a loud voice and gave up the Ghoſt:</hi> ſo he was <hi>put to death in the Fleſh</hi>; that is, as to his human Nature. That is plain: The following words have more difficulty in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But quickned by the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What's the meaning of <hi>quickned?</hi> And what's here meant by <hi>Spirit?</hi> (that we muſt enquire into, becauſe it will tend to open the difficulty that lies in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words): <hi>Quickned,</hi> (as the Greek hath it) <hi>Vivificatus autem ſpiritu,</hi> made alive, which is of the ſame import with <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>: he died as to his human Nature, but he did not continue in a ſtate of death, but was <hi>made alive again.</hi> Chriſt that died for ſinners, was <hi>made alive.</hi> What was <hi>made alive?</hi> That which was <hi>dead.</hi> What was <hi>dead?</hi> The man Chriſt; ſo that <hi>that</hi> which died for our ſins, was <hi>made alive again</hi>; that is, <hi>raiſed from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43855:32"/>
the dead,</hi> that's the meaning of it. There's nothing can be <hi>made alive,</hi> but that which was <hi>dead.</hi> The Apoſtle uſeth this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for to ſignifie the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body; and therefore in reaſon it may ſignifie ſo in this place, 1 Cor. 15.22, <hi>For as in Adam all died, ſo in Christ ſhall all be made alive:</hi> 'Tis the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>made alive</hi>: that is, they ſhall be raiſed from the Grave. So here Chriſt died as to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> but he was <hi>made alive</hi>: that is, he was <hi>raiſed from the dead</hi>: Raiſed, How was he raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? (it follows) In or by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> What <hi>Spirit</hi> is here? Why it is that <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> that did efficiently raiſe him; he was <hi>quickned</hi> in, or by the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by this <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſay the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is meant the human Soul of Chriſt. For this reaſon it cannot be meant of the Soul of Chriſt, becauſe that the Soul of Chriſt being a creature, could never <hi>quicken,</hi> could never raiſe the dead body of Chriſt: For Chriſt was perfect God and perfect Man; as he was Man, he had a Soul and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43855:33"/>
body; his Soul and body were creatures; and though the Spirit or Soul of Chriſt was an excellent, pure, holy Soul, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; yet it was not God, and had not an Almighty power. None but God could raiſe the dead: therefore the ſoul of Chriſt could never raiſe the body of Chriſt. What was it then? It muſt then be the Holy Ghoſt, it muſt be the Spirit of God, which is God, which is Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that can raiſe the dead, and did raiſe the dead Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For what reaſon do I think that by <hi>Spirit</hi> is here meant the Holy Ghoſt? Why, I will tell you: Becauſe all the Miracles that Chriſt, or his Apoſtles did, whether they healed the ſick, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they raiſed the dead, or caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, were all attributed to the Spirit of God, to the Holy Spirit of Chriſt. And therefore no wonder if the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt be given unto the Spirit of God. And (if I miſtake not) that is the meaning, or the import of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3, 4, <hi>Concerning his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43855:33"/>
Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, which was made of the ſeed of David according to the fleſh: And declared to be the Son of God, with power, according to the Spirit of holineſs:</hi> Holineſs in the abſtract, that is by the Greeks commonly uſed for the concrete, and you may read it thus, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Holy Ghoſt, he was <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Son of God, with power,</hi> with the power of the Holy Ghoſt, by the Reſurrection from the dead; he was raiſed by the Spirit of God, by which all works of Miracles were wrought, or done by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; he was raiſed from the dead by this Spirit.</p>
            <p>And now, That which follows will be ſomewhat clear: For if by being <hi>made alive,</hi> is to be underſtood the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſts human Nature, and by the Spirit that raiſed that human Nature, is to be meant the Holy Ghoſt; then proceeds, by which, or in which, he went and <hi>preached.</hi> He went. Who went? Chriſt went. By which Spirit? by which Holy Ghoſt he went and <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43855:34"/>
to the ſpirits in priſon.</hi> Why, did Chriſt the Son of God <hi>preach</hi> to the old world before he came in the fleſh? Yes, How? By his Spirit. What immediately? No, but by <hi>Noah,</hi> for he was a <hi>preacher of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>: Why all the Prophets they had their Prophetical gifts, and they had them all from the Spirit of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. — <hi>And ſpared not the old world, but ſaved Noah the eighth perſon, a preacher of righteouſneſs, bringing in the flood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world of the ungodly.</hi> You muſt know, all the preachers under the Goſpel have their gifts from the Spirit; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is employed in ſending them out: the Spirit aſſiſteth them; the Spirit ſaid, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate me Barnabas and Saul:</hi> It was the Spirit which ſent all the Prophets out; the Spirit of Chriſt ſent out <hi>Noah,</hi> made him his Preacher. So then, by this Spirit of Chriſt <hi>Noah</hi> preached, or Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Noah.</hi> To whom? <hi>To the Spirits in priſon</hi>; that is, to the ſouls of thoſe wicked men that are now in priſon; that were in priſon at the time when <hi>Peter</hi> did
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43855:34"/>
write. When God drowned the world, that was not all; their bodies lay float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the great Sea, but their ſouls went down into Hell. Well; but ſay you, Did Chriſt by his Spirit preach to them after they went to Hell? No. They were preached to when they were <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time diſobedient,</hi> in the times of <hi>Noah</hi>; as in the verſe following; <hi>the Spirits in priſon, that were ſometime diſobedient.</hi> Diſobedient to whom? To the Spirit. When? <hi>In the time of Noah</hi>; for they diſobeyed <hi>Noah,</hi> regarded not his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the building of the Ark; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him as a mad-man, they took not the warning, and were ſwallowed up in the flood, and are now in priſon for their diſobedience; they were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Spirit of Chriſt in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts, by the Spirits in priſon,</hi> they would perſwade you, is to be meant a <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> (as they call it) a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſtate between Heaven and Hell, wherein the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were held until
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43855:35"/>
the time that Jeſus Chriſt died; and that when Chriſt was dead, and his body in the grave (for that three days and nights) that Chriſt in his ſoul did deſcend into this <hi>Limbus,</hi> and there did preach himſelf unto the ſoul of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe good Spirits that were alive in former days, and took them out of that ſtate, and carried them to Heaven. Thus ſay the <hi>Papiſts</hi>; this is their Interpretation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, But this is not to be believed; becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch <hi>Spirits that were diſobedient,</hi> not of the Spirits of the Fathers: for the very <hi>Papists</hi> themſelves ſpeak of no Spirits in their <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> but only good Spirits; But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (in this place ſpeaks of none but <hi>diſobedient Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, 'Tis a vain Interpretation; becauſe if that their <hi>Limbus</hi> (or middle ſtate) is only a receptacle of good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Why, they needed not to have preaching after their death to them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believed while they were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43855:35"/>
the earth: and if they believed whilſt upon the earth, they were juſtified; and if they were juſtified, their ſins were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: and what then ſhould keep them out of Heaven? 'Tis a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent thing to think, that Chriſt ſhould go into their <hi>Limbus,</hi> to preach faith to them that have believed already.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Their Interpretation depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth much upon the interpreting the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which he was quickned; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting that to be meant of his ſoul. But if that cannot be meant of his ſoul, but of the Holy-Ghoſt, then their notion falls to the ground: for they read it thus, Chriſt was dead in the body, but kept alive in his ſoul; by which he went and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto theſe Fathers in their <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Scripture is plain, that Chriſt did not go down into any ſuch middle-ſtate; for he ſaid to the Thief, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> This can't be any middle-ſtate, where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He ſaw and heard things
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43855:36"/>
that were unutterable.</hi> Well then, this is that the Apoſtle meaneth, that thoſe <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that are now in priſon,</hi> were ſometime alive in the body as we, and they heard the preaching of the Spirit of Chriſt in <hi>Noah</hi>; but for their diſobedience they were taken off by the flood, and their ſouls were laid up in Hell, as in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Now the Doctrine ſhall be this;</p>
            <p>That the Spirits or ſouls of wicked men, (when they die) they ſhall as priſoners of Gods juſtice be dragged out of their bodies; and by the righteous ſentence of God, ſhall be laid up in the priſon of Hell, for their diſobedience unto the Spirit of Chriſt, that preacheth in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>All this is contained in the words.</p>
            <p>In the opening of it, there are theſe things I ſhall ſpeak to;</p>
            <p>Firſt, What are theſe Priſoners? Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How are theſe Priſoners car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away to their Priſon? By death (as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43855:36"/>
thoſe of the old world were by a death cauſed by the flood).</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What's this priſon? Hell.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, What's the cauſe of their commitment? Diſobedience, diſobedience to the voice of the Spirit of Chriſt in his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Here is the juſtneſs of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence implied; for inaſmuch as they are Gods priſoners, ſo they are priſoners that are juſtly impriſoned. I pray God by what you and I hear of it (this day), it may never be any of our lots; that you and I may never prove any of theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Priſoners!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What are theſe Priſoners? <hi>Spirits, Souls</hi>: thoſe immortal Souls that live and abide in you, while you are in this world. Your bodies they are like houſes that are made up of clay, of earth: but a houſe is not without its Tenant. God hath made no body, but he hath made it for a Tenant. Every human body hath his Tenant: What's that? The Soul, the Spirit. It is that immortal
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43855:37"/>
Spirit that is in you, by which you live, move, act, reaſon; by which you ſee, hear, walk: all the motions that are ſeen, or done by any part of you, come from the Spirit, from the Soul. And as it is with an old houſe, or any houſe, if it be pull'd down, the Tenant goes out of doors; if it be fir'd down, the Tenant ſteps out of doors, and perhaps on the other ſide of the ſtreet, looking upon his houſe burning down: The houſe is burnt, but the Tenant's alive: So it is with you, when theſe bodies of clay of yours fall, are they drowned (with theſe of the old world); ſhould they be burnt, ſhould they fall by a Fever, or any other way; your ſouls (like Tenants) they come out: That living ſpirit in you comes out, you give up the Ghoſt, give up the Spirit. The <hi>body returns</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>to the earth,</hi> your <hi>Spirit returns to God,</hi> to be judged. This is the Priſoner. But, O what a ſad Priſoner is the ſoul of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, when ſtript of his body! He is a naked Priſoner, and a friendleſs Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43855:37"/>
which are two ſad circumſtances of a priſoner. When God ſendeth the Serjeant death, and ſeizeth upon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a wicked man, knocks at the door of his body; the body is faſt bolted, locked, no getting in. What does death do? breaks down the Body, pulls it about his ears: ſometime death drowns him, ſometime death hangs him, ſometime ſtabs him, ſometimes he goes to Sea, and is caſt away, ſometimes a Cart goes over him; and ſo the poor ſoul of the wicked man is arreſted; death lays hold of him, and drags him away to the Tribunal of God, and there is he in a naked condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: naked of the world, naked of his body: A poor thing! When a wicked mans ſpirit is in the world, he hath a houſe, a body; and out of his body he hath the caſements of his eyes to look through, and hath ſome kind of enjoyment in his meats and drinks. But when death comes, he pulls down the houſe about his ears, and the ſoul's drag'd away, and there is no more the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43855:38"/>
light of the Sun, no more eating and drinking, no more the delights of the fleſh. He is like the malefactor that hath committed ſome great crime, and the Prince ſends the Officers, and they ſurround the houſe, and break it open, and drag him away in his ſhirt, and won't give him time to put on his cloaths. This is a ſad ſight. Juſt ſo will thy wicked ſoul, O thou wicked man, be dragged away without ſhirt, or hoſe, or ſhoe, out of the houſe of thy body. And when the poor priſoner, the ſpirit of a wicked man, is ſent by death to the Tribunal of God, he is in a friendleſs condition. If a man is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for debt, there may be ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; ſome good neighbours may come and ſay, Pray have pity, he is a poor man, he cannot pay you, he will pay you when he can, I will lay down ſomewhat for him: you have ſuch a thing as that is here, that ſaves the poor man from priſon. But alas! thou poor wicked ſoul that wouldeſt take no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43855:38"/>
warning, but haſt been diſobedient to the Goſpel, when death comes with a Commiſſion from God, from Chriſt the great Judg of quick and dead, he ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon thee, draggeth thee away; and perhaps, when thou art dragging away, thou lookeſt about, what, can I have no friend to intercede for me? O, for a little more time to repent in! A little more time to pay my debts in! What, will none lay down a ranſome for me? No, No. Thou wicked man, while thou art in the body, Jeſus Chriſt comes often in his Miniſters, ſaying to thee, Thou wicked ſinner, thou art ten thouſand Talents in debt; Come ſinner, believe in me, repent of thy ſins againſt me, and I will pay all thy debts; I will diſcharge them all: but thou poor rebel wouldeſt not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to it, but thou wouldeſt go on, and run farther and farther. Now ſays Chriſt, I will have no more to do with him; Juſtice, ſeize upon him. Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of death, arreſt him, drag him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43855:39"/>
with thee: bring him to my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and there to priſon thou muſt go: and now poor ſoul, thou haſt no body to pay thy debts for thee; now thou muſt go, and pay them all thy ſelf: but thou wilt never be able to pay the uttermoſt farthing; nay, thou art not able to pay one farthing.</p>
            <p>Well, but whether muſt I go? To priſon. What's that priſon? Hell (man), that's the priſon: ſo it is called a priſon, Rev. 20.1, 2, <hi>And I ſaw an Angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the Dragon that old Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him:</hi> Where? why where he was looſed afterwards, for a time, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7, <hi>And when the thouſand years are expired, Satan ſhall be looſed out of his priſon.</hi> This deep pit is here call'd a priſon; this deep pit where the Devil is chained, is a priſon, and thither muſt every arreſted ſinner be dragged into this pit, and laid in this priſon, in

chains, under darkneſs. Why, ſay you, Why is Hell call'd a priſon (for theſe poor ſpirits to be laid in)?</p>
            <p>Why, becauſe of the reſemblance that it hath to a priſon. In theſe three reſpects Hell is called a Priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's a place of puniſhment, as Priſons are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's a place of Reſtraint.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's a place of Abode.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A priſon is a place of Puniſhment: Alas, your priſons are full of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of puniſhment: Go into a priſon, and there you ſhall ſee your dark dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, without any light (or next to none), there you may ſee your Preſs-yard, where the malefactors are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preſs'd to death, and you may ſee the preſs, and the weights that are laid upon them: go into Priſons, and there you ſhall ſee Racks to torture men, to ſtretch them, to pull their limbs and members out of joynt; there you ſhall ſee Chains, Chains for the feet, for the hands, to bind them, to load them, to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43855:40"/>
pain them. Priſons are places of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, torment, miſery. Hell is called a Priſon, becauſe it is a place of pain and torment. Why, what is there in Hell that anſwers to theſe Racks, Preſſes, Irons, Chains? Why there is darkneſs, there's your Dungeon, utter darkneſs, extream darkneſs: For Miſery, there is <hi>weeping, wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> For Torment, there is fire, everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire that will never go out. There's a rack for the Spirit, there's the worm that never dieth. For a Jaylor, there's the Devil, that is in for his own fault, and to be tormented himſelf, and to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment others. O! 'tis a ſad Priſon! to be under a cruel Jaylor, in Chains, and fire, with a worm gnawing at the very heart, under the wrath of God! This is a ſad ſtate, ſinners! a ſad ſtate! The Lord help you to believe it. But you are apt to hear this as a Fable; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, you will find this true. The old world was as ſecure as you are. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, faith God, or I will drown you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43855:40"/>
all, and (that which is more) I will damn you too: I will ſend your bodies to rot in the ground, and your ſouls to the Priſon of Hell. <hi>Noah</hi> tells them ſo: Says God to <hi>Noah, Prepare thy Ark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the time</hi>: He did ſo. Why what did the reſt do? They believed it not, they regarded it not: they thought <hi>Noah</hi> muſt ſay ſomething, and they look't upon him as a Mad-man, and ſo you do Us. Sinners! take heed that death does not come and drag you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before you have repented, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the voice of Chriſt in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The old world becauſe they did not repent, they were damn'd for not hearkning to <hi>Noah</hi>; and you ſhall be damn'd if you will not hearken to Us. The Lord awaken your ſleepy ſouls, that you may not ſleep the ſleep of death; that you may not go down with your bodies to the Grave, and your ſouls to Hell.</p>
            <p>But again, Hell is called a Priſon, becauſe it is a place of reſtraint; you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43855:41"/>
can't go out when you pleaſe. Go to <hi>Newgate,</hi> they will talk with you through the grates, but they can't go out of doors, neither can friends come to them, but muſt ask the Jaylor leave: and if he hath commiſſion to deny any, away you muſt go, though a Wife, though a Father or Brother: So, poor ſoul, when God hath ſtript thee of thy body, and laid thee in this Priſon, thou ſhalt be reſtrained, and others reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from coming to thee; there's no friend to come to thee then. <hi>Noah</hi> preached to the old world in the body, and ſo we do to you; but when you have by your diſobedience provoked God to cut you off, and lay your ſouls in this Priſon, there's no coming to you, no preacher then, no Chriſt, and no Spirit to offer Salvation then: you are poor Priſoners reſtrain'd and kept from all manner of comfort. O ſaith the rich man in Hell, <hi>Father Abraham, O that ſome would come and give me but the refreſhment of a drop of cold water
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43855:41"/>
to cool my tongue in this torment! No,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there's a gulf between us and you</hi>; 'tis a Gaol, and the Priſoner is bounded up by the Juſtice of God; and there is a charge, none ſhall come from us to you, nor from you to us. It's a Priſon, you are reſtrained, poor ſinners! Will you believe? No, you don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Becauſe you dont believe, you will be damn'd: This damn'd the old world, and this will damn you, if you don't believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hell is a Priſon, as it is a place of Abode. When you are in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if it be for debt, How can you get out? Why theſe Three ways you may get out of theſe Priſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By breaking of them: but you can't break the gates of Hell, no you can't; you may clamber theſe walls, and come down by ropes: but there is a great gulf, that you may as well think of clambering the Stars, as to get out of this Priſon. And again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is an other way, if you can't
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43855:42"/>
pay your debts, <hi>another</hi> may: But there is no paying for you out of Hell. Chriſt hath once done it, if you will repent he will pay all for you; but if once clapt into that Priſon, Chriſts blood will profit you nothing. Or,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> By Pardon. If no body will pay the debt, the Creditor may forgive him: but believe it, ſinner, you will never have ſuch a pardon from God; for here's your time of pardon, if thou wilt repent, Chriſt he will pardon thee, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts</hi>: but if you die, no more pardon, no more offers of Grace; then thou art ſhut up for ever. 'Tis a Priſon. Never man that was in Hell, got out of Hell more. So much for the Third.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What's the Crime (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcourſed of the Priſon)? Wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>'s the Crime? Diſobedience. <hi>That were ſometimes diſobedient in the days of Noah.</hi> To whom? To the Spirit of Chriſt. In whom? <hi>Noah</hi> Where <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the old world. Why, did the Spirit
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43855:42"/>
appear in viſible ſhape? No, but in <hi>Noah, a Preacher of righteouſneſs.</hi> They hearkned not to <hi>Noah,</hi> and for that they periſhed: That is the great crime for which men have from the beginning of the world gone down into Hell, for their diſobedience to the Spirit of Chriſt in his Prophets, and in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Why, what were the ſins that they were guilty of, that <hi>Noah</hi> called them to repent of? Why you ſhall ſee in the 6 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> and the 5 <hi>ver.</hi> (they were a wicked ſort of people, and made God repent that ever he made them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5), <hi>And God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> Here were wicked ſpirits, wicked ſouls: they are the principals in ſin, and they are the principals in puniſhment. The wickedneſs of their hearts. Men are condemn'd for the wickedneſs of their thoughts, as well as for the wickedneſs of their lives, The 11, 12, 13, Verſes,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43855:43"/>
               <hi>The earth alſo was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. And God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt: for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the earth. And God ſaid unto Noah, the end of all fleſh is come before me; for the earth is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with violence through them: and behold, I will deſtroy them with the earth.</hi> Here are wicked hearts, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lives; wicked thoughts, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deeds: When God does impriſon ſouls in Hell, it is for their wicked thoughts, as well as for their wicked lives; and ſome of you perhaps never take account of the wickedneſs of your thoughts; and yet God does take a a ſpecial account of your wicked thoughts. And in this ſtate of ſin they were a ſecure people, they feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; they went on in trading, and merry in their buſineſs, as the world is juſt now. As in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.38, <hi>As in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vîng
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43855:43"/>
in marriage, until the day that Noah entred into the Ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the ſon of man be.</hi> They were ſinners, wicked rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinners, and ſecure ſinners, and <hi>Noah</hi> was ſent to awaken them out of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and called them to repentance, and threatned the wrath of God upon them if they did not repent. <hi>But</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>they regarded it not</hi>; no, <hi>not to the very day that the flood came. And ſo it will be</hi> (ſays he) <hi>againſt the coming of the ſon of man.</hi> And is it not ſo now? Look about your ſtreets, in the morning there you hear the clattering of your Shop doors, and ſetting out of your wares, and buying and ſelling; and when Breakfaſt, or Dinner, or Supper comes, you ſet down, and eat and drink; you lie down and riſe again; and ſometimes you go to the Change, and buſie you are, like ſo many Ants; and here we Miniſters of the Goſpel come, like <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> we ſay, <hi>Repent, repent, for God hath
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43855:44"/>
appointed a day wherein he will judg the world for ſin, by the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Yea, that he hath a priſon to throw your ſouls in at death, where he hath dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to affright you, and chains to bind you, and fire to burn you; and you mind us no more than theſe people did in the days of <hi>Noah</hi>; no, not you: till ſickneſs comes, or the day of your death; and then you begin to bethink your ſelves, and cry, O that I had an Ark now! O that I had an intereſt in Chriſt! O that I had Grace and a title to Heaven! Now nothing but Chriſt, nothing but Grace, nothing but praying and ſending for Miniſters to come and talk with you. Here is a Cuſtomer come in, O don't talk to me now! O I muſt mind Heaven! But before that time, you are as careleſs as the old World was, until the flood came and ſwept them all away. O you poor fools! what do you do? you are buſie for time, and regardleſs for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Death is at your doors, and you know not how ſoon you may hear the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43855:44"/>
blows and clattering about your body, and your houſe fall, and your ſouls hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away; and yet do you mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but eating and drinking, buying and ſelling, and the like. What will you do? The Lord awaken you! Here you ſit and hear me, and you are ſtupified many of you, you gaze upon me, you do not know what to think of what I ſay; and thou art queſtioning whether what I ſay be true; and thou art thinking to eſcape, but aſſure thy ſelf ſinner, that as ſure as God is in Heaven, thou wilt not eſcape, if thou doſt not believe now in this thy day, when God is calling upon thee, now hear his voice; but if thou goeſt on ſecure, as the old World, ſay you had warning, and that I gave you warning this day: God knows but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeven days hence thou maiſt be in this priſon. O come to Chriſt that your debts may be diſcharged. But you go away, go to dinner, and come again, make it a hearing-buſineſs, and do no more, and think your ſelves ſecure:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43855:45"/>
This will not ſerve thy turn, poor ſinner, no, no; no, this will not do. Go into thy Cloſet and down upon thy knees, tell God what a ſinner thou art; tell him how much thou haſt provoked him, and promiſe him to obey him for the time to come; and never give him reſt till he hath given thee an intereſt in Chriſt, and an aſſurance of an Ark; and then go comfortably, man, about thy buſineſs, when thou haſt got an aſſurance of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world. <hi>Noah</hi> might go and eat, and drink comfortably, he had an Ark to go into when the flood came; ſo thou poor ſoul if thou wouldſt but repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt, thou maiſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably eat and drink, and buy and ſell as thou haſt occaſion, for thou haſt an Ark. But for thee to live in a wicked ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, and take no thought for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: what wilt thou do ſinner, when death comes and awakens thee? O that the Lord would awaken you this day! How few of you have been a hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this Ark? a making this Ark?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43855:45"/>
I tell thee, (I will be a Prophet to thee, ſinner!) thou wilt wiſh a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times that thou hadſt taken this counſel. Be wiſe now in time; thou wilt repent that thou haſt not prayed more, that thou haſt not repented more. O do it now then, for the Lords ſake; for when thou art once thrown into priſon, thou art gone for ever. It is for the diſobeying of the Goſpel; and therefore the rich man in the Goſpel cried, <hi>Father Abraham, I have brethren upon earth, O that ſome would go and tell them: no, no,</hi> ſays Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>they have Moſes and the Prophets, if they will not believe them, neither will they believe, though one go from the dead.</hi> So then the rich man is in hell; how ſo? Why I did not believe my ſin would bring me there? Why, did not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets tell thee ſo? Yes, But I did not believe; O that ſome would come from the dead! ſo ſinners, you go on in ſin, why do you ſo? Becauſe you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43855:46"/>
what will come of it. Why, did not Miniſters tell you ſo? and they are ſent of Chriſt to tell you ſo? hath not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets told you ſo? Yes, yes; But you will not believe us, nor Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, nor <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> nor the Prophets. Men will have their ſins, and they will not fear being damned; though all the whole cloud of witneſſes warn them, they regard them not. But though you will not regard them now, they will all come in as witneſſes againſt you at that day. Had not you a Bible? Yes, but I could not read. But did not you hear it read, and had it preached to you? What can you ſay? But ſay you, here's a priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſent to priſon too, for diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel; but is it juſtice for God to ſend men to priſon for not hearkning to a company of prating Preachers? Prating! God will vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate us from prating; I tell you, we come with our Commiſſion from God to you, and Chriſt ſpeaks by me, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43855:46"/>
by every Miniſter that cometh to you; and if you reject us, you reject him; if you reflect upon us for prating, you may as well ſay, it is a prating Chriſt. <hi>We beſeech you in Chriſts ſtead to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God.</hi> We come not with our own words, but the words of the Lord we bring and preach.</p>
            <p>Well, but is it juſt for God to damn me thus eternally in a priſon, becauſe I will not repent of my ſin? Yes. Why?</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe God does it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe thou deſerv'ſt it.</p>
            <p>God! why what is he? A righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, a juſt God, juſt in his nature, righteous in all his ways; and when he does pour out his plagues upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Heavens glorifie his Juſtice, and cry <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> to him. See how God is applauded in his ſevere acts of Juſtice upon men: <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.1, 3, <hi>And I ſaw another ſign in heaven, great and marvellous, ſeven Angels, having the ſeven laſt plagues, for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>And they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43855:47"/>
ſung the ſong of Moſes the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lamb, ſaying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints.</hi> Go An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, pour out the plagues full of my wrath upon yonder rebellious ſinners. And when the Angels come upon this work, <hi>Righteous, O Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty art thou, thou loving King of Saints:</hi> Thou loving King of Saints that haſt mercy for thouſands, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them that love thee: But for them that hate thee, <hi>Just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art thou, O God, in all thy ways of pouring out plagues full of thy wrath upon men.</hi> O ſinner, the Angels will ſhout up the Juſtice of God for pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the wrath of God upon you. So ſinner, do but think of it; ſuppoſe thou Drunkard wert to die to night, and to be dragged to the Tribunal of Chriſt, and to receive this ſentence, Go, get thee down to thy fellow-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners that have diſobeyed the voice
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43855:47"/>
of my Son. O poor Drunkard! for thee to hear thouſands of Angels (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently) ſhout, and ſay, Righteous and juſt art thou, O Lord God, for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Drunkard to hell. O we knew with what a hard heart he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever'd in his ſins, notwithſtanding all the calls and warnings given him by the Spirit of thee our God in thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.5, <hi>Thou art righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, O Lord, which art, and waſt, and ſhalt be, becauſe thou hast judged thus.</hi> Angels admire God for judging thus; that is, for judging the ſpirits of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to hell; and afterwards for raiſing their bodies, and uniting ſpirit and body together, and throwing down both into hell. Now,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thou haſt deſerv'd it, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; thy crime deſerves it: What is the crime? The crime is diſobedience, rebellion, ſtubborneſs, obſtinacy in ſin; men are damn'd for that. The wicked world had evil thoughts, were full of evil thoughts and imaginations conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43855:48"/>
they were full of violence, full of oppreſſion. Were they damned for that? Yes; but not only for that. What then? why it was becauſe they were told (by the Spirit of Chriſt in <hi>Noah</hi>) the wickedneſs of theſe thoughts, how they angred God, and God repented that he made them; but notwithſtanding this, they would go on; this is that which damns the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; 'tis not barely, becauſe a ſinner, but it is becauſe when he is called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (by the Miniſters of Chriſt) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he will not repent. You poor ſinners, you have lived lives without God, without Chriſt, prayerleſs lives, drunken lives, unclean lives, Sabbath-breaking lives; ſhall theſe damn me? no ſinner, if thou wilt now (while Chriſt ſpeaks by his Miniſters) hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his voice, and not harden thy heart againſt the Call of the Goſpel; theſe ſhall not damn thee, if thou wouldſt but repent and confeſs them to God, and give thy ſelf up to Chriſt,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43855:48"/>
to be ruled and governed by him: God for Chriſts ſake will then blot them all out, and they ſhall never riſe up in judgment againſt thee. What is it damns me then? why this, That thou art a Drunkard, and wilt be ſo; a Swearer, and wilt be ſo; an unclean perſon, and wilt be ſo; a prayerleſs man, (thirty or forty years) and wilt not call upon God: Thou art an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſinner, a rebellious ſinner; though Chriſt calls by one Miniſter, and another, yet thou regardeſt it not: 'tis for this that God will throw thee to hell; and how juſt a thing is it for thee to be damned for ſtubbornneſs? If a child hath committed a fault, and will be reclaim'd, the father will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him; but if he will go on ſtill in his ſtubbornneſs, the natural affections of the father will be turned to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. You ſee the Prodigal when he came home crying, <hi>I have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heaven and before thee: father let me be as one of thy hired ſervants:</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:43855:49"/>
The father meets him, falls about his neck, and kiſſes him, takes him home, and ſays, <hi>My ſon was loſt, and is found: he was dead, and is alive again; and there was joy and rejoicing.</hi> But if this ſon now after he had ſpent all, and continued with his harlots, and never had thought of returning, he might have died &amp; rotted there in that field with the ſwine. So ſinner, if thou wilt ſtill keep to thy ſwiniſh luſts, and there lie and die, and rot, and go to hell, God does not matter thee, Chriſt will not regard thee. But if it comes into thy heart, Lord I am in a ſtarving condition, here I am, a rebel, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon, a drunkard; I am a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I ſee I am undone; I come to thee, father. Go now, and he will accept of thee, and receive thee. But if thou art ſtubborn and rebellious, and wilt go on, thou maiſt expect no other, but that God will inflict upon thee, hell to thy ſoul at death, and at the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, hell to ſoul and body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:43855:49"/>But there are Aggravations of this thy ſtubbornneſs, for thou art ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Againſt the tenders of mercy that are made to thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Againſt the long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God to thee. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou art ſtubborn, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thou haſt had ſo much warning.</p>
            <p>And theſe things will juſtifie God, and lay a foundation for condemning thee in thine own Conſcience: As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Mercy, mercy! I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their iniquities; let a wicked man <hi>forſake his ſins.</hi> What then? <hi>I will have mercy upon him, and will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly pardon him.</hi> Here are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of mercy offering ſtrength to help thee to conquer thy luſts (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Prophet), <hi>O ye ſimple ones, how long will ye love ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity?</hi> Are you blind? I will teach you. Are you weak? I will ſtrengthen you. How wilt thou do it? <hi>I will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43855:50"/>
pour out my Spirit upon thee.</hi> Haſt thou a mind to have Grace? He will give it thee. Haſt thou a mind to have the Spirit of Grace and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? He will beſtow it upon thee. But for thee to go on in ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject pardon when offered: What canſt thou ſay for thy ſelf?</p>
            <p>Again, Theſe tenders of mercy are made with <hi>long-ſuffering.</hi> There are a great many ſinners (I am afraid ſome here are not yet Converted), who all for a long time have heard Sermons: God hath been calling upon you. As God ſaid of the old world: <hi>Here is a wicked people,</hi> What ſhall I do with them? What? Why Juſtice might have ſaid, deſtroy them. No, ſaith God, they are a raſh giddy-headed-people, I will give them warning. How long? Why almoſt one hundred and twenty years. So ſinner, God ſaw thee Drunk, heard thee Swear: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice might have ſaid, cut him off: No, ſaith God, I will try him with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43855:50"/>
month of Sermons, another year of Sermons; I will try what my Children, that are his Friends, will ſay to him. O ſinner! <hi>The long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God waiteth upon thee.</hi> Grace cries, repent, and I will pardon thee: Repent, and I will give thee my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: though thou art a wicked Rebel, I will not ſnatch thee away; I will let thee live five years longer, ten years longer: O, if thou goeſt to Hell, what will Conſcience ſay? O thou art a ſtubborn ſinner. Thou muſt ſay, <hi>Righteous art thou, O God, in all thy ways, and juſt in all thy judgments.</hi> I might have been in Heaven, but I would not; and now I am in Hell, and that juſtly; becauſe I preferred my luſts before God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Never ſay, 'tis an unjuſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; becauſe God gives you warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: There is the merit of the cauſe. If nothing will do, Why then take notice God gives you warning. He does not let you go on, and ſay, let
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43855:51"/>
them alone, I will be even with them at length: He might have done ſo: No, but in pity to poor ſinners, he gives them warning. Sinner, repent, ſaith God, and be reconcil'd to me; come and lay hold upon Chriſt, for elſe I will damn thee. Take notice of it, there is a <hi>Tophet prepared,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting burnings prepared,</hi> a <hi>worm that never dieth</hi>: and I tell thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand what it will coſt thee, and yet ſinners will go on ſtill. Never complain that God hath done thee wrong, he hath offered to give thee his Spirit to ſanctifie thee, and ſave thee. But if thou wilt not, after all, thank thy ſelf if thou goeſt to Hell. O ſinners, What will you do? Will you imitate the old world, or imitate <hi>Noah</hi>? Why, if you imitate the old world, you ſee then what a deſperate courſe you are running; you are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your bodies to the Grave, and your ſouls to Hell: For when the flood came there was not one ſpared:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43855:51"/>
The flood takes whole Families; they look gaſtly one at another: Father, what ſhall I do (ſaith the child)? And when the world was full of cries and ſcrieks, and they all drowned, one would have thought this was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yet God had no pity upon them; for as ſoon as they were dead, their diſobedient ſouls were laid in Priſon.</p>
            <p>Well now, ſay you, What ſhall we do? Why, obey the Goſpel, This is your Duty. Obey Chriſt Jeſus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Spirit in Us, poor men, that are the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt; for we are but as inſtruments to convey the mind of the great God to you; for certainly, what I have Preached to you, is no other than the word of Jeſus Chriſt, and he will make it good. O get into ſome corner, and cry mightily to the Lord, and pray Chriſt to pay all your debts for you; and that the blood of Chriſt might take away all your iniquities, and that you
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43855:52"/>
might have an Ark to ſave you from the fire that will burn the world; as <hi>Noah</hi> had an Ark to ſave him and his houſe from the flood that did drown the world; and then you are ſafe, and never ſafe till then. The Lord awaken you, that you may take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not go away and mind no more what you have heard, than they did, and ſo be loſt as they were.</p>

            <p>IN the former words you have an account given you of the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the old world by the flood. They were all drowned, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children. God neither ſpared the grey-headed-ſinner; no, nor the ſucking-infant; children of wicked and Rebellious Parents, he drowned them all. The reaſon of this wrath of God that was poured out upon them, was their Diſobedience; their <hi>diſobedience to the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> by which <hi>Noah</hi> Preached to them. What did he Preach? He Preached to them Repentance, called them to repent and reform their lives; and if they would not, God would
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43855:53"/>
drown them all. Why what were their ſins? Why, the very <hi>thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their hearts were evil, and that continually.</hi> They were men of wicked hearts, they were deviſing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but miſchief, they thought of nothing but the ſatisfaction of their luſts. I wiſh it be not the caſe of ſome here. I am ſure it is the caſe of every unconverted ſinner, the imaginations of his heart are evil, and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; for he does defile even his good thoughts with unbelief.</p>
            <p>And their ſin was likewiſe the ſin of their lives. Their hands were full of violence, they were oppreſſors, they were cruel, they were bloody; and beſides this, they were ſecure and wanton, and they minded nothing but eating and drinking, and marrying, and giving to marriage, their whole hearts were taken up in theſe things. No man enquired after God, no man regarded the voice of God in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Noah.</hi> God waited upon them,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43855:53"/>
(after he had ſent <hi>Noah,</hi> and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd them) above a hundred years; (and that while, was <hi>Noah</hi> a building his Ark), but they <hi>deſpiſed the long-ſuffering of God, which ſhould have led them to repentance:</hi> and at length the threatned Judgment came upon them, and they were drowned, all, but <hi>eight perſons.</hi> This is not all, God did not only deſtroy their bodies, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (we read here in the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) their <hi>Spirits were laid in priſon,</hi> in the infernal Priſon of Hell for their <hi>diſobedience to the voice of Chriſt.</hi> Having already ſpoken to this; The Doctrine that I raiſed from this was, <hi>That thoſe wicked men (while they are in their bodies) that will not obey the voice of Chriſt in his Miniſters, but live and die impenitently, their ſouls by the righteous judgment of God ſhall be condemned unto the priſon of Hell</hi>: For what is ſaid of this old world, will be verified of every impenitent ſinner here, that dieth in his impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43855:54"/>
ſtate; Lord, who is it that does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thy report? Few ſinners (the Lord knows) do regard it. God knows his word is little believed. We do as little believe theſe things now, as the old world did: and as the flood came upon them before they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, ſo the ſpirits of ſome here (God knows, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaid, <hi>I do not deſire to ſee that evil day</hi>) may be in theſe Priſons before they believe them. Death (ſinners) is coming, which will drag you to the Tribunal of Chriſt; and aſſuredly Chriſt will do you juſtice: I ſay, he will do you ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. He that will be faithful to his promiſes that he makes to <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> that obey the Goſpel, he will be faithful to do juſtice to thoſe that are <hi>diſobedient.</hi> He will give you all your Mittimus's, he will lay you faſt enough; and when he hath laid the Chains on, take them off if you can. I know (through your unbelief) what I ſay, ſeems to you but as a Fable:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43855:54"/>
So did the drowning of the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be; but they found it true, and ſo will you, if ye repent not. It amazeth me, my Brethren (when my faith at any time is but raiſed to the cloſe of theſe truths of God; it ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth me) to look upon your faces, to ſee how indifferently you look, how careleſly you look; you look up-and-down this place as if theſe things did not concern you: but the reaſon of it is, you do not believe, your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief ruins you, and will ruin you for ever. What man that really was in his wits, and did believe a Hell, would venture upon thoſe ſins that will certainly bring him thither? But you ſlatter your ſelves in your unbelief, that there is no <hi>puniſhment</hi> to the wicked, nor <hi>reward</hi> to the godly; and ſo you go on in ſin: Theſe things are true (my Brethren), your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences muſt bear me witneſs they are true. No man or woman that are in their wits, and did really believe an
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43855:55"/>
eternal Torment that is laid up for the diſobedient to the Goſpel, but they would obey be-times, they would not go on hardening their hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: but you do not believe. We ſhall preſently make ſome enquiry into the reaſons of it.</p>
            <p>We come now to the other part, wherein you have an account of a <hi>few that are ſaved.</hi> A few! Lord, What a few! <hi>Eight perſons</hi> out of a world of men and women. I do not know but the world at that time was as full of men and women as it is now; for the world was at that time about Fifteen hundred years old, and they lived many years: ſo that it is likely that there was a very numerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of people; and that there were great Cities, and great Kingdoms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. What a ſtrange thing is it, that of a world of people there ſhould be found but <hi>eight perſons</hi> that would believe a God! And yet 'tis certainly ſo, there was but <hi>eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43855:55"/>
ſaved</hi>; all the reſt were drowned for their diſobedience to the voice of the Spirit of Chriſt in <hi>Noah.</hi> Why were no more <hi>ſaved</hi>? Becauſe there did no more believe. They did not believe that God was in good-earneſt, they did not believe that God would ſend the flood, as <hi>Noah</hi> threatned: they looked upon <hi>Noah</hi> as a mad-man to build an Ark they knew not for what. Juſt ſo does the world now, they look upon poor, humble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Chriſtians, as a company of melancholy diſtracted perſons, that look ſadly, and pray much, and weep much, and hear much, and are afraid of ſinning; and all this while they are but buſie about their Ark: and they cry, what a ſtir is here that theſe people make? I will tell you what the meaning of it is: why this world is to be burned, and theſe poor ſouls are providing againſt the burning of the world: <hi>The wicked muſt be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Hell, and all the Nations that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43855:56"/>
forget God</hi>; and theſe poor, praying, humble Chriſtians do believe, fear, and tremble; and that is the reaſon that they live not as you live, but take that care that they do, to prepare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that great day of the Lord. And were not you deſperately blind and fooliſh, you would do ſo too? There were <hi>eight perſons</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>ſaved.</hi> Which were they? All of one Family, <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi>; there was the three Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and their three Wives, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.7, eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in one family, they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they were ſaved from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, they were ſaved from being drowned. God knows whether all theſe were ſaved from hell (too) of theſe eight. For of theſe, <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> there was (one of theſe Sons) <hi>Ham,</hi> that did laugh at his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nakedneſs, and God afterwards curſed him; ſo that whether he was eternally ſaved, is not a thing certain unto us. But this is ſure, all theſe eight
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43855:56"/>
perſons did believe the deluge would come, or elſe they would not have entred into the Ark, for if any of them had looked upon it as a meer old do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fancy of their father, they would have been aſhamed to have gone into the Ark; but at the ſet-time before it began to rain, they all went, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they all did believe the word of the Lord, that the deluge would come. It's true they received an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the miraculous bringing of all creatures into the Ark to ſave them alive. <hi>Wherein few, eight perſons were ſaved by water.</hi> Saved by water! there may be a double ſenſe:</p>
            <p>By water as an inſtrument; for that very water that was the inſtrument of deſtruction to the enemies of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a means of ſalvation to theſe eight perſons; for it bore up that Ark wherein the lives of theſe eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were. It may be rendered,</p>
            <p>Thus again, But they were ſaved by, or through water, ſaved through the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43855:57"/>
danger of water, carried in the Ark through, or upon the water.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation that I raiſe from it, is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That though many have the means of Salvation offered them, yet there are but few that make uſe of theſe means, and do obtain Salvation by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old World had the means, as thoſe eight perſons had the ſame means; they were told of it, they were a hundred years told of it, God waited long enough; there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had the means; if they had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the flood had not come; or if more had repented, they had been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But theſe eight did believe, and they were ſaved by water, the reſt had as good means as they, but they did not repent upon it, they did not believe upon it.</p>
            <p>This ſhould be an awakening Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to us, that though God does afford the means of Salvation to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43855:57"/>
yet there are a very few that do make uſe of thoſe means, and are ſaved by them: I ſay 'tis an awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſideration. Here is <hi>England,</hi> a great and populous Country, here is <hi>London</hi> a great City, a City that hath ſome hundred thouſands of ſouls in it, they have all the means as the old World had; the Goſpel is preached up and down the City, and up and down the Suburbs; the voice is every where, throughout all your ſtreets. <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand</hi>; repent, for there is a day of judgment, and Chriſt is made the Judg of quick and dead, that will give to every man according to his works. You have all the means, but alas, how few of <hi>England,</hi> how few of <hi>London,</hi> or of <hi>Southwark</hi> are like to be ſaved by theſe means! for how few do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what we preach? How few do repent upon their ſeeming profeſſion of repentance, and believing? How few reform their lives? how few are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43855:58"/>
converted in <hi>Southwark,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſo as to be healed by the grace of God! How few! <hi>Many are called</hi> (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>but few choſen.</hi> Why here is perhaps three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred people here, you have been call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one of you to repent, but when God that ſearcheth the heart, cometh for to examine the truth of our repentance, and of our faith, how few, how few in likelihood will there be found penitent? how few! alas, it was always ſo: Many called, a whole world called to repent, but eight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. But perhaps you will ſay, that was an notorious wicked world, that old world; but ſurely the world is grown better ſince. Truly, there is reaſon it ſhould, becauſe they have that judgment to awaken them; but we will ſhow you that the hearts of men have been deſperately wicked, all along to this day; yea, under the richeſt means that ever God hath afforded the world, from the beginning to this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43855:58"/>
very day. And we will take the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and give you ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof: God promiſed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that he would give him a ſeed that ſhould be as the ſtars of heaven, and would take that ſeed into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with himſelf, and that he would be their God, and they ſhould be his people. What a wonderful bleſſing was this, for the great God to marry himſelf to a people? And he gave them the Covenant of Circumciſion for a memorial of this Covenant, of this betrothing; he gave them the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and the Promiſes, and was with them, in the midſt of them; he was the King of them, he made War and Peace for them, fought for them, and defended them. They had all the means of Salvation, the beſt means that the world had in thoſe days. But you will ſee how few of them made uſe of thoſe means of grace that God afforded them.</p>
            <p>We will begin with this great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43855:59"/>
of <hi>Jacob</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> (The Lord help you to conſider what I am ſpeaking; for many, becauſe they are Chriſtians, and are baptized, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſhall be ſaved; but you are deceived. Juſt like the old World, they eat, and they drank, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and gave in marriage, and never dreamt that God was angry with them, and would drown them; and ſo do theſe people of <hi>England,</hi> never think that God does intend to burn them.) Now you ſhall ſee what advantage they made of the means, and you may read as in a glaſs the condition of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the moſt parts of the world at this day, <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.45, 46, <hi>So were all thoſe that were numbred of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the houſe of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Iſrael: Even all they that were numbred were ſix hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and three thouſand five hundred and fifty.</hi> Theſe were the people that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43855:59"/>
God brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Wilderneſs, and afterwards led to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand, all men, from twenty years old and upward: How vaſt muſt be the number of Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and young men alſo, that were below twenty years old! above ſix hundred thouſand fighting men! An Army of twenty thouſand is a great Army; but a hundred thouſand, that is much more: But here was an Army of ſix hundred thouſand fighting men, beſides Women and Children. What had God done for this people? I will tell you what God had done for them: why, they were in <hi>Egypt</hi> under a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el hard-hearted <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they were groaning under their burden, and God remembers his Promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, That he would viſit his ſeed, and bring them into Canaan.</hi> God cometh by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and commanded them to go; <hi>They are my people ſaith God, let them go and ſerve me. I will not let
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43855:60"/>
them go, ſaith Pharaoh; why who is your God, that I ſhould obey him</hi>? God at length ſends one plague upon him, and then another; and then another, and then a fourth, a fifth, a ſixth, a ſeventh, an eighth, a ninth, a tenth; ten Plagues God ſent upon him before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would let them go. When they were gone, they came to a Red Sea, (I am telling you, my Brethren, the works of God for his people in the days of old, remember them, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they are written for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, they came to a Red Sea) now thinks <hi>Pharaoh</hi> I have got them in a trap, I will follow them, I will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, I will overtake, I will deſtroy them; but God makes the Red-Sea divide, and bringeth them all through; but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt aſſayed to follow, and God makes the Sea to cloſe and drowned them all. Well, God car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them from thence to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and there was thundrings and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and gave them his Law, and his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43855:60"/>
Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and did as it were ſolemnly marry that people to himſelf, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiing them if they did but do what he bid them, he would be their God, and fight their battels, and give them counſel in all their ſtraits, and be a defence round about them. Away he leads them then, and gives them a Symbol of himſelf; for if they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by night, there was a pillar of Fire; if by day, there was a Cloud went with them. A wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, that God ſhould do ſo with them! They come into a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, they want bread, they begin to murmur; Well, ſaith God, they ſhall ſee what it is to be my people; he gives them bread from Heaven, rains down Manna: They want wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Well, ſaith God, they ſhall not want water; he commandeth <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſtrike a Rock, and there came ſtreams out of it, and thoſe ſtreams followed them where ever they went up and down the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43855:61"/>
they wanted Water no more. What now became of this People? Here is a good God, he lets them want nothing; he works wonders for them, and delivers them with a mighty hand, and gives them Angels food to eat, and water out of a Rock to drink; and here he numbreth them in the Wilderneſs, Six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men. What did theſe people do? Do! Surely they loved God, and were obedient to his Law, and would never murmur againſt him more. But did they do ſo? No, you ſhall ſee how that before Forty years came about, God cut off all theſe Six hundred thouſand men, and left their carcaſes to rot in the Wilderneſs, and <hi>ſwore in his wrath, they ſhould never enter into his reſt.</hi> Notwithſtanding he had done all this for them, they ſo provoked him to wrath, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed all the means of mercy, that God cut them all off: See alſo, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.28, 29, 30, <hi>Say unto them</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:43855:61"/>
(ſaith God), <hi>As truly as I live, ſaith the Lord, as ye have ſpoken in mine ears, ſo will I do to you.</hi> What had they ſaid in his ears? They had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt God, and ſaid, <hi>God hath brought us and our children into the wilderneſs to deſtroy us.</hi> Well, ſaith he, <hi>I have heard your murmuring, and for your murmuring againſt me, your carcaſes ſhall fall in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and all that were numbred of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which you have murmured againſt me. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ye ſhall not come into the Land concerning which I ſware to poſſeſs you of, ſave</hi> Caleb <hi>the ſon of</hi> Jephu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neh, <hi>and</hi> Joſhuah <hi>the ſon of</hi> Nun. There were ſix hundred thouſand men, and amongſt them there was but two men that did believe that Promiſe that God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would give them <hi>Canaan</hi> for an Inheritance. O read to day as in a glaſs here, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of <hi>England,</hi> and the World;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43855:62"/>
for as face anſwers to face in a glaſs, ſo does the face of the generality of the men of the world, anſwer to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the unbelieving <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and old unbelieving World. But ſaith he, <hi>For your little ones, which ye ſay ſhall be a prey; No,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>your little ones ſhall go into the Land, and ſhall poſſeſs it; for they knew nothing of your murmuring. But as for you, there is not a man of you ſhall enter into the Land.</hi> Well, go a little farther, (for the inſtances are many,) I will paſs by all the dealings of God with this very people under the Judges, where you may read that they were as many times captivated (for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God) as they had a Judg raiſed up among them; but we will paſs by the time of this people under thoſe Judges (becauſe the time will be ſhort for me to relate all the dealings of Chriſt with this Church) and we will come to thoſe Twelve Tribes, after they came into
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43855:62"/>
               <hi>Canaan,</hi> and were divided into two great Kingdoms, Ten Tribes under <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and Two Tribes under the Poſterity of <hi>David,</hi> two mighty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; all of them that had, or might have had the Oracles, Promiſes, and Covenants, all of them had the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and might have uſed it. But what did they do with it? They cri'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up, (juſt like <hi>England</hi>) The Church, the Church; <hi>The Temple of the Lord</hi>; and boaſted of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that there was no people in the world like them; and that if God ſhould cut them off, he knew not where to find another people. See now what became of them; We will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Ten Tribes firſt. In the firſt of <hi>Kings,</hi> the 19, and the 11 and 14 <hi>Verſes. And it was ſo, that when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and went out, and ſtood in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in of the Cave; and behold, there came a voice unto him, and ſaid, What doſt thou here, Elijah? And he ſaid,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:43855:63"/>
(Elijah ſaid) <hi>I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hoſts; becauſe the children of Iſrael have forſaken thy Covenant, thrown down thine Altars, and ſlain thy Prophets with the ſword, and I, even I only am left, and they ſeek my life to take it away.</hi> Here were Ten Tribes, a great Kingdom, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, that had the word of the Lord, and the great Prophet of the Lord <hi>Elijah</hi> among them, who called them to Repentance, and told them God was angry with them for forſaking Him, and his Covenant. Why, but how many of this Kingdom did ſo? Why truly, for what <hi>Elijah</hi> could ſee, he could not ſee one man, that did keep Covenant with God. <hi>I only am left alone.</hi> Why what did the reſt do? Why they have all forſaken thee. This is ſtrange! What! the ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> all gone! What they, whoſe fathers God delivered out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; and brought them through the Red-Sea, and fed them with Manna, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43855:63"/>
gave them water out of a Rock! What, forget it all! Ai, forget it all. They have left the Lord, and forſaken his Covenant. What have they done with the Prophets of the Lord? Knockt them o' the head, ſlain them, kill'd them, thrown down his Altars, and no worſhipping of God; and yet theſe were the men that were the ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> that had all the means of grace offered them; God had given them many a call, they had the word to do it, and his Prophets to do it, and yet we ſee they all left him. It is true (as God ſaid afterwards in reproving <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi> judgment in the caſe, I have a few more, my Kingdom are not all gone) ſaith God, <hi>I have reſerved ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, that keep Covenant with me.</hi> Ai, but (my Brethren) what are ſeven thouſand to a whole Kingdom? What if God may have ſeven thouſand in <hi>England</hi> to keep Covenant with God? What if twenty thouſand? What are they to compare to thoſe many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43855:64"/>
thouſands that are in <hi>England?</hi> Here you ſee many are called, but few choſen; many are taken viſibly into a Covenant, but there are few that are ſpiritually in Covenant with God. Well, what became of theſe Ten Tribes? theſe that had the Oracles, Covenant, and Promiſes among them? What became of them? Why you ſhall ſee what became of them, (no good, you may be ſure, God pays them off their old ſcores at length) God is a long time in reckoning, but be ſure he will do them juſtice in the end. He will do it, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.18, there you ſhall ſee the deſtruction of them (In the 15 <hi>verſ. And they rejected his ſtatutes, and his covenants that he made with their fathers—and they followed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>) <hi>Therefore</hi> (Verſ. 18.) <hi>the Lord was very angry with Iſrael, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them out of his ſight: there was none left but the Tribe of Judah only.</hi> 22. <hi>For the children of Iſrael walked in the ſins of Jeroboam which he did,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43855:64"/>
they departed not from them.</hi> 23, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Lord removed Iſrael out of his ſight as he ſaid by all his ſervants the Prophets.</hi> (The word of God ſpoken by his ſervants and Miniſters, (though but men) he will make it good; here you have Miniſter after Miniſter come to you; and believe it, when we ſpeak his word in his name, he will take care of our honour, and of our word; he made good the preachings of his ſervants the Prophets.) <hi>So was Iſrael carried away out of their own land to Aſſyria unto this day.</hi> There came the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> upon them, and took them away, and ſpoiled them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them away captive, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returned more into the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> to this day. O wicked people! They had the means of grace, but would not make uſe of them. You are told of Heaven and Hell, and bid to repent, but no body repents; here you give us the hearing, and when you have done, you go away; and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43855:65"/>
when gone, you paſs on in a carnal manner, and there is no reformation of your lives.</p>
            <p>But (pray) what became of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tribes that were under the tuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and government of the Poſterity of <hi>David?</hi> Why the truth is, they were ſometimes better than the other. But ſee alſo what became of them for their revolts, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. But what did they do? (theſe were the two tribes) <hi>They mocked the meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord aroſe upon them, till there was no remedy.</hi> 17, <hi>Therefore he brought upon them the King of Chaldees, who ſlew their young men with the ſword, in the houſe of their ſanctuary, and had no compaſſion upon young man or mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, old man, or him that ſtooped for age; he gave them all into his hand.</hi> And this was all for their general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt that they made from God. Follow it (now) to the time of Chriſt; when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43855:65"/>
Chriſt Jeſus came into the world, and preached the Goſpel himſelf, one would have thought now, that though they had abuſed all his Prophets of old, yet now his Son himſelf is come, ſure they would hearken to him. When Chriſt himſelf turns Preacher, and works ſuch Miracles among them to confirm his Doctrine, and to evidence himſelf to be ſent from God, and all this to bring them to Heaven: When Chriſt came to preach the Goſpel, did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him? No, he lifted them up to Heaven by means; he would as it were have drag'd them by force, he lifted up voice and cried, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come unto me, and drink of the water of life freely.</hi> He cried and wept over them, <hi>O that ſhe had known the things of her peace!</hi> (Mighty ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt!) <hi>I would have gathered her, but ſhe would not.</hi> And did they believe? No. Why, what do they do? They conſpire together, and lay hold of him as a malefactor, and crucified him; they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43855:66"/>
put him to death: &amp; as being very well ſatisfied, when that innocent blood was ſhed, O ſay they, <hi>Let his blood come upon us and our children</hi>: we are not afraid of his blood. Of all that people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> there was but a few that did believe in him: And that the Apoſtle takes notice of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5, <hi>I ſay then,</hi> Ver. 1, <hi>Hath God caſt off his people? God forbid. For I am an Iſraelite</hi>: God hath not caſt away all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not every individual: <hi>For I am of the Tribe of Benjamin: And through Gods mercy, I am not caſt away</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>for I do believe in Christ, and there are ſome few with me that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo.</hi> But what became of the whole Nation? They are cut off, the curſe of God is upon them, and they are a hiſſing and diſgrace to this very day. I tell you, Sirs, of theſe poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible <hi>Jews</hi>; God offered them a Chriſt before he offered him to you: Chriſt came of the Loyns of a <hi>Jew,</hi> he was born (after the fleſh) of a <hi>Jew,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:43855:66"/>
he was firſt ſent to the <hi>Jews</hi>; and offered grace firſt to the <hi>Jews</hi>; and you came in but in the ſecond place. But for their Infidelity, God hath cut them off, only a remnant, a little ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering flock, they hearkned, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, they embraced Chriſt, and they were ſaved, and the reſt were cut off. Here are a great many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <hi>That many are called, but few choſen.</hi> Here is a great deal of Preaching to <hi>England,</hi> but few of <hi>England</hi> like to be ſaved: Don't think it a hard cenſure. What a whole world drowned, and but <hi>eight ſaved</hi>? What a whole Kingdom of <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> and but ſeven thouſand <hi>ſaved</hi>? What, that great Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> cut off, and but a few of them <hi>ſaved</hi>? There were (it is true) a good ſeed in that Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> but take the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them, they did provoke God as much as her Siſter <hi>Samaria</hi> did. Well, But what ſhall we ſay of our ſelves? Look in the glaſs of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43855:67"/>
Church, and then tell me, how many among us are like to be <hi>ſaved</hi>? 2 Cor. 6.10, <hi>Know ye not,</hi> (Ver. 9,) <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God?</hi> (and if they do not, they ſhall never be ſaved; for none are ſaved, but they inherit the Kingdom of God) Who are they? Why God knows, ſome of you may read your own Names here in your Character. <hi>Be not deceived, neither fornicators, or unclean perſons</hi>: you know what it means: If there be any wanton perſons here, the Lord give you Repentance. Such as you are for the flood, and for the fire, and for Hell. God hath ſet you a-part. The Lord give you Repentance. No <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,</hi> no Image-worſhipper, no Hoſt-worſhipper; ſuch as thoſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> Idolater, worſhipping Saints and Angels, and praying to a peice of bread, as unto God himſelf. Theſe are Idolaters. God will not give his honour to any other. And <hi>Papiſts</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43855:67"/>
will know in the end, that they have wronged God, to give his honour to a peice of bread. God will not be wronged of his Glory. Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, many Idolaters have been apt to flatter themſelves, that it ſhall go well with them; but they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived themſelves, and ſo will theſe in the end. No <hi>Adulterers,</hi> the Lord help you to look into your hearts and lives: There is an Adulterous heart, and an Adulterous life: none ſuch ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God. Theſe are all for the flood, theſe are ſet a-part for burning: aſſuredly, you ſhall be burned, if you repent not. Believe it, it will be ſo, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not; you may laugh and mock at me, and <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Bible,</hi> as the old world did at <hi>Noah.</hi> Nor <hi>effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, not abuſers of themſelves with mankind.</hi> No <hi>Thieves</hi>: that is, that repent not in their time. No <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards</hi>; mark, that you Ale-houſe-haunters, and Tavern-haunters! None
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43855:68"/>
of theſe, not a man of them ſhall be ſaved, except, in time they repent and reform their lives. Say you ſo? None of them? No, none of them ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God. Ah, but (by your leave) we won't believe you tho. I know there are but few will believe it. I knew it before I came to you before I read this Text, <hi>Lord who hath believed our report</hi>! I have been a Preacher (up and down) two and twenty years, and have had experience of the hardneſs of mens hearts. I can Preach to them, and take them in a room, and ſit an hour over a hard heart, and make it no more ſtir, than a rock: No, he does not believe, turns away, and laughs at (perhaps) all the counſel given him. But whether you believe, or believe not, This day know, God hath given you warning; you are men as certainly ſet aſide, and deſigned to be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burned, as the old wicked world was deſigned to be drowned. And
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43855:68"/>
if you ſay why do I give you this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? Why, The Lord in mercy gives it you, that in time you may repent. But if you repent not; as the flood drowned the old world, ſo Hell will burn and torment you.</p>
            <p>But truly I have not come to the half of that which I intended.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion will be, What is the reaſon that men will not believe? What, but eight perſons believe, in a whole world? But one <hi>Elijah</hi> in a whole Ten Tribes? What, but one <hi>Elijah</hi>? No truly, for ought that he knew. What, but a remnant in the time of Chriſt? No, but a remnant. So but a few, a very few in <hi>England.</hi> What is the reaſon of all this? why the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon of it all, is this: Neither would the old world believe, that God was in good earneſt; neither would <hi>Iſrael</hi> believe, neither will <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> believe; they don't believe what is ſaid. No. What if God ſpeaks by a <hi>Noah,</hi> will you believe? No. What
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43855:69"/>
if God ſpeaks by a <hi>Moſes,</hi> will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? No. VVhat if God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon a Mount, and ſpeaks ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, will you believe now? Yes, for a little while, but not long, as they did not. VVill you believe by a Chriſt? No. (Crucifie him.) Will you believe the Apoſtles? No. Will you believe us that ſpeak? No, No, you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve none? What is the reaſon of it, why wont you believe? VVhy, I think this is one reaſon:</p>
            <p>In very truth, ſaith the poor carnal wicked world, we do not believe that God is in good earneſt; none of them did, till they found the judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. But why, you poor ſinners, why do not you believe that God is in good earneſt now? VVhy I will tell you, you flatter your ſelves thus; ſurely God is a very good God, and he hath done us good all our days; he hath been my God twenty, thirty, forty years; he hath fed me when hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; and when naked he hath clothed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43855:69"/>
me; and when ſick, he hath healed me and mine; and when in danger he hath deliver'd; and do you think that God will damn me, and burn me (as you talk of) at laſt? Ai, but ſinner! hath not God ſaid he will? Ai, but ſay you, God is not in good earneſt; he threatens us, but as we threaten our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. We threaten our Children ſometimes what we will do! and then lay down the rod again. Ai, but ſinner! God is not like a man, that he ſhould change. But ſay you, he is good. 'Tis true, or elſe he would never have ſtayed ſo long; but for you to ſay he is good, and will not therefore be true to his Word, that's abſurd. Why ſhould he not (notwithſtanding all his goodneſs) damn ſuch a rebel as thou art, as well as damn an Angel? Thou art his Creature? ſo were the Angels. Does God give thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43855:70"/>
of the glory of the earth? ſo God gave him abundance of the glory of Heaven, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, for ſin he threw the Angels down into Hell, and now they are Devils.</p>
            <p>Why, if God ſpared not an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, doſt thou think he will ſpare a man or woman? Nay, when thou haſt provoked him to wrath more than the Devil, doſt thou think he will ſpare thee, and not an Angel? God never offered a Saviour to the Devil, but he offered a Saviour to thee, that if thou wilt repent and turn, he will ſave thee: and wilt thou abuſe all, and go on in thy wickedneſs? Why certainly, as thou ſinneſt more in this reſpect than the Devil, thou wilt as ſure go to hell as he did; 'tis not your relation to God as Creatures, that will ſave you. What, (I pray) was the old World? Did not God drown them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43855:70"/>
all? were not they men and women as you? and had not they Children as well as you? and had not God bowels to them, as well as to you? But was God loth to drown them? Why, firſt, it repenteth me, ſaith God, that I made them, I will drown them all; Tuſh, ſay they, God is ſo good he will not. But I will, ſays God. You ſay God hath done you good, and heal'd you of many diſeaſes, and hath looked to you, and bleſſed you, and hath wrought wonders for you, and that therefore he will never damn you. O poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! how ſimply doſt thou cheat thy ſelf? Single me out any blind Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or unclean perſon, or ſelf-juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary, I would ſingle thee out, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with thee this day; God hath wrought wonders for me, he will not damn me (ſaiſt thou). Alas! that's true, ſays a poor drunken Water-man, I was at Sea, and was in danger to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43855:71"/>
drown'd, and God ſaved me; and do you think that he will damn me! And ſaith another, ſuch a time I was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall off from a houſe, and God prevented me. Why I tell thee now, that though God does give many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mercies and tokens of his long ſuffering to ſinners, he does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend therefore to ſave them. When God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did God ever work ſuch Miracles for you, as he did for them? Did God ever bring ten Plagues upon your enemies to deliver you from them? Did God ever in a danger that you have been in, make a Sea for you to paſs through, and your life ſaved? And when you were hungry, and had no bread, did God ever rain bread down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you? When you were thirſty, did God ever bring water out of a Rock to quench your thirſt? Theſe, and ſuch things as theſe did God do for <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Here now was ſome ground
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43855:71"/>
for them to plead, and yet though God did this; did he love <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo, that he would not deſtroy them? No. <hi>He laid their Carcaſes as dung in the wilderneſs, and ſwore in his wrath that they ſhould never enter into his reſt.</hi> I'le tell thee ſinner, if thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt for forty years together upon bread out of the Clouds, yet if thou liveſt and dieſt in thy ſins, thou wilt moſt certainly be damned. God can be good, (man!) for all thou art damned; for God is good to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that ſtand, though the reſt that fell are in Hell; ſo he will be good in his mercy to Saints and Angels, when the wicked are thruſt down into Hell. God can be good, (man!) and God can do thee good, and when he hath done, he can hang thee up in flames. Alas, you ſee that commonly among your malefactors, Princes do allow their priſoners to have meat and drink, while they are in priſon, they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43855:72"/>
ſhould not be ſtarved; and when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be hanged, there will be care taken, that they ſhould be fed and clothed; but when the day comes, away they are bound, and to the cart and gallows they go. Thou priſoner! (for ſo thou art in the decree of God) before thou come to that priſon of hell, he will feed thee, and clothe thee, and yet all this while intends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee, if thou repent not.</p>
            <p>Ai, but ſay you, there is another reaſon of our unbelief: why truly, God hath threatned ſuch great things that they are incredible. VVhy, what are they? God threatens priſons for Spirits; Alas, we can't underſtand how this ſpirit ſhould live after our bodies are dead, that when our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are rotting in the grave, our ſouls ſhould be roaring in flames. And then again God tells us of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our bodies; How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould be ſo? And then again,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43855:72"/>
God threatens to throw our bodies and ſouls into Hell, to be burned for ever; an incredible thing! who can believe this, when we can hardly live fifty or threeſcore years, How can we be alive for ever and ever? And that Chriſt ſhould judg the world; it is now ſixteen hundred years ago; wonderful things! Here has been a great deal of talking, but no perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. A company of fables! we can't believe them; and who would go and venture to make themſelves ſad and miſerable in the world, with fear and repentance; with fear of theſe things that are never like to come to paſs. I know it, ſinners, that theſe are the workings of thy heart, as well as if I was within thee. VVhy, do you think there are any ſuch here, that are of ſuch a mind? why truly, it is likely, for there were ſuch in the Apoſtles days, and of this ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Apoſtle ſpeaks in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2, <hi>That in the latter days there ſhould
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43855:73"/>
come ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts:</hi> one after the luſt of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, another after the luſt of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: VVhat are theſe walkers? Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. VVhat do they ſcoff at? why they ſcoffed at the burning of the world, and the day of Judgment. VVhy do theſe men ſcoff at it? why, I will tell you; they ſcoff becauſe the Scripture does threaten the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal burning of theſe ſort of men that walk after their own luſts, and they cry, Tuſh, we believe no ſuch thing. VVell, and thus they argue, ſaying, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He would come, and he would come quickly.</hi> Here is a talk of his coming, but here is no Chriſt come; when will this Trumpet ſound? No, no, <hi>for ſince the fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the Creation:</hi> The Sun riſes as it did, and the Moon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves its courſe, we have Summer
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43855:73"/>
and VVinter, and we ſee all things juſt as they have been for theſe five thouſand years, and we ſee no change. No? (ſaith the Apoſtle) don't you? <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if you are ignorant of this one thing; you are wilfully igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:</hi> VVhat is that? why ſaith he, <hi>That by the Word of God, the heavens were of old, and the earth ſtanding out of the water and in the water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the world that then was, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with water, periſhed. But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the ſame word are kept in ſtore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved unto fire againſt the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.</hi> I'le tell thee, thou ſcoffer, and walker after thy luſts, Doſt thou not know that God once drowned the world? if thou art ignorant, 'tis a wilful ignorance. And I pray you ſcoffers, is it not as eaſie a thing to conceive how God ſhould burn the world, as drown the world? he hath
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43855:74"/>
done one already; the Lord open your ears and hearts to underſtand it. You ſcoff now, as the old world ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at <hi>Noah</hi>; but they found that <hi>Noah</hi>'s words were true; and you will find that our words are true too. The Lord ſtrike you with the authority of the VVord, that you may receive it as the Oracle of God. This is the VVord of God, and do you oppoſe it, and rebel againſt it, and ſlight it if you dare. But I know you have that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to do it. But then I ſummon you to anſwer it at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; do you remember it then.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral other workings of carnal hearts, by which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themſelves in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lives.</p>
            <p>What are they? Come let me name them.</p>
            <p>O ſay you, we don't deny, but God will condemn men, and we don't deny but God can make good
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43855:74"/>
all his threatnings: But ſay you, we are in ſuch a body, and our bodies are in ſuch want; you know we muſt not ſtarve, and ſuffer our poor wives and children to famiſh for want of bread; and truly we are poor, and muſt work for our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; and we are ſo taken up, that we have no leiſure to hear what God ſays, or what Chriſt ſays; we have ſcarce leiſure to read or hear the word of God: This is another thing.</p>
            <p>I know you would fain be gone, but I will tell you why I ſtay you ſo long; I would fain (before you go out of them doors) have you to believe. If Gods Miniſters do ſo compaſſionate you, you ſhould compaſſionate your ſelves: Ah, But ſay you, I can't attend it, I muſt be gone, my dinner waits for me; no, nor to morrow neither. I have no time at all to think of theſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43855:75"/>
things. No? Have you no time to think of them? Do you think that they don't deſerve your thoughts? Why, What are your poor bodies (for which you labour ſo much), in a compare to your ſouls? I tell thee (man) if it were put to thy choice, that thou ſhouldſt either ſtarve, or make uſe of the means of Grace; thou ſhouldſt rather go and read, and kneel, and pray till thou art faint, and canſt ſcarce riſe up: If one muſt periſh, ſoul or body; let the body ſtarve. Thou poor creature! Thy ſoul is more worth than thy body; 'tis a thouſand times better that thy body ſhould ſtarve, than that thy poor ſoul ſhould be damned. But, Starve! Thou poor unbeliever! Thy wretched heart of unbelief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives thee. I tell thee (man)! (but that thou haſt no faith to entertain what I ſay, I tell thee) if thou wilt but ſet thy ſelf, firſt to mind this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43855:75"/>
great work of ſaving thy ſoul, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring thy Ark; if thou wilt ſet thy ſelf to look upon thy ways, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs thy ſins, to turn to the Lord, to cry mightily, and to pour out thy ſoul in ſecret to God, that he would pardon thee, and ſanctifie thee, and reform thee, and give thee grace: I tell thee, I dare promiſe thee in the name of the Lord, that thou ſhalt live more comfortably as to this world, than ever thou didſt in all thy life. Why, will you promiſe that we ſhall grow richer by it? This I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thee in the name of the Lord, (and I am ſure 'tis true) that either thou ſhalt thrive more in the world, or elſe thou ſhalt be better contented with what thou haſt: and beſides, it ſhall be bleſſed to thee, that thou wilt ſay, it is far better to thee than abundance. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all other things ſhall be added to you.</hi> Do
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43855:76"/>
but ſet thy ſelf to pray mightily to God, that whatever he does, he would ſave thy ſoul; and then for thy care, thou mighteſt caſt thy care upon him; your care diſtracts you, it is Gods ſetting in with you, that makes your care ſuccesful. O poor ſinners, if you were but acquainted with God and Chriſt, you would have a God to caſt your care upon. You Maſters of Families; begin your day with God, bring your Families to God, make it your great buſineſs to ſerve God; and then truſt God for his bleſſing upon your endeavours. There is another Reaſon.</p>
            <p>What is the reaſon that you do not believe? That you believe not God that ſpeaks by his Son, and by his Prophets? Why truly I dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. For (to ſpeak plainly) I am ſo in love with my ſins, that I cannot think to part wirh them; and I do profeſs, if I muſt be damn'd for them,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43855:76"/>
I muſt run the hazard. Such deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſlaves are Satan's ſlaves, though they ſee Hell before them, and in they muſt, if they repent not; ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light,</hi> Why? <hi>becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> They love their <hi>evil deeds,</hi> and <hi>love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and hate the <hi>light</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; they hate my word, becauſe my word threatens their deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Hell; they can't endure to ſee what is at the end of ſinning. I have kept you a long while; and ſo God kept them above a hundred years. I have ſpent one hour (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps half an hour more), but if it were poſſible that I could Preach an hundred years to an <hi>unbelieving</hi> heart, it would never work upon him, without Gods Grace: O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſiſt not Crace: When I have done all, 'tis God that ſingles out one at one time, and another at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43855:77"/>
time, and then another, and ſometimes many at once, and opens their eyes and hearts, and makes ſuch a Sermon bear upon them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth their hearts to ſtrike in with the word: And if the Lord does but bleſs the word, to take hold of ſome poor youth, whether man or maid; it is worth all my labour that I have ſpent in Preaching: If the Lord would but bring ſome poor ſoul to believe, that the word of God is true, and that it is as certain that they will be damn'd, if they repent not, as is was certain that the old world was drown'd: This might be the beginning of a new life. O 'tis an hour well ſpent, and thou wilt bleſs God for it, if he will come in with light upon thee, and make thee <hi>believe the Goſpel,</hi> that Chriſt is willing to ſave every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinner that is brought thus to believe in him. O that God would be pleaſed to convince you that he is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43855:77"/>
in good earneſt to damn the wicked and impenitent ſinner; but to bleſs and crown with eternal life, every obedient ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am forced to cut off many things that I have to ſay; But the Lord in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bleſs this word unto you.</hi>
