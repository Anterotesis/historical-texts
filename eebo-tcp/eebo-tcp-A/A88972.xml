            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Eſterday you deſired me to give you ſome proofes, by which it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare how inconſiſtent Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Government is with Monarchie. You were pleaſed to tell me that ſome good and worthy men doe deſire to be ſatisfied in this point.</p>
            <p>It ſeemeth theſe men doe not think that <hi>Presbyteriall Government</hi> is deſtructive of the true neceſſary and perpetuall Government of the Church, which is Epiſcopacie: inſtituted by Chriſt, propagated by his Apoſtles, and continued by uninterrupted Practice above 1500 yeares in the Church, and to this day retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the greateſt part of the Chriſtian world. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, to promiſe or expect to King or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Prince or Subject, Peace and ſafety, or deliverance from our troubles and diſtreſſes, if we ſubordinate Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls in Religion, neceſſary truths, of faith, worſhip and government, to our publique or private civill good. Nor am I able to expreſſe how high an Impietie it is, at this time when God's hand is out againſt us juſtly for our ſinnes, to be ſo diſpoſed and fixed upon a reſolution, that to redeem externall Peace, we will embrace any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112926:3"/>
of the Church, provided it be conſiſtent with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: and will not ſcruple, not onely to ſhake off the true and neceſſary government inſtituted by our Lord, but by Law, endeavor by higheſt authority to condemne it as Antichriſtian. If this be <hi>not to frame miſchiefe by a Law,</hi> I know not what is. If this provoke not more wrath, more vengeance, make not the Land ſpew us all out, I am infinitely deceived. We may promiſe to our ſelves that by ſuch a courſe we may ſay like to the man in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <hi>Soule take thy rest for many dayes,</hi> but it feareth me the ſucceſſe and event ſhall be much like to his caſe. Sir, I pray you conſider what Peace hath King or Kingdome enjoyed here or in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſince Epiſcopacy in <hi>Scotland</hi> by Law was damned, and the Presbyterian Anarchie (the Seminarie of all fude Faction and Rebellion as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by what enſueth) by Law and Supreme authority eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>I cannot diſſemble, but to a man of your worth and Integritie I muſt unfold my ſelfe: I admire to ſee too too many amongſt us here (where is great plenty of able Gentlemen of excellent learning, worth, wit, and all other perfections &amp; endowments, as in any Nation beſides) to be ſo prepared that they are too too inclinable, if not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſolved, to admit and authorize in this Kingdom and Church what they know not: and to forſake that happy Native proper government of the Church, the ſweet fruits of which they have reaped ſo many yeares to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if not envy, of other Kingdomes, States and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. This is <hi>Samaritan-like</hi> to <hi>worſhip that we know not.</hi> Or Athenian-like to conſecrate an Altar and to ſacrifice <hi>to an</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Your worth and noble favours oblige me ſo much to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112926:3"/>
you, that I cannot chuſe but obey your command. And for your ſatisfaction, I preſent you with a ſhort view (as in a Mappe) of Presbyteriall Government: give you a little touch of their Maximes, and ſuitable Practices, and that with as much truth and honeſty as your goodneſſe expects from me. By which it will be more then appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> as it is at this day ſomewhere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in His Majeſties Dominions, is not onely <hi>inconſistent</hi> but alſo <hi>deſtructive of Monarchie;</hi> And where it obtaineth, it diſturbeth the quiet and peace publique and private of King and Kingdome. This is that you deſire, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you, to this I confine my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>This Presbyteriall government within it's verge hath foure Iudicatories. 1. <hi>A Parochiall Seſsion.</hi> 2. <hi>A Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall Conſistorie.</hi> 3. <hi>A Provinciall Synod.</hi> 4. <hi>A Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſembly.</hi> The <hi>Parochiall Seſsion</hi> moveth in the loweſt Sphere. The Generall Aſſembly is the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> the higheſt Orbe, which carrieth all with it's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although the reſt have their proper and ſpecifick motions. The other two are in the middle, and interjected Orbes. I ſhall begin at the loweſt Iudicatorie, and ſo ſhall orderly aſcend to the Supreams.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Parochiall Seſsion.</head>
               <p>EVery Pariſh hath one or more Miniſters. If more, all <note place="margin">1. Of the Seſſion, hovv and of vvhom conſtituted.</note> of them are equall in all honour and juriſdiction, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Senior hath the precedencie. To the Miniſter, or Miniſters of each Pariſh, to make up a Seſſion, in which is fixed the Parochiall Iuriſdiction, a competent number of <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> (whom they call, <hi>presbyteri non docentes)</hi> and Deacons, proportionable to the precinct and extent of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112926:4"/>
Pariſh, are conjoyned: which aſſociate body thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, is the <hi>Spirituall-Parochiall-Sanhedrim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Seſſion ſits once a week, or oftner, <hi>pro re natâ:</hi> In which <hi>all Parochiall caſes,</hi> which concerne <hi>externall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and cenſure,</hi> are determined and ordered.</p>
               <p>If there be but one Miniſter in the Pariſh, he is <hi>conſtant</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Miniſter is Moderator.</note> 
                  <hi>Moderator;</hi> If there be more, they moderate by turnes, either weekly, or monthly, as they agree.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever thing is ordered, determined, or decreed, <note place="margin">He hath no Negative Voyce.</note> is done by the joynt-conſents of the <hi>Miniſter, Lay-Elders, and Deacons,</hi> or by the plurality of voyces. The Miniſter, who is the Moderator, hath <hi>no casting, no Negative Voyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The power of all Iuriſdiction, is <hi>radically,</hi> and <hi>equally</hi> in all: for binding, for looſing, for all cenſures Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, <note place="margin">The Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is radically in the Lay-Elders.</note> for orders which concerne externall order and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. So the <hi>Power of the Keyes</hi> is as much in the <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> and Deacons, as in the Miniſter or Miniſters. What ſacrilegious intruſion upon ſacred Orders this is, I need not informe one of your underſtanding.</p>
               <p>To make this frame good, they maintaine that <hi>Iure divino</hi> there be foure orders of Eccleſiaſticall offices, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">Their foure ſacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> me to ſpeake in this Epiſtle all along their dialect) or perſons. 1. <hi>Preaching-Elders,</hi> whom they call Miniſters. 2. <hi>Doctors,</hi> theſe are profeſſors in the Chaire, ſuch as are in Vniverſities. 3. <hi>Lay,</hi> or ruling-Elders, who now have <hi>vocem deliberativam &amp; deciſivam in rebus fidei, Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tûs, politiae,</hi> and <hi>in foro exteriori Eccleſiae, in cenſuris Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticis</hi> are as much intereſſed and authorized, as Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching-Elders. 4. <hi>Deacons,</hi> who have truſt of the meanes, and monies deſtinated for pious and charitable uſes.</p>
               <p>This is very conſiderable too, that although they hold theſe foure orders and offices neceſſary for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112926:4"/>
of Chriſt's Church, <hi>de Iure divino,</hi> by divine Right and Inſtitution; yet neither the Parochiall Conclave, nor any Presbyteriall Conſiſtory (except it be where the Presbyteriall ſeat is in a City where an Univerſity is) have any Doctor or Doctors amongſt them. Nay which is more, nor be any ſuch in their generall Aſſemblies, or if they be, they appeare only in that capacity as Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from, and for the Vniverſity.</p>
               <p>It is worth your notice taking, that their Lay-Elders <note place="margin">This yeare they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, the next yeare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</note> and Deacons are yearely elected. Here is truly verified of them, that, <hi>Hodie Clericus, cras Laïcus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The things within the compaſſe of <hi>Seſsion-juriſdiction,</hi> are, things meerly Parochiall, the ordering of the Pariſh-Church <note place="margin">The compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent caſes of this Seſſion.</note> and peculiar Service, the cenſure of leſſer Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls (I muſt ſpeak their words) as Fornication, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, Scolding, Profanation of the Sabboth (they mean <hi>the Lords day)</hi> &amp;c. Capitall Scandalous crimes, or Scandalls of Higheſt ſtraine, are reſerved as caſes of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar juriſdiction for <hi>the Presbytery;</hi> as alſo leſſer offences when they are attended with <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> and what is cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or puniſhable by the <hi>greater Excommunication.</hi> If I miſtake not, they know not much, at leaſt uſe not much the <hi>Leſſer Excommunication.</hi> In the caſes above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Cognition, Examination, and Iudgement of the cauſe is proper to the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> the Miniſter with his <hi>Parochiall Conclave,</hi> are only the <hi>Executioners.</hi> If any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall difficult caſe occurre, which this <hi>Parochiall Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> cannot determine, the uſe is to conſult with <hi>the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Seſsion</hi> cenſureth any delinquent, or Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous <note place="margin">They enjoyn civill puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſines.</note> perſon, they order his publique and Solemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (if by ſome ſuperiour judicatorie it be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112926:5"/>
as they think fit by plurality of voyces: after performance of which order, the penitent is received into the communion of the Church.

               <p>Within one County there may be two, or three, more or fewer Presbyteries, according as there be more or fewer Pariſh-Churches; and yet all theſe Presbyteries are independant one from another: only it is remarkable, that the Presbyterie of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> becauſe (as they ſpeak) <hi>it is ſeated on the Watch-Tower,</hi> hath well nigh obtained

The reaſon is, beſides the eminency of this City by its wealth, and the reſidence of all higheſt Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice there; although this Allobrogicall brood maintaine Parity, there be notwithſtanding ſome few Patriarchs, who rule and over-rule all, <hi>who Lord it, and Pope it</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Lord's Inheritance, and in this City ordinarily are ſome of theſe Patriarches: and the <hi>Reſponſa prudentum</hi> from hence, are received as Oracles by remote Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and reverenced as anſweres by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi>

The Presbyterie is independent from the Crowne of an <hi>earthly King,</hi> who is <hi>Gods and Christs Vicegerent in the generall Kingdome</hi> of His providence on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; But this <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> is <hi>Christs vicegerent</hi> in His oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall Kingdome as Mediator, as they ſpeake; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to it He muſt vaile His Crowne, ſubmit His Scepter, and from it receive Chriſts Law and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

The Teſtament of a Gentleman of Wit, and more then ordinary worth and eſteeme, is to this day extant, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he dyed many years agoe) wherein confeſſing his many Sinnes (he was much guilty of uncleanneſſe, and was of more then ordinary reach in Politicall and Subtile waies) abhorring himſelfe for them, and earneſtly begging pardon, profeſſed, and proteſted, that no ſinne did wound his conſcience ſo much, as his deep Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, who without the true feare of God, made great ſhew of Religion where none, or little was, and to cover his ſinnes from the World, to hide his ſhame, and the better to effectuate his private deſignes, he made much of ſome few prime leading Miniſters: by doing of which, he was not challenged for his ſinnes; and was enabled to worke his other ends.

                  </note> ſo that I need not trouble you by reſuming and repeating the like: only here is ſome peece and uſe of good Policy, which is this; In a Province, there may be ſome foure or five, or ſix, or more knowing leading Miniſters, who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule different &amp; diſtant Presbyteries, &amp; ſo cannot formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; fairely joyne their wits and power to compaſſe their common and private ends.

               <p>There is another trick of policy too, whereby the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> of this province advance their own credit, that the wiſeſt of the Nobility and Gentry ſee who are the active and doing men, and having their particular intereſt many times, both in the publike, and their own private, they make their addreſſe to theſe Popes, gaine them to their courſe, and ſtrengthen themſelves by the Spirituall Sword to diſtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> bold to tell you a true ſtory, &amp; the moſt inſolent I beleeve you ever read or heard. When Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was waxed old K. <hi>Iames</hi> bethinking how to come at the peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that Right God and nature had entitled him to after her death; &amp; reſolving to recall &amp; pardon the Earles of <hi>Angus, Huntlie,</hi> and <hi>Erroll,</hi> (who at that time were baniſhed and beyond Seas) feared, if by himſelfe, and his Soveraignty, he ſhould doe it, becauſe they were profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Papiſts, he feared the Church would except againſt it, and move his Subjects to Sedition and Rebellion: yet the Noble men were moſt able to ſtrengthen him, and doe him beſt ſervice in the Kingdom. To prevent this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, he ſent one of his truſted and worthie Courtiers to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> one of the Miniſters of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> who at that time had great ſway in the Church, deſiring him to come to His Majeſty about ſome buſineſſe of high concernment. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Robert</hi> did come. The good admirable King, welcomed him more then courteouſly, took him into his Retiring or Bed-chamber. Spoke powerfully to this ſenſe; M. <hi>Robert,</hi> I have ſent for you to have your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:112926:13"/>
in a buſineſſe of great weight concerning the Peace of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and which concernes me in Right and Honour moſt nearly. Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> my Siſter and Couſin, is ſick and cannot live long, you know I have God's and Nature's Right to that Crowne; I cannot looſe it in Honour or in Iuſtice, and yet my prayer to God is that I may come at my Right without any blood. I know there is ſome Faction in <hi>England</hi> againſt me, but my friends are more prevalent there. It concerneth me in the poynt of Prudence, to provide that there be no Faction and diviſion in this my Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for if this Kingdome be all one way for me in hearty obedience and Subjection, the diſaffected party in <hi>England</hi> will be better adviſed, then to worke me trouble to their great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Now, ſaith the beſt and wiſeſt of Kings, I feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that theſe three Noble men beyond Seas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their forfeiture, may be wrought upon by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, encouraged and enabled by them there, and the Engliſh Papiſts, who are moſt againſt my comming to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> knowing I am a ſound Proteſtant, to come hither and trouble Me and the Peace of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Doe you not think it fit, that I give them a pardon, reſtore them to their Honour and Lands, and by ſo doing ſo gain them, that thus I may ſave the effuſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian blood? To this demand ſo piouſly made, the anſwer was, Sir, you may pardon <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll</hi> and recall them, but it is not fit, nor will you ever obtain my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to pardon or recall <hi>Huntlie.</hi> To this the moſt gratious King ſweetly replied: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Robert,</hi> it were better for me to pardon and recall him, and not the other two, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two without him. 1. Firſt, becauſe you know he hath a greater command, and is more powerfull then both
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112926:14"/>
of them. 2. Next you know I am more aſſured of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to me, for he hath married my deare and neare Kinſwoman, the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> his Siſter. His rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was, Sir, I cannot agree to it. The King out of the great depth of His wiſdome and prudence, and His tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent goodneſſe, concluded thus; M. <hi>Robert</hi> I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted my moſt ſecret thoughts to you firſt before any, and to you only; I am ſo confident of your zeale and good affection to Me and My Honour, that I entreat you to think upon this matter a day or two; and after your better thoughts and Prayers, returne to me, and tell me clearly what you think. Thus was he diſmiſſed with as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as the King could give to any of His higheſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The truth is, at this time this man had more power in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> then the King; and his credit there had a mighty influence upon all His Sect, and many in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; within a day or two he Returnes to His Majeſty, yet, if I be informed right, not till he was called upon. When he entred the Kings Preſence-chamber, the King took him in to a ſecret retiring roome as before, made the doore be ſhut, and ſpeaketh to this ſenſe: Now M. <hi>Robert,</hi> I hope you have thought more ſeriouſly upon that weighty buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I propoſed to you the laſt day, and have prayed God to direct you and Me both, tell me then what you think of my purpoſe and reſolution concerning thoſe three Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. He returneth this anſwer; Sir, the more I think of it, the more I am confirmed in the advice I gave to you the laſt day. I agree with all my heart that you recall <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> and <hi>Arroll,</hi> but for <hi>Huntlie</hi> it cannot be. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and repeated his reaſons before mentioned, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome more. He obſtinately oppoſed and contradicted it. All doe know, who knew any thing of theſe times,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112926:14"/>
that <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll</hi> were as bigot Papiſts, if not more, then <hi>Huntlie;</hi> there was no difference in Religion: the truth is, Maſter <hi>Bruce</hi> was a Lover of the Earle of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who loved not much the Earle of <hi>Huntlie.</hi> This was the Spirit inſpired him, as it ſeemeth. King <hi>Iames</hi> deſired his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: he gave none, but ſpoke Majeſtically. Then the King told him downeright, M. <hi>Robert</hi> I have told you my purpoſe; you ſee how nearely and highly it concerneth me; I have given you my reaſons for my reſolution, you give me your opinion, but you ſtrengthen it not with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; wherefore I will hold my own reſolution, and doe as I firſt ſpoke to you. To the which, with Chriſtian and Subject-like reverence, he returned this reply; well, Sir, you may doe as you liſt, but chuſe you, <hi>yee ſhall not have me and the Earle of Huntlie both for you.</hi> Sir, Iudge by this in what caſe Monarchie is, in ſuch a government, for that this is truth, I am as much aſſured of, as morall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty can aſſure any man of morall truth, which with his own eares he hath not heard.

Thirdly, the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities and Colledges ſend their Commiſſioners, which for the moſt part are not Doctors nor Miniſters, but Lay-Men and Graduates in Liberall Arts and Sciences. This will goe neare to equall the number of Lay-Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to that of Preaching Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The King is a member conſtituent to, and ſhould be <note place="margin">Hovv the King is a member of it, and of no povver above the meaneſt Ruling Elder.</note> there either <hi>perſonally</hi> by himſelfe, or <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatively,</hi> in, or by his Commiſſioner. He hath one voyce too, and that <hi>affirmative</hi> only. In what Capacity they admit the King to be a member conſtituent of this Spirituall Court, I know not well if they be agreed upon it. Some hold, that he is there as <hi>Princeps membrum.</hi> By this I ſee he is the firſt gentleman there, and it may be, hath the right hand too. Some ſay, as a Repreſentative of the Civill body of the Kingdome, &amp; ſits there in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. All of them agree in this, that he is bound by his own preſence, or Commiſſioners, to ſee and provide that no diſturbance or violence be offered.</p>
               <p>The King, if preſent, and His Commiſſioner, if abſent, have ſo much honour indulged to him, that He or His Commiſſioner may have foure, five, or ſix <hi>aſsistants</hi> for advice; but theſe Synodicall Fathers give their indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112926:16"/>
with ſuch circumſpect prudence, that to preſerve Chriſt's honour, and their owne entire, the King, or His Commiſſioner may debate and adviſe with His Councell, or Aſſiſtants, or deſire any of them to ſpeak, while matters are in <hi>debating;</hi> But when it commeth to the deciſion and determination by voyces, and plurality of voyces maketh the decree, the King has <hi>onely one voyce,</hi> and that <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> onely, not <hi>Negative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this it is certaine, that if the greater part of voyces determine contrary to the King's voyce, nay to His mind <note place="margin">The King muſt execute their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be againſt His Conſcience.</note> and Conſcience, He is bound to put it in Execution, for <hi>Poteſtas Iuris</hi> is radically in the whole Aſſembly, the King hath no more but <hi>Potestatem Facti,</hi> to be an Executioner <hi>Rei Iudicata,</hi> of the decrees; otherwiſe He is cenſurable; and if He be obſtinately refractory, He is not worthy to hold His Crowne.</p>
               <p>The King preſides too, as they confeſſe; but ſo, that it is onely civilly, and in His civill capacity.</p>
               <p>If I be not miſtaken, yet I dare not avouch this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, the King hath not Power to propoſe any thing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, or that concerneth the Church; but if He doe it, it muſt be done by the Right Father of the Aſſembly, the <hi>Moderator.</hi> This I dare to ſay, that neither the King, nor His Commiſſioner can hinder or oppoſe the propoſing of any thing they think concerneth the Kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt. For this were no <hi>free generall Aſſembly,</hi> and to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>holy one of Iſraell.</hi> Nay if the thing propoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them to be Spirituall, be ſo twiſted with the things civill, that the ordering or eſtabliſhing of it may carry along with it a change and diſtemper in the State and Government, or import danger to the King and Crowne, The Moderator, or any Commiſſioner hath power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

it, determine it, and never to conſider or reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the danger of King, State, or Kingdome, and that for God and Chriſt's glory.</p>
               <p>The proper, naturall, and right Preſident of this Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall <note place="margin">The proper Moderator is a Preacher.</note> Iudicatorie, is one of the Preaching Elders al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we obſerved before, how Lay-men, as <hi>Buchanan, Melvil, Bruce,</hi> have been Moderators) a Lay-Elder now cannot be Moderator.</p>
               <p>Here is the Legiſlative power, here is the Soveraignty of Chriſts Kingdome, here is the higheſt Tribunall and Iudicatory of Chriſt upon the Earth, from which no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no office, no condition of creature is priviledged, from it lyeth no appeale.</p>
               <p>The King hath no Power to appoint the time or place <note place="margin">They indict the Aſſembly by their ovvne povver.</note> of this Aſſembly, but once a yeare it muſt neceſſarily meet. And at the cloſe of every Aſſembly, the Preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth the day and place for the next. If any great Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie really, or in their fanſie intervening, requireth the meeting of a generall Aſſembly before the time determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Commiſſioners from the Aſſembly are to make remonſtrance of it unto the King.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever power the Pope unjuſtly uſurpeth, The <note place="margin">The vaſt povver of this Court.</note> Catholick Church, or <hi>her virtuall and Repreſentative,</hi> an oecumenicall councell, juſtly challengeth; this generall Aſſembly vindicateth to it ſelfe, onely <hi>Authoritativé, by way of authority,</hi> within the Church of the Kingdome and Nation; yet <hi>Conſenſivé, and Charitativé,</hi> to extend to all Neighbour Churches in the World; whatever it be that concerneth, <hi>fidem, cultum, Regimen.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>credenda, agenda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet if this infallible Supreame Iudicatorie would reſerve to it ſelfe that juriſdiction is due to men in Sacred Orders, and which intrinſecally, radically, and originally

Fourthly, you have warrants iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out to make or force all to be put in execution. Fiftly, you have a Proteſtation, and that a threatning one too, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queen Regent and whole Parliament.

Immediatly after a Sermon Preached by <hi>Knox</hi> in <hi>Saint-Iohnstowne,</hi> at his exhortation and direction, they fall to the pulling downe of the Religious Houſes, and within two or three daies equall three of them to the ground. Sir, can it appeare that by Holy Writ or Reaſon ſuch Popular tumultuary reformations are warrantable? Is it not intrinſecally inherent in the Crown or whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſoveraignty is fixed? And ſo they proceeded in <hi>Fife, Angus, Mornis, Stirling, Lowthian &amp;c.</hi> and through the whole Kingdom. See <hi>Knox</hi> Hiſt. p. 263. Here were many goodly and Rich Churches Spoyled, Robbed, and caſt downe.</p>
               <p>After this they diſclaim Soveraign authority, except it be as they pleaſe, and have their deſires.

               <p>The poor Queen Regent was brought to an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <note place="margin">They vvill heare of no Peace, but enter into a Combination for mutuall defence.</note> and the Aſſembly at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>-<hi>Iohnſtowne</hi> was diſmiſſed.

               <p>The Queen Regent finding this Soveraignty overbeare Her's, and the Peace of the Kingdom ſhaken, by a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration publiſhed and proclaimed, teſtified her deſire of Peace, and deſcended ſo much, that really it was onely a requeſt.

               <p>Sir, you will now ſay, that I ſpeak too hardly of our firſt <note place="margin">The Author's modeſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that is called the firſt reformation of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> Reformers and Reformation, and would know what is my opinion of them and it. To deale clearly, God is my witneſſe I am no Papiſt, but doe abhorre Popery as much as any, and that I am no Puritane the other party wil wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for me. I am bound to ſpeak the truth in my heart, and to give ſome ſatisfaction, I ſay 1. Firſt, as I am able, I bleſſe and praiſe God moſt heartily that we were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Popes Tyranny, and that groſſe Aegyptian darkneſſe we were under: which I aſcribe to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſedome and infinitely tranſcendent goodneſſe of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112926:22"/>
God. 2. Next I leave the men to God's mercy, but for the manner of proceeding, the way they took, I dare not, I will not approve it: but will ſay with <hi>Iacob, in conſilium eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ne veniat anima mea.</hi> 3. Thirdly, I daily heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile that that too too much Idoliſed reformation in an exceſſive hatred againſt Popery, did runn too much to the other extreame, that the goodly order and government neceſſary of the Church was ſhouldered out; the publick ſervice and worſhip of God with it's decency, reverence and comlineſſe was much defaced, diſgraced; That good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſtately and rich Churches, were abuſed, robbed and equalled to the ground; and that the Church Patrimonie was dilapidated: and yet this was not ſo much done by the firſt called Reformers, as by their Diſciples, <hi>Aetas parentum pejor avis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It feareth me, beſides that God is puniſhing our preſent ſinnes, that by this ſcourge, which is guilded with the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but ſpurious compellation of a <hi>glorious thorow, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reformation,</hi> he is in the ſame juſtice puniſhing the ſinnes of that firſt Reformation. For my part I judge ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that Church had never an orderly and warrantable Reformation, till it was happily begun and advanced by King <hi>Iames</hi> when he took the government in his owne hands, and was like to come to a great perfection under the government of our moſt gratious Soveraigne King <hi>Charles.</hi> Although I deny not but the ſeeds of truth were ſowen by <hi>Hamilton, Wiſeheart, Mylne</hi> and others, who before <hi>Knox</hi> his time did Preach truth, caſt downe the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Peoples hearts, were farre from ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the Subjects againſt lawfull authority, and like the ancient Martyrs, did ſuffer patiently and ſeale the truth of the Goſpell with their blood. If <hi>Knox</hi> and his Complices
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112926:23"/>
had kept in this way I am certaine that Church had been more happy: nor had we ſeen ſuch Robbery and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Church. Sure I am, great, many, and more then ordinary ſinnes in them and us and our forefathers have brought us to be plunged in thoſe almoſt inextricable miſeries: And till we proportionably repent, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look to ſee better dayes, what is disjoynted in ſtate ſet aright, and the beauty of God's houſe reſtored; which God of his mercy grant to us for his onely Sonne Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>By what is ſaid, it appeares ſufficiently that this <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Soveraignty</hi> is farre above the King's Crowne, and what we undertook, to make their practices prove their tenets, is more then evident, onely one thing reſts to be proved, that this Soveraignty may authorize any and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private man to doe to the utmoſt of their power for the Reformation of Religion, to plunder, kill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, I referre you to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Knox</hi> hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Scotland, pag.</hi> 143, 144, 145. where relating how <hi>Cardinal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Practice of miſchief done by private men, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by them.</note> 
                  <hi>Beaton</hi> Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrew's,</hi> (a man whom I ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie not neither commend much) was killed by <hi>Norman Leſley, Iohn Leſley, Peter Carmichael</hi> and <hi>Iames Melvil</hi> in his owne houſe the Caſtle of Saint <hi>Andrew's,</hi> who were all onely private Gentlemen, and if you will truſt <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> the cauſe was a jarre betwixt <hi>Norman Leſley</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal;</hi> upon <hi>Knox</hi> faith, the quarrell was the killing of M. <hi>George Wiſeheart</hi> (a good man undoubtedly.) The <hi>Cardinal</hi> could have no mercy, although he cryed pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it, ſaying, I am a Prieſt ye will not ſlay me; <hi>Knox</hi> I ſay relating this hiſtory commends the fact of <hi>Iames Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> killing him with grave and pious words in his mouth as a godly fact. The ſumme of the ſtory is, when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:112926:23"/>
the Cardinall's chamber with ſome ſixteen or ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen more, <hi>Iohn Leſly</hi> and <hi>Peter Carmichaell</hi> fell violently and paſſionatly on him, but <hi>Iames Melvill</hi> with gravity and piety withdrew them, and ſaid: <q>This work and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God (although it be ſecret) ought to be done with great gravitie. And preſenting unto him the poynt of the Sword, ſaid, Repent thee of thy former wicked life, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of thy ſhedding of the blood of that notable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God M. <hi>George Wiſeheart,</hi> which albeit the flame of ſire conſumed before men, yet cries it a vengeance upon thee, and we from God are ſent to revenge it. For here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my God I proteſt, that neither the hatred of thy perſon, the love of thy Riches, nor the feare of any trouble, thou couldest have done to me in particular, moved, or moveth me to ſtrike thee: but only becauſe thou haſt been and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainest an obſtinate enemy against Chriſt Ieſus and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goſpell.</q> And the meek man of God, as he is there ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſtroke him twiſe or thriſe thorow with a ſtog-ſword; and he fell. I give all this that <hi>Iames Melvill</hi> did this in revenge of M. <hi>George Wiſeheart</hi> being ſlain by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall. what Divinity will warrant this fact of <hi>Iames Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's</hi> to be a good and Godly fact (for ſo it is noted in the Margent) to a privat man to murther or kill thus a Prieſt an Archbiſhop of ſo high dignity? The reſult of all is, he did it gravely, in coldblood, told him ſo much, that he was ſent from God, he had no private end, the motive ſturred him up to this Godly fact, was, that he had been and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at that time an enemy to Ieſus Chriſt and his holy Goſpell; he exhorted him to repentance and for all his great ſinnes, as <hi>Knox</hi> writes the ſtorie, he allowed him no more time, but ſo much as was ſpent in his Godly Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ang: for immediatly after he was twiſe thruſt thorow. But
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:112926:24"/>
thoſe Seraphicall Doctors know, <hi>Neſcit tarda molimina Spiritus Sanctus;</hi> and the ſpirit can work ſuddenly, <hi>Inter os &amp; offam; Inter Pontem &amp; Fontem,</hi> eſpecially where and when they are ſent of God to doe ſuch great good works. But this is <hi>proteſtatio contra factum.</hi> what ever M. <hi>Melvil</hi> ſaid in his Proteſtation, <hi>Knox</hi> doth witneſſe that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall being murthered, they ſeized upon <hi>the Artillery and Ammunition, wherewith that fortreſſe was plentifully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and likewiſe upon the rich hangings, houſhold-ſtuffe of all ſorts, apparell, Copes, Jewels, ornaments of Churches, great ſtore of Gold and Silver Plate, beſides no ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of treaſure in ready coyne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could inſtance ſome practices about the time of the Parliament in <hi>anno</hi> 1621. commonly called the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hamilton's</hi> Parliament, but becauſe that will only reflect upon ſome particular perſons, I paſſe it willingly and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certain when the pious and learned Doctors of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> did demand of the Patriarches of this late Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, why they did not by Preaching, Printing, Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or ſome reall deed expreſſe their deteſtation of that horrid fact done by the Raſcally-rout of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> the 23. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1637. where at the firſt reading of the ſervice there, a great many Biſhops being in the Cathedrall Church, the Serving-women roſe barbarouſly within the Church, did throw their ſtooles at the Biſhop of the place, and the Deane who was officiating, did cry out moſt horribly, that the Major, Aldermen, and others within could hardly compoſe it for a long time, and the worſt and baſeſt of the People, who were without, did throw in great ſtones at the glaſſe windowes, the doores being ſhut. After the ariſing of the commotion, to prevent
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:112926:24"/>
more tumult and danger, and when Service and Sermon were done, the Biſhops, Major and Aldermen going home with the Lord Chancellor and ſome BB. attending his Grace, the Biſhop, and Deane of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were well nigh ſtoned in the ſtreets: when I ſay it was demanded of theſe Apoſtles, why they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne this unchriſtian Barbarous outrage, voyd of Pietie and Reaſon, and without any example in the Chriſtian Church, the ſumme of their anſwer was, and to this day is, that ſuch a zealous people were to be left to their own warrand, they knew not by what Spirit they were gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, God worketh great workes many times by baſeſt means: and yet thoſe Nobles, thoſe zealous, thoſe intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and knowing Chriſtians (whereof many of them in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> were knowne Coale-ſtealers and Whores) were the firſt <hi>active instruments in this glorious reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> I confeſſe this Divinity is ſo tranſcendent and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall, that it exceeds my capacity, and is ſo fruitfull upon any occaſion to work all or the greateſt of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, that I doe not ſee how it can conſiſt with peace or ſafety of King, Kingdome, Church, or of any entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with greateſt truſt in Church or State. Sir, I believe any rationall man may ſee by this, how ſuperlatively this ſpirituall Signorie is above King and Royall Soveraignty. I leave it to your own judgement and memory to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, and to bring home the concluſion, that this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Eccleſiaſticall is inconſiſtent with Monarchie, with the Peace of a Kingdome, and is or may be in time a Mother and Nurſe of as much Rebellion and Treaſon as any Ieſuitiſme of the Higheſt dye, if not more. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Rome,</hi> although a Whore, and hath a cup of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in her hand, is not ſo bad nor ſo abominable;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:112926:25"/>
I pray God to keep all good Chriſtians cleane of both.</p>
               <p>Let us goe on; In Faith, Worſhip, and all ſpirituall things they vindicate to themſelves ſuch a Soveraignty, that <hi>King, Councell, Parliament,</hi> nay all together, muſt not touch the Scepter of Chriſt, they are to determine, define, take cogniſance, accuſe, ſentence, puniſh; neither King, nor King and Councell, nor King and Parliament, all muſt aſſume power here, for otherwiſe it is to intrude upon Chriſt and his Right.</p>
               <p>This Soveraignty is of ſo high a ſtraine, ſo large an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that when they have decreed any thing in this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream <note place="margin">When they demand the Royall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of their decrees it is only an act of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</note> infallible Iudicatorie, that they may have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obedience to demand the King and Parliament's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; This is not demanded as a thing arbitrary which the King and Parliament may doe or not doe; or leaving it to His Royall judgement with the advice of His Parliament to qualify or rectify their decrees, and orders: No, no truly; that is to betray the truſt Chriſt hath given them, they need not ſupplicate or Petition for it, it is in them but an act of courteſie to ſhew dutifull obedience. And if the King and Parliament will not grant it, they are armed with as much power from Heaven as to force them to doe it, by Excommunication, and making all good Chriſtians joyne with them in God's cauſe.</p>
               <p>Sir, I feare you think I ſpeake Liberally. God forbid I ſhould doe it. I doubt not but you have read the Scotiſh Pope's Sermon Preached at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> and Printed by Order of the Houſe, ſince you have it I will not ſpend time and Paper to cite his Words which giveth to the King no more. But to make this appeare, I give you ſome unanſwerable reaſons. 1. It is certain in Scotland M. <hi>Knox</hi> and his complices ſet on their reformation without the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:112926:25"/>
Queen, or Queen Regents authority, or the authority of Parliament. For <hi>anno</hi> 1558. they made their confederacy: gave out their Orders for Reformation throughout the whole Kingdome. <hi>anno</hi> 1559. they acted their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">An inſtance. <hi>anno.</hi> 1559.</note> by caſting downe Churches, Abbyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> caſting out Prieſts, Friers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all this by their owne radicall and originall power. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> their true and lawfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne did authorize them in nothing, ſhe was then in <hi>France.</hi> The Queen <hi>Dowager,</hi> Queen Regent, King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth's Widdow, having the Soveraignty by fiduciary truſt, in regard of the abſence of the Queen her daughter, did not authorize it, nay ſhe did by her authority oppoſe it, contradict it, came in Armes againſt it. The Parliament was not till the yeare 1560. (how holden for the preſent I cannot tell) but in that Parliament they ſet out a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, reformed Religion: but when they ſent to King and Queen beyond Seas (Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was then Married to <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond in <hi>France)</hi> to confirme or ratifie the acts thereof, they denied. When intelligence was given to the Confederates, they profeſſed they little regarded the deniall of King and Queene, for ſay they <hi>(Knox Hiſt. pag.</hi> 500.) <hi>all we did was rather to ſhew our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull obedience, then to begge of them any ſtrength to our Religion.</hi>

                  <hi>Iames</hi> then being King, and the <hi>Earle of Marre</hi> being <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> an Aſſembly was holden at <hi>Leith,</hi> where by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Aſſembly, and Ordinance of the <hi>Regent</hi> and Councell, ſome Commiſſioners were appointed from the <hi>Regent</hi> and Councell, and ſome from the generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to condeſcend upon a <hi>platforme of diſcipline,</hi> which was agreed to on both ſides. The <hi>platforme</hi> is that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:112926:26"/>
of the Church ſhall be by Archbiſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Deanes and Chapters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the order and courſe of all their Nomination, Election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is juſt conforme to this in <hi>England</hi> at this day, and as it was in <hi>Scotland</hi> before this <hi>new happy Reformation.</hi> This was enrolled in the Councell Books of that Kingdom, and ſtands there to this day, this I know certainly, and if I be not deceived, and almoſt I dare ſay it, except they have wronged their moſt famous and their moſt ancient Councells, the platforme is upon Record in the <hi>Generall Aſſembly Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave to tell you by the way one thing, that the <hi>Negative Faith,</hi> which is <hi>ſine rugâ, ſine maculâ,</hi> was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>anno</hi> 1580. and it is believed, that in that Negative faith Epiſcopacy is abjured as Antichriſtian; yet <hi>anno</hi> 1581. this ſame Government is renewed, ratified and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to continue conſtant, and not to be changed till His Majeſty come to perfect age, and to be kept or changed then onely in what He and His great Councell, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, ſhall think fit, and not otherwiſe. Before this the King His Houſhold and Councell had ſubſcribed the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Faith;</hi> can any man, not voyd of judgement and diſcretion, think, that the King, His Houſhold and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in ſubſcribing it did judge Epiſcopacy Popiſh and Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p>Next it is worth your notice taking, that as I honour the good parts which were in <hi>Knox</hi> and his fellow-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, I never accounted them as Apoſtles men ſecured from error; yet I will ſay ſo much for their juſtification, that they were greater Enemies to Sacriledge than their after-diſciples; and were not againſt the Order of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy as Popiſh and Antichriſtian, as M. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> and his diſciples afterward maintained. Nor were they ſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:112926:26"/>
fooliſh to ſeclude all Church-men from voyce in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, onely their deſire was, that ſeeing the Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were allowed to enjoy their Benefices and Rents during their life time (this was more then our charitable glorious Reformers allowed to their Proteſtant Biſhops now) with all other Priviledges except ſpirituall juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that they ſhould not ſit in Parliament as the <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Church,</hi> but in their places ſhould ſit the <hi>Superintendents and Commiſsioners of the Church.</hi> Which indeed were ſomewhat like to Biſhops, but reſembled more Arch-Presbyters then Biſhops.</p>
               <p>To returne againe thither from whence we digreſſed; <note place="margin">They ſet on their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline by themſelves.</note> after that this platforme of diſcipline was ſo agreed and eſtabliſhed, as we told before, M. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> comes to <hi>Scotland</hi> about the yeare 1574, or 75. <hi>ultra citra.</hi> This man a good Hebrecian and Linguiſt, and full of the <hi>Geneva Talmud</hi> which was now more refined, beginneth to ſet Presbyterian diſcipline higher, to make a <hi>ſecond book of Policy,</hi> or <hi>devout Imaginations,</hi> acknowledgeth no more Orders in the Church, then the foure above named. A Biſhop was no more in Scripture but the ſame identically with Presbyter; and where Abbots and Priors to his time were nominated and admitted to the Abbies and Priories as Church-men, gave their trialls and were <hi>collated</hi> (as they ſpeake) by the ſuperintendents: This great Doctor found out another Divinity, that there was no Biſhop but a Pariſh Prieſt; Scripture, for Abbots and Priors there were none ſuch in God's book. At this time, and from that they call Reformation to this time, there was no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick nor Abbie annexed to the Crowne, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not impropriate to any Subject. It is true Lay-men held them <hi>in commendam</hi> by the King's gift, but as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:112926:27"/>
men able to doe the King and Church good ſervice; and before their right could be completed or perfected, they were to returne to the King from the Superintendent a <hi>collation</hi> or certificate, that he was of that ability to doe good ſervice to the King and Church. Men ſacrilegiouſly diſpoſed graſped greedily this doctrine, and thanked God that their names as <hi>Abbots</hi> &amp; <hi>Priors were not in the book of God.</hi> And to have theſe Church livings and dignities with Biſhopricks annexed to the Crowne, and from thence to impropriate them to them and their heires, they deified M. <hi>Melvil,</hi> and contributed their beſt wits and uttermoſt power to raiſe Presbyteriall government higher. And by the <hi>ſole authority of that they call the Church,</hi> they began, without the King, Councell or Parliament's conſent or authority, to diſtribute the whole Kingdome into ſo many Presbyteries, as they thought fit in their diſcretion and by the direction of the holy Spirit: and did procure private ſubſcriptions to their new Book of Policie, and put it in practice. Sir, I hope you are the more apt to beleeve this, becauſe you know in <hi>England</hi> the <hi>diſciplinarians</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> meetings debated and eſtabliſhed their orders in ſecret and not warrantable Conventicles, and much about the ſame time; and great correſpondence was entertained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Scots and the Engliſh at that time. How that book of Diſcipline was practiſed without any authority in <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> and other places you know well enough.</p>
               <p>Now I pray you, when without Authority, by their owne inherent radicall Right, they make Orders, reforme, eſtabliſh a Diſcipline, doe theſe men imagine, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Chriſtian authority Soveraigne is abſolutely neceſſary, or that their demand is any thing elſe but an
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:112926:27"/>
act of courteſie, when by themſelves and aſſiſtants they may eſtabliſh and practiſe it?</p>
               <p>This Second book of Policie, Maſter <hi>Melvils</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is the <hi>Epocha</hi> of our ſecond Reformation. The fruits of which I will tell you were, the Annexation of all Biſhopricks, Abbyes, Priories &amp;c. to the Crown, which was effectuated <hi>anno</hi> 1587.</p>
               <p>If you will caſt your eyes upon <hi>the third glorious refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> that makes the Popes knees ſhake like <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> when he did ſee the handwriting on the Wall, (that is if we will ſpeak truly, this deformation which is the diſgrace of reformed Catholike Religion, and which threatneth Church and Religion, King and Kingdom with ruine) you will find theſe men have ſung a note above <hi>Ela,</hi> have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and practiſed more then all that went before them. <hi>Hanc movere nolo Camarinam.</hi> I hope a better wit and more elegant and eloquent pen, ſhall ſome time Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe this Monſter, and ſo lay it open to the view of the world, that it ſhall appeare to be no true brood of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Catholike Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, another argument to prove that this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Soveraignty <hi>in ſpiritualibus,</hi> hath all its moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <note place="margin">All muſt Preach as they direct.</note> Subjects at its devotion and obedience, is this, that what they command to be Preached, muſt ſound alike in all their Synagogues. And whoſoever he be that is the Miniſter of the Kings family he muſt Preach the ſame. There is no coequall, corrivall, or coordinate power that can doe ſo much as <hi>intercedere</hi> make the leaſt ſort of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, oppoſing or interpoſing. Is it not known that the <hi>Kings Miniſter</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the direction of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,</hi> when his Councell have been to meet frequently for Treaty with Ambaſſadors from forrain Kings; upon

And if the King had gone to the Church of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> a Beardleſſe boy had told him more ſound wiſdome from Heaven, how to article and conclude in matters of Higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment betwixt him and <hi>Spaine,</hi> or him and <hi>France,</hi> then all the wiſeſt Councellors and greateſt Nobles in the Land: and this forſooth muſt be the King and Councell's rule.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, doe they not challenge to themſelves the <note place="margin">They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt publike Faſts.</note> ſole power to appoynt publike faſts, to give the reaſons of it, which ordinarily are, that Gods judgements are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent and imminent upon Church and Kingdom, for the ſinnes of the Governour and Governours, and that the Government is amiſſe. And the conſequent or effect of theſe faſts is too too frequently and ordinarily ſome Commotion, Sedition, Rebellion, or at leaſt, ſome change of Court, Councell, or Seſſion.</p>
               <p>I cannot here paſſe by a ſtorie as true as ſtrange. While King <hi>Iames</hi> was in Scotland, two French Ambaſſadors <note place="margin">A ſtrange af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front offered to King <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </note> had remained ſome months there with Him: being ready to depart and take their leave of the King, the King for His own and the French Kings greater Honour, ſent on a Satterday for the Major and Aldermen of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> commanding them the very next Monday to Feaſt the French Ambaſſadors. The Miniſters of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the King, and the King of <hi>France</hi> too, on Sunday intervening indict a ſolemne faſt to be kept to morrow on Monday, the day appoynted the Saterday before by His Majeſty for the entertainment of the Ambaſſodors.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:112926:28"/>
The Magiſtrats of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> proudly contemne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſupream ſpirituall powers, and out of carnall affection, feaſt the King &amp; the French Ambaſſadors Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally &amp; Nobly on Monday; when the Miniſters &amp; the good Chriſtians of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> faſt, the King, the Ambaſſadors, and Magiſtrates of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> feaſt. <hi>ô facinus horrendum.</hi> But to avert Gods judgement from the Land, the Major and Aldermen were cited and convented (here was ſome favour that the King and Ambaſſadors were not, but I will tell you it was partiality and corruption, for ſome of the Miniſters were the Kings Penſioners, and this kept the King free) to be cenſured for their high Scandall in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning ſo ſolemne a Faſt. There was much work: but the King who was the chiefe and almoſt ſole tranſgreſſor, with interpoſed delayes, and much ſollicitation and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, took off the edge of their zeale, and the purſuit ceaſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this Aſſembly is Soveraigne in <hi>all Spiritualls,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">None Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treaſon is cenſurable by any but by them.</note> admits no Coordinate or Coequall power, farre leſſe a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, is cleer in this; That if any Preacher be charged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King or Councell for any offence to be puniſhed, if they in any caſe can cloath it with a ſpirituall reſpect or circumſtantiate it ſo, that it may be qualified for the Spirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall High Sanhedrim, the party cited and convented, may and ought to appeale to the <hi>Generall Aſſembly, as to the Iudge competent.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> if I be not deceived, was the firſt Spirituall Councellor of Law, that taught this way. It is certain that what they Preach in Pulpit is not cenſurable by King, Parliament, nor Councell, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Iudge or Iudicatory elſe. There be two reaſons for it, one is that, <hi>Spiritus Prophetarum ſubjecti prophetis,</hi> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets onely, 1.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:112926:29"/>
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. the t'other is, whilſt men are there in that infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible pulpit, they are ruled by ſome ſuperior good ſpirit and they dare not blame or condemne them, leaſt they ſhould offend and ſinne againſt the Spirit, and ſo although a man Preach downright Treaſon, if it be in this place he is priviledged. It is known and, I hope, yet remembred that after <hi>King Iames</hi> of bleſſed memory <hi>anno</hi> 1584. made many good Lawes to curbe the Inſolency of Miniſters, did by Statute and Act of Parliament declare His Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over Eccleſiaſticall Perſons and cauſes; condemne all Iudicatories in uſe which were not by his own authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eſtabliſhed; (He meaned the Presbyteriall.) That the Miniſters then did importune the King to repeale them: and when that would not doe, did they not fall at laſt into open railing againſt him in pulpit, as <hi>an enemy to Christ and his Kingdom;</hi> they diſperſed through the Kingdom infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous libells againſt his Perſon and Royall Honour: they branded him as an Apoſtate from the truth, and reviled him as an ofſpring of the cruell and bloody houſe of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> This forced the King to put out a Declaration <hi>anno</hi> 1585. in Print yet extant to vindicate himſelfe and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from that unchriſtian and more then diſloyall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies. At or about the very ſame time ſome fugitive Miniſters out of Scotland, pretending they were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did in the Pulpits of <hi>London,</hi> with their fowle mouths, raile againſt His Majeſty, the wiſeſt and learnedſt of Kings: ſo that the Scottiſh Ambaſſador was forced to complaine to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of it; Her Majeſty gave preſent order to the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> then, to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all the Scottiſh Preachersthere.</p>
               <p>Now that this Sanhedrim is only competent Iudge in <hi>Spiritualibus,</hi> and that one convented before King and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:112926:29"/>
Councell, may decline his and the Councel's authority, although he hath Preached Treaſon, appeareth cleerly. 1. Firſt, if this had not been an ordinary practice before this time, what needeth the making of that Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>anno</hi> 1584. declaring it Treaſon in all time to come to decline the Power and Iuriſdiction of the King and His Councell. 2. Secondly, has not <hi>Iames Gibſonne</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Pencaitland</hi> witneſſed for or againſt himſelfe rather in this caſe in Print: who publiquely in his Preachings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared His Majeſty unto <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> told him He ſhould be the laſt of His Race, reproached him as a Perſecutor; and much more of this zealous ſtuffe: who being convented before the King and Councell, and accuſed of thoſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crimes, He with that boldneſſe becometh His Order, juſtified all, ſaying to His Majeſty, <hi>As long as you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe curſed acts of</hi> 1584. <hi>the tyranny of Biſhops, you are a Perſecutor. And addes, that as Jeroboam for the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people of Iſraell from the Lawes of the houſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and from the true worſhip of God, was rooted out, he and all his posterity: ſo ſhould the King (if He continued in that wicked courſe, maintaining thoſe wicked acts against God) be rooted out and conclude the race.</hi> much more to the like purpoſe was ſaid, &amp; if any look upon the Privy. Councell Books of the Kingdom of Scotland, he will find this a truth. He was convented 27. <hi>December, anno</hi> 1585. This man was an Oracle conſulted, and gave his anſwer in <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger, Arthington,</hi> and <hi>Hacket's</hi> extraordinary motion, which ſtorie you know better then I.</p>

                  <hi>Andrew's,</hi> was convented too before the King and Councell about the ſame time, who appealed from King and Councell <hi>to the Presbytery or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſembly;</hi> this laſt had ſpoken againſt both King and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:112926:30"/>
Queen. There was a great buſineſſe for the two mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales, their brethren ſided ſo much with them that the King had too much to doe. At laſt out of more then war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable indulgence His Majeſty was content to inſiſt no farther againſt them before His Councell, but to remit their cenſure to the <hi>Generall Aſſembly it ſelfe:</hi> before which it was cleerly proved, that in pulpit they had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reproachfull and Treaſonable ſpeeches, yet could the King by no power or entreaty obtain of them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict any puniſhment upon them, becauſe ſaid they, <hi>They knew not with what Spirit they were overruled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will ſhut up this poynt with one inſtance more then ſufficient to make the truth of what I ſay to appeare. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>King Iames</hi> came to the Crowne of England, it was ordinary in Scotland to have a <hi>Generall Aſſembly</hi> once a yeare, and oftner <hi>pro re natâ,</hi> upon any great exigent. The laſt which was kept during His Majeſties abode there was <hi>Anno</hi> 1602. in the cloſe of which the next enſuing was appoynted to be at <hi>Aberdine, Anno</hi> 1603. in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim the King ſucceeding to Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and being in England, He was ſo much taken up with the affaires of the Kingdom, that He was neceſſitated to lay aſide thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Scotland; and for this reaſon His Majeſty thought it fit to adjourne the Aſſembly (unto which he had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall eye, knowing their turbulent diſpoſition, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in it whileſt he was preſent amongſt them) to the next Summer in <hi>Anno</hi> 1604. When the time appoynted was come His Majeſties more weighty affaires not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to think upon <hi>the Aſſemblies buſineſſe,</hi> He gave order to Prorogate it to another and longer day; which was accordingly done by publike Proclamation, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by His Honourable Privy Councell of that Kingdom.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:112926:30"/>
Notwithſtanding all which, ſome Thirteen or Fourteen Godly zealous brethren muſt needs meet at <hi>Aberdine</hi> at the day appoynted for the Aſſembly. They eſtabliſhed and formalized the Iudicatorie, by conſtituting a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, a Clerk, and other eſſentiall Members of the Court. The Lords of Councell underſtanding this contempt, ſent a Gentleman of good qualitie and place, with an Herault at Armes, to diſcharge and diſſolve the Holy meeting. The Commiſſioner and Herault were entertained with as much reſpect, as before they had given reverence to the Proclamation iſſued out by the Soveraigne authoritie of the King with the advice of His Honourable Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. The <hi>Holy Fathers in the great Sanhedrim</hi> proteſted and profeſſed, that in Conſcience and Duty to Almighty God, they were bound to preſerve the Churches right, and could not, would not, give way to that power the King Sacrilegiouſly uſurped, which properly and natively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the <hi>Church virtuall, the Aſſembly.</hi> They kept and continued the Aſſembly ſome dayes, and finding that no more of the holy Brotherhood came to joyne with them, they diſſolved, and to preſerve the holy right of the Church appoynted the time and place of meeting for the next Aſſembly. The King hearing this, gave order to His Privy-Councell to cite &amp; convent them before them, and to puniſh this High contempt. The more <hi>zealous Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the Lord of Hoſtes</hi> appeared, and with an undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courage gave in to the Lords of Councell a <hi>Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Declinator</hi> from the Kings Councell, and appealed to the next <hi>Generall Aſsembly,</hi> as the ſole and competent judge in this caſe and cauſe. The Kings Atturney or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, by order from the Councell-Table, was ordained to purſue them criminally before the Lord Iuſtice Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,

Of whom the moſt part thereafter upon their confeſſion and ſubmiſſion were pardoned, came home, lived and enjoyed their own, or at leaſt as good, if not better Benefices. Sir, are theſe things conſiſtent with Monarchie, or the obedience is due to Soveraignty and its Higheſt Courts?</p>
               <p>So abſolute and uncontroleable is this High Celeſtiall Court, that it commandeth, Conſcience and Soule, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſeth <note place="margin">The Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence body &amp; Eſtate.</note> of body and eſtate in the poynt of Religion, that if you conforme not in all, neither Soule, nor Body, nor Eſtate can be in Peace, nay no toleration can be allowed where this ſoveraignty domineereth.

               </p>
               <p>If any doth not, after a little time granted for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conforme and ſubſcribe to their confeſſion of Faith, (which is more in negatives and deſtructives, then affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matives and poſitives) their rule of government, their manner of Worſhip, and what elſe in their opinion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, (and in this I am ſure they are more rigorous then ever God or Catholike Church was, for if you diſſent but from them in a Theologicall tenet, it is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie) you are forthwith excommunicated, <hi>and given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Divell:</hi> after which upon the remonſtrance of a Commiſſioner from the Presbyterie to the Civill Iudge, there is a warrant from Supream authority given out to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:112926:32"/>
command you to conforme (this is different from the Writ <hi>De excommunicato capiendo)</hi> or then within few dayes to be put to the horne (that is outlawed.) Vpon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience the tender conſcience not conforming, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed's eſtate moveable (Chattells we call it) become proper to the King. God knoweth, little of this benefit commeth to the King's Theſaurer, but a <hi>Donater to the eſcheit,</hi> which ordinarily is the Convicted's mortall Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for a little compoſition hath the right made over, and hath the benefit of the eſcheit. If within yeare and day he give not obedience and conformity, His whole Revenues and Rents of immoveable goods forfeit to the King du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life time. Some Enemy of His, or Favourite of the Theſaurer's, obtaineth the King's Right, and the King hath little or nothing of it. Here you have him ſtript of all his Eſtate moveable, immoveable. Yet here is not an end: but ſtill upon Remonſtrance of the <hi>Presbyteries or Church's Commiſsioner,</hi> another writ goeth out, which they call Letters of Caption (that is, if I miſtake not, the tant'amount of the writ <hi>de Excommunicato capiendo)</hi> which is directed to all Sheriffes, Stuards, Provoſts, Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, &amp;c. to ſeize &amp; ſecure his Perſon whereſoever it may be apprehended, and to commit him to cloſe Priſon as a Rebell. If he skulk and hide himſelfe, then upon the ſame Remonſtrance goeth out a writ, which there they call <hi>Letters of Intercommuning</hi> (I know no thing in the Law like this) the intent is that none of the Kings Subjects commune or conferre with him <hi>coram</hi> or perſonally, or by Letter or interpoſed Perſon keep intelligence or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with him; otherwiſe the intercommuner is to be judged and reputed to be a Rebell of the ſame guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe.

Church requireth all theſe of the civill Magiſtrate (ſo they are pleaſed to terme Soveraignty) he is bound to grant them. Now, Sir, I pray you conſider if this is not in many reſpects worſe then the Inquiſition; when an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Theologicall tenet different from the aſſured faith of thoſe <hi>Gamaliels</hi> may bring a man unto all thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

               <p>There is another practice of the power of this Court, <note place="margin">This Court is Iudge of Treaſon in relation to Religion, and of fit &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors for a King.</note> that for the glory of God, the honour of the King, the good and preſervation of Church and Religion, it may aſſume to it ſelfe to be Iudge of what is Treaſon, what is not: who are fit Councellors for a King, who not.</p>
               <p>Practice is the moſt ſure infallible and clear proofe and demonſtration of power. I will give you one in the caſe of Treaſon, that none dare to ſay it is a Lye, and which can be made good by the authentick and publique Records of Parliament and Councell of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their owne No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acts of generall Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Iames,</hi> about the age of <hi>Ioſias,</hi> (when in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ it is recorded of him that he began to ſeeke the Lord with all his heart) had taken the Government of the Kingdome in his owne hand; and did Reigne and Rule with ſuch prudence incomparable, admirable, that none could juſtly except againſt Him or His Government: yet ſuch was the reſtleſſe ambition of ſome, who could not with patience endure the truſt of others, eſpecially of that Noble worthy <hi>Eſme Duke of Lennox,</hi> His Majeſties nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Kinſman and higheſt Favourite, and that juſtly for His moſt eminent Noble endowments. Theſe diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gentlemen layed downe a reſolution to get the King
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:112926:33"/>
into their hands and power, and to thruſt out that Noble Prince. They watched an opportunity, when the King came to His ſport of hunting neare to <hi>Saint-Iohnstowne,</hi> with an ordinary attendance, (the Noble Peere ſtaying with others at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> for the King and Kingdomes better ſervice) ſurpriſed him fearing no ill, ſeized his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, carried him along to the Caſtle of <hi>Ruthen,</hi> kept him ſo that none could have acceſſe to him, till he was forced to command the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> to depart the Kingdome (which out of zeale and love to the King he did in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter embarking at <hi>Dunbrittane,</hi> came to <hi>France</hi> and dyed ſhortly after) and to change all his ſervants they diſliked, and to ſurround him with themſelves and their owne. They kept their King in captivitie the ſpace of nine monthes, ſuffering none to come at him, but ſuch as they pleaſed. The wiſe King put a good face upon a foule bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, ſeemed to like well of them and their courſes. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe the beſt and moſt knowing of Subjects grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled exceedingly to ſee their Prince ſo abuſed. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators underſtanding it, did adviſe upon the beſt courſe to ſatisfie the people and to bring them to approve their way. They wrought with the chiefe Rulers of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and prevailed. At the next generall Aſſembly they give in a Remonſtrance to them then ſitting in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> declaring the <hi>Extraordinary reaſons</hi> that moved them to ſecure His Majeſties Perſon in the Caſtle of <hi>Ruthen:</hi> their zeale to the Reformed Religion, which was in imminent and apparent danger by the practices of the Duke, who was ſent from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Scotland</hi> of purpoſe to corrupt the young King: their care to ſecure the King's Royall Perſon, whom the Duke intended to conveigh privately to <hi>France:</hi> their deſire to free the Subjects from the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:112926:34"/>
tyranny and oppreſſion both of their lives and goods by the malitious diſpoſition, and inſatiable avarice of thoſe who were about him and overruled him; and a great many more ſpecious pretences, (which are not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from theſe of this time;) upon this Narrative the humble Petition to this Superlative Soveraignty was that the holy Brother-hood would be pleaſed to give an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to this their Heroick and Chriſtian fact, and whatſoever was their judgement they would obey it with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> that it ſhould be made knowne to all good Chriſtians within the Realme. The demand was pious and juſt, the holy Aſſembly ſecured from erring and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and not encroaching upon any thing meerly civill, but in a caſe of ſo high concernment <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> as competent Iudges doe take the caſe into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and after mature deliberation, being aſſiſted with a fanſied infallible direction give out their verdict, authorize and approve all in ſubſtance or circumſtance to be holily and juſtly with much zeale and diſcretion done. In all this they exceeded not their power, and that becauſe what was done, was for the advancement of God's glory, the honour and perſonall ſafety of the King, and publique good of the Kingdome: That all good People may reſt content and be fully ſatisfied, it was further ordained, that all Miniſters ſhall upon their returne to their Pariſhes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate ſo much to all their flockes; and withall exhort all People to eſteem the actors as good Chriſtians and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, that for the cauſes above mentioned were neceſſitated to take this courſe, to preſerve Religion, to rectifie the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Court, which were brought and wrought to that height that both Religion and Policie were in the greateſt imaginable danger. The Ordinance was accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:112926:34"/>
to no ſmall griefe of honeſt Subjects and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Sir, if there were no more inſtances what doe you thinke of this?</p>
               <p>It is worth your notice taking, that this Noble Duke dying in <hi>France,</hi> who before His comming to <hi>Scotland</hi> had been bred in Popery, became a Proteſtant when He came thither, and was King <hi>Iames</hi> his Convert. While he was a dying, Romiſh Prieſts were moſt earneſt for acceſſe to reconcile him to that Church; but he adhering to truth, and proteſting withall his Promiſe to his Couſine King <hi>Iames,</hi> would admit none and dyed in the Communion of the Proteſtant reformed Church.</p>
               <p>This high Court, the generall Aſſembly, <hi>in ordine ad</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the Aſſembly is above all Lavves, and may repeale them.</note> 
                  <hi>ſpiritualia,</hi> challengeth and practiſeth a Soveraigne power above all civill Lawes and Statutes and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that with that power that of it ſelfe it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale and condemne ſtanding Lawes, and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are in practice and obſerved within the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>To give you a recent example and inſtance of this; Since this Aſſembly of late in this diſtemper hath reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it's place and power, the generall Aſſemblies of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and <hi>Edenburgh</hi> have damned Biſhops as Anti-chriſtian and againſt their Reformation. I wave this. More, they have ſecluded Biſhops or any Church-man from having any voyce in Parliament, Conventions, or Councell. Thus by their owne moſt proper Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call authority they have made voyd many Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, which before were in force and practice. As that in <hi>anno</hi> 1584. <hi>declaring it Treaſon to call in question the power and authority of any of the three Estates</hi> (that is Biſhops, Lords and Commons) <hi>or any one of them.</hi> This
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:112926:35"/>
act was made onely to preſerve the priviledges of the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate inviolable. This is evident by the King's Declaration put forth the yeare following 1585. Again they have made voyd another Act of Parliament in <hi>anno</hi> 1597. <hi>Ordaining Miniſters that ſhould be provided by His Majeſty to Prelacies to have Vote in Parliament, as being the third Estate.</hi> Another in <hi>anno</hi> 1606.</p>
               <p>The ſame Aſſemblies, did declare the Acts of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of <hi>Glaſgow, Perth, &amp;c.</hi> null, voyd and unlawfull: which notwithſtanding were enacted as Municipall Laws, obedience commanded, and practiſed in the greateſt part of the Kingdome. How much King <hi>Iames</hi> his happy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is blaſted, by theſe ſupercilious new Orders of thoſe Aſſemblies, my Pen bluſheth to expreſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame Aſſemblies have condemned the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Court, declared by Act of Parliament. And this is done upon this ground which proveth their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty in ſpiritualibus,</hi> becauſe it was not conſented to by the Church: That is, the vertuall Church, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>When I conſider theſe things, I cannot ſufficiently won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how the high Court of Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> hath ſwallowed and ſworne their Covenant, which in it's right ſenſe doth eſtabliſh a Court above King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Iudge you, Sir, if this Oath be <hi>in Iudicio, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate &amp; justitiâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If King and Parliament be ſubordinate to this Court <hi>in</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:112926:35"/>
The holy Fathers of this Court have ſhowen their Right in this point too. To confirme this, fearing I have weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, I will bring but one inſtance, and ſpare to trouble you with more.</p>
               <p>This Story can be made good by Records which I am to tell you. And firſt, give me leave to informe you, That the <hi>Lords of Seſsion</hi> (who by Act of Parliament are ſo) are in all <hi>Civill cauſes</hi> the Supreame Iudicatorie of the Kingdome under the King. No Iudgement paſſed there can be rectified or reduced by any Iudicatorie, under the King and Parliament, but by themſelves, which is onely by <hi>ſuſpenſion of Execution,</hi> of that is judged and decreed, or by <hi>action of Reduction:</hi> This is nothing but <hi>provocatio a Philippo malè edocto ad Philippum rectiùs edoctum.</hi> This thus premiſed I come home.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Iohn Graham,</hi> one of the Iudges of that aſſociate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, had commenced an ordinary and proper ſuit before the Lords of Seſſion, obtained <hi>Decree and Iudgement</hi> according to his Libell. After which, a rumour was noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed abroad, that the Writs and Evidences, upon which his ſuit and the judgement upon it were founded, were forged and falſe. The generall Aſſembly took notice of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt decree, as they to whom the inſpection of Religion and Iuſtice belongeth, and who were bound not to ſuffer ſuch an unjuſt judgement to take place and be executed. They ſend for M. <hi>Iohn Graham</hi> commanding him by their authority to paſſe from his <hi>decree,</hi> to make no uſe of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Party againſt whom it was obtained, and that becauſe it was purchaſed upon falſe grounds, and <hi>it gave occaſion of great ſcandall,</hi> that he being a Iudge ſhould make uſe of ſuch writs. His anſwer was, if any would challenge his <hi>Decree or Iudgement</hi> upon any juſt ground, he might
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:112926:36"/>
have his recourſe to the <hi>ordinary Iudge,</hi> and take it away by <hi>way of reduction,</hi> but ſo long as it was not reduced, it concerned him to take the benefit of it. Then ſeeing that they could not prevaile by admonition, they threatned him with Excommunication, if he did not what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. He appeales from them to the <hi>Lords of Seſsion,</hi> as the onely <hi>Competent</hi> Iudges in ſuch caſes: notwithſtanding they reſolve to proceed againſt him. The Lords of Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finding themſelves intereſſed, and the Aſſembly uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them and their power, in this proceeding againſt one of their owne number, who had appealed to them in a civill cauſe already judged by them, directed ſome of their number to the Aſſembly, and deſired them not to meddle any more in that buſineſſe, as being meerly civill, and no wayes belonging to their juriſdiction. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no other effect, but incenſed the holy Fathers to raile againſt the Iudges as wicked and corrupt men, who ſided one with another whether it were right or wrong. The buſineſſe at laſt came to this height, that the Lords of Seſſion, (who would not ſuffer them to encroach upon their Priviledges) by vertue of that delegate power and authority they were inveſted with from the King, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to out-law them, and to proclaime them Rebells to the King, if they proceeded any further, and would not admit of the appeale. The Aſſembly finding themſelves too weake and not able to make their part good by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (in which caſe onely they will be Martyrs) fell from the purſuit and all was quieted.</p>
               <p>Sir, I pray you to conſider in what condition are they that live under ſuch a government that is boundleſſe and univerſall, will give Lawes to King, Councell and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Repeale theirs at pleaſures; reduce and make voyd
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:112926:36"/>
Decrees and judgement of Higheſt Iudicatories &amp;c. What Peace or Tranquillity can there be in ſuch a State or Kingdom? Give me leave to tell you a true ſtory. It is known and lamented by all good men this day, how King <hi>Iames</hi> His Soule was vexed with them, that many times they have made Him fall out in teares. A Noble man, a moſt wiſe man, then Chancellor, ſeeing the King extreamly troubled at the miſcarriage of the Miniſterie, ſaid to Him: Sir, no man is to be blamed, that you are ſo much troubled with the Miniſters, as yourſelfe; for when they doe any thing amiſſe, you never ceaſe till by Your Royall prudence and authority you ſet it aright againe: but would you leave them to themſelves, the very body of the People would riſe up againſt them, and ſtone them out of the Kingdome. His Majeſty returned a moſt pious anſwer, worthie to be written in letters of Gold in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that all Kings may learne it: My Lord, ſaith He, your advice is ſhrewd Policie, but your Counſell is not good piety; If I had no more to doe but to ſerve my ſelfe of them for a Politick end, your advice is good, and I know it would prove ſo. But God hath appoynted me a Nurſe or Father of his Church, it is my charge from my Lord and Maſter to preſerve his Church, and not to ruinate it. Which if I doe, God will ruinate me and my poſterity.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> in the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court</hi> hath well obſerved, that this Eccleſiaſticall Government pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth way, and uſhereth in a Democraticall government. And he telleth alſo, that in His Mother Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> abſence, and in his own Minority and non-age, it was much thought upon and intended. Their Maxims of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity lead to it, for they ſay, <hi>Reſpublica eſt in Eccleſiâ:</hi> The Church and her Policy are the Houſe, the Civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:112926:37"/>
is but the Hangings, which neceſſarily for decency and good order muſt be made conformable to the Houſe. Monarchy is enmity againſt the Church. <hi>Catherwood</hi> in his book entitled <hi>Altare Damaſcenum,</hi> gives you it in down right termes, <hi>Naturâ inſitum eſt omnibus Regibus in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum odium;</hi> and in his Preface, or Epiſtle (I have not the book by me) he calls K. <hi>Iames, Infenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſsimum &amp; infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiſsimum purioris Religionis hostem.</hi> And that they may now exerciſe all their power, and bring the Kingdom to a Popular State, which was not ſo feiſable before, it is more then probable, and much to be feared, and with great prudence to be prevented; becauſe the Generall Aſſembly hath in it now the prime Noble men of the Kingdom, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Lords; the moſt active and knowing Knights of Counties and Eſquires; the wiſeſt Citizens and Corporations, and this in the Capacity of <hi>Ruling-Elders,</hi> who diſcontented are able here to make a Faction, call King, Seſſion, Councell, or whom they pleaſe before them, becauſe of their ſupreame, univerſall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent juriſdiction. And this Iudicatorie cannot <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>erre in its determinations, for it is undoubtedly ſecured from error, and aſſiſted with infallibility.</p>
               <p>This divine policy hath another ſacred trick to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its <note place="margin">A Holy trick vvhich hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Soveraignty and to continue it, which is this. The Generall Aſſembly ordinarily meets but once a year, yet at the end and cloſe of every Generall Aſſembly, there is a choice made of ſome Commiſſioners, (a Committee) who are to reſide, or at leaſt upon any neceſſary occaſion to be at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> Theſe are the virtuall Aſſembly, and their power continueth till the next Generall Aſſembly. They are in the firſt place, to intimate to the King the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and demands of the Aſſembly, and to ſee <hi>all due civill</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:112926:37"/>
                  <hi>Sanction and confirmation given to it.</hi> the King, His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, His Parliament can change nothing of their ſacred decrees without their conſent. What ever new occurrence is in Church or State <hi>pro re natâ,</hi> theſe Commiſſioners are to give order and to ſee, <hi>ne quid detrimenti Ecoleſia capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.</hi> It is true their orders bind only in the interim betwixt the two Aſſemblies, and the next plenarie Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly may <hi>derogare, abrogare, obrogare &amp;c,</hi> yet give me leave to tell you truth, theſe great Delegates with their power have ſo much influence upon the next Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, that their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> precognitions and predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, are formally and Legally enacted. Nor is this to be wondred at, for the <hi>Achitophels</hi> and <hi>Ioabs</hi> of Church and Kingdom, the beſt head peeces of greateſt depth, Preaching and Ruling Elders are in this Iunto.</p>
               <p>Heere are all diſturbing Seditions, and treaſonable courſes hatched and conceived; whether it be Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, Sedition in State or Kingdom, the change of Court, the removing of Courtiers from the King, the ſurrounding of him with others &amp;c. The next Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie ownes all their courſes, decrees them under pretence of Piety, Reformation of abuſes, removing of Malignants from the King and from His Counſell, from being Iudges in the ſupreameſt Iudicatories of the Kingdom, &amp;c. By this means at pleaſure, when and where they will, they procure Parliaments to work for their own private ends. To facilitate the work, order is given to all Presbyteries, to command all the Miniſters to Preach to their flocks, to make and keep Faſts, for the danger the Church is in, that the King is inclinable, nay inclining to Popery, that there are none in truſt or power by Him, in Court, Councell, Exchequer or Seſſion, but ſuch as are Popiſh or Popiſhly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:112926:38"/>
affected: and ſuch they muſt be, if they once determine it. And woefull experience hath confirmed it, that worthie, Innocent and deſerving men have ſuffered, and the King hath been forced to abandon His beſt ſervants.</p>
               <p>This cloſe Committee hath all theſe prerogatives: 1. During the <hi>interim</hi> betwixt two Aſſemblies, they had truſt to ſee that all the Orders and Decrees of the grand Conſiſtory ſhould be put in execution. 2. Next upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exigent intervening, they have the power by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon all the Presbyteriesin the Kingdom, to make them goe which way they thought fit for their own ends, both to make the Miniſters Preach their ſenſe, and to work with all the people to believe the poſture of affaires in Church and State were as they informed and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. 3. Thirdly, here were all things prepared for the next great meeting of the Generall Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>By theſe means things projected were effected. This way the Queen Regent was put from Her Regencie. This way Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was expulſed Scotland. This way King <hi>Iames</hi> His captivity at <hi>Ruthen</hi> was found to be good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. This way that Noble Duke of <hi>Lennox Eſme</hi> was made a Papiſt, and the King forced to abandon him, and he to depart the Kingdom in Winter being ſick, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after dyed in France. By this means, if I be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was that infamous day the 17. of <hi>December, anno</hi> 1596. <hi>atro ſignanda lapillo,</hi> renowned for a moſt horrid inſurrection in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> againſt King <hi>Iames</hi> and His prime Counſellors. I begge leave to give you a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> whileſt He was King of Scotland, by all forraigne Kings, Princes and States, was admired for His <note place="margin">The Storie of 17. <hi>December</hi> 1596.</note> extraordinary Royall endowments. Ambaſſadors from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:112926:38"/>
many beyond Seas at the ſame time, and almoſt conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were with Him. The ſmallneſſe of the Patrimony of that Crowne, was not able to maintain that Royall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment He kept. Beſides being too too Royally liberall and magnificent, His coffers were empty, and at this time ſcarce was His Majeſty able to maintain the neceſſary charge of His houſe in that meaſure which was ſuitable to ſo Royall a King. To rectify this, the King with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Counſell, entruſted with all his Rents, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and caſualties, Eight prime men of good worth and integritie, Officers of State, Counſellors and Iudges. This was done that all might be rightly regulated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things His Tables at Court kept like a Kings, that forraign Ambaſſadors might not eſpy any want which might derogate from the Honour of King and Kingdome. The ordinary Tables of the Court were regulated; the Courtiers daily allowance was retrenched; which they could not away with. They and other diſcontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did reproachfully call theſe men, <hi>The Octavians.</hi> They who grumbled at this, and would right themſelves, to gain their intendment, hit upon the ordinary and ſafeſt way, that was to beginne with the Church. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, the forraign Ambaſſadors did work upon the King to turn Papiſt: it was like they would prevaile, for theſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctavians</hi> were all ſuch in their hearts, and diſſembled only in profeſſing to keep a communion with the Proteſtant Church; if thoſe were not removed from the King, and good men put about him, Religion, Kingdom, and all were undone. When this had been often informed and ſuggeſted, early in the morning on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> three of the Kings Domeſtick Servants came to M. <hi>Walter Balcanqual's</hi> houſe; The Miniſtery of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:112926:39"/>
and others Commiſſioners of the generall Aſſembly, with ſome of the beſt Chriſtians of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> are ſent for, they meet there. The Kings Servants informe that all was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, if they did not in time and ſpeedily prevent; for the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntlie,</hi> (this was the late Marqueſſe who came occaſionally the night before to Court, and it is true he was Popiſh, but God knowes he was free of what he was charged with) ſay they was with the King till twelve a clock at night in his Bed-chamber yeſter-night; it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon to re-erect Popery, and ſo many of your beſt Citizens and Chriſtians are to be ſeized upon; ſome to be ſent to <hi>Blacknes,</hi> ſome to <hi>Innernes,</hi> ſome to <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> &amp;c. The caſe was apprehended in that zeale which became the cauſe. The reſolution taken, was, that M. <hi>Walter Baelcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall</hi> being to Preach that very day in the Chancell of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> Church, which they call the little Church, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sermon and Prayer done, he ſhould deſire all good Brethren and Chriſtians to meet immediatly forthwith there for the good of Church and Religion. Noblemen, Gentlemen, Preachers, Burgeſſes, all who affected the good cauſe did meet. M. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> was appointed by common conſent Moderator. It is laid open in what caſe Church and Religion, State and Kingdome are: the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inſtant neceſſity is made to appeare. The reſult of the determination was, that preſently they goe to Armes, and by holy force, to pull from the King's ſide thoſe <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Octavians:</hi> That a Letter be written to <hi>Iohn L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

to this day. They runne to Armes, the word is, <hi>The Sword of the Lord and Gideon.</hi> The good King was in the place of Iuſtice; the prime of the <hi>Octavians</hi> with him; hearing ſomething of the uproare and tumult, by a ſecret paſſage, he and ſome other goe up to the Exchequer houſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. A great Lord was head of the Congregation, he and ſome others came Commiſſioners to the King, were admitted, demanded thoſe <hi>

                     </gap>tavians</hi> to juſtice. The King askes this Lord, how durſt he againſt His authority, His Lawes, His Proclamation keep unlawfull meetings at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi> (for the King before had diſcharged the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Commiſſioners of Aſſemblie, or any other meeting whatſoever without his Royall warrand.) The Lord, with courage in zeale to a good cauſe, told the King that he ſhould ſee ere long they durſt to doe more. The Lord, or ſome other, taketh hold of one of the <hi>Octavians</hi> Gowne, who was Preſident of Seſſion; but he pulleth his Gowne out of his hand, and conveyeth himſelfe downe to the houſe where the Lords did ſit in judgement. In fine, the King and Lords were forced, to ſhun the danger of this tumultuarie inſurrection, to cloſe up the doores, and ſome to ſtand with their ſwords drawne if any ſhould offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to break up the doores. Some good Subjects eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Alexander Home</hi> of <hi>Northborvick</hi> for the time Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Roger Mackmath</hi> (whom King <hi>Iames</hi> ordinarily called His Bailie) with others well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed and Loyally affected Subjects, and namely the <hi>Hammer-men</hi> riſe up in Armes for the King, who partly by ſmooth words, and partly by threats, huſht and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Factious and Seditious. The King came out of the place of Iudicatorie, and on foot, attended with many Nobles, Gentlemen, and other good Subjects, came to

His Pallace at <hi>Halyrude-houſe</hi> in Peace: where immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the afternoon, he convened his Privy-Councell, and by his Wiſdome and Authority ſo repreſſed and puniſhed that inſolencie, that all the time of His Raigne, the like Barbarous treacherous courſe was never attempted. I hope you are the more apt to believe this, when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what a Petition or Declaration was preſented to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at <hi>Green<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Sir, I could make it appeare how all Seditions almoſt and Rebellions in that Kingdom, have been ſet a foot or fomented by this Government Presbyterian: How neighbourly Feudes have been encreaſed and entertained: How Moneys collected for the reliefe and ſupport of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> were by the chiefe <hi>Gamaliels</hi> and Presbyters inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, employed to raiſe and pay Souldiers to ayde and aſſiſt the Earle of <hi>Bothvell</hi> and his complices in Rebellion againſt the King. I feare I have wearied you already, the Subject is everlaſting and I am weary of it.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould give account of the late practices and tenets of this late Covenant, it were poſſible to let you ſee that it hath farre exceeded all the miſchiefe ever their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, although they tread in the ſame footſteps. The reaſon why I have ſpared it is not I feared it, I hope to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſometime to the World by anatomiſing it fully. Next, I hope, you have eſpyed the Noble paſſages of it, and are ſufficiently confirmed, that nothing can be more deſtructive of Monarchie, and the Peace of any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To ſhut up all, give me leave, in the cloſe, to give the Articles of their Apoſtaticall Creed inconſiſtent with Monarchie, which they hold as the twelve Articles of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:112926:40"/>
Apoſtolicall Symbole. I will touch onely the prime of thoſe; for for their other Articles, they are ſo many and of ſo vaſt an extent abounding in Negatives, that as King <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith well, he that would keep them is not able to keep them in his Braine, but muſt keep them in a Table Booke.</p>

               <head>The Articles of the Dogmaticall Presbyterian Faith inconſistent with Monarchie.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AS I have ſaid before; They Preach and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the Church is the houſe of God, the <note place="margin">Their Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Creed.</note> civill Policy and Government are onely the hangings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next they beleeve, all Miniſters are <hi>pari conſortio honoris &amp; potestatis praediti,</hi> that there muſt be a parity in the Church. Ioyne theſe two together, and you have a faire way for Democracie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They vindicate to themſelves and their Conſiſtory, a ſoveraigne, complete, univerſall, independent power in all things ſpirituall that concerne Salvation, they have not onely the directive power but the Legiſlative alſo; and all temporall things in order to Salvation and Religion come within the verge of their Scepter. All ſoveraigne Power, (whereſoever you fixe it, (whether in one, as in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie; or in few, as in an Ariſtocracie; or in many or all by viciſſitudinarie turnes) have onely the Executive power to doe as they command; and is bound to preſerve by it's Power, Lawes and Armes, their ſacred and celeſtiall Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Soveraignty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whatſoever Lawes civilly enacted by King or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament they conceive to be againſt the Lawes of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:112926:41"/>
Kingdome of Chriſt, by their native proper intrinſecall right immediately derived from Chriſt, they may repeale and make voyd, diſcharge the Subject to obey them. They may decree not onely different Lawes of their owne from the ſtanding Lawes of the Kingdome, but contrary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory and deſtructive of them. And have withall ſo much coactive power, that if obedience be denyed to the Lawes of this Soveraignty, they can deſtroy the Soules of the Subjects, by delivering them over to <hi>Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. No Miniſter Preaching in Pulpit, Sedition or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or railing at King, Councell, the prime Iudges, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, or puniſhable by King, Parliament, Councell, or any Iudicatory whatſoever; But from all he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the <hi>Sanhedrim and Conſistorie</hi> as the ſole and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per competent Iudge.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What Corroboration or civill Confirmation, or Sanction they demand of the King, which he is able to doe civilly (for they will give him no formall intereſt in any ſacred or religious thing) He is bound to Grant it, and to obey them as Chriſt's immediate Vice-gerents: otherwiſe they may Excommunicate him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Reformation and preſervation of Religion, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preſcribe the way and Orders for Reformation is ſolely theirs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The King is bound to put their Orders in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but if neither He, nor His Councell, nor His Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will doe it, the Inferiour Iudges, the Nobles, the Commons, nay every individuall man to his utmoſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, at their direction, are bound to doe it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That they may without warrant of ſupreame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Aſſemble where and when they will, for God and Chriſt's cauſe, and for the Liberty and Peace of Subject
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:112926:41"/>
and Kingdome <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia;</hi> and there they may Covenant together, ſweare and ſubſcribe for the glory of God, the advancement of Religion, and conſpire and combine in a mutuall defence one of another in this holy Cauſe and League.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They teach and maintaine, that all Soveraignty and Majeſty in a King is originally, immediately and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly derived from the Communitie, and that onely by way of a fiduciary truſt, ſo that it is habitually and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſtill in the People, and the King hath no greater por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or proportion then He hath by the firſt popular fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Conſtitution. And in caſe of deficiency, the collective body may ſupply in Church or State the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of His Government. For mal-adminiſtration the King is cenſurable; For enormous errors He is depoſable, and they may diſinherite His Poſteritie.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That a defenſive Warre is lawfull againſt a bad King, or a weake King ſeduced by Malignant Councell.</p>
               <p n="12">12. They may oppoſe and reſiſt all His Officers and Commiſſioners by force and violence, if they come to execute His illegall commands. And if He will be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate that He will come in Armes againſt theſe good Chriſtians, they reſiſt not His Authority, but His Will: nor His Office, but His Perſon.</p>
               <p>Beſides their practice, upon theſe grounds, is to bring all caſes all cauſes under their cognition and Iudgement, <hi>ſub formalitate ſcandali,</hi> by which the King is robbed of His Sacred Prerogative; The Iudges of their authority; and all Subjects of their Right and quiet. The reſt of their Extravagant Maximes inconſiſtent with Monarchy and the Peace of Government are reduceable to thoſe heads. More then this you deſired not.</p>

Sir, being infinitely obliged to you, and honouring you much for your worth and Excellent parts, curſorily and haſtily, I have written this anſwer to you. Not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereby to reproach any perſon particularly whatſoever, but to lay open to the World how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Government this is, not onely for Monarchy, but for all Governments whatſoever: and that our eyes being opened we may chuſe rather to endure any torment tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, then to enter into this treacherous and damnable Covenant, deſtructive of Religion, King, Church, Peace of all, and the Liberty of the Subject.
