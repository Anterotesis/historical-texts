            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>eral notorious Malefactors Tryals, at the Aſſizes holden for the County of <hi>Hertford, July</hi> the 15th and 16th, 1676.</p>
            <p>And firſt I may take notice of two young men here indicted and condemned for robbing on the High way: One of them had been an old Practitioner in that kind, ſaid to be one of thoſe that about a quarter of a year ſince, had the impudence to rob a Traveller of Sevenſcore pounds, or there abouts, in the day-time, juſt at <hi>Hemſted</hi> Towns-end, and in the view of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral people. The other was but a freſh-man, lately liſted in the Gang, living in <hi>London,</hi> by Trade a Laſt-maker, and newly ſet up in that Imployment with a Partner, being lookt upon as a very civil hopeful fellow, onely a little too much given to Company, and eſpecially to the haunting of Fencing Schools, Prizes, and ſuch robuſtious Exerciſes. That day the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery was committed, going forth in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he told his Partner he was walking but to <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and ſhould be back again about noon; but meeting (whether by chance or ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointment, I cannot ſay) with this other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Companion, he inticed him to ride out with him upon the Pad, it being, as he proteſts, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> firſt time he was ever abroad on any ſuch d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſigne. When he objected the want of Horſe for that purpoſe, the other told him, he knew where ſome fit for the work were to be let, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95514:3"/>
that two Houſe-keepers, (which he named) ſhould be ſecurity for them: All which was done accordingly, and they m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unted to ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Roads of <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> but without ſucceſs; for they met with no prize till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night, when they came up with an Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper of <hi>Biſhops Strafford,</hi> who by chance had not above twelve ſhillings in his pocket; ſo that they treated him very untowardly for not riding better furniſh'd; which perhaps might more provoke and invigorate his ſearch and proſecution after them, though no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diligence was required: For after they had robb'd him, they rode not above four miles, but took up their lodging as unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly as might be, at a publick Inne at <hi>Ware,</hi> where they were the ſame night taken in their b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds upon the Hue and Cry ſent after them; and thereupon ſent to <hi>Hertford</hi> Goal, and now condemned to die. 'Tis ſaid, they were after Condemnation very penitent (eſpecially the Laſt maker) and that they have made a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of, and impeach'd ſeveral perſons in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> that uſed to infeſt the Roads, particularly the two perſons that now ſent them out, and engaged for their Horſes; who are privately retired thereupon, and do for the preſent ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond themſelves.</p>
            <p>Another perſon was here Arraigned, convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and Condemned for picking a pocket at <hi>Hemſted</hi> fair: He was taken in the very Act,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95514:3"/>
and had very little to ſay for himſelf, nor we of him.</p>
            <p>But that which made the moſt Noiſe and Diſcourſe at this Aſſizes, was the Trial of a perſon for wilfully attempting to ſet the Town of <hi>Hodſdon</hi> on Fire, that he and ſome thieviſh Confederates of his might thereby have the fitter opportunity to ſteal and pilfer diſtreſſed peoples Goods, in that lamentable diſtraction. The Priſoner was born and bred for the moſt part in St. <hi>Martins le Grand, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; but by reaſon of an ill Education and bad Examples, became very looſe and extra vagant in his Converſation, and fit (it ſeems) for any enterpriſe of miſchief. Upon the 20 of <hi>June</hi> laſt paſt he came down to the ſaid Town of <hi>Hodſdon</hi> in this County, and took up his Quarters at the <hi>Black Lion</hi> Inne there, where he continued likewiſe the next day, and eat and drank very plentifully, waiting for, as 'tis believed, the arrival of his Aſſociates; but they not coming all day, it ſeems he was reſolved to go about his wicked deſigne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were all alone. For the next Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>June</hi> 21. taking up a live Fire brand out of the Kitchen, under pretence of lighting his Pipe of Tobacco, he went with it out into the back ſide, and ſo directly into the Stable, and there put the Brand, freſh and burning as it was, into the Rack full of Hay. But as he went through the Yard thither, a young Maid
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95514:4"/>
at the next door ſaw him out at the window, and perceiving him to go with fire into the Stable, called to him after he was in there, and aſked what he did there: Who anſwered, <hi>No harm, no harm.</hi> However the Maid, fearing the worſt, preſently called her Father, who with another Neighbour went immediately into the Stable, and there found part of the Fire-brand burning in the Rack: But the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, at the Alarm given by the Maid, and hearing them come, had endeavoured to pull the Firebrand out of the Rack again, and ſo had broken it, and what was left had only burnt a little Hay; but not proceeded ſo far as to flame, when theſe two men came in and prevented it, ſo that no part of the Stable was burnt, or any further miſchief done; which muſt be attributed to the wonderful Mercy of Providence, directing ſo ſeaſonable a diſcovery of it; which otherwiſe poſſibly (nay very probably, conſidering the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Inne, and the Wind and Weather at that time) might have deſtroyed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Town.</p>
            <p>Being thus taken in the Fact, he was carried and examined before two of his Majeſties Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace for this County, <hi>June</hi> the 22<hi>th</hi> 1676. where he confeſſed he did deſign to ſet the aforeſaid Stable, and conſequently as far as in him lay, the whole Town on Fire: That he was hired for that purpoſe by two idle perſons, whoſe Names and Lodgings in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95514:4"/>
               <hi>London</hi> he declared, with deſcription of their Habits and Perſons (of whom one is ſince ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and at preſent in the <hi>Gatehouſe,</hi> but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely denies what is charged upon him; the other has been ſtrictly ſearched for, but cannot be found:) From theſe Fellows, he ſaid, he had received the ſumme of Thirty <hi>Shillings</hi> on <hi>Thurſday, June</hi> the 15 on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come down, and ſet this Town of <hi>Hodſdon</hi> on fire, that they (who promiſed to follow) might have the advantage to Steal and plunder; and that they had treated fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about his going afterwards to fire the Town of <hi>Hertford,</hi> for which he was to have <hi>Five</hi> Pounds. At his Trial he pleaded, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> for forms ſake, yet did not in reality diſown the Fact; but when the Firebrand and ſome Hay-aſhes were produced in Court, he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with an horrid Imprecation, <hi>What do you bring that for, do I deny it?</hi> And ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to affirm all that he had declared before the Juſtice: However, it being only an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (though a moſt wicked and cruel one) and no part of the Houſe or Stable actually burnt, it could not be adjudged Felony within the Statute, but a miſdeameanour of the higheſt rate imaginable; and accordingly for his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment he received Sentence. To ſtand two ſeveral Market days in the Pillory, and is fined Three Hundred Pounds, and never to be releaſed out of Priſon till he hath not only paid the ſame, but alſo given ſuch good Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95514:5"/>
as two Juſtices of Peace of this County of <hi>Hertford</hi> ſhall approve, to be of the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour for the future, during the term of his life. In purſuance whereof, as I am informed, he ſtood on Wedneſday the 20th of <hi>July,</hi> in the Pillory at <hi>Hodſdon,</hi> and on the Saturday following ſuffered the ſame puniſhment at <hi>Hertford</hi>; and ſo was reconvey'd to the Goal, thereto lie till he can diſcharge his Fine; of which there is no great probability.</p>
