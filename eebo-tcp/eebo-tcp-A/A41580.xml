         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Holy and Profitable
SAYINGS
Of Mr. <hi>J. G.</hi> who departed this life the Third day of this inſtant <hi>October,</hi> 1678.</head>
            <p>1. WERE the World to write a
Catalogue of its Mercies,
that of our Redemption
ought to be placed in the
front of them.</p>
            <p>2. The leaſt Intereſt in the Blood of Chriſt, is
more truly valuable than our firmeſt claims to
the greateſt Temporal Felicity.</p>
            <p>3. A young Chriſtian, like a young Souldier,
may at firſt be afraid to enter into Spiritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
but when, through a faith in Chriſt, he has
once repell'd Temptations, he will never after
leave fighting under his Banner.</p>
            <p>4. It is but reaſon we ſhould truſt God for
Temporal Mercies, ſince, upon performance of
the conditions of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he aſſures us of
thoſe which are Aeternal.</p>
            <p>5. They pray in vain for pardon of Sin, who
endeavour not to prevent Sin by Prayer.</p>
            <p>6. The ſtrictneſs of Chriſtianity ought not
to be computed by the abundance of parts; it
being often ſeen, that Men who have a large
ſhare in Natural Accompliſhments, have a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
quantity of Corruptions to ballance them;
ſo that it is certainly to be concluded, that it is
the illiterate Saint, not the elaborate Sinner,
which at the laſt day ſhall be juſtified.</p>
            <p>7. Sin ought to be more terrible to us than
Death, ſince there is nothing at our deſolution
truly worthy our fear, but what the Impiety of
our lives hath made ſo.</p>
            <p>8. As Body and Soul are kept diſtinct in their
Eſſence, though they be united to make a Man,
ſo are the God-head and Man-hood of Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
in their natures; notwithſtanding the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of them in one perſon.</p>
            <p>9. He who thirſteth after Chriſt, as the Hart
after the Water-brook, or truly longeth for him,
ſhall not be long without him.</p>
            <p>10. Private Prayer is often rewarded with a
publick Bleſſing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6.</p>
            <p>11. It is the Practicer, not the Prater, of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>12. Our Relation to Chriſt is a moſt high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative:
<hi>We are his Servants,</hi> Rom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
gloried in it: yea, <hi>his Friends,</hi> Chriſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 14. yea, <hi>his Brethren,</hi> Chriſt
bluſhes not to call us ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. yea, <hi>his
Spouſe,</hi> for Chriſt and his Church are Husband
and Wife, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 32. yea, <hi>Members of his body,
of his fleſh, and of his bone, Eph. 5. 30. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 15.</p>
            <p>13. He who is diligent for heaven, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with a delightfulneſs in Heaven. The
puling Souldier offers at the prize, whilſt the
purſuing one carries it away.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>He who has much wealth, has generally
as much trouble mixt with it; he who has none,
has more;</hi> Lord! grant me that ſutable compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
which may ſupply my neceſſities here, and
debar me from that ſuperfluity which may wed me
to this troubleſome World, and make me unwilling
to part with it to go to thee hereafter.</p>
            <p>How vainly do we <hi>ſet our affections on things
below,</hi> ſince there is as much happineſs in not
deſiring, as in enjoying the greateſt temporal
Felicity.</p>
            <p>15. He who would dye without fear, muſt
endeavour to live without Sin.</p>
            <p>16. The common partakers of all outward
comforts, cannot diſtinguiſh the Righteous from
the VVicked; the friends of Chriſt and his
People, from their Enemies; the Heirs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or Sons of Love, from the Children of
VVrath. Becauſe <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 1. 2. All things come
alike to all; and no man knoweth either Love, or
Hatred, by all that is before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. Since Chriſt ſhed his Blood by reaſon of
our Sins, how ought we to forgo our Sins, in
conſideration of his Blood!</p>
            <p>18. It is very ſtrange, but very true, that a
Real Chriſtian has more ſatisfaction in Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than a Sinner in Proſperity.</p>
            <p>19. VVhen, in the various progreſs of Human
Life, I had ſeriouſly conſidered the little ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and certain afflictions was to be had
therein, <hi>Lord!</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>how happy am I that
my hopes bound at the things here below.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. Nothing but the hopes of Heaven are
ſufficient to bribe me to undergo the troubles
on Earth.</p>
            <p>21. A Man had better not be, than not be a
Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>22. Theres no Man on Earth ſhares ſo ſmall
a Portion of Gods Bleſſings, or is ſo unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his power, but if he looks into the
particulars of his preſervation, and will but
conſult Gods dealings with him in his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties,
how ſome times he is pleaſed to ſupply
him even beyond his expectations, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times miraculouſly frames his contentment
to his condition; but ought to fly from <hi>Deſpair</hi>
as that moſt nigardly Sin. which, by confining
his power, contracts his indignation, and if it
were poſſible to alter his decree, were enough
to cloſe that liberal hand which was intended to
be open before.</p>
            <p>23. It is not the faint but the faithful; it is
not the ſuſpitious, but the circumſpect Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
that gains his aſſurance and evidence for
Heaven.</p>
            <p>24. As the way to dye well is to live well, ſo
the way to live well is to conceipt we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
dying whilſt we are living.</p>
            <p>25. VVere it not for the hopes of future
happineſs, no man would be hir'd to undergo
the Penance of Humane VVretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>26. Afflictons are mercies when they draw
us towards Heaven.</p>
            <p>27. And Proſperitie's a curſe when it tempts
us from it.</p>
            <p>28. Pleaſures, Riches, and Honours, and the
reſt of the VVorlds trivial enjoyments, in the
meridian of his Age, may ſeemingly render
a man happy, but there is nothing but Piety,
and a good Conſcience can perfume his end.</p>
            <p>29. Little do the VVicked think how many
mercies the Godly enjoy, as the ſweet earneſts,
or returns of their Prayers, with a ſatisfaction
which the other are never capable of.</p>
            <p>30. Experience is an Art of knowing well,
which is learnt by obſervation: Religion is an
art of living, or doing well, which is learnt (at
leaſt perfected) by Experience. If Gods dealings
with us eſcape our obſervation, they cannot
come into our minds, much leſs enter into our
hearts to conſider them. It is a great Judgment
of God to have an unſeeing Eve, an unconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
mind, and an unaffected heart with his
works. Experience in matters of God, helps to
bring the Trade of Chriſtianity to maturity and
perfection; yea it is a ſtock to let up the Trade
of Religion, which otherwiſe might impair
without it.</p>
            <p>31. Make good Thoughts your nightly, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and continual Companions.</p>
            <p>32. Whilſt you are going, walk as to your
Graves; and when you lye down, conceit your
Couches your Death-beds. A military Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
has no interval in his Warfare, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
like that of a Kingdoms, when it ceaſes
to be happy, retrogrades into deſtruction.</p>
            <p>33. Moſt men would live Atheiſts, but
none would dye ſo; but he that would be a
Chriſtian in deed and in truth, muſt live one.</p>
            <p>34. 'Tis a hard thing to part with the world,
but ſhould not be ſo to a Chriſtian who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
his advantageous Exchange.</p>
            <p>35. 'Tis the Holy man that alone is the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
man.</p>
            <p>36. 'Tis a hard work to dye, but when death
is in order to life eternal, methinks it is eaſie.</p>
            <p>37. What a vaſt advantage have the godly,
of the wicked, when the righteous mans <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations</hi>
are a Sacrifice, and even the carnal
mans <hi>Prayers</hi> are but as ſins, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8.</p>
            <p>38. The unworthy contempt of Gods Word
and Miniſters, is a moſt provoking ſin to God,
and a preſaging ſymptom of ruine to a People.</p>
            <p>39. He who is negligent in his Duty towards
God, may reaſonably expect that God will be
as careleſs or oblivious in his preſervation of
him: And indeed he is infinitely unvvorthy
the gracious priviledges of the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
vvho is vvilfully guilty of the breach of
it, vvhen the advantages thereby only redound
to his proper intereſt.</p>
