            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

perusers.</head>
            <p>KNow I hate to affect too much obscuritie, &amp; harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, because they profit no sence. To note vices, so that no man can vnderstand them, is as fonde, as the
French execution in picture. Yet there are some, (too
many) that think nothing good, that is so curteous, as
to come within their reach. Tearming all Satyres (ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard)
which are not palpable darke, and so rough writ,
that the hearing of them read, would set a man teeth on
edge. For whose vnseasond pallate I wrote the first Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre
in some places too obscure, in all places misliking
me. Yet when by some scuruie chaunce it shal come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the late perfumed fist of iudiciall <hi>Torquatus,</hi> (that
like some rotten stick in a troubled water, hath gotte a
great deale of barmy froth to stick to his sides) I know
he will vouchsafe it, some of his new-minted Epithets,
(as <hi>Reall, Intrinsecate, Delphicke,</hi>) when in my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hee vnderstands not the least part of it. But from
thence proceedes his iudgement. <hi>Perseus</hi> is crabby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
antient, &amp; his ierkes, (being perticulerly giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
<pb facs="tcp:4862:7"/>
priuate customes of his time) duskie. <hi>Iuuenall</hi> (vpon
the like occasion) seemes to our iudgement, gloomie.
Yet both of them goe a good seemely pace, not stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
shuffling. <hi>Chaucer</hi> is harde euen to our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings:
who knowes not the reason? hovve much
more those old Satyres which expresse themselues in
termes, that breathed not long euen in their daies. But
had we then liued, the vnderstanding of them had been
nothing hard. I will not deny there is a seemely deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
to be obserued, and a peculiar kinde of speech for
a Satyres lips, which I can willinglier conceiue, then
dare to prescribe; yet let me haue the substance rough,
not the shadow. I cannot, nay I will not delude your
sight with mists; yet I dare defend my plainnes gainst
the veriuyce face, of the crabbed'st Satyrist that euer
stuttered. Hee that thinks worse of my rimes then my
selfe, I scorne him, for he cannot, he that thinks better,
is a foole. So fauour mee <hi>Good-Opinion,</hi> as I am farre
from beeing a <hi>Suffenus.</hi> If thou perusest mee vvith an
vnpartiall eye, reade on, if otherwise, knowe I neyther
value thee, nor thy censure.</p>

            <p>GEntle, or vngentle hand that holdest me, let

I glaunce not on it. If thou hast perused

not to abuse me with vniust application? Yet I feare
me, I shall be much, much, iniuried by two sorts of
readers: the one being ignorant, not knowing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Satyre, (which is vnder fained priuate names,
to note generall vices,) vvillneedes wrest each fayned
name to a priuate vnfained person. The other too sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
bearing a priuate malice to some greater perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
then hee dare in his owne person seeme to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingne,
will striue by a forced application of my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reproofes to broach his priuate hatred. Then the
<pb facs="tcp:4862:62"/>
which I know not a greater iniury can be offered to a
Satyrist. I durst presume, knew they how guiltlesse,
and how free I were from prying into priuatnes, they
would blush to thinke, how much they wrong them
selues in seeking to iniure me. Let this protestation
satisfie our curious searchers. So may I obtayne my
best hopes, as I am free from endeuoring to blast any
priuate mans good name. If any one (forced with his
owne guilt) will turne it home and say <hi>Tul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I cannot
hinder him. Neyther doe I iniure him. For other
faults of Poesie, I craue me pardon, in that I scorne all
pennance the bitterest censurer can impose vpon me.
Thus (wishing each man to leaue enquiring who I am,
and learne to know him selfe,) I take a solemne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee
of this fusty world.</p>
