            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Stringer,</hi> May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; Sir <hi>Miles,</hi> the Priſoner at the Barr ſtands here Indicted of the greateſt and blackeſt Treaſons that can be invented by the worſt of men; He ſtands here Indicted for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to deſpoſe the King from his Crown and Dignity; and by imagining and Compaſſing the Death of the King to alter the Eſtabliſhed Government, and rout out the true Proteſtant Religion, and to Eſtabliſh the Romiſh Religion among us. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to Compaſs theſe wicked deſignes we ſhall prove there hath been ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults where the Priſoner at the Bar hath been, and where he hath Contributed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Carry on theſe wicked deſignes: And Gentlemen I muſt acquaint you there hath been a horrid Plot againſt the King and Government, and I need not do it, for it hath been made Notoriouſly known; not only Parliaments have declar'd it ſo, but there have been Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Prieſts, Nay, ſome men have been found guilty for carrying on the Horrid deſigne and have receiv'd their deſerts. This Plot, Gentlemen, is no new Plot, not a Plot of a day, nor of an Age; But a Plot that hath been carryed on for a hundred years. My Lords ſince we were delivered by God's mercy from the Popiſh Religion by the Reformation; ever ſince that time, the Pope, the Jeſuits, the Prieſts and thoſe of the Popiſh perſwaſion, have, my Lords, been from time to time and ever ſince, endeavouring to carry on this wicked deſigne,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99503:4"/>
and had deſiroyed us long ſince, if we had not been by God Almighty from time to time deliver'd from their power. And you Gentlemen of the Jury I muſt tell you, this Plot was carryed on in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time; And as they did in this Plot car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their deſignes, with the King of <hi>France,</hi> ſo then they carryed it on with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> at <hi>Validolid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he Joyn'd with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh partie here; but it pleaſed the Lord to take the Queen to his mercy, before that Plot was effected. And I muſt tell you, the ſame men of the ſame quality that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it on then, have now endeavoured to carry it on in theſe dayes. My Lords, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> though he was a Papiſt, yet it was ſo horrid a thing that he left them to carry on their wicked deſign, and God Almighty did preſerve the Queen. My Lords, they reſted not here, but in King <hi>James</hi> his time they deſign'd to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd both King and Parliament at one blow, and thereby the whole Nation in its repreſentatives, and this they managed by <hi>Guy Vaux</hi> and others. And all King <hi>Charles</hi> his time the ſame Plot was on foot, and pray how far did they bring it? they brought it to the Death of that Gracious King, and the ſad effects of a Civil Warr; and they have brought it in theſe days, to raiſe Officers, Generals, Major Generals, and other Officers, and proceeded ſo far that Actual Commiſſion was deliver'd for deſtroying our King, and if this had not been by God's mercy prevented, what would have been the evil effects thereof 'ere this day? And Gentlemen, I muſt tell you that which is now before you is the greateſt, and moſt wicked deſign that ever was before men; and though you be of Relations and kindred, yet I know if you have but Conſcience and Right in you, you will give a Verdict according to the juſtneſs of the thing and the Evidence you ſhall have.</p>

               <p>I muſt ſpeak of it then what I have done beyond-Sea my Lord.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I remember when I had been firſt beyond-Sea, I became acquainted with one <hi>Abbot Montague</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Car,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and they told me then, if I came to the Romiſh Religion, what preferment I ſhould have here in <hi>England;</hi> they told me what Friends they made in <hi>England,</hi> they nam'd ſeveral perſons about the Court, and ſeveral Gentry in <hi>England</hi> which I did not then know to be Papiſts. I ſtay'd ſometime among them in <hi>Paris,</hi> and all this while I did not pervert to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion; though they told me how many Jeſuits they had ſent over into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> After I left <hi>France,</hi> I was going for <hi>Rome,</hi> where I met with Father <hi>Anderton</hi> Rector of the Engliſh Colledge, and Father <hi>Southwel</hi> and Father <hi>Campian,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd me into the acquaintance of Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> which is an <hi>Italian</hi> name, but he is Arch-biſhop of that place, I happening there, they carryed me to ſpeak to the Cardinal, and he told me what likely-hood there was for introducing the Romiſh Religion into <hi>England,</hi> and he told me he would prefer me very well there, if I would turn to their Religion; and gave me Letters to ſeveral Friends in <hi>Italy:</hi> At laſt I was perverted to the Romiſh Religion by vertue of this Cardinal, and this Gentleman at laſt askt me if I had a mind to ſtudy, I told him yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo I came into an <hi>Italian</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and became acquainted with all the Secular Prieſts, both Engliſh, Scotch, and French: who told me what intereſt they had made in <hi>England</hi> during the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Cardinal <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and ſaid there was but one man in the way, meaning the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaid they ſhould ſoon remove him.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Yes my Lord, they ſaid there was but one man in the way, and that they would ſoon make an end of him, and that they had men ready in <hi>England</hi> for it. After this, my Lord, I left this <hi>Italian</hi> Colledge, and came to the Engliſh Colledge (for I had a mind to come there) and I made friends with the Jeſuits: After I came to the Engliſh Colledge, my Lord, I was enform'd of one Father <hi>Anderton</hi> Rector of that Colledge, and Father <hi>Mondford,</hi> who told me that by means of this Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> they did not doubt but to take the King out of the way; and that they would give me all priviledges that could be for a young man in that time. When I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, my Lord, from <hi>Rome,</hi> and had my Letters Emiſſaries, by Cardinal <hi>Perori<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

(He ſent for me when I was coming away, as is uſually done to all Scholars, and they Kiſs the Popes toe, and he gives them his bleſſing and particular Indulgence: which I had when I came into <hi>England)</hi> ſaid he to me there is one man in the way who hath made us fair promiſes but will performe nothing, therefore we muſt take him out of the way, and that I might be Inſtrumental in the deſign; with this my Lord I took my leave of the Colledge, and we came five into <hi>England</hi> as Prieſts, and I made my application to the Arch-Prieſt which was in <hi>London,</hi> one <hi>Purrat,</hi> and I was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd a long time by him in <hi>England;</hi> but Proclamations coming forth for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Popiſh Prieſts, I was conſtantly after at the <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſadors Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, where this <hi>Purrat</hi> had a Chamber, wherein I diſcourſt with ſeveral of the Clergy in <hi>England,</hi> who ſaid they doubted not but Popery would ſoon be ſettled in <hi>England.</hi> I came after that to live at one Mr. <hi>Jenniſons</hi> Houſe where the Clergy had ſeveral meetings, and we were all of opinion that courſe would be taken with the King unleſs he brought in Popery. And this my Lords is all I can ſay in General.</p>

This Mr. <hi>Thwing</hi> came to me oftentimes and ſeveral other Prieſts in this City, and they all preſt me to it, but I was againſt it, knowing what their deſign was.</p>

I deſired him to be very Cauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, telling him that ſeveral lives were at ſtake; at that he began to be fearful and chang'd Coulor; I askt him for what cauſe that fear was, he ſaid if that were upon my Conſcience that was upon his, for concealing it ſo long, I ſhould be as fearful as he. I bid him ſeriouſly conſider what he had to ſay; he ſaid then he had deliver'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to Mr. <hi>Tindal;</hi> well then ſaid I why is it you come to me? ſaid I Mr.

               <p>No reaſon at all that either you or any Papiſt ſhould do it, but only through the mad fiery zeal of the Jeſuits, for ever ſince the Reformation you have enjoy'd your Eſtates and Religion without any moleſtation, but you could not endure we ſhould quietly enjoy ours.

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> ſtands indicted for a very foul Treaſon, for endeavouring to ſubvert the Government, change the Religion, and to bring in Popiſh Superſtition and Idolatry: which he could never do, without compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Death of the King, he being the only obſtacle in the way. This is his Charge. The proof of this depends upon <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray;</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the firſt Witneſs, he only relates he hath been in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and among all the Prieſts he convers'd with there was ſuch a deſign on foot; But againſt Sir <hi>Miles</hi> he knows nothing, but things told him by Mr. <hi>Thwing,</hi> which I muſt tell you is no Evidence againſt Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton. Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray,</hi> do poſitively ſwear the thing as plain as any thing can be; they both ſwear they were preſent at ſeveral Conſults, where it was reſolv'd the King ſhould be kil'd, and that Sir <hi>Miles</hi> did agree to it, and did agree to contribute 200<hi>l.</hi> to carry on this Deſign. Captain <hi>Bayns,</hi> being Examined, he ſaith he did really ſee Sir <hi>Miles</hi> at <hi>Barmbow</hi>-Hall at that time, but he doth not know whether it was about that or no.</p>
               <p>Againſt this, Sir <hi>Miles</hi> ſaith it cannot be but this is an Invention of <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and to prove this he produceth ſeveral witneſſes, that <hi>Bolron</hi> ſhould deny, and that he ſhould ſometimes ſay that Sir <hi>Tho Gaſcoyn</hi> knew nothing of it: ſometimes that Sir <hi>Miles</hi> knew nothing of it: I muſt tell you at this time, that they were then diſcourſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99503:10"/>
withal, they at that time were Papiſts themſelves, and lay under the Oath of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy. But now here are three Witneſſes, Sir <hi>Tho. Tarbrough,</hi> my Lady <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lowder;</hi> and they do ſpeak as much as any of the other doth concerning <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray,</hi> and they ſpeak it when it was a time Pertinent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what they ſpoke to a Juſtice of Peace at that time ſeems ſomewhat probable: You heard what Mr. <hi>Lowder</hi> ſaith, they came to him to accuſe them the 25<hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>January</hi> 79, and he put them off for that time, and he gives you Reaſons why he did it; and then he brings an Order of Counſel to Examin <hi>Mowbray,</hi> and he rells him what <hi>Mowbray</hi> would Swear, and he tells him he would Swear againſt Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> that he was at the conſult at <hi>Barmbow</hi>-Hall; you have heard him often deliver this, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſomewhat material we deſir'd him to ſpeak it again and again: <hi>Bolron</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, he never told him what <hi>Mowbray</hi> could Swear; ſo that depends upon the Credit of the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Yarbrough</hi> tells us that <hi>Bolron</hi> came to him, and knockt him up out of bed for his Warrant to ſearch for <hi>Ruſhton</hi> a Prieſt, who he ſaid was at Sir <hi>Miles</hi>'s, and thereupon he askt him if he could tell any thing of Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> and he ſaid no, with many Aſſeverations; now if that Information were the ſame that was ſent to Mr. <hi>Lowder,</hi> then tis of no ſuch weight, and it hath been preſuppos'd by the Kings Counſel that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> might forget himſelf, neither was there any thing in theſe Papers relating to Sir <hi>Miles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And my Lady <hi>Yarbrough</hi> being in bed in the ſame Chamber, ſhe ſaith ſhe heard the Papers Read and her Husband askt him of Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> but he deny'd that he was concern'd in the Plot: And ſhe ſaith further, in the Afternoon, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man brought him into the Porch where they were ſitting, and the Gentleman askt him who was Plotters, but he would not tell him; then he askt him if Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton</hi> was concern'd, and he poſitively deny'd it. Theſe things hang not well together, I know not how to make any obſervations upon it; he denies that he ſaid ſo, they ſay he did. The reſt of the witneſſes are not very much material, only as I told you before, what talk they would have talkt before they changed their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: There is nothing proved againſt them, but they are good witneſſes in the Law; there is no Records, nor perjuries; nor any thing elſe that takes off their Evidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have Sworn it ſeveral times, and ſtand to it. Now you have heard and taken notice what objections have been made againſt it</p>

               <p>My Brother hath open'd it ſo fully, I ſhall trouble you with very little, only to let you ſee that my obſervations were the ſame, and that I concurr in the Evidence with my Brother, for there is very full Evidence againſt the Priſoner at the Barr. The matter they ſwear is Treaſon of the Higheſt nature imaginable: There are but two that Swear poſitively, but they Swear of ſeveral Conſults, and of the particulars that were agreed on by Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton</hi> for the carrying it on; and there is no material witneſſes againſt them. For the latter witneſſes, of their denying of it, it muſt be before they were of the Proteſtant Religion; when they were concern'd as much to conceal it, as any Perſons that were guilty of it: beſides in a diſcourſe a man is not bound to tell a Neighbour all things that he doth know, he cannot be ſafe to tell it to a private perſon at that time. It is very true, as my Brother hath told you, they were reſolved when they diſcover'd it they would have ſecurity for themſelves: I ſuppoſe they needed not have fear'd Sir <hi>Miles</hi> flying from being apprehended, but if Sir <hi>Miles</hi> was at large they might have fear'd it. But when they came to be examin'd upon their Oaths before Mr. <hi>Lowder</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> there could not be any thing to excuſe them; It is true, to my apprehenſion, there was no probable reaſons why theſe two Gentlemen ſhould ask them if Sir <hi>Miles</hi> were concern'd in the Plot; for in the information that they ſaw, his name was not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; thus they were as much afraid as Sir <hi>Miles</hi> was, it may be, it was their care of him knowing what Religion he was of, and knowing him to be related to Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyn.</hi> No it doth depend upon the Credit of what they have Sworn, they deny what is charged upon them by theſe Gentlemen; by Sir <hi>Thomas Yarbrough</hi> and by my Lady; and tis true Mr. <hi>Lowder</hi> was as a Magiſtrate too, and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was as a Magaſtrate too, it is true he was not upon the Examination of them upon Oath at that time, therefore that was not as before a Magiſtrate; but Mr. <hi>Lowder</hi> they came to him as a Magiſtrate, therefore it muſt be for you to conſider whether or no there might be a forgetfulneſs of them in their ſpeaking or a miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99503:11"/>
of them; there is nothing elſe that I know can tend to the reconciling of it: For if there were a miſtake by the one, or a forgetfulneſs in the other, then it might alter the underſtanding; but if they heard well and remember'd true, then it will be, as I ſaid before, more difficult to be reconciled. But Gentlemen, upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will depend upon the Conſtruction and Reputation of what they Swear and theſe Gentlemen ſpeak, which you are to Conſider.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Having Sworn a <hi>Bailiff,</hi> the Jury withdrew for about half an hours conſultation together, and then Return'd into Court and gave in their Verdict, NOT GUILTY.</p>
