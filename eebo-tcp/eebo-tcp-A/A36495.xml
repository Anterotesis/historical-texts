            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Theſe words therefore that I
now read unto you, are laid in by

counſels, whoſe naturall temper
carried him to peace and pardon,
yet you ſee here hee croſſes and
condemnes his nature, commends
and commands thoſe counſels
that preſſe and put on to armes

force and freedome, that in coole
blood, as a buſineſſe not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,

            <p>So that if you will ſurvey and
conſider this Scripture, you will
finde it of great occaſionall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
and uttered to the
chiefe Commanders of the <hi>Campe
and Common-wealth of Iſrael:</hi> and
being of an <hi>hiſtoricall nature,</hi> and

<hi>of a record<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> entered <hi>as an act of

For they did purpoſely paſſe by
without any ſhew of hoſtility, and
expreſt a command for their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore their firſt war was a
defenſive, driven the next day into
an offenſive, when they were not to
let their juſt anger ſet with the ſun,
without they meant to give place to

If they were aware of ſuch

ones, need be made, and executed
upon them. Look not about you in
theſe Caſes, but above you; <hi>It is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bargain to be eaten by a Lion, then by

draw a Civill ſword to the breaking
of the happy Vnion of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
which hitherto have beene
able to bid the World doe, as they
would be done to. Believe it they
go Antichriſtian ways by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

Call other men Traitors, when
they themſelves are the rankeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
render religious Chriſtians as
ill affected civill ſubjects: and revile
the wiſdome, conſcience, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of a State in Parliament, as a
Faction, a Combination, a pack of
<hi>Puritans;</hi> but wee hope before long,
the word <hi>Puritan</hi> ſhall prove a good

This party are they that

Principles of tyranny and then

            <p>Fourthly, Conſider, whether we
be not to be blamed, for forgetting
<hi>Amaleck.</hi> Take theſe ſeverall ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
wayes, to conſider whether you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93213:19"/>
remember them or not: and let no
man ſay, I might have ſhewed more
moderation &amp; diſcretion to come off
at large, fair, and afar off; active cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection
is to be praid for in the
Caſe; but for this omiſſive, dimme,
diſſembling Neuter, negative good
manners, I underſtand it not, but as
the fault, and folly of the times: and
yet I ſhall keep within my bounds;
though theſe Ieſuits ſtatizing would
call us out of our ſtation, to ſtudie
Politicks, if it be but to countermine
them, who are ſo devoted to Court,
with ſuch ſecular ſolicitude; as if they
were able to prove, there were no
other Heaven; and I ſhall plead for
peace, if it be but becauſe ſome of
the Clergy are charged, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the War.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider if you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
to pray againſt <hi>Amaleck,</hi>
and ſo hold up the Magiſtrates hands
that they may fall under a Civill
ſword; theſe men would ſurely hold
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93213:19"/>
you off from comming to God, that
urge it ſo odiouſly, as an intolerable
inſolency, to petition the King againſt
thoſe grievances, that ariſe from their
falſe ſuggeſtions: whereby the wiſeſt
of Princes may be miſinformed,
though they cannot be miſtaken; (as
I heard his Majeſty ſay in the Caſe)
who graciouſly invites to petition.
Tis a moſt prodigious courſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that to the beſt, which was never
denied to the worſt of men, in the
worſt times, which is leave to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
That wee ſhould undergo the
worſt of government, under the beſt
of Princes, is the depth of miſery,
and therefore pray that God would
remember their iniquities that have
thus reacht to Heaven.<note place="margin">Rev. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider if you doe not
contradict, and croſſe your own
prayers, by preſuming to ſave, ſome
of the fatteſt for a ſacrifice, to comply
withall; Mercy to theſe upon affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is cruelty to your ſelves upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93213:20"/>
judgment. <hi>David</hi> gave a command,
upon private, paternall affection, to
ſpare <hi>Abſolom;</hi> and grieved beyond
meaſure, upon the ſame grounds,
when he was cut off; and therefore
<hi>Ioab</hi> did well and wiſely (and <hi>David</hi>
had reaſon to take it well in coole
blood) as to take off an evill inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſo alſo reſpectively to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the King, that he was miſtaken
in his paſſion, when the State had
loſt ſo great an Enemy. <hi>Samuel</hi> was
no cruell man, and yet he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
to hew <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces: If wee
ſhew pity becauſe they come with
halters about their necks, they will
ſoon ſhift them, and ſtrangle us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider what you po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
performe againſt them, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and give ſucceſſe to your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
I ſpeake not that meere private
men, ſhould upon meer perſonall
malice, proſecute the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of any <hi>Romiſh</hi> Recuſants, that
are otherwiſe Civill ſubjects, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93213:20"/>
not the State: or that a Prince
ſhould publikely, and ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade,
only to ſettle Religion, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
Hereſie, without the mixture
of Civill Titles; that is the Ieſuits Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
and I wiſh them enough of it:
but this is it I would have you doe,
Take care that Apoſtates be ſeverely
puniſhed, &amp; thoſe that ſeduce them,
or lay grounds for it: for if theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites,</hi>
that were external Enemies,
far from home, were to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
and ruined, how are ours to be
regarded, that are in the Common-wealth,
but not of it, but fully and
fouly againſt it, knotted into a great
party, tied in dependance to the
greateſt forrein Enemy. Theſe men
ſtrike at Church and State at a blow,
being the anchor of the State is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which if ſhaken, the State will
float; and for fundamentall Laws
they pull them up, that they may pull
us down; and that againſt the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of all Civill government. For
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93213:21"/>
when by common conſent, men fell
upon a Regiment, and at firſt permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all, to the wiſdome and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Governours, choſen by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<note place="margin">Hooker l. 1.</note> and after by experience found,
the remedy in this Courſe,<note place="margin">Numb. 10.</note> worſe
then the diſeaſe; they ſaw, I ſay, to
live by one mans will, was the
ground of all mens miſery: then
they were conſtrained to Come to
Laws, (not only admit a Councell
for aſſiſtance:) and whoſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringes
ſuch Laws, is an abſolute, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
Enemy of the Common
good. But you will ſtill demand of
me what you muſt doe? I can better
tell you what you muſt not ſuffer,
them to do.</p>
            <p>And let no inſolent, obnoxious
Diſturber, or Innovatour in Church
or State, ſay that theſe Diſcourſes
muſt not be brookt. I muſt tell them,
tis true, that in peaceable times, when
all paſſe calmely along, the <hi>Locrians</hi>
Law was of force: but <hi>in ſtatu per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbato,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93213:21"/>
&amp; quaſi in maligno poſito,</hi> in a
Common and Calling Calamity (as
Religion is a Calling Cauſe) advice is
welcome from any hand, being there
is a tacit conſent of States, in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
times, to allow extraordinary
undertakings; witneſs on the wrong
ſide, their Quotidian, double-tertian,
diſtemperd projects, which depend,
like ſickmens Dreams: they that like
not this, I wiſh they mean no worſe;
for that State that can bear a Civill
War, may very well away with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Memento's, to prevent it. Take
therefore theſe Conſiderations,
which I deſire to lay down, with
Cautions reſtrictive, and directive, to
keep within the compaſſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the peace of Church and
State, which I leave to wiſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
men to accommodate.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">This was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the day after the Lords Petition.</note>Firſt, conſider, that in an Exigent,

procured by theſe <hi>Britiſh
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93213:22"/>

Though it be not according to Law
(ſays ſhee) yet if you will faſt and
pray, I will go to the King, whatever
come of it. Indicious Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi>
ſpeaks cloſe in the Caſe, and I dare
not condemne him, neither need I,
being allowed by the State, when
this Monarchie was in a moſt Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
height.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider that when a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by power breaks the Laws of the
Land, that they may break the Laws
of God, and thereby force you to
goe along as their friends, or put you
to make a ſtand, and ſo conclude you
the States Enemies, where the Laws
of the Land are thus by them made
too ſhort for your ſecurity, the Laws
of Nations come in for reliefe, till it
can be otherwiſe provided: for twas
never intended by Law-makers, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93213:22"/>
lay them on, with ſo rigid a will, but
that ſtill, <hi>ſalus populi</hi> ſhould be <hi>ſola,
&amp; ſuprema lex;</hi> and no State did ever
intend, to caſt it ſelfe into a deſperate
Caſe, by good Laws; ſo that as for
the good of the perſon of a Prince,
there are not only allowed, <hi>jura do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minationis,</hi>
but alſo <hi>arcana dominatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi>
ſo for the ſafety of the body of
the State, there are <hi>arcana,</hi> Latitudes
allowed for ſecurity; eſpecially when
the Enemies (who are not true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
but Tools of State, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationum

that worke through <hi>Alps,</hi> or

if they get their Ends: In ſuch a

graviſsimo &amp; certiſsimo diſcrimine, lex

            <p>Thirdly, conſider that the States
of a Kingdome, either actually aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in a repreſentative body, or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually

            <p>Fourthly, Conſider, and make a
