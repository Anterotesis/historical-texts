         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

loose and lawlesse <hi>Belials,</hi> which in
<hi>Dauids</hi> time like Bees swarmed in
euerie Countrey &amp; Citie, in euery

daily &amp; howerlie as thicke as haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones

otherwise of the Lord then he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and in a kind of quarrelling

O Lord, &amp; hidest thy selfe in due time,

Greatlie (no doubt) did iniquitie
preuaile, &amp; strong was the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yea to great boldnes, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
were the wicked growen when
it seemed to <hi>Dauid,</hi> as if the Lord
were carelesse in gouerning the
world, and had forgotten to releeue
his poore distressed people, or call
the wicked to account, but seemed
either to let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do euen what they
listed without controlment, which
God forbid we should once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
but yet in the time of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; temptation such is the weaknes
of faith eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the verie regenerate,
that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue somtime of God
and his works, otherwise then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or then beseemeth the
maiestie of God, the reason hereof
is, because they be for the time as
men that are buffeted and astonied
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10083:7"/>
with blowes, to whose sence the
ground seemeth to turne round,
when indeed there is no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but the turning and alteration
is in themselues, and therfore the
temptations of the regenerate are
called by <hi>Paule</hi> the buffetings of
Sathan. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
(though at a blush
they may seeme to iumpe with the
wicked, who doe alwaies harbour
within them most base and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
conceipts of the most high,
who filleth Heauen and earth with
his all seeing, and incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
presence, &amp; with whom is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
change nor shew of change,
yet between the godly and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
there is alwaies this double dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
First, in the greatest afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and weaknes of faith wherwith
the godly are exercised, there is yet
some euidence of Gods sanctifying
spirit in them, supporting them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10083:7"/>
from finall and desperate falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the grace of God, though
it be more then they alwaies feele
in themselues, for though <hi>Dauid</hi>
complaineth in the beginning of
this Psalme of Gods long absence,
yet he is certainly perswaded of his
presence to him, or else he had
praied in vaine. And as earthlie
Fathers haue a secret affection to
their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more then their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
do alwaies perceiue, so God
hath a secret hand in his children
to vphold them from falling away,
more then they alwaies doe feele,
which feeling they want somtime
to humble them, and to make
them more earnest in prayer, and
more carefull to keepe the fauor of
God when they haue it. And som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the Lord bestoweth secret
fauours vpon his children more
then they know of, as <hi>Iosephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
had euery man his money in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10083:8"/>
his sacke by the waie, which was
more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knew, til they came
their Inne. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 27. But with the
wicked it is not so, for God hath
left them to themselues,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24 2. Tim. 3. 13.</note> giuing
them ouer to a reprobate sence
that they may wax worse &amp; worse,
deceiuing and beeing deceiued,
there is no secret hand of Gods
grace in them, that can be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
either of themselues or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for them. Another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is this: when the heat of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and strength of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is allaied in the godly, and they
come to themselues againe, as
men doe that haue beene beaten
and buffeted, they recall their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and correct their former cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
opinions, giuing to God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that honour that is due vnto
him, but the wicked after they be a
little eased, and released of their
paine, doe turne againe to their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10083:8"/>
former vomit, neuer once drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that they either thought or
spake, or did any thing amisse, or
against the glorie of God, but
praise their owne wit, doing sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the works of their owne
fingers.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Dauid</hi> had complained to
the Lord of the pride and crueltie
of the wicked and very substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
proued those articles which he
exhibited against them, in the 12.
verse he doth humbly sue vnto the
Lord by praier, that he would arise
and shew by some gracious effects
that he hath the poore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
which doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselues vnto him, and
namely by breaking the arme,
that is, the power of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
which they abused to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
and wronge. And at
length as one hauing obtained
his request, hee concludeth this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10083:9"/>
Psalme with a holy gratulation or
thanksgiuing vnto the Lord, for
that by his spirit he did assure him
of some remedie, by taking a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
hearing of the matter on
both sides, whereby we are taught
to pray for Gods poore distressed
people as for our selues, as also to
be as thankfull to God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
toward them as if they had
beene bestowed vpon our selues,
and in so doing shall we trie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we be fellow &amp; feeling mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the bodie of Christ, or dead
and rotten members, such as are
cut of from the bodie, and liue
not by the life of God that is in
Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord thou hast heard &amp;c.</hi> Heere
<hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledgeth the goodnes
of God towards his poore helplesse

and willingnes which is in God to
heare their desire in these words,
<hi>Thou bendest thine eare vnto them,</hi>
and then by the finall cause of this
goodnes, in vers. 18. &amp; that is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
first in respect of the poore,
and oppressed, that they may haue
iustice and right, secondly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their oppressors (who are
called in contempt the man of
earth) that they may be no more
cause of terrour to the godly.</p>
            <p>The first thing heere to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is how <hi>Dauid</hi> changeth his
note, for before he said, <hi>Lord thou
hast hid thy selfe,</hi> but now he saith
<hi>Lord thou hast heard the desire of the
poore,</hi> that is, thou hast shewed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10083:10"/>
thy selfe in the robes of Iustice and
iudgement, <hi>Dauid</hi> here was like
one that during the battaile could
not tell what to make of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but after the encounter is past,
like a valiant conquerer he striketh
vp, and maketh forward in triumph
saying: <hi>The Lord is King for euer
and euer, the heathen are destroyed
out of thy sight, Lord thou hast heard
the desire of the poore, thou preparest
their heart, thou bendest thine eare.
To iudge the fatherlesse and the poore,
that the man of earth cause to feare no
more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And heere we see that verified
which is in <hi>Psal. 126. 5. 6. They that
sowe in teares, shall reape in ioy:</hi> And
that which is in our prouerbe, A
harde beginning maketh a good
ending: for one woulde haue
thought by the beginning of this
Psalme that he shoulde neuer
haue obtained so happy an end,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10083:10"/>
for thus he be ginneth: <hi>Why dost thou
stand farre off O Lord, and hidest thy
selfe in time of affliction:</hi> that is, why
haue we not Iustice executed; but
he endeth as you heare: <hi>Lord
thou hast heard the desire of the poore,
&amp;c.</hi> which is as much as can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.
Such a blessed and ioyfull
end will God sende vnto all his
poore afflicted seruants, when he
hath well humbled them, and
throughly exercised them with the
buffetings of Sathan, and stung
them to the very heart with the
sence and feeling of their sinnes,
and affrighted them with a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
shew of an angrie &amp; wrathfull
countenance, all which the Lord
wil do against his dere childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. First
to let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feele &amp; know what they
haue, &amp; are of themselues, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
to make them acquainted with
sathans mallice, that they take heed
how they either obey him or beleue
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10083:11"/>
him againe, thirdly, to make the
greatnes of his loue, and gracious
mercy more knowen in deliuering
them at the last; for by the want of
a benefit we know what a benefite
is worth, and therefore ioy resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
is more acceptable then ioy
continued. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 12. And lastly
to make them fit instruments for
the conuersion and strengthning
of those that are or shalbe in the
like case, as Christ said to <hi>Peter:
Sathan hath desired to sift you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 31. 32.</note> 
               <hi>as wheat
is sifted, but I haue praied for thee,
that thy faith may not faile.</hi> Therfore
<hi>when thou art conuerted, strengthen
thy brethren.</hi> But in the meane time
it goeth hard for any feeling that
the afflicted soule hath of any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in himselfe, Oh I cannot feele
the loue of God in my heart, I
cannot find Gods spirit in my hart,
my heart is not grieued for my sin,
I cannot pray, I take no delight in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10083:11"/>
the word, &amp;c. Oh that I could pray
that I could beleeue, that I could
feele Gods mercy in assuring my
heart of the forgiuenes of my sins,
but I haue abused his mercy, and
offended his Maiestie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am cast out of his sight, there
is no mercy for me, I am damned,
and shall goe to hell, &amp;c. And
thus the poore soul etaketh on du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the winter time of afflictions,
and temptations, but soft a while,
who telleth thee that thou art cast
out of Gods sight, that thou art a
reprobate &amp;c. Againe who told
thee that thou wantest faith and
repentance, &amp; other graces of the
spirit? Againe who is it, or what
is it that doth so earnestly thirst
after those excellent graces of faith,
of repentance, of the forgiuenes of
sinnes, &amp;c. Surely in this Tragedy
be three actors, and euery one doth
his part, and here is wisedome to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10083:12"/>
discerne on from the other, here is
thy owne conscience accusing, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
accusing, &amp; Gods law accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
Thy conscience sheweth thee
thy wants; Gods spirit sheweth thee
thy wants, &amp; Sathan sheweth thee
thy wants; but that which God doth
in loue Sathan doth in malice, that
which God doth to humble thee
satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth to destroy thee; thou saist
thou canst not repent, thou canst
not beleeue, thou canst not pray:
Oh sweet mercie of God, that for
the wicked doe not so much as
know their wantes, thou art so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
that thou canst not repent, that
thou canst not beleeue, &amp;c. Oh
what better repentance then
to bewaile thy impenitencie?
what greater griefe then that
which ariseth for no griefe for
sinne? What is this but sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
it selfe for sinne? thou
wouldest pray, thou wouldest
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10083:12"/>
beleeue stedfastly, who wrought
that hunger and thirst in thee? not
flesh and blood, not Sathan, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must needs be Gods spirit,
content thy selfe thou shalt be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and take that desire of
grace for grace it selfe, and a
pledge of further grace to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
hereafter. Thou saist thou
feelest not Gods loue in thee, and
therefore he loueth thee not, but
doe the Lord no iniurie, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
not his grace by thy feeling,
he that tooke a rib out of mans
side, while he slept in such sorte
that he felt it not, can also put a
secret hand of grace into thee, to
vphold thee while his spirit doth
sleepe in thee, and thou not feele
it, and for the proofe of that I say
consider with me, how often
haue many beene tempted to
mischiefe themselues and others,
yea and practised their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10083:13"/>
which yet are liuing, and
well? from whence came this, but
from a secret hand of God within
them that still plucked them as a
praie out of the hands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.
Some againe (that I know)
haue bene afraid that they should
speake blasphemie against God &amp;
treason against the Queene, and
haue beene so tempted the runto,
that they haue held their mouthes
with their hands least it should out,
and yet when they haue beene wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to vtter it, they could not, but
cleane contrarie, in stead of treason
and blasphemie haue spoken all
good in most heartie &amp; holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that might be both of God and
of the Queene, by which they haue
perceiued &amp; confessed in the end
to Gods great glory, that these were
illusions of sathan, and that Gods
spirit is stronger in them then the
temptation, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had suposed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10083:13"/>
that God had cleane forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.
Oh I am damned, I am da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned thou
criest: who told thee so? Surely it
is the voyce of Sathan that would
haue it so, beleeue him not, for he
that is compounded all of lying
and falshood cannot possibly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
any trueth vnto thee. Oh if I
could feele some comfort in my
soule, I were well: if I could pray
from a feeling heart and beleeue ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
&amp;c. then I were wel. Then
I should hope that God would be
mercifull vnto me: but content thy
selfe: there is a time for all things
saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> a time to weepe, and
a time to reioyce, so there is a time
of affliction, and a time of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
out of temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if that time
were come that thou speakest of,
then were thy afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at an end, &amp;
the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mptation of no force not effect,
but now is the time of casting down
&amp; of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pters forcible working
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10083:14"/>
but waite on God, he is thy present
helpe and thy God, with patience
possesse thy soule vntill the time
be come for thy deliuerance, and
verely when Gods rods haue had
their working, to frame thee vnto
God, the time will come that thou
shalt haue diluerance, though
now thou sayest with <hi>Dauid, Lord
why standest thou farre off? and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thy face, euen in the time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi>
yet after the conflict is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(which must be when God
will, and not when thou wilt) thou
shalt sing ioyfully &amp; triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Lord thou hast heard the desire of
thy poore seruant, thou preparest thine
heart, thou bendest thine eare, to helpe
thy poore comfortlesse seruant that
thy hellish enemie be no more cause of
feare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, that in time of thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
conflict, thy soule may hope
for some more comfort &amp; strength
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10083:14"/>
in the ende then for the present
thou feelest, it shall not be amisse
for thee to call to mind the former
experience that thou hast had of
Gods goodnes towards thee in
time past, whereby thou maist
assure thy selfe that he wil be good
vnto thee againe, as <hi>Dauid</hi> said,
<hi>The Lord that hath deliuered me from
the Beare and the Lion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 37.</note> 
               <hi>will also deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
me from this vncircumcised phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime:</hi>
so say thou, That God which
deliuered mee from such a perill,
and gaue me strength against such
and such temptations, will one
day deliuer me from this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God
which once let me feele peace and
ioy, and comfort in Christ, will
surely giue me comfort againe
when he seeth fit time: For whom
the lord loueth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 1.</note> he loueth for euer.
And the gifts and calling of God
are without repentance saith the<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29.</note>
Apostle. Thy treasure is laide vp
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10083:15"/>
surely in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saith Christ, where
neither mothes can eate it, nor
rust can corrupt it,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 20.</note> nor theeues can
digg through and steale it away,
God doth not keep it from moths
and from theeues to let the deuill
deceiue thee of it, no, it is sure for
euer, where neither man, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
nor all the deuils in hell shall
take it from thee, no nor God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
for though we be vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet he is faithfull,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 23.</note> and cannot
denie himselfe. And where as thou
criest out for it now, saying thou
canst not feele it in thy heart &amp;c.
it is for that perhaps thou diddest
not vse it as thou shouldest, when
thou haddest it before, thou wert
peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture a lazy professor of the
Gospell, or a proud hearer of the
word, or negligent in the worship
of God, both with thy selfe and thy
familie, or it may be thou diddest
waxe proud of Gods graces, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10083:15"/>
diddest not giue him his due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or it may be thou diddest
make some rash promise (presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vpon thy owne strength)
that thou wouldest do this or that,
or that thou wouldest neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
such and such a sinne againe.
And therfore the Lord (to let thee
know thy selfe) like a most wise fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath for a time taken away his
graces from thee, and the feeling
of all spirituall comfort, and yet
for all that loueth thee as his
child. And heerein the Lorde
dealeth with thee, but as thou
wouldest deale with thy owne
childe if thou hast anie; when
the childe abuseth anie thing
that he delighteth in it is taken
from him, and laide vp till
another time, and he made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that it is quite taken
from him, the childe woulde
haue it alwaies in his sight,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10083:16"/>
but that may not be for diuers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
and in like manner dealeth the
Lord with his children, it sufficed
<hi>Iacob</hi> to heare that his sonne <hi>Ioseph</hi>
was aliue, though he saw him not,
so it should suffice the afflicted
conscience to know that Christ li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in him, though his spirituall
eye be so dazeled, that as yet he
cannot see him, yea there is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desire to see and feele Christ in
thee, as an earnest-penny, though
it be as in a bag sealed vp, and in
time it shalbe deliuered thee, yea
though thou goest as a malefactor
that is condemned goeth to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
out of all hope for life, yet
(as some friend of his sueth out his
pardon for him, and deliuereth it
him euen when he is on the ladder
readie to be turned of, to his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ioy more then he expected, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to Christ Iesus hath sued out
thy pardon, and when thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10083:16"/>
there is no waie but one with
thee, and that is to hell, euen when
thou seemest to thy selfe to be past
all hope of recouery, then shall the
spirit of Christ step vp in thy heart,
which now seemeth to be gone,
or to lie a sleepe, and shall deliuer
it vnto thee, with this message of
comfort, <hi>Sonne be of good cheere thy
sinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> And in the
meane time know that Christ is
not gone from thee but sleepeth in
thee, as he did in the ship, and that
was but onely during the tempest,
but when they in the ship were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of sinking, they cried, Saue vs
Master we perish else, and then he
awaked and rebuked the winds: so
Christ may seeme to sleep in thee
during the time of tempestuous
temptations, but whensoeuer
thou art in any danger, he is
awake to saue thee, and in the
end will rebuke Sathan and tread
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10083:17"/>
him vnder thy feete; that Christs
spirit is in thee thou maiest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
by the voyce of the Church
that is in thy case: In my bed by
night (saith the Church) I sought
him whom my soule loueth,<note place="margin">Can. 5. 1.</note> but
could not finde him, so thou
seeekest him whom thy soule lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
but canst not finde him, that
is, thou seekest him whom thou
hast with thee, for there is in thee
the loue of Christ, which cannot
come, but from Christ himselfe,
now the very loue of Christ in thy
heart though it be but weake, yet
is a certaine argument of Christs
sanctifying spirit in thee, for
though the reprobate may in
some sort slauishly tremble at
the iudgements of God, and for
some carnall respect, ioye in the
things of God for a time, yet there
is not in them a loue of God in
Christ Iesus: but with their seruile
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10083:17"/>
feare is ioyned also a deadly hatred
of the Lord as of their mortall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</p>
            <p>Againe if thou feele not as yet
the gracious presence of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in thee as thou wouldest,<note place="margin">Psa. 43. 5.</note> yet vse
the holy means that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the conuersion &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of his children; frequent
the word preached, read in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
&amp; labours of the godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
vse praier, &amp; conference, and
meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; so wait on God, who
is thy present helpe and thy God,
but thou saist thou canst not heare
with delight, thou canst take no
pleasure in reading of good books,
nor hearing of them redd vnto
thee, thou canst not brooke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and praier, thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
distast them all, yet I say vse
them still, as a good man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
meate and drinke, and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
though it be against the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10083:18"/>
stomacke, and cast vp all againe,
yet he desireth to digest it, and so
by often taking, at last doth gather
strength, and take that willingly
with hope, which before hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
against his will with a kind
of loathing. So thy sicke soule by
often vsing the holy meanes that
God hath appointed, at last
through his blessing will strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
thee, and make thee to vse them
of loue &amp; desire, which now thou
doest but vnchearfully and with a
certaine kind of loathing. There is
a defect in the stomacke or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the body which will
not suffer wholsome meate to be
digested; So in the inward man, the
defect may be in the vnderstanding
which may be darke, or in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
which may be brittle, or in the
vtterance which may be slowe,
or in thy faith which may be weak,
or in thy repentance which may be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10083:18"/>
imperfect, or in thy loue which
may be small, or in thy zeale which
may be bitter or colde, or in thy
minde which may be earthly, or in
thy affections which may be vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
or in thy whole man which
may be lumpish, heauie, and vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to good things: yet in all
these remaine a double comfort.
First these graces are not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet,
but in trueth are such as they
seeme to be, thou vnderstandest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
thou vtterest the trueth
though but slowly, thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest
the best things, and beleeuest
the word, and repentest in trueth,
with hatred of thy sins, and thou
louest God and his word for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
sake: againe so much as thou
vnderstandest and knowest, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrest,
&amp; beleeuest, &amp; louest,
thou also affectest &amp; embracest in
heart, &amp; desirest to grow in them,
&amp; to practise them to the praise of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10083:19"/>
God, and therfore still hope and
wait on God, for though God
seeme now to thy soule as if he had
no care of thee, yet he doth care
for thee, and thou shalt one day
ioyfully sing as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth heere:
<hi>Lord, thou hast heard the desire of
the poore, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord, thou hast heard, &amp;c.</hi>) The
Lord doth heare all mens desires,
and knoweth all their thoughtes
long before, but he is said to heare
the desires of his children after a
more speciall, and gracious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
because he doth in mercy both
fauour their sutes, and grant their
requests, &amp; so this word of hearing
is to be vnderstood somtime in the
scripture, as where <hi>Dauid</hi> saith: <hi>If
I regard wickednes in my heart the
Lord will not heare me:</hi> that is, the
Lord will not grant me my desire.
And so is it taken also sometime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
vs in our common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10083:19"/>
of speaking, as when we doe
not fauour a mans suite, we use to
say, I heare you not. This is that
which the children of God doe
most groane and long for in praier,
namely to pray so, that the Lord
may heare them, that is, may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them a gracions hearing,
which if they may be assured of,
then are their hearts filled with ioy
whatsoeuer happeneth to them in
the world. And al their feare is, least
their sins and sinful praiers should
stop the eares not of the Lord sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie,
but of his grace and fauour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. To that end doe they
come before the Lord in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
feare, and reuerence, striuing,
sighing, and groaning and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in spirit. And to this end the
Lord oftentimes seemeth vnto
his children as one that is deafe,
he maketh them no answere,
but takes away from them for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10083:20"/>
the time all feeling of comfort in
praier, to that ende that when he
doth speake peace vnto their harts,
they may know what a mercy they
haue receiued from his Maiestie.</p>
            <p>But wicked hypocrites regard
not so much whether the Lord
doth heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or no, but whether
men do heare them, that is all their
care: they pray to be seene of men,
and to be heard of men, onelie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
with their lips, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anie strife of the heart. They
pompe it, they chant it, they howle
it, and throate it to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
and others, but whether all
that paines of theirs be accepted
with God, they neuer so much as
once thinke: So that when they
haue done their stint and taske,
they may saie as the harlot said, of
whom <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Pro. 7. 14.</note> 
               <hi>To daie
I had peace-offerings, I haue payed
my vowes,</hi> and so leaue for that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10083:20"/>
matter, it is no matter whether
they be receiued or no, she hath
paid them, so saith the Hipocrit, I
haue said all my praiers to day, I
haue done al my deuotion, &amp; there
leaue for that matter; but the poore
child of God whose soule groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vnder the buthen of his sins,
doth not so much boast of the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his praiers, as he doth of
Gods mercy in hearing his praiers,
Lord I thank thee saith (the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie)
that I fast and praie so often in
a weeke, but Lord be mercifull
to me saith the Publican, Lord I
praied in thy temple saith the one,
as the wicked in the Gospell, Lord
we haue heard thee preach in our
streets; but the other saith, Lord,
thou hast heard the desire of thy
poore seruants,<note place="margin">Doctr. 3.</note>, blessed be thy name
for that fauour: <hi>the desire.</hi> He doth
not say their cryings, or their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
and eloquent praiers, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10083:21"/>
the voice of their lips, although
the desires of the heart be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
cryings with the Lord, but he
saith: <hi>That the Lord hath heard
the desire of the poore:</hi> Which
are the cries and praiers, and
voices of the inwarde man,
though not alwaies vttered by
the tongue, to shewe that the
Lord of his goodnes is so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to heare the afflicted, that
he doth not alwaies expect the
cryings, and voyces of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
man, or the orderly and
set praiers of the lips, for before
they cry, he heareth them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the testimonie of the
Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> who (speaking
in the person of God) saith thus:
<hi>Before they call I will aunswere,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eisai. 65. 24</note>
               <hi>and while they speake I will heare.</hi>
And Saint <hi>Paule</hi> sayeth. The
spirit it selfe likewise helpeth
our infirmities, for wee know
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10083:21"/>
not what to praye as wee
ought: but the spirit maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
for vs with groaninges,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20</note>
which cannot be expressed: that
is, the spirite helpeth our weake
prayers which want strength to
come forth, and accepteth the
verie sighes and groanes of the
heartes of Gods children in stead
of prayers, as the tender nurse
doth the monefull lookes of the
babe that lyeth in the cradle
full of payne, and cannot
speake.</p>
            <p>And these inwarde desires,
and groanes of GODS chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
are to the children of God
as an earnest-pennie of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and as the first fruites of
the spiritituall haruest, now an
earnest-pennie is but a pledge
or assurance of a thousande
pounde to be payed in time,
and the first fruits of the corne are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10083:22"/>
but a sheafe or handfull as it were
of the whole haruest which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
is to be reaped. And this
may serue to comfort the afflicted
conisciences which cannot pray
as they would sometime and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thinke they are not regarded
of God, it serueth onely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the afflicted soule I say, but
no way to confirme vs in our slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish,

            <p>
               <hi>Of the poore.</hi>) The state of Gods
children in this life is not alwaies
of the best,<note place="margin">Doctr 4.</note> neither in outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with the world, nor yet in
their owne feeling. And therfore
they are called sometime: The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
ones,<note place="margin">Pro. 15. 15</note> as in <hi>Pro. 15. 15. All
the daies of the afflicted are euill:</hi>
Sometime the hungry and thirstie,
as in <hi>Mat. 5. Blessed are those that
hunger and thirst after righteousnes.</hi>
Sometime little wormes as in <hi>Esay,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10083:22"/>
Little worme Iacob:</hi> And in the
Psalmes, <hi>I am a worme and no man,</hi>
saith <hi>Dauid:</hi> And sometime,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>The
little flocke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> As in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. And in
this place they are called,<note place="margin">Psa. 41. 8.</note> 
               <hi>The poore:</hi>
For whosoeuer will liue godly in
Christ Iesus must suffer affliction.
And they doe still hunger &amp; thirst
after Christ their righteousnes:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the Hart doth after the riuers of
water,</hi> Like little wormes they are
contemned and trodden vpon by
euerie one: And like poore and
miserable persons they are alwaies
in need of Gods grace and helpe.
And yet they in that account with
God that he heareth their desires:
The afficted haue a continualfeast,
The hungry shalbe filled with good
things, when the rich shalbe sent
emptie away. The little worme <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
is written vpon the palmes of
the Lords hands, and is euer in his
sight. The little flocke neede not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10083:23"/>
feare for their littlenes, for they
haue the kingdome. And the
poore seruants of God which are
alwaies in need and want of Gods
grace and fauour, and alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
their owne pouertie and
want, are heard of the Lord, and
therefore are both rich and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye.</p>
            <p>This may teach vs to iudge
wisely of the poore children of
GOD that are in contempt, and
tribulation in the worlde; and
louingly to embrace them as
members of our bodie though
in shewe vnderlinges to all; like
the feete, or rather like the
footstooles of the wicked, and
not to despise them: <hi>For the
Lorde heareth the desires euen of
the poore.</hi> Yea and they may
pleasure vs more with their
praiers, then we can hurt them
with our persecutions. There
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10083:23"/>
is not the best, nor learnedest
Doctor in the Church, nor
the greatest or wealthiest man in
the commonwealth but may, and
doth receiue helpe and benefit by
the praiers of the poorest man
that liueth, if he be a godlie
man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou preparest, &amp;c.</hi> Heere
<hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledgeth a double
grace or fauour of God, First,
that he vpholdeth his children,
that they fainte not vnder their
burthens, for he armeth them
with courage, and patience,
putting vpon their heades the
helmet of good hope, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them vp, thereby to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
their prayers as speedie
postes and messengers vnto the
hilles from whence commeth
their helpe. A singular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
surelie to haue our senses
and thoughtes setled in Gods
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10083:24"/>
prouidence, and not caried awaie
to worldlie deuises, and desperate
attempts. Secondly, God hauing
thus prepared &amp; setled their harts
for praier, he doth also prepare &amp;
settle himselfe to heare their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
yea, because their praiers be
but weake and feeble, that scarce
haue any perfect voice, but make
a soft and still noise, in the secret
corners of their hearts, the Lord
doth bend his eare vnto them, and
laie it close vnto their mouth, in
most fatherly, friendly, and tender
sort, that so he might know what it
is that they whisper so inwardly,
&amp; so faintly. from hence we learne.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Doctr. 5.</note> that to direct our desires
to God in affliction is a speciall
worke, and fauour of God in our
hearts, for otherwise, affliction of
it selfe doth breede rather impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and dispaire, then any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
hope, and heart to praier.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10083:24"/>
And therfore let vs be admonished
when (in any kind of affliction,
crosse, and temptation) we feele
any comfort in God, or desire to
goe vnto his Maiestie, by praier to
giue him the whole glorie, and
take it as a token of his loue vnto
vs. Let vs also acknowledge our
owne weaknesse, and inabilitie to
prepare our hearts, our selues to
Godward. And most false, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
is that popish assertion of
freewill in man to praie when he
will, and to beleeue when he will,
and repent when he will, for it is
God (saith the Apostle) that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
both the will and the deede.
Lastly,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> let vs hereby be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to goe to God although it be
with broken praiers, and fainting
desires, we shall not loose our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
no the godly doe not in
vaine direct their desires to God,
nor in hope and patience want
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10083:25"/>
vpon him because the eares of
the Lord are open and bent, ready
in most gracious manner to heare
the groanes of his poore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
seruants. And thus much
of the manner and matter in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

<hi>Dauid</hi> praiseth God
for hearing the desires

what was their desire, and
wherein God hath heard them at
the last, namely, they desire
that GOD woulde iudge and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10083:26"/>
determine betweene them &amp; their

that God hath granted them, from
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the faithfull may learne this

that when they shalbe vniustly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
God at length wilbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged
of their aduersaries, and
deliuer his children; which may
serue to admonish vs to endure the
crosse manfully, because God will
not many times helpe his poore
children before they be brought to
extreame danger. A hard thing
this is to flesh and blood, because
euery one desireth to be free from
trouble, and therfore except God
doth quickly helpe, he seemeth
to be slow in helping or forgetfull
of his promises (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
we should imagine) but if we

may prouoke the fauour of
God, and to this purpose is that
parable of the poore Widow and
the wicked Iudge propounded by
our Sauiour Christ in the Gospell
and in this sort applied to God and
his children: that if a wicked Iudge
fearing neither God nor man,<note place="margin">Luke. 18. 7</note> will
notwithstanding be ouercome
with importunate suters at last to
doe them iustice, how much more
will God that is a most righteous
Iudge, and all righteousnes it selfe,
heare at length his poore children
which call and crie day and night
vnto him for Iustice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That earthly man, &amp;c.</hi>) The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

subiect to many miseries, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

for this is their insolent madnes,
and mad insolencie, while they
forget their estate, and condition
they breath out threateninges
as <hi>Saul</hi> did against the Church of
God, as if God himselfe were not
sufficient to represse their rage.
And yet they are but men, &amp; men
of earth too, &amp; come against God
as if wormes should come out of

should encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with a mountaine

the stoutest, the brauest, &amp; the

And that may be either in regard of

of their great inability to effect that

and borne of weakenes,
worse then a dunghill? Is he not
brought vp in ignorance &amp; blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
in folly and vanitie? Is not
he against God, and God against
him? His life is death, and his
death is double, temporall, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,

betweene his poore seruants, and
their oppressors. This is that for
want whereof he complaineth in
the first verse. This is it for wante
wherof the wicked were so lusty to
contemne God. By this he will
breake the armes, that is, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the wicked and search out
their wickednes. This is the poore
Churches desire, namely a iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

God prepared their hearts, and
to this ende doth the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline

his eare vnto them, namely,
To sit in iudgment vpon the poore
mans case, So that, when God
doth proceede against the wicked
it is in iudgement. And though the
poore commit his cause vnto God,
yet it shalbe iudged, and without
a iudiciall proceeding shall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be done: for God is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accepter
of persons as men be,
though he loueth the godly, yet
they shall stand to their triall, and
though he hateth the wicked, yet
they shall haue their triall, all shall
be iudged, and all wronges shall
be righted by iudgement: therfore
it is saide in the Psalme, <hi>The Lord

               <note place="margin">Psa. 67. 4.</note> This

            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:10083:32"/>And here now we see that verified
which is in <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 5.<note place="margin">Psal. 126. 5.</note> 
               <hi>They that
sow in teares, shall reape in ioy:</hi> And
that which we haue in a prouerbe.
A hard beginning maketh a good
ending, for one woulde haue
thought by <hi>Dauids</hi> beginning of
this Psalme, that he should not
haue made so good an end, for thus
he beginneth: <hi>Why doest thou hide
thy selfe aad stand a farr off O Lord in
time of affliction?</hi> That is, Why
haue we not iustice? but he endeth
as you heare: <hi>Lord thou hast hearde
the desire of the poore, to iudge,</hi> &amp;.
which is as much as can be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
But let vs reason a little with
<hi>Dauid</hi> abou this matter. How is
it that thou beginning so rudely
doest speed so well in the end? If
the God of heauen should haue
dealt with thee <hi>Dauid,</hi> as the Gods
of the earth doe with their suters,
it were a wonder that euer thou
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10083:32"/>
shouldest finde so much fauour,
for though thy matter were good,
yet thou mightest haue marred it
in the handling, thou diddest vtter
one speach that was inough to
haue spilled all: <hi>Why doest thou
hide thy selfe, &amp;c.</hi> What an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent,
rash, and vnaduised speach
was this to vtter to the Lord of
Heauen and Earth? would the
Gods of the earth haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such a
speach at thy hand, or at any poore
mans hand? No <hi>Dauid</hi> no, many
haue sustained great wrong by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, and haue had good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that for such a word, yea for a
lesse offence then thine haue bene
very hardly dealt withal, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
haue but craued iustice &amp;c. Now
thy fault is greater, and God is a
seuere God, it is to be maruailed
then how thou diddest escape, and
speede so well as thou diddest</p>
            <p>It is true indeed (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10083:33"/>
I confesse my frailtie, and my fault
to be great, and so must they also
that speake rashly before Gods
Magistrates, but if the Lord should
narrowly marke euery word that is
spoken or euery thing that is done
amisse as men doe, who coulde
stand before him? No, the Lord
knoweth whereof we be made, and
considereth in mercy that through
extreame heate of passionate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and weaknes of faith his
children be caried many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
themselues, but vpon their
humble submission, and vnfained
repentance he freely forgiueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
though men will not. Yea the Lord
in mercie doth put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his seruants, &amp; his enemies
though men many times will not,
I recanted my opinion and sayde,
The Lord is king for euer and euer,
&amp; for all my rude beginning haue
through Gods mercy obtained a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10083:33"/>
good ending: <hi>Praised be the Lord
which hath hearde the desire of the
poore, to iudge the fatherlesse, and the
poore, that the man of earth cause to
feare no more.</hi> A notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for earthen Gods, magistrates
I meane, to follow, and not with
bitternes, and rigour to censure,
and in extremitie to prosecute e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie slip,
and aduantage of poore
ministers, and other honest men
when they come to complaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, but with loue &amp; words
of graue and gracious counsell to
heale, or at least to couer the sore,
least the vncircumcised doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
and triumph ouer their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and brethren, as cursed <hi>Cham</hi>
did at his fathers nakednes. And
so much for the bringing of the
beginning, and ending of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
petition together. Nowe
let vs heare a little more of the
thing it selfe that the Lord hath
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10083:34"/>
granted, and that is this, that it
will please his Maiestie to heare &amp;
determine betweene his poore
people on the one side, and their
cruell oppressors on the other side.
In all respects it may be resembled
vnto a purchased Assises, wherin
we are to consider, First the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
betweene whom the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
dependeth, Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom it is to be tried. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by whom it must be tried.
Fourthly, the action that is to be
tryed. Fiftly, the verdict of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Sixtly the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Iudge.
And lastly the execution of the
sentence. And this course we may
safely take, both because Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

haue giuen thee will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

to descerne of causes, and
memorie as a register to recorde
thy causes, and conscience as a

determine of all thy proceedings.
And this Court is called the Court
of Conscience, thou shalt also be
tried by that. In that Court be
many examinations, many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and many recordes. The

many sentences in tables fayrely

Perhaps thou wilt saie, they that

thee and disquieted thee, and
therefore they are not thy friends,
I know it well, and therefore thou
wouldest not heare them: Thou
hast also disquieted and vexed
them, and therefore wouldest be
loath to be tried by them, I know
also thy corrupt dealing with that
Court, how with false perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thou hast blinded reason, and
peruerted iudgement, how thou
hast fed vnderstanding with false
informations and blinded her eyes
with false loue, how thou hast put
the two Iudges out of commission
the loue of God, and the loue of
thy neighbour, &amp; in steed of them
hast aduanced selfeloue, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10083:39"/>
How ignorance and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
haue pleaded thy matters,

haue beene thy assistantes, and

into their handes. And this is the
verdict of the Courte of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which doth finde him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
also of much more, as namely
of hypocrisie, of vaineglorie, of
conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of Gods word, of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt
of man, and of diuers villanous
practises done in secret, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10083:44"/>
are knowen onely to God, for
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith. If our heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
vs,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 20</note> God is greater then our
heart and knoweth all things. And
thus much for the triall of the man
of earth. Now let vs heare the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Iudge.</p>
            <p>Man of earth (saith the Iudge)
thou hast beene endited of diuers
and sundrie enditements, to the
which thou hast pleaded not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and yet notwithwanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tried by the grand Iurie of the
holy Prophets, and men of God,
as also by the verdict of the Court
of thy owne conscience, hast
beene conuicted, and found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of them all. Therefore nowe
what canst thou say for thy selfe,
why sentence of eternall death
should not be pronounced against
thee according to the lawe? In
earthlie iudgementes, this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10083:44"/>
is put to two sortes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
First, such as are quitt by
booke, Secondly to such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
haue that benefit. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in this heauenly iudgement.
This question is propounded
both to the elect, as also to the
reprobate. To the elect it is said,
what canst thou say for thy selfe?
They staight waie condemne
themselues as <hi>Dauid</hi> did of bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltinesse.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 51. as <hi>Iob</hi> did
his children for blaspheming
GOD in their mirth and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinges,
as <hi>Peter</hi> did his fall
from Christ, euen with bitter
teares, and as <hi>Paule did,</hi>
who saide, he was a chiefe sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
crying out, O wretched
man that I am &amp;c. and as the
prodigall childe did: Father I
haue sinned against Heauen,
and against thee, and am no more
worthie to be called thy sonne,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10083:45"/>
but yet for them (thus condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and humbling themselues)
there is some comfort: VVhat,
canst thou beleeue in me, (saith
the Iudge) and repent from the
bottome of thy heart, canst thou
read thy name in the booke of life?
To which question euery one doth
answere as he is prompted by the
spirit of God, I beleeue and repent
but not of my selfe, it is the gift of
God, I beleeue, Lord helpe my
vnbeliefe. And with <hi>Zaccheus</hi>
they promise restitution of goods
ill gotten.<note place="margin">Luke. 19. 8</note> And with <hi>Dauid</hi> they
pray: <hi>Oh that my waies were so dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 119.</note>
               <hi>that I might keepe thy statutes

thou any heartie desire so to doe?
for otherwise thou sayest no more
then the Deuils doe, who beleeue
and tremble. No Lord: I know
not what that meaneth. It is true in
deed, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou wert admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to repent, thou hardenest thine
heart, abusing my patience, and
making a custome of sinne, which
hath bred full hardnes of heart,
and impenitencie in thee, and so
hast heaped vp vnto thy selfe
wrath against this day of wrath,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note>
and reuealing of my righteous

that thou haddest faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance at commandement, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
thy selfe and others that

and will doe againe when I can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

rather then goe to hell. Ah thou
reprobate (saith the Lord) who
required all this at thy hands? doest
thou thinke to please me with thy
wil-worship, and spirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms?
all that wil not serue thy turn
thy name is not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the book

(saith the Lord) so hast thou and

&amp; do thee no wrong. Therfore now
heare thy finall sentence, because
thou hast abused thy arme, that is,
the power, wealth, &amp; authority that
I gaue thee, &amp; hast not at any time
loued me for my mercy, nor feared
me for my iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, lo, therfore thy

of all meanes wherby thou
hast bin encouraged to do mischief,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10083:48"/>
and then thou shalt be no more
cause of feare: my people shall goe
and liue without feare of thee. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
thou shalt goe from hence to
the place from whence thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note>
and that is to the earth: For
out of the Dust wert thou taken,
and to the dust shalt thou returne
againe. And from thence to the
place of execution in hell, and
there shalt thou hang in torments
intollerable, and perpetuall, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Deuill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
where shall be weeping and
wailing, aud gnashing of teeth for
euer. Thou shalt haue blacke
fame for thy herault, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
shame for thy hearse, feare
and terrour shall be dealt for
thy doale, and the curses of the
poore shall follow thee to thy
graue. And this is briefely the
substance of the sentence of the
reprobate man of earth, which is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10083:48"/>
yet but a shadow of that which it
is indeed, for indeed it will be
more grieuous and terrible when
it commeth, then is possible for
all the tongues of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to expresse. Now a little of
the execution of this sentence.</p>
            <p>In earthly iudgements, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth not alwaies presently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the sentence of the iudge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for some are repriued vpon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consideration,<note place="margin">Of the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> some are after
a while committed to the gallies,
and perpetuall slauerie, some are
sodenly hanged vp, not knowing
of the time when, nor the place
where vntill the very instant. And
some haue knowledge both of the
time and place before hand, that
they may be prepared for death.
So is it also in this heauenly iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.
Some are repriued, and liue
long, yet still in the prison of sinne
and slauerie of the Deuill, which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10083:49"/>
is to encrease their torment, some
are sodenly taken, and speedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
without recouerie being
brought by the righteous hand of
God into euil in the middest of the
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation as apeareth in <hi>Pro. 6.
15.</hi> Some are longer in languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paines &amp; torments then some,
euen in this world for one and the
same fault.</p>
            <p>There be three causes for which
the Lord doth defer the ful execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of iudgement vpon the wicked,
the first is, to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
miserie, for all good things turne
to their euill, the second is to
plague them with their owne
sinne, for there cannot be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mischiefe then to be a wicked
man, and to liue long in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
for when he hath serued the
deuill, the deuill shall pay him his
wages, and that sinne wherunto he
hath beene most enclined, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10083:49"/>
whereof he looked for the greatest
pleasure and profite, shall worke
him the greatest plague and woe.
The third cause is, that they may
liue and punish vs which are the
children of GOD, who haue
beene alreadie crossed and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by them, and are neuer the
better, but when he hath worne
them as rods to the stumpes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the backes of his stubburne
children, and well humbled vs
by them, he will then cast his
rods into the fire. God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
not as earthlie iudges
doe, to content them that
haue receiued the wrong, or to
satisfie the worlde, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hateth sinne, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
righteousnesse, and drawe
thereout greate glorie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and singular good to
his children. The vse of this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10083:50"/>
Doctrine may serue to terrifie the
wicked, who vse to make but a iest
of the iudgements of God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
what? so long yet? till
doomes day? &amp;c. but it is not so
lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as they dreame, for the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of God is begunne many times to
be executed vpon the wicked, euen
when they least feele it, for it is
a iudgement of it selfe to be past
feeling of Gods iudgement when
they sinne: It serueth also to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the godly, who thinke the
time long till the Lord take the
wicked in hand which do oppresse
and vexe them. Lastly let it serue
to admonish all of vs to looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our waies, and to liue so, as
that when God shall get vp vnto
his iudgement seat, we may be
found, in Christ our great suertie
vnblameable, and so escape the
fearefull and irrecouerable sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10083:50"/>
of the wicked and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and on the other side may
receiue our <hi>quietus est,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
with Gods elect in Christ
Iesus. To whom with the Father
and the holy Spirit, be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

for euermore.</p>
