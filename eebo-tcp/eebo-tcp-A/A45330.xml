         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

they are the two Butts that he specially

batter his Kingdom: Where <hi>Moses</hi> and

greater Visible Reformation in one year (when we
had an<note n="*" place="margin">Col. Greavis.</note> active, prudent, pious Iustice in the
Parish) then in twenty before, notwithstanding all
my preaching and assisting of the Officers.</p>
                        <p>There should therefore be a sweet Harmony
and mutual assistance between Magistrates and
Ministers, since the one helps to uphold the other,

of each other. The Minister wants the ayd of
the Magistrate in Temporals; and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
wants the Ministers ayd in Spiritual and
eternal blessings. The Minister hath need of the
<pb facs="tcp:96886:4"/>
Magistrates sword to defend him against unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
men; and the Magistrate hath need of
the Ministers ayd to maintain his authority in the
consciences of men, (<hi>Titus</hi> 3. 1.) This made a
Learned Magistrate to say, <hi>Were it but for our
felves (viz.</hi> for the upholding of Magistracy)
<hi>we had need to uphold the Ministery.</hi> Tis State-Policy
and Church-Policy so to do; for without
Ministers men may live <hi>commodiously,</hi> but not
<hi>Piously;</hi> and without Magistrates men may live
<hi>Piously,</hi> but not <hi>peaceably and commodiously;</hi>
like stones in an Arch these two help to uphold
each other. Hence good <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> joyned <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Levites</hi> together, the better to promote
and countenance Religion in the Land, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
17. 8.) Tis a great mercy to Magistrates when
they have good Ministers to assist and instruct
them, it makes them prosper as King <hi>Uzziah</hi>
did when he had a good <hi>Zachariah,</hi> who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in the Visions of God, to counsel him,

they be earthly Gods, yet they must die like men;

it is, that the bare singing of it at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
the Sabbath before the Iudges were to
Vote concerning Ship-money, brought the man
into question that caused it to be sung: and yet
the Psalm was composed (as the Learned conceive)
that it might be sung either at the Creation of new
Magistrates, or else before the old Ones,
before they went to the Judgement Seat.</p>

in the Psalm, wherein are matters of the greatest

hearing and obeying of them, he sets a short, but
pithy Preface before them. (Exod. 20. 2) <hi>I am
the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the Land

slavery of sin and Satan, from the Curse of the

before <hi>the Lords Prayer,</hi> the better to prepare our

because he was a Christian, cast off his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,

                        <p>2. In Scripture we find Rules for Rulers (<hi>Exod.
18. 21. Deut.</hi> 1. 16, 17. &amp; 25. 1. <hi>Psal. 2. 10. Rom.</hi>
13. 3, 4.) Now these would be in vain if there were
no Rulers to observe them.</p>
                        <p>3. God oftsends men to the Magistrate for help
in their distress, <hi>Exod. 22. 9. Deut. 17. 8.</hi> This God
would not do if the Office were unlawfull.</p>
                        <p>Object. <hi>These are Old Testament proofs. Answ.</hi> Christ
sends us to the Magistrate in the New, <hi>Mat. 5. 25.
Luke 12. 58. Paul</hi> when in danger of his life, appeals
to the Magistrate, which he would not have done,
had it been a sin.</p>
                        <p>4. We are commanded to <hi>Pray</hi> for Magistrates
(<hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 17 &amp; 47. 10. <hi>Ier. 29. 7. 1 Tim. 2. 2</hi>)
but if their Office were evil, we should rather pray
against them; Now we are to pray for nothing but
what is good and pleasing unto God.</p>
                        <p>5. Christ who is the eternal Wisdom of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
tells us that <hi>'tis by him that Kings reign and
Princes decree Iustice, yea Nobles and all Iudges of
the earth,</hi> Prov. 8. 15, 16 not only Superiour, but
also Inferiour Rules are appointed by Christ; he sets
up not only Kings, but Princes and Nobles also; from
him they have their Ordination, Conservation and
Qualifications; 'tis he that gifts them with wisdom
to make good and just Laws for the benefit and
peace of their people. Tis he that pulls down one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96886:16"/>
and sets up another in the Throne, and none may
say unto him, What dost thou? <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 12 &amp; 12. 18.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 34. 24.</p>
                        <p>6. The Lord commands Subjects to obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and give Honour, and pay Tribute to
them; this certainly implies (by the Rule of
Relatives) that there must be Magistrates to whom
this Honour and Tribute is due: And if every soul
must be subject to the Higher Powers, then there
must be Higher Powers; to which men must be
subject. This enjoyning the duty of the Subject,
doth establish the authority of the Magistrate; for
they are Correlatives and Individuals.</p>
                        <p>7. That awe and dread which is in the hearts of
men toward Magistracy,<note place="margin">See 8. Arguments more to prove the lawfulness of the Civil Magistrate, in Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> against the Anabaptist. <hi>Article</hi> 6. p. 153, 154.</note> argues that there is much of
God in it. To see so many thousands of men of
contrary dispositions, and perverse tempers, yet
to live peaceably together under the Government of
one man, shews plainly that the hand of God is here.</p>
                        <p>Object. <hi>But some may</hi> Object, <hi>that if God be the
Author of Magistracy, how is it said (Hosea 8. 4.)</hi>
They set up Kings, but not by me; they made Princes,
and I knew it not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> The Answer is easie,<note place="margin">Multa dicuntur non esse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tis true, I let them go on in their own way, but I
neither did, nor will take cognizance of what they
do so as to bless them in it. Many a man Rules by
Providence, not by promise. So then God doth
not here disclaim the Ordinance of Magistracy, but
the manner of chusing him, <hi>viz.</hi> in a mutiny, and
without any respect to Gods will. Thus <hi>Ieroboam</hi>
(of whom 'tis conceived the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> speaks)
was chosen King by God, <hi>1 Kings</hi> 11. 31. 35. 37.
&amp; 12. 15. 24. but the seditious and disorderly
manner of chusing him is attributed to the people.</p>

Yet what they build with one hand, they presently
pull down with the other, affirming that Magistracy

is an Office displeasing unto God, and unlawfull for
any Christian to bear; they would have a parity
and equality amongst Christians, they would have no
Superiours, nor Inferiours, but all fellow-creatures
well met; as that house is like to be well governed
where all are Governours, so that State is like to be

list, to be Arrians, Arminians, Socinians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is
<hi>Libertinism,</hi> and not spiritual Liberty.</p>
                              <p>2. Though believers as they are in Christ, are all
one and equal, yet considered as they are members
of a Politick body and in civil respects, so there is
an inequality; and though Christ hath freed us from
the curse of the Law, from the Traditions of men
(1 <hi>Cor 7. 23</hi>) and from the Tyranny of sin and Satan:
yet he hath not freed us from Subjection to men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to those ranks and callings he hath set us in:
and therefore even in Gospel times we read of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
and Inferiours, of Masters and Servants,
with directions how they should walk, and promises
of Reward to such as faithfully perform the duties
of their places, <hi>1 Cor. 7. 21, 22. Ephes. 6. 5. to 9.</hi>
So that Magistracy is so far from hindring true
Christian liberty, that it helps to suppress sin, and so
makes us free indeed. Neither is a Politick inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
against a spiritual equality; <hi>Onesimus</hi> was as
good a man as <hi>Philemon,</hi> yet for all that <hi>Onesimus</hi>
was <hi>Philemons</hi> Servant.</p>
                              <p>3. The Scripture speaks of Magistracy as a great
mercy, and not as a misery or burden to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
it calls them nursing Fathers, Shields, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the loss of them is reckoned as a
sore judgement, <hi>Isa. 3. 1. to 5.</hi> and the restoring of
them as a great mercy, <hi>Isa. 1. 26. I will restore thy
Iudges as at the first. 2 Chron. 9. 8.</hi> 'tis made a sign
of Gods love to a people. Let wicked men and
Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> call Government bonds and burdens.
(<hi>Psal. 2. 3.)</hi> yet believers of all men should be the
most obedient to Magistrates (whether they be
good or bad) in all lawfull things, of any people in
the world, that so they may stop the mouths of
gain-sayers, and all the world may see that Rulers
have no better friends then such as make conscience
of their wayes;<note place="margin">See more in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. Pag. 31, 32.</note> for none can be truly loyal, but

to be subject to the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
In the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there were many Saints,
and yet the Apostle commands them all to submit
(in civil things) to the Magistrates of those times
who were profest Heathens and Tyrants.</p>
                              <p>2. The best are flesh as well as spirit, as we see in
<hi>Noah, Lot, David;</hi> and if there were not a Law
without to restrain, as well as a light within, we
know not how far the best may fall; for though
the just be a Law to themselves, yet they have lusts
still within themselves which many times call for
coertion and correction from the Magistrate. A
good man saith, as the Martyr said once at the stake,
when they went to bind him to the stake, That
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96886:21"/>
needs not (said the Martyr) yet since I am flesh
as well as spirit, you may bind me if you please:
So a good man though he hath Gods Law within his
heart, and he delights to do his will, and so need
the less binding; yet since he knows the rebellion
of the flesh and the deceit of his own heart, he
desires as many restraints as may be, to hedge up
his way and keep him from sinning against God.</p>
                              <p>3. Though Gods people be holy and obedient,
yet they are mixt amongst the wicked, and so have
great need of the Magistrates sword to defend them
from the violence of unreasonable men, <hi>1 Tim. 2. 2.</hi>
So that albeit good men should do no evil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(though we see Doves many times and sheep
fight one with another, and have need of some
to part them) yet they may quickly suffer evil,
if the Magistrate and his Laws do not protect
them.</p>
                              <p>4. Though the Law be not made for the <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of the Righteous, yet tis ordained for a Rule
to direct and guide him. This Law he cheerfully
obeys, because it confines him to live in that element
where he would live, as if one should be confined
to Paradise where he would be, though there were
no Law to confine him to it. So then the Magistrate
is not a terrour to him because he doth well, and
doth spontaneously obey his Laws.</p>

are promised as a special blessing (<hi>Isa. 30. 20.

blessing that our Nobles shall be of our selves,
and our Governours shall proceed from the midst
of us, <hi>Ier. 30. 21.</hi> Strangers shall not rule over
them, nor keep them in slavery, but they should
have Governours of their own, that would be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
over them. Tis a sign of Gods love to a people
when he gives them Rulers that will execute justice
amongst them. 1 <hi>Kings 10. 9. 2 Chron.</hi> 2. 11 &amp; 9. 8.
when a people is but willing to obey, Violence
shall no more be heard in the land, nor wasting and
destruction in their borders, but he'l <hi>restore their
Iudges as at the first, and their Counsellors as at the
beginning, (Isa. 1. 25. &amp; 60. 18.</hi>) and under them,
shall all humane abilities be improved to the highest
apex and utmost excellency; all callings, Laws,
Learning, Valour, Religion, Arts and Faculties
thrive and flourish with much happiness and success
under the wings and warmth of a Godly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

may have familiar recourse in our necessities; if the

being proud, loves not the Superiority of others; and

rather then Anarchy. The most unruly know not
how to subsist without a Ruler: even Theeves have
a Leader amongst them; yea and those <hi>Monsters of

order amongst themselves. Tis ill with that state
where men are left like the Fishes of the Sea which
have no Ruler, but the greater devour the less,
<hi>Hab 1. 14.</hi> Where all will rule, there is no rule;
and where there is none to rule, there is all manner
of misrule, as Idolatry, Murder, Plunder, Thefts,
Rapes, Riots and all uncleanness, <hi>Iudges</hi> 17. 4,

Government that is worse then none at all; where
there is Magistracy, some may be opprest and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but none can be righted where there is none at
all. Better poor people should sit under a scratching
bramble, then have no hedge at all to shelter them

19, 20. Hag. 2. ult.</hi> yea though they be Heathens,
yet their power is Gods, and therefore he calls them
his Servants and Ministers, <hi>Rom 13. 4. 6.</hi> Neither
is this Title any diminution to them, but tis the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their Honours that they are Servants to so
great a Master, who is King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords. The Angels those glorious spirits count it
their honour to be Ministring Spirits to such a Lord,
<hi>Heb. 1. 14.</hi> and Christ by way of Honour is called
<hi>Gods Servant, lsa. 42. 1. &amp; 53. 11.</hi> These are the
great Servants of the Common-wealth, endowed
with gifts of prudence, fortitude, clemency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for
the good of others. Neither are they only his
Servants by right of <hi>Creation,</hi> for so all creatures
are his Servants, <hi>Psal. 119. 91.</hi> Nor Secondly by
Right of <hi>Redemption;</hi> for so the elect only are his.
But by special <hi>Delegation</hi> and Commission from God,
by way of Eminency they are called his Servants,
because they are set to serve him in a more excellent
place. Now the more Eminent the Master, the
more Noble is the service. No Master like God,
his work is wages, and such imployment is high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.<note place="margin">Quô sublimior est <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have received their power from God, spend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and all they have for his honour: for albeit
they are Gods amongst men, yet they are but men
with God; the greatest Emperor is but his Minister;

in Power and Dignity, and because of that glory
and excellency wherewith God is pleased eminently
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96886:39"/>
to adorn them. Though <hi>Libertines</hi> reproach them
as Inglorious and fools in <hi>Israel;</hi> yet the Holy Ghost
for-seeing what spirits would arise in Gospel-times,
calls them <hi>Dignities and Higher Powers</hi> in respect of
their Superiority and preheminence above others,
and in respect of those glorious gifts and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which God adorns them withall, whereby
they are fitted for an honourable, fruitfull and
faithfull discharge of their office, as wisdom to
discern between good and evil, clear apprehension,
Magnanimity and Zeal. Thus even <hi>Saul</hi> when he
was made a King, was said to be another man <hi>i. e.</hi> he
was adorned with Prudence, Clemency, Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and other Princely vertues fit for his place,
<hi>1 Sam. 10. 9.</hi> and so was <hi>David, 1 Sam. 16. 13.</hi>
These are the light and glory of a land, of whom
we may say as the people did of <hi>David, that he was
worth ten thousand of them.</hi> 2 Sam. 18. 3. &amp; 21. 17.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>14. Nails and Pins</hi> upon which all the burden
hangs, and therefore they have need to be fastned
in a sure place, keeping close to the Rule of the
word; never till then will they be a glorious
Throne to their Fathers house, <hi>Isa. 22. 23.</hi> Now
the Magistrate is compared to a Nail fastned in a
Wall.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>1.</hi> For <hi>Stability</hi> and firmness; as a Nail driven
into a Wall sticks fast, so God will establish and
confirm the power of Magistracy, that it shall be no
more removed then a Nail that is driven up to the
head, which may be matter of singular comfort to
all faithfull Magistrates, who must look to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with many difficulties and indignities from an
ungratefull world. But he that hath called them
to their honour, will keep them there, and fix them
with his own hand, whilest they walk in his fear,
doing justice and judgement, <hi>Prov. 29. 14.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. In respect of <hi>Vtility;</hi> as a Nail that is fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in a Wall is fit for many uses; so a faithfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96886:39"/>
is many wayes benefical to the people
where God hath fixt him; and as Pins do fasten
Tents, so these help to fix us in our places in peace,
in despight of Oppressors, <hi>Zach. 10. 4.</hi> and as
the beams of a building are fastned and united
by nails one to another; So Magistracy is a means
to unite people together in Society and Amity.</p>
                        <p>3. In respect <hi>of the weighty labours</hi> that lie upon
him. We know every one is apt to clap somewhat
upon a Nail or Pin. Arms, Utensils, Vessels, great and
small we use to hang upon the wall. So the Magistrate
is usually loaded with imployment; every one comes
to him for support, defence and succour. They lay
and leave their loads with him, all the necessary
Utensils of the house hang on this Nail. Upon it
hang Vessels small as well as great; their Justice is
or ought to be as large as <hi>Solomons</hi> wisdom which
extended to the Hyssop, as well as to the Cedar;
<hi>Isa. 22. 24. They shall hang upon him all the glory
of his Fathers house, and all the Vessels of such quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
even little Cups as well as great Flaggons: all
affairs, great and small, and all the weight of the
Common-wealth shall hang on him from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to the lowest. <hi>The glory of a Nation hangs on the
Nail of Government.</hi>

As Ministers are guides
and Bishops in an Ecclesiastical sense, because they
must see to the flock that is committed to their
charge, (<hi>Acts 20. 28. Heb. 13. 7. 17.</hi>) and lead
them both by their light and lives:<note place="margin">Vos estis Episcopi in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

shew that protection is part of good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

This Text alludes to Gospel-times,<note place="margin">Heac Historicè de <hi>Hezekia,</hi> Allegoricè de Christo dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Aquinas.</hi>
                           </note> and is fitly
applied to Christ, but in the Letter it relates to
Rulers and Magistrates, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his Under-Officers.</p>
                        <p>NOW all these Titles of honour God hath
given to Magistrates to encourage them
against those discouragements which they are sure
to meet withall in the faithfull discharge of their
duty.</p>
                        <p>2. It should teach us to lament the loss of good
Magistrates. If he that hath lost a good Father,
Friend, Guardian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot but mourn; how
great then should our mourning be for the loss of a
gratious Prince in whom all those Titles of love and
respect do concenter and meet! When good <hi>Iosiah</hi>
was dead, what bitter lamentation did the people
make, <hi>(2 Chron. 35. 24, 25.)</hi> First <hi>All Iudah</hi> and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96886:42"/>
                           <hi>Ierusalem</hi> mourn for him. 2. Tis with a <hi>great</hi>
mourning; the lamentation for him is put as the
the highest President of mourning, <hi>Zach. 12. 11.</hi>
Great losses call for great lamentation. The loss of
godly Magistrates and godly Ministers, are great
losses, and therefore the Saints lay them deeply to
heart. When <hi>Moses</hi> was dead, the people mourned
for him thirty dayes, <hi>Deut. 34. 8.</hi> when <hi>Samuel</hi> died,
all <hi>Israel</hi> mourned for him, <hi>1 Sam. 25. 1.</hi> yea when
<hi>Saul</hi> a wicked King and <hi>Davids</hi> enemy too, was
dead, yet see how he laments his fall, and makes a
Panegyrick or Funeral Oration in his praise,
<hi>2 Sam. 1. 17, &amp;c.</hi> So good Ministers are spiritual
Fathers, the Chariots and Horsemen of <hi>Israel,</hi> and
therefore we should lay to heart their deaths, <hi>Num.
20. 19. 2 Kings 13. 14. Acts 8. 2.</hi> and the rather
because tis the sins of a people that provoke the
Lord in wrath many times to remove godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and Ministers from amongst us.</p>
                        <p>3. Those Titles of <hi>Dignity</hi> do shew Magistrates
their <hi>duty.</hi> Let no man glory in Empty Titles, but
labour to answer them in obedience.<note place="margin">

breeds Impenitency, it hardens men in their sin, and
oft-times brings them to a second murder, which
the indulgent Magistrate becomes accessary too.
When one told the King of <hi>France</hi> that such a one
had committed a third murder; No, said one; he hath

the Kings; for if he had not pardoned him, he had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                        <p>Thirdly, tis injurious to the State to spare Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,

care of the Poor, the Fatherless and the Widow,
who have none to take care for them. <hi>Psal. 68. 5.</hi>
So the Magistrate who hath power, must be a defence

So Magistrates must be very tender over them; the
world is apt to wrong them, and trample upon them
by reason of the Churches weakness; and therefore
she is compared to a Vine, a Dove, a Widow, as
Sheep, which cannot subsist long without a defence
and support; and if Magistrates neglect their duty,
yet God will never fail his people, but will reprove
Kings for their sakes; and though his Church be
weak, yet her enemies shall know that her <hi>Redeemer

care to promote Gods worship, and to abolish all
the monuments of Idolatry. <hi>David</hi> saw to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

then never bear the sword of justice.
Either act like Magistrates, or never bear the office;
either discharge the duties of your place, or leave it
to such as will; for shame let not blasphemy escape
better then Felony, let not a Cut-purse die and a
blasphemer live. Do not punish him that speaks a
word against you, and let him scape scot-free that
speaks two against Christ. Tis a Sin to be calm and
cold when God is blasphemed. When <hi>Servetus</hi> that
blasphemous Heretick charged <hi>Melancthon</hi> with
harshness in a dispute against him, he answered,
<hi>In aliis mitis sum; cum blasphematur nomen Christi,

<hi>simply</hi> in the name and authority of men, but for the
Lord, who is the Supream Ruler, to whom they must
account: and therefore it greatly concerns them to
take heed what they do. Kings causes call for great

well, must take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>2. They must consider that <hi>God is with them,</hi>
which serves first for <hi>Caution;</hi> if they do ill, he is with
them to punish them: for though they be mighty,
yet God is Almighty, and there is a greater then
they, <hi>(Iob 33. 12.)</hi> who stands in their Assemblies,
not as a bare Spectator, but as a Witness, Judge and
Avenger of such as act unrighteously, <hi>Iob 12. 18,
19, 21.</hi> 2. It serves for <hi>comfort;</hi> he is with them to
defend them if they do well. The Devil throws his
darts principally at them: they destroy his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and therefore he useth all means to destroy
them; he saith to his Agents as <hi>Aram</hi> the King of

wickedness and act unrighteously. Tis true they will
formally and in words confess that they reign <hi>Dei

that God is not in all their thoughts, nor must He,

do it.</p>
                           <p>See what Anabaptistick Logick here is, because
Christ forbids Lawing before Heathens therefore
we may not go to Law before Christians. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96886:56"/>
is Cogent thus; The Apostle condemns Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
for going to Law before Heathen Judges,
therefore he allows of it before Christian Judges.</p>
                           <p>3. If the Apostle should <hi>absolutely</hi> condemn all
suing to the Magistrate in case of wrong, then he
should contradict his own Practice; for he being in

In charity we must have respect to a poor mans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
but in point of Justice neither the power of
the rich, nor the Penury of the poor, but Right
only must be regarded <hi>(Psal. 72. 7.)</hi> if a man

the Lord himself who is most tender over the poor,

the respect which he owes to God and Right, he gives

before a Rich man in his cause, yet sometimes it may
so fall out that at the tears and cries of the Poor, and
to get a Name for a merciful man amongst men,
there may be offending on that hand. Tis true, we
must shew mercy, but yet with Judgement and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
In other cases we may shew respect to men
for their age, gifts, graces, affinity, dignity, calling,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not in Judgement. The Court must know
no Kinsmen. Judges must with <hi>David</hi> do justice to
<hi>All</hi> the people without distinction of rich or poor
<hi>(2 Sam. 8. 15.)</hi> they must dispense Justice with an
equal hand and an even ballance. As the Law it self
is equal to all, so should the Judge who is a living
Law, be the same to all that fly unto him for succour.
So that this makes nothing for the Sottish, Uncivil
<hi>Quakers</hi> who cry down all outward respect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to men in authority under pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to no man person: Whereas the Scripture

                        <head>Answer.</head>
                        <p>Tis true, Magistrates must execute Justice for rich
men as well as for the poor: yet since the poor are
most subject to injury, therefore the Magistrate must
be more careful to defend them. The poor are low
in condition, and are often laid lower by Oppression:
now God hath raised up Magistrates for this very
end, to protect them in their low condition, and to
lift them up when they are laid lower by oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                        <p>2. As for <hi>Rich men,</hi> the world loves her own, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
her White Sons, her Great and Prosperous
Children, so that their causes are sure to be heard,
and their right improved to the utmost who have so

Besides, men are afraid of wronging great ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have great power and many friends to
Vindicate them against the wrongs of any.</p>
                        <p>3. There's an aversness and backwardness in our
Natures to help the Poor, who have no gifts nor
friends to side with them, who have nothing to plead
but only the justness of their cause. Men that are

He that is called Poor in the beginning of

is taken sometimes <hi>properly,</hi> for one that hath lost his
Father. 2. <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> for such as are in deep di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress

two years over <hi>Israel,</hi> when he reigned many years:

                     </p>

2. 3.</hi> and of wicked men, <hi>Mal. 2. 10.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Others are called his Sons by <hi>Adoption:</hi> thus all
true believers are the Sons of God. <hi>Iohn 1. 12. Rom.
8. 14. 16. Gal. 4. 5. 1. Iohn 3. 2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Others are called the Sons of God in respect
of that <hi>Power, Majesty, Authority and Eminency</hi>
which God hath conferred upon them above the
ordinary sort of men: and in this respect it is that
Magistrates are called the Sons of God; for as Parents
give some part of their Inheritance to their children:
so the Almighty hath invested Magistrates with part
of his power and Soveraignty, and intrusted them
with the administration of his Earthly Kingdoms,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96886:80"/>
by the exercise of Vindictive and Remunerative
Justice.</p>
                     <p>Now some conceive that Magistrates are called
the Sons of God, because they are more dear to
God, and more acceptable to him then other men;
but that will not hold; for in this very Psalm where
he calls them Gods, yet he sharply reproves them
for their unrighteous practices; and if Rulers be
wicked, they bring more dishonour to God, and do
more mischief then inferiour persons can do, and
so their persons are more displeasing to God then
inferiour persons are; and God looks upon them as
Beasts rather then men, <hi>Prov. 28. 15.</hi> But if Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
be truly Godly, then they are the Sons of
God in a double sense. 1. As Believers. 2. As Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates;
and so they are nearer and dearer to God
then ordinary men: they are as the Signet on his
right hand, ever in his eye; he looks upon them as
his ornaments;<note place="margin">Quaerit abs te <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> as the Devil useth all means to get
men of Power and Parts on his side, that he may
the better advance his Kingdom; so God delights in
gracious Magistrates as the Pillars and Upholders of
his Kingdom in the world. The more of God dwells
in any, the more he loves them; If Magistrates who
are Gods in name, do resemble God indeed, in
Wisdom, Justice, Purity, Clemency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then
are they the children of the most High in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
sense, and God hath a Paternal care over
such, even as Parents have over their obedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <p>2. This implies <hi>Participation,</hi> and tells us that
Magistrates derive all their power from God, as a
son hath his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rom his father; and therefore it is but
Equity that they should imploy that power which
they have received from His goodness, to the praise
of him that gave it.</p>
                     <p>3. Here is the Extent of this Dignity, it is not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96886:81"/>
given only to Superiour Magistrates, but to Inferiour
ones also; Ye are <hi>All</hi> the children of the most High;
yea wicked ones when placed in authority, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Gods and Sons of the most High. Those in the
Psalm were none of the best, yea they were almost
as bad as bad could be. <hi>Verse 2. 5.</hi> And yet it is said
here, I have said ye (in respect of your office) are
Gods, and children of God.</p>

this of the Psalmist (<hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 34, 35, 36.)
tells us, that to Magistrates the Word of the Lord
came, or was made. <hi>q. d.</hi> they have their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
Commission and Power from God to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the duties of their places. When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
were sent to preach, The Word of the Lord
was said to come to them. <hi>Luke 3. 2.</hi> The Word
of God came to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and then <hi>Verse 3.</hi> he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and puts his Commission in execution: So when
God hath given Magistrates a word of command,
then, and not till then they may act with comfort
and with confidence. Our Saviour in <hi>Iohn 10. 34.</hi>
refers us hither, when the <hi>Pharisees</hi> reproacht him
for blasphemy, because he made himself equall to
God, by saying, My Father and I are one, he clears
himself from that aspersion, by an Argument from
the less to the greater, Thus; If the Title of God
may be given to Princes, who are but men, and
many times the worst of men; then much more
may that Title be given to me, in whom the Majesty
of God doth more especially appear, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his God-head dwell. The Antecedent I have
proved to you (saith Christ) out of your Law which
you cannot deny, and therefore you must grant the

He is the great Jehovah, the Lord Paramount of

and our Lord is above all Gods;</hi> whether they be so
<hi>Deputed</hi> as Magistrates, or <hi>Reputed</hi> as Idols. He is
not only great, but Greatness it self; not only high,
but the most High, beyond the Tongues expression,
or the hearts imagination. It is infinite and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable;
we may assoon measure the Sea with a
spoon, or put it in a bushel, as comprehend with our
shallow understandings his excellent Greatness; it is
therefore called Unsearchable, <hi>Psal. 145. 3. Great is
the Lord, and greatly to be praised, his Greatness is
Vnsearchable.</hi> All the power, perfection, beauty and
excellency that is dispersed through the whole
world, that and ten thousand times more is in the
Lord by way of Eminency and Transcendency. All
the glory that is in Angels, men, and all creatures,
compared to his, is but as a drop to the Sea, a shadow
to the Substance, or one little sand to a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
Heaven, Earth and Sea compared to him are
<hi>parum nihil,</hi> meer Nothing. In <hi>Isa. 40. 12, 15, 16, 17.</hi>
we have a most lively expression of the power of
God, <hi>Who hath measured the water in the hollow of
of his hand, and meeted out the Heavens with a span,
and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure,
and weighed the Mountains in scales, and the Hills in
a ballance,</hi> &amp;c. He doth these great things with ease, as
if it were but Spanning, Measuring, Weighing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Hence it is that Greatness is truly and properly
ascribed to God alone.<note place="margin">Nihil magnum nisi Deus magnus.</note> He only is great, <hi>Deut. 32. 3.

1 Chron. 29. 11, 12. <hi>Thine O Lord is the Greatness,

thine; thine is the Kingdom O Lord, and thou art

&amp;c. He is mighty in power; there is no opposing

with a look of approbation and delight. Barely to

A serious consideration of Death will take off the
scales from our eyes, and make us see the vanity of
all earthly glory, how short and transitory it is;

be lifted up with the gay feathers of Honour, Wit,
Wealth, Beauty or any other fading excellency; then
cast your eyes upon the black feet of your morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

                     <p>
                        <hi>God sometimes seems to sleep when his people are in
trouble.</hi> He seems to be careless, and let all run into
confusion, as we have seen in this Psalm. Not that
God doth indeed sleep or disregard the affictions
of his people, for <hi>he that keepeth his Israel, doth not
so much as slumber, much less sleep, Psal. 121. 4, 5.</hi>
He hath a special eye upon his people for good, he
protects them so, that the Sun shall not hurt them by
day, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

shall hurt them, neither Sun nor Moon, neither heat
nor cold. 2. No part of them shall be hurt, <hi>thy
soul shall be preserved;</hi> thy going out and coming in
shall be guided and guarded: these include the whole
person of man with all his just undertakings and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
Thus are they kept who have the Lord for
their keeper; and as if this were not sufficient, he
adds <hi>Verse 3. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved,
i. e.</hi> he will not suffer thee or thine to be moved or
violently cast down; the power of oppressours shall
not prevail over thee; for the power of God sustains
thee. Lest any should hurt his Vineyard, he keeps
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96886:95"/>
it night and day, <hi>i. e.</hi> at all times, <hi>Isai. 27. 3.</hi> So
that to speak properly, there is no passion in God,
there is neither rest nor motion in him, but the
Scripture speaks of him by an Anthropopathy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our apprehension. Thus the Lord is said
sometimes to be slack, slow, and delay his coming;
and then by our Prayers we must quicken him, <hi>Psal.
40. 17. Make no long tarrying O my God, Psal. 74. 1.
How long Lord, how long wilt thou forget thy people!</hi>
Sometimes he seems to forget his Church, and then
his people must put him in remembrance, <hi>Isai. 62. 7.
Ye that are the Lords remembrancers give him no rest.</hi>
Sometimes he seems to sleep, and then he expects that
his people by their prayers should awaken him, as
in the Text, <hi>Arise Lord.</hi> The Lord is a God of great
patience, and long suffering; he bears long with
the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, <hi>Rom. 9. 22.</hi>
He bears so long with the wicked till they rage
again, and insult, thinking that God approves of
their wickedness, <hi>Ps<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at <hi>Israels</hi> troubles 430 years; but at last <hi>Pharach</hi>
and his followers paid for all together in the Sea.
The <hi>Amorites</hi> one would think had been wicked
enough to have been destroyed, for they were gross
Idolaters, grand oppressors, and notorious for lust;
yet God bare some hundred of years with them, tell
they were ripe for ruine, <hi>Gen. 15. 16.</hi> Wo then to
all the insulting, blasphemous enemies of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
though God seem for a time to sit still and sleep,
letting the wicked oppress the righteous who is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then he, <hi>(Hab. 1. 13.</hi>) Yet as a man after sleep is
refresht; so God will arise like a Gyant refresht
with wine, and then his enemies shall be scattered,
and those that hate him shall flee before him. As
smoke is driven away by a mighty wind, though it
seem black and formidable at first; yet it soon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth;
and the higher it ascends, the sooner it is
scattered; and as wax melteth before the fire, so
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96886:96"/>
shall the wicked perish at the presence of God, (<hi>Psal.
68. 1, 2.</hi>) If the Lord do once arise, though his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
be never so many or mighty, yet they are soon
scattered. Let the Lord but look upon the Host of
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> through the Pillar of fire, and it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and torments them, <hi>Exod. 14. 24.</hi> Let not
then Gods people be despondent, though the Lord
make them wait, yea and wait long; though the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be yet for an appointed time, yet at the end it
shall speak comfort to those that Patiently wait
Gods appointed time; and to assure you of this, the
promise is doubled and trebled; <hi>It shall speak, it
will come, it will surely come, it shall not lie, it will
not tarry, Hab. 2. 3.</hi>

Prayer is not a work of the wit, voyce, memory,
but of the heart, <hi>Psal. 25. 1.</hi> Let the words be never

and their lusts, what is this but to mock God to his
face, and to give him occasion out of our own
mouths to condemn us? If ever we desire that
God should hear our Prayers, we must first put
iniquity far from our Tabernacles, <hi>Iob 22. 23, 27.</hi>
Our Prayers must not come from feigned lips, <hi>Psal.

then <hi>they must call upon him in truth, Psal. 145. 18.</hi>
It is the Prayers of the Upright that are Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
<hi>Prov. 15. 8.</hi> And as all sin, so three espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
there are that marre mens Prayers. The first is
<hi>Ignorance,</hi> when men have no sense of their own
misery, nor of the Majesty of that God they pray
to: such cannot pray, <hi>Rom. 10. 14. How shall they
call on him of whom they have not heard?</hi> or if they
do, yet there prayers are abominable, <hi>Prov. 28. 9.
2. Pride,</hi> when men are full of self-confidence, and
think to be heard for their own merits and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
God resists such proud Pharisees; but it is
the prayer of the destitute and the humble which he
regards, <hi>Psal. 10. 17. &amp; 102. 16, 17. 3. Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and cruelty;</hi> the cry of these sins out-cryes their
prayers so as they cannot be heard. Though such
should pray, yea and make many Prayers, yet God
will not hear, <hi>Isai. 1. 15.</hi> how can he expect mercy
from God, who shews none to his Brother?
<hi>Prov. 22. 13. He that stops his ears at the cry of
the poor, shall cry himself, and shall not be

he hath a God to go to, he hath hidden Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah
which the world knows not off. By this he gets
strength from God either to overcome the Tentaton,
or to undergo it patiently; it either removes the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or else gets it sanctified. Prayer hath <hi>Virtutem
pacativam,</hi> a settling and composing power; it stills
the distempers of the soul, as sleep composeth the

his agony, and cheerfully goes forth to meet even

                     <p>That the God of Heaven hath appointed Magistrates
to be Gods on earth.</p>
                     <p>He is God by Nature, and he hath given them to

infinitely above all; he shineth eminently with his

his beauty and brightness on some men, whereby
they excel and are above others in this lower
world.</p>
                     <p>For the Explication of this truth, I shall only
shew in what respects Magistrates are called Gods,
and then proceed to Application.</p>
                     <p>Magistrates are in a two-fold respect called
Gods.</p>

                        <item>1. In respect of their honourable dignity.</item>

                     <p>It speaketh that their priviledge is high, and that
their practices should be holy.</p>
                     <p>1. In respect of their Dignity,<note place="margin">Ceterum hic nomen sicuti paulo post, &amp; aliis locis pro judicibus sumitur, quibus specialem gloriae notam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculpsit Deus, <hi>Calv. in Psal. 82. 1.</hi>
                        </note> God speaketh the

                     <p>Nay, God giveth Magistrates not only those names
which are in most esteem amongst men; but the
names of Angels.</p>
                     <p>Angels are the perfection, as it were, of the
Creation, the top-stone of this glorious building.
When the Spirit of God would speak a thing, or
person to be excellent, it doth resemble them to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
<hi>My Lord is wise as an Angel of God, 2 Sam. 14.

of holy ones in heaven is set forth by their

Magistrates, that have the names of Angels given
them; Angels are called <hi>Dominions, Principalities,
Powers, Col. 1. 16. Ephes. 1. 21.</hi> So are Magistrates,
<hi>Iude v. 8. Titus 3. 1. Be subject to Principalities
and Powers;</hi> But the Text speaketh more of their
dignity. Magistrates have not only the highest names
of the most honourable visible creatures, Men; and
of the most honourable invisible creatures, Angels;
but of the Creatour, of God himself, the Fountain
and Standard of all Dignity and Honour; <hi>I have said
ye are Gods.</hi> When <hi>Iacob</hi> would manifest to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>

Magistrates are children of the most High, they are

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ons to the King of Kings. But the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of all is to be called Gods; for God to say
My name be named on them, This is the highest name
that can be given; Here is a <hi>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the highest Name which is above all names, and as
the Diamond to the Ring, addeth both vertue and

                     <p>As because Gold is the most precious excellent
metal, therefore we lay gold over other things; we
guild peuter, brass, yea silver it self. So because
God is the most excellent name, it is laid to other
things, that thereby their worth may be set forth:
As <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> Job 1. 6. <hi>The City of God,</hi> Psal.
46. 4. <hi>The River of God,</hi> Psal. 65. 9. <hi>The Kingdom
of God</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">It is ordinary in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> to adde the name of God to a thing to heighten the excellency of it. A man of God is as much as an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary man, an excellent man. It is said of the Church compared to a Vine, <hi>She sent forth her branches as goodly Cedars, Psal. 80. 10.</hi> so we read it; But in Hebr. <hi>As the Cedars of God,</hi> that is, tall, and excellent
Cedars; and so in many other places, because all the creature excellencies are derived
from him, and are but a drop, a beam, a print of that Glory and Majesty which is in him.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Now in their dignity Magistrates resemble God
in these two or three particulars,<note place="margin">Dii per analogiam tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Deum imitantes. <hi>Theodor.</hi>
                        </note> and therefore are
fitly called Gods.</p>
                     <p>First in receiving honour from others.<note place="margin">This is a godlike preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. <hi>God is cloathed with Mijesty and honour, Psal. 104. 1.</hi> The blessed and only Potentate, to whom all people must pay this tribute. In this the Gods on earth resemble him.</note> Honour
accompanyeth power as the shadow the body.
There is naturally in man an aw and respect towards
those that are Magistrates: They are the Fathers
of their Countrey, and their subjects like children
owe them both obedience and reverence. Divine
worship is to be given only to God in heaven, but
civil worship may be given to Gods on earth. <hi>David</hi>

in thy salvation, Honour and Majesty hast thou put

                     <p>There is indeed one Supreme and absolute Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,

                     <p>Man is by nature an untamed Heifer, loathing
the yoke of subjection, prone to rage and rebel; so
that he needeth all means imaginable to rule and

hath therefore thought fit not only to give Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
a natural law and moral law from himself, but
also positive laws from men, that this threefold
cord which is not easily broken may bind him fast.
And this surely speaketh Magistrates to be like God;
for even the Heathen themselves would ascribe
their laws to some one of their Gods. <hi>Zorastres</hi>

a sword without an edge for no use or service. And

The power of life and death is in the hands of these
earthly Gods: they enliven with their smiles; their
favour or the light of a Kings countenance is life;
they kill with their frowns; <hi>The wrath of a King is
the messenger of death, Prov. 16. 14, 15.</hi> Herein their

great as well as small, fearing none but the God
of heaven, <hi>Deut. 1. 17.</hi> you shall not be afraid of
the face of man, for the judgement is Gods. <hi>Papini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>

for fearing God, so likewise for not fearing men,
<hi>Iob 29. 17.</hi> I brake the jaw of the wicked and pulled
the spoil out of his teeth. Great men oftentimes are
like Lions, or ravenous Beasts, that prey on others
without fear or pitty. Now the care of this pious
Magistrate was to secure his people against such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>David</hi> kept his Fathers sheep, <hi>and there
came a Lion and a Bear, and took a Lamb out of the
stock,</hi> David <hi>rose after the Lion and smote him, and
took the Lamb out of his mouth,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 34. Every
Magistrate is or should be a Shepherd. God saith of
<hi>Cyrus, He is my Shepherd, Isa. 44. ult.</hi> The man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

And when Lions or Bears (men that are
great and strong) come to devour their flock,
they ought to protect or defend them. He is a base
hireling that hides his head when the Wolf cometh
in the night, though he endeavour to preserve his
sheep from injury by the flies in the day. For one
Wolf will do more mischief in a night then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
flies in a year. As the day of judgement will
make no difference between great and small, rich
and poor, noble and ignoble; for then the Kings
of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
and the chief Captains and the mighty men will hide
themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and will say to the Mountains and rocks, Fall
on us and hide us from the wrath of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.

                     <p>The impartiality of God, and also of the Gods,
consisteth in not taking gifts. God is no taker
of gifts, <hi>2 Chron. 19. 7. Riches prevail not in the day

                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:96886:116"/>Thus should Magistrates resemble his Majesty,
not perverting justice either for having, or for
hope of a reward. A bribe received or expected
clogs or obscures the course of Justice. A golden
pen must not write the discharge: when the hand
of a Judge is greased with gold, it cannot hold the
sword of justice, but will let it slip, at least strike ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
partially.</p>
                     <p>Thou shalt not wrest judgement, thou shalt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

                     <p>The Roman story telleth us of two persons that
were Competitors for some place of preserment, and
that a Senator being asked, for which of the two he
would give his voice; answered, For neither; because
saith he, One hath nothing, and the other hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enough. He knew that poverty and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are both unmeet qualifications for a Ruler.
The former maketh Magistracy obnoxious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

As Justices are called the Kings Justices, because they
act by Commission from him: so Magistrates are

derived from the Lord. Coin is carryed to

                     <p>Governours are not of the Devil, as Satanical
spirits have affirmed, nor of men, as others have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted;
but of God, <hi>Rom. 13. 1.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As in the waters there be some greater, some smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

Hills as well as Plains and Valleys; and in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
there are Stars differing from each other in

in authority and glory.</p>
                     <p>As the natural body is distinguished by God
himself into comely and uncomely parts, <hi>1 Cor. 12.

                     <p>The Bees in their Common-wealth (as is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
have a Commander in chief, a Master Bee. The
Lyon claimeth a command and superiority among
the Beasts of the field. The Angels in heaven have
a chief, <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, <hi>Iude 9. 1 Thes. 4.
16.</hi> The School-men indeed being more bold then
they ought, do divide the Angels into three Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchies,
and each Hierarchie into three several or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
The first Hierarchie they say comprehendeth
Cherubims, Seraphims, and Thrones: The second,
Dominions, Principalities, and Powers. The third,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96886:117"/>
Mights, Archangels, and Angels: As also they assert
the reason of these several names. But the more
modest and learned Expositors who joyn not in the
aforesaid presumptuous division, do yet generally
conclude an order, distinction, and preheminence
amongst Angels, from <hi>Ephes. 1. 21. Col. 1. 16. Dan.
10. 13.</hi> Nay, there is a government amongst the
very Devils; there is not only a Prince of Angels,
<hi>Dan. 10.</hi> but <hi>Beelzebub</hi> a Prince amongst Devils,
<hi>Matth. 12. 24.</hi> They that cause so much disorder
amongst others, yet have some order among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
We read of the <hi>Devil and his Angels,
Matth. 25. 41.</hi> There is a kind of government
in Hell, though some would turn all out of the
earth.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> indeed calleth Magistracy an
ordinance of man, <hi>1 Pet. 2. 13.</hi> though <hi>Paul</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
us it is of God; <hi>The Powers that be are ordained
of God, Rom. 13. 1.</hi> And the Magistrate <hi>is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of God,</hi> vers. 4.</p>
                     <p>Magistracy is an ordinance of man in a fourfold
respect.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Subjective.</hi> As man is the subject thereof, by
them it is executed. Our Princes as well as our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are men of like passions with us.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Objective.</hi> As man is the object thereof, about
them it is exercised. It is for the punishment of
bad men, and encouragement of good men, for
the deciding differences between man and man.</p>
                     <p>3. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Finaliter.</hi> As man is the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
He is the Minister of God for mans good.</p>
                     <p>But these things will not prove Magistracy to be a
meer humane Ordinance; for in these three respects
the Ministry as well as the Magistracy may be said
to be an humane Ordinance; Man being both the
subject, object, and end thereof; yet what sober man
ever denyed the ministry to be an Ordinance of
God?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:96886:117"/>4. It is Ordinance of man in regard of the kind
of it: Each Nation having a liberty to choose
what form of Government they apprehend most
commodious for them. Magistracy is Ordained by
God, though this particular Magistrate, or this
form of Government be appointed by man. The
Genus of Magistracy is from God; yet the Species;
whether Monarchy, Democracy, or Aristocracy
may be at the choice of men.</p>
                     <p>Further, though the Magistrate should be of the
Devil, a wicked ungodly person; yet the Magistracy
is of God.</p>
                     <p>There is a difference between the Office or
Power it self, and the manner of exercising it, and the
means of attaining it: The first is alwayes of God,
but not alwayes the second and third. The power of
<hi>Nero</hi> was of God, (as the Holy Ghost speakethl ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Rom. 13.)</hi> though he exercised it in a Devillish
manner, oppressing and killing the good, encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and acquitting such as were evil. The power
of our <hi>Richard</hi> the third was of God, though he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it by ungodly and devillish means, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
his own Soveraign and Nephew.</p>
                     <p>There are four particulars which will clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the truth of this assertion, namely, That
Magistracy is of Divine Authority.</p>

                     <p>2. Their command to govern is from God; the
several Precepts from God to men in high places,
doth fully speak their power to be of God. Why
should God command them to rule according to his
laws, who have no authority to rule at all? <hi>Ier. 22.
2, 3. Hear the word of the Lord O King of Judah,
execute judgement and righteousness, and deliver the

matter or substance of their rnle were unlawful,
surely God would not own it so far as to prescribe
rules for the manner of executing it. Now God
through the whole Scriptures scattereth many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
for directions to Princes how they should
govern, and what they should practice, <hi>Deut. 17.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Their protection is from God. As a King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth
his inferiour officers in the execution of
their offices; so the King of Kings defendeth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
in the discharge of their trusts; <hi>God stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96886:118"/>
in the Congregation among the Gods, Psal. 82. 1.</hi>
not only to observe whether they offer injuries to
others, but also to take care, that they receive no
injuries from others. God is a stronger guard to
the Judge then any Sheriff. And were not he a
wall of fire about some worthy zealous Justices,
many beastly persons (who have been curb'd by
them, and hindered from leaping over the hedges of
divine commands) would have trampled them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
feet, if not torn them in pieces.</p>
                     <p>It is worthy our observation how exceedingly
God manifesteth his power and zeal for the help of
Magistrates against all opposition. <hi>Korah</hi> and his
company conspire against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy
and Ministery, <hi>Numb. 16.</hi> and would have
brought in Anarchy. (Indeed both those Ordinances
have the same adversaries, Those that would level
the Ministery, making Preachers <hi>Ieroboam</hi>-like, of
the lowest of the people, and filling the Pulpit as
<hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, with creatures clean and unclean, will
at last level the Magistracy too, and make the Throne
as low and as common as the Pulpit.) But observe
what God saith of these opposers of Magistracy and
Ministery, and what God doth to them: for his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
That they <hi>are gathered together against the
Lord, vers. 11.</hi> They wounded God through the sides
of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> They that murmur and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
against Gods Delegated servants, murmur and
conspire against God himself. And surely God will
first or last be too hard for those that thus harden
themselves against him: For see what he doth to
them; <hi>The Earth opened her mouth and swallowed
them up, and their houses, and all the men that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
unto</hi> Korah, <hi>and all their goods; they and
all that belonged to them went down alive into the
pit, and the earth closed upon them, vers. 32. 33.</hi>
God hath strange punishments for such strange
principles and practices; He will work miraculously,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96886:119"/>
but that he will make such as are against Magistrate
and Minister exemplary.</p>

The Supreme Magistrate is in great dangers; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God giveth him great deliverances; as he is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

so he may expect (if he be godly especially) more

what a Beast the Empire is, how unruly and unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

cut off one, nay many, yet there will millions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
still. Now that one should keep millions in
awe, how could it be, if there were not a divine
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96886:119"/>
constitution in an humane person. The Devil is
such an enemy to mans peace and welfare; and every
mans nature so opposite to rule and restraint, that
if there were not somewhat more then humane in
Magistracy, one man would be a Beast, nay a Devil
to another, and be no whit kept under by the higher
Powers. But we see clearly God hath put such a
Majesty on Princes, that their people are afraid of
their fury; reverence their persons, and submit to
their authority. He that readeth the wonderful
strength of the Horse, how his neck is cloathed with
thunder; how the glory of his nosthrils is terrible;
how he paweth in the Valley, and goeth out to meet
the armed men; how he mocketh at fear, and is not
affrighted, nor turneth back from the sword, <hi>Iob 39.
19. to 26.</hi> He that considereth the power of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
how he moveth his tail like a Cedar; how his
bones are like strong pieces of brass, and like bars of
Iron. <hi>&amp;c Iob 40. 15. to 24.</hi> when he observeth how
these strong fierce creatures are ridden and ruled by
weak man, and turned about at his pleasure, will
presently conclude the reason to be this, because
God hath put the fear and dread of man upon every

many millions of men subject to the word, to the

then Cities, and the Inhabitants rather
herds of Beasts then Societies of men.</p>
                     <p>There are two sorts of men guilty of this sin.</p>
                     <p>First, those that in their Principles deny Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to be from God. There have in several ages
been some, that because they themselves were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and inferiours, would therefore deny all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
and Superiority. The <hi>Donatists</hi> whom
<hi>Augustine</hi> undertaketh, were of that opinion. And
so were the Anabaptists and Libertines in <hi>Germany,</hi>
who (armed the rude multitude against their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
and) were opposed by <hi>Luther.</hi> And truly
in our dayes there are some who against the light
both of Nature and Scripture, affirm Government
to be a work of darkness. Though it be written in
the fleshly tables of their hearts, and in the tables
of stone by the finger of God; That Fathers and
Mothers civil as well as natural must be honoured,
yet they are so wicked and blind, that they will not
fee or read it. In the Apostles dayes there were
ungodly men that turned the grace of God into la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciviousness,
despisers of Dominions, <hi>Iude vers. 8.</hi>
such as aimed at Anarchy (according to <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi>
Comment) and the over-throw of all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
being proud they scorned rule; and being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious,
they were impatient of restraint.</p>
                     <p>First, Order is needful to them that are in a state
of innocency. Angels who continue in their estate
of integrity differ in point of Superiority; <hi>Michael</hi>
the Archangel, <hi>Iude v. 4. Michael</hi> speaketh the
name of his person, and <hi>Archangel</hi> the nature of
his office. There are Thrones, Dominions, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,
Powers, different degrees among those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
spirits. Surely if such order be conducible to
the happiness of perfect Angels, it is the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
for the happiness of imperfect man. And if
there be such order in heaven, it is no part of our
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96886:120"/>
bondage to have some order on earth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Grecians</hi> do upon good ground use the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to signifie Superiority, or Government:
which in its proper and native acception, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>principium,</hi> to set forth the antiquity of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which had a being assoon as the world
had a beginning.<note n="*" place="margin">Politick Government was probably then insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, when man was first created under the Old Covenant of works; for it is a natural blessing, and grounded upon the fifth Command of the Moral Law, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced upon mans first Creation before <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and the rather may we thus judge, because it is a law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was binding in mans estate of innocency; besides, Christ himself who knew no sin, yet minded this duty of subjection, <hi>Luke 2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>2. Order and Superiority are needful to them
that are in a state of Apostacy; the more wild man
is, the more need he hath of a yoak; the more heady
our Horses are, the more we curb them: Unruly
persons for their own good as well as for others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
restraint.</p>
                     <p>The hearts of wicked men are like the Sea which
cannot rest,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Augustine</hi> thinketh that all civil subjection of one man to another came in by sin, though not all natural subjection of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to pa ents. <hi>De civit. Dei, lib. 19.</hi>
                        </note> but is ever casting up mire and dirt;
Now what a deluge would the boisterous waves
of their unsanctified wills and affections cause, if
there were no banks of Magistracy to bound them
and keep them in. If some men were not Gods to
others, most men would be Devils to others.</p>
                     <p>Sin must be discouraged; evil doers must be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished;
humane Society must be preserved; the
good must be protected; our liberties and properties
must be defended; justice must be executed; the poor
must be relieved; wholesome laws must be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
and how can either of these be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Magistrates: Many fear not sin, nor the God
of Heaven; and if it were not for suffering from
the Gods on earth, their lusts should be their law,
and they would deprive the innocent of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
estates, and lives, and turn the places where
they live into <hi>Acheldema's</hi> fields of blood; nay
make the earth worse in some respects then hell;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96886:121"/>
for in hell there is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ppression, as no injustice; no
guilty person freed, and no guiltless person punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but had these men their wills, it should be so
upon earth.</p>
                     <p>3. Again, Order or Magistracy is not only necessary
to those that are in a state of nature, but to those
also that are in a state of grace, <hi>Titus 3. 1, 2. Rom.
13. 1, 2.</hi> When they begin to be servants to God,
they do not cease to be subjects to the Gods. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
doth not consume but confirm Magistracy:
As a man I obey and honour the Magistrate for fear;
as a Christian, for conscience sake: so that Religion
addeth a stronger tie and obligation. The Scepter in
Christs hand doth not strike the Crown of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
head: No, it maketh it sit the faster, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where their person is crowned with grace, and
the power improved for the glory of Christ. One
Ordinance of God doth not weaken but strengthen
another.</p>
                     <p>I shall inquire a little, and very briefly, into the
reasons which some urge against Magistracy and
Order.</p>
                     <p>1. Say some, <hi>We are the Lords Freemen, and
and therefore should not be servants of men,</hi> 1 Cor.
7. 23. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be not the servants
of men.</hi>

                        <p>That place indeed forbiddeth sinful subjection to
men, but not civil subjection to men. I may serve

If men command what God forbiddeth, I
must disobey men to obey God. Or that Text may
import, that I must give no man liberty to give my
conscience laws; No, my absolute dependance for
soul-direction must be only on Christ and his Word.</p>
                        <p>Those whom Christ makes free are free indeed,
but it is from bondage to their own and others

                        <p>As some sin in their words by uncivil language, so
others in their works, by their unseemly carriage
towards the Magistrate. Surely the world is near its
end, that there are so many dregs appearing, such
brutish persons in it that have not only banished
piety but humanity. They neither reverence the
rulers nor honour the antient. How many are in

their principles antiministerial, and in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices

                        <p>The time was when a Magistrate came by, the

another. But now saith <hi>Iob, they that are younger

                           </note> I say, Magistrates must be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their lawful commands. If a King (saith our
Civil Law) giveth laws out of his own Territories,
he is not to be obeyed. And if Magistrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what God forbiddeth, they give laws out of
their own Dominions, and therefore saith the Divine
law, they are not to be obeyed. God indeed is to
be obeyed universally and unlimitedly, <hi>intuitu vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis,</hi>
upon the bare sight of his will; but I must
examine the laws of men by the laws of God, and
if they are dissonant and disagreeing to Gods laws,
I must be disobedient to their laws. No meer
mans <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> is sufficient, <hi>Acts 6. 29. We ought
to obey God rather then men.</hi> The men of <hi>Calicot</hi>

                           </note> which latter words, <hi>And that because

excellently observed, a limitation to the precedent
Exhortation; They are a reason or enforcement:
It is neccessary to give obedience to Magistrates,
not only out of fear towards them, because of
their sword; but out of conscience towards God,
because of his vows that are upon us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96886:126"/>
and so it seems to relate to some Covenant and Oath
of fidelity, which was taken by the people towards
their Princes, 1 <hi>Chron. 11. 3. Isai.</hi> 19. 18. And
surely Oaths to Magistrates are to be kept, though
some slip Oaths as easily as the Monkies do their
collars; and like the man possessed with the Devil,
break all those bonds asunder. God will have a time
to make inquisition for perjury, when his roll of
curses ten yards long, and five yards broad, shall rest
in the house of him that forsweareth himself, and
destroy it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
                        <p>But the words may be considered as a limitation;
<hi>Keep the Kings command;</hi> but so, that thou do not
violate thine Oath and obedience due to God. Thy
fealty to the Gods must be such as will consist with
thy fidelity to God; for we are bound to God and
his service by Oath and Covenant, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. Psal.</hi>
119. 106. And no subordinate obedience must make
us forget our obedience to him who is Supreme. We

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96886:128"/>
thoughts to enforce the duty of honouring Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</p>
                        <p>First, Consider the necessity of Magistracy; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Magistracy one man would be but bread for
another; and the world which is like the Sea for
storms and tempests, would also resemble it in this,
that the Inhabitants of it would be as the fishes of
the Sea, the great would devour the small. <hi>Men
are like the fishes of the Sea</hi> (saith t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>s and miseries that raign where the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
doth not raign. <hi>In those days there was no
King in</hi> Israel, <hi>every man did that which was right</hi>
(not in Gods, but) <hi>in his own eyes, Iudg. 17. 6.
Iudg.</hi> 19. 1. And what evill is not good in his eye
who hath the Devil for his guide and leader, and
corrupt nature for his law and rules? When the
gate of Magistracy is shut, the floodgates for all
manner of enormities are open. When these that
bear up the pillars of the house are removed, how
soon will the building be ruined? When God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the destruction of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Common-wealth,
he took away their <hi>Sanedrim.</hi> And in the glass of
our times it is too too visible what a sad desormed
face things have, when Magistrates are overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Constantinople</hi> will witness to this truth, where
upon the grand Signiors death, till his Successor be
on his Throne, all things are in a confusion, and
the Janizaries have the rule and Dominion. Some
write that the <hi>Persian</hi> law commandeth, that upon
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96886:128"/>
the decease of their Kings, there should be a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension
of the Laws for certain (five) dayes that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
might know the necessity of Government, and
learn to value it more by being berest of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of it for a time. Nay when God is exceedingly
provoked by sin, how sharply doth he make men
suffer by taking away their stay and their staff. The
mighty man, the Judge, the Prophet and the Prudent,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. The taking away the civil stay
and staff, the Prince; and the spiritual stay and
staff, the Prophet, will quickly cause the fall, yea the
utter downfall of the people. Men often murmur
at the Magistrate, and tell us (many times falsly)
He is a Tyrant, if he were gone all wonld be well;
but when he is out of the way, do they not find many
Tyran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s for one? Every man would be an oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
were there no man to be a restrainer.</p>
                        <p>What would a Nation without goverment be but
a desert of savage beasts? what would Towns be but
dens of Thieves, and what would families be but
stages of unclean birds? yea what would most men
be, but like dogs trying all right and title by their
teeth and strength?</p>
                        <p>Men naturally are more afraid of the noise of the
Musket then of the Bullet; I mean of the frowns of
the Rulers, then of the fire of Hell: and therefore
were they once free from them, they would do that
which would soon undo boch themselves and others.</p>
                        <p>Now the necessity of Magistrates calleth for reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and obedience to their authority. The more
needfull things are, the more gratefull they should,
be. Things that are superfluous may be slighted,
things that are only convenient may be the less valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
but things that are absolutely necessary must be
highly esteemed. I tell thee, the Ministry is not
more necessary to the well-being of the Church,
then the Magistracy to the well-being of the State.
You may as soon see a Tree thrive without a root, as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96886:129"/>
a Common-wealth flourish without a Ruler. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
are in Scripture called the <hi>heads of the people,
Exod.</hi> 18. 25. because they are as necessary to the body
Politick, to direct and govern it, as the head is to the
body natural; therefore as the members yield respect
and are subject unto the head (if the head do but
ake, all the humours of the arm (as some observe)
run to the head, and therefore the arms are thin and
slender, because they want their proper nurture;
yea if the head be in danger how do the other parts
hazzard themselves for its shelter? many an hand and
arm hath been wounded, that the head might be
saved) thus should subjects shew their respect to,
and tenderness of their superiours, for if a member
or some of the inferiour parts be cut off, the body
may live; but if the head be taken off, if Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
be set aside, <hi>Actum est de republica,</hi> that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that Common-wealth cannot stand long.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Consider the severity of God against
the contemners of Magistrates. There are several
in the word of God that stand up like the Mast of a
Ship cast away by Sands, to warn us that we
steer not their course, least we be sunk also. Those
who opposed the preservers of our civil lives, have
not seldom been punished with violent deaths:
<hi>Corah</hi> and his company, <hi>Abimelech, Athaliah, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah,
Absolom, Zimri, Ioab, Sheba,</hi> with several
others will confirm this truth. And humane as well
as divine writings speak to the same purpose.</p>

he ended at once his wicked dayes and desires.

                           <hi>My Son,</hi> saith Solomon, <hi>fear thou the Lord and
the King, and meddle not with them that are given to
change. For their calamity shall arise suddenly, and
who knoweth the ruine of them both? Prov. 21. 22.
i. e.</hi> of them that fear not God, and of them that
fear not the King. And <hi>Eccles. 10. 8, 9. He that
diggeth a pit, shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an
hedge, a Serpent shall bite him. Whoso removeth stones,
shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood,
shall be endangered thereby.</hi> These four proverbial
expressions speak the danger of them that go about
to supplant their Rulers. Whilest they are digging
pits to catch others, the earth falleth on them, and
murdereth themselves. When they are breaking
up the old hedge of Government, Serpents and
Adders which use to harbour in old walls and hedges
will sting them. God will make men know that it
is a dangerous thing to confound rule and subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and to break down the partition wall which
he hath set up between Magistrates and people.
When these sharp instruments which they run
against, wound them deep, they will believe that it
is bad medling with edged tools; and that there is
a truth in those words of the Apostle, <hi>They that
resist procure to themselves damnation, Rom.</hi> 13. 2. that
is, both corporal punishment and eternal torment,

take heed of sinning with others. <hi>Depart I pray

                        <p>My second Exhortation will be to the Gods. If
the God of heaven have appointed you to be Gods
on earth, then it may exhort you to walk as Gods,
and to work as Gods amongst men.</p>
                        <p>First, Walk as Gods among men; your calling is
high, and therefore your carriage should be holy.
Every calling hath a peculiar comliness belonging
to it. A Courtier hath another manner of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
then a Countrey man, a Scholler then a Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
a Prince then a Peasant. The greater your
priviledges are, the more gratious your practices
should be. Remember whose livery your wear, whose
image you bear, whose person you represent, whose
place you stand in, and walk worthy of that calling
whereunto you are called, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1. Some would
have us give no names to children, but such as should
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96886:131"/>
mind them of their duty. The spirit of God hath
given you a divine name which should mind you
of the divine nature. Since your compellations are
according to God, surely your conversations should
be according to the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>The several Titles given to you, call for sanctity
and strictness from you.</p>
                        <p>The spirit of God calleth you Kings, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 9.
and Princes, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 8. 33. Now is it seemly or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
to see Kings or Princes padling in the mire, or
playing in the dirt with every beggars brat? Doth
not every one expect that their Linen should be in
print, their cloaths clean without the least spot of
dirt? And is it comely or consonant to see Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
(honoured with a commission from heaven)
wallowing in the mire of sin and pollution with every
heir of hell? Do not all expect that as your places
are god-like and honourable, so your practice
should be godly and answerable, that your linen
should be white, your garments undefiled, and your
persons higher then others not only in place but pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
                        <p>When King <hi>Porus</hi> was taken prisoner, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Conquerour how he would be used? he
answered, Like a King: and being three times asked
the same question, he as often returned the same
answer. And if you ask me how you should demean
your selves, I would answer Like Kings, Every one
resembling the behaviour of a King. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31, 3, 4. It is

to you, that walk every day in the midst of many

                        <p>It might have been a cutting word to the heart
of <hi>Brutus,</hi> (whose hand was then stabbing <hi>Caesar</hi>)
What thou my son <hi>Brutus!</hi> I could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
better from a slave; but little looked for
this from a son. How think you, can the Lord
take it, that you who are his children, should wound
the Body of his Son with oaths and curses, his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
laws by wickedness and wilful disobedience!
I beseech you, be exceeding holy that ye may shew
your selves to be <hi>children of the most High.</hi> In this
the children of God are manifest, and the children
of the Devil; <hi>He that doth not righteonsness, is
not of God, I Iohn 3. 10. If ye therefore call on the
Father, who without respect of persons will judge
every man according to his works, pass the time of
your sojurning here in fear, 1</hi> Pet. 1. 17. <hi>forasmuch as
ye know ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,
as silver or gold, from your vain conversations received
by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious
blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without spot and
blemish, vers.</hi> 18, 19. It is written of <hi>Boleslaus,</hi> one
of the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> that he still carryed about
with him the picture of his Father, and when he
was to do any great work, he would look on the
picture, and pray that he might do nothing unworthy
of such a Fathers name: So when you set about
any busines, desire and labour that you may do
nothing (while on earth) unworthy your Father who
is in heaven.</p>
                        <p>Nay further, the Holy Ghost calleth you Gods.
How godly then should you be! how unsutable are
the works of the Devil to them that have the name
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96886:134"/>
of God! God is light, and in him is no darkness at
all; and should not the Gods shine brightly with
the light of holiness, and abhor all deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
The Gods of the Heathen were taxed with
several crimes; <hi>Iupiter</hi> with uncleanness, <hi>Iuno</hi> with

liberty to sin, because their Gods were represented
to them as patterns or approvers of such actions:
As <hi>Charaea</hi> in <hi>Terence, Non ego facerem quae</hi> Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>fecit?</hi> Should I be backward to what the God
himself was forward? But the God of Heaven is
far from such things; He is the holy One of <hi>Israel,</hi>
holy in all his wayes, and righteous in all his works;
His Nature is the pattern of holiness; his Law is the
rule of holiness: Holiness is his Essence, his glory,
himself, <hi>Psal. 89. 13. A God of truth without jni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
just and right is he, Deut.</hi> 32. 4. There are
many spots in our Moons; but not the least spot in
this Sun of Righteousness. Now therefore you
that have his Name, should get his Nature, and be
pure as he is pure: The Name of God is an honour
to yon, O be not you a dishonour to it, <hi>Iames 2. 8.
Do not,</hi> O do not <hi>blaspheme that worthy name by
which ye are called.</hi> How holy should you be in
your hearts; how watchful over your words; how
wary in your works; how faithful in your families;
how conscientious in all companies? for the most

                        <p>Sir, observe it, is it comely for a God to swear;
for a God to wrong his neighbours; for a God to

But now, if a great man walk with God, condemn
and reprove sin by his works as well as by words,
(being as the chief Magistrate of <hi>Israel</hi> was, mighty
in word and deed, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 22.) if he pray with his

                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:96886:136"/>First, Execute justice impartially. God is a God of
Justice &amp; judgement, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 18. The most just, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.
17. Others may do justly, he cannot but do justly: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
which is an accident in others (and therefore
may be separated from them) is his very Essence,
his Being. Be ye therefore like God. <hi>Let Iustice
run down like water, and Righteousness like a mighty
stream.</hi> Wear the same garments which he doth,
<hi>Isa. 59. 17. He putteth on Righteousness for a Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
and the Helmet of Salvation upon his head.</hi> Such
garments did holy <hi>Iob</hi> wear, <hi>I put on Righteousness,
and it cloathed me, my Iudgement was as a Robe and
a Diadem, Iob</hi> 29. 14. Kings and Princes wear
Crowns and Diadems, Judges and other Officers
wear Robes and other Ornaments. Now saith
<hi>Iob,</hi> others place much of their glory and state
in their Robes, in their Purple vestments which
strike a reverence in the Subject toward his Superior,
adding in the estimation of men Majesty to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and solemnity to the action of the wearer: but I
place my honour in Justice and Judgement; I think
my self better cloathed with these real vertues, then
others with their empty marks &amp; ensigns of dignity.</p>
                        <p>I say,<note place="margin">It was a strange yet true saying, There was more justice in hell then in <hi>France;</hi> there the guilty are punished, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great, they do not escape; but in <hi>France</hi> it is otherwise; may it not be said so of <hi>England?</hi>
                           </note> Execute Justice impartially, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

as if he had said, ye cannot deal righteously, if ye
spare any, because he is poor, or because he is rich.
It is a principle in Moral Policy, That an ill executor
of the Laws is worse in a State then a great breaker
of them. And the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings presented the
Oath to their Judges, not to swerve from their
consciences, though they received a command from
themselves to the contrary. Neither fear of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
(It is a mercy to have Judges, saith <hi>Cicero, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
audeant quae sentiunt)</hi> nor favour of nearness
should make Magistrates deviate from the Rule.

When <hi>Caricles</hi> the son in law of <hi>Phocion</hi> was accused
for taking bribes, he desired his Father to defend
his cause; but he answered him, I took thee for my
son in law in all honest matters only. A Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
should be an heart without affection; an eye
without lust; a mind without passion; or otherwise
his hand will do unrighteous actions. He that goeth
to the Seat of Judicature, must leave his affections
(as <hi>Abram</hi> his servants when he went to the Mount)
behind him. A Justice must like the earth, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
and nourish the low Violet as well as the
tall Cedar. The <hi>Graecians</hi> placed Justice betwixt <hi>Leo</hi>
and <hi>Libra,</hi> thereby signifying, that there ought to
be both magnanimity in executing, and indifferency
in determining. But the impartiality of a Ruler
is notably set out by the Throne of the house of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
which was placed in the gate of the City,<note place="margin">Psal. 122. 5.</note> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sun rising, as some observe. In the gate, to
tell us that all who went in and came out at the gate,
might indifferently be heard, and have free access to
the Judgement Seat; but rowards the rising of the
Sun, to shew that their judgement should be as clear
from corruption, as the Sun is clear in his chiefest
brightness.</p>
                        <p>It would be an ornament unto, and tend to the
settlement of Magistracy (<hi>for the Throne is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by righteousness, Prov.</hi> 16. 12.) if those two
Verses which some say are written in letters of gold

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96886:137"/>

and why should it from the Gods?<note place="margin">Dan. Hist.</note> 
                           <hi>Edward</hi> the
Confessor was held a bad Prince, not by doing

telleth him that he would judge his house for ever
for the iniquity which he knew, because his Sons
made themselves vile, and he restrained them not,
1 <hi>Sam. 3. 13. Eli</hi> was a Magistrate, and should have
put forth his authority and punished those ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
children, but because he did not, God punisht
both him and them. O it is dangerous to do the
work of the Lord negligently. Sir, Do not you
(or might you not upon inquiry) know of them
that prophane Gods day, blaspheme his name, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Ale-houses and the like? do you restrain them?
Do you fright such offenders with your frowns, and
shew your love to their souls by executing Justice
on them for their sins? If you do not, look to your
self; for God hath Iron hands for Justices that have
leaden heels, and will one day strike them home, for
forswearing themselves to spare others. He will be

all the world, then one God. I beseech you,
make it appear that you are Magistrates by being
men of courage; be as bold in executing as others
are in transgressing the law. Shall iniquity be brazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced,
and authority hide it self? If the offendor
be in robes, be not afraid of him, but make him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of you. I have read that the <hi>Athenian</hi> Judges
sat in <hi>Mars-street,</hi> to shew that Rulers should be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96886:138"/>
men of valour; Cowards are more fit to be slaves
then rulers. A Magistrate should be like <hi>Moses,</hi> in
his own cause as meek as a Lamb, in Gods cause as stiff
as an Oak, as bold as a Lion. All dare disparage
him who dareth discourage none. How punctually
doth Scripture tell you, that this ought to be your
practice! Magistrates, saith <hi>Peter,</hi> are sent for the
punishment of evil doers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. And <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, <hi>If thou doest evil, be afraid; for he beareth not
the sword in vain. For he is the Minister of God, an
avenger to execute wrath on them that doevil, Rom.</hi> 13. 4.
The sword which is carried before him, as an Ensign
of his power, is not for shew or for fashion, but
for the wounding disorderly persons. <hi>A wise King</hi>
saith Solomon, <hi>Prov. 20. 26. scattereth the wicked and
bringeth the wheel over them,</hi> a kind of punishment then
in use, and now in many places. Especially be severe
to them that prophane the Sabbath, that Queen of
dayes, that golden season of grace. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would
not spare the chief men that prophaned this chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of dayes, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 17. This is one of the
chief precepts which the Lord of Sabbath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you, <hi>Exod. 20. Exod. 23. 12. Englands</hi> disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods rest, hath raised God to disturb <hi>Englands</hi>
rest.</p>
                        <p>He that spareth the bad, hurteth the good. The
Chirurgion must cut off incurable members, and the
Physitian of the State must purge out the peccant
humours of the body Politick, least they infect and
injure the whole. The execution of Justice is like
a clap of thunder which striketh few, but frighteth

the good and bad are (though unjustly) punished;
yet the greatest injury is to the Ruler, by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors

contracts on his soul, and thereby Gods eternal
wrath, he is oftentimes punished in his body, and

to banish that generation of Vipers, the Jesuites,
he would not, saying, Give me security then for my

their instigation. God doth not seldom make them
examples of his Judgements, that will not make others
examples of Justice.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That you be Protectors of them that do
well. The Holy Ghost telleth you that you should be

should be Cities of refuge to them that are unjustly
and causlesly pursued; like <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, to take in

of the Altar, to which innocency should flie for

especially under the shadow of your wings. Piety

(especially good ones) as Fathers of their children.
Alas, if the Magistrates will not own them, what
what shall the godly do! The Devil raiseth all the
the Train-bands of hell against them that march to
heaven. The world loveth its own, but because
they are not of the world, therefore the world ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

because they dare not run to the same excess of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot.

them in times of danger. Sure I am that it is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge

to the people of God. God carrieth them
upon Eagles wings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 4. as tenderly as the
Eagle her young ones, of which some observe, she
carrieth her prey between her Talons, but her young
under her wings; and if a Fowler shoot at her, she
will first have her own body shot through, before
they shall be hurt. God is therefore called their
shield, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Now a shield is between the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

God in this. Remember that men were not
made for you, but you were made for them; God
took <hi>David</hi> from the sheepfold to feed <hi>Iacob</hi> his

                        <p>It was said by <hi>Nazianzen</hi> of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that he

                        <p>Secondly, As you should work like Gods amongst
men in executing Justice impartially, so likewese in
shewing mercy: <hi>God is the Father of mercies, 1</hi> Cor.
1. 3. <hi>Rich in mercy,</hi> Ephes. 2. 4. <hi>He hath multitudes
of tender mercies,</hi> Psal. 51. 1. <hi>He is abundant in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96886:139"/>
mercy, 1</hi> Pet. 1. 3. <hi>His mercy is free,</hi> Rom. 9. 15.
<hi>Great,</hi> Psal. 57. 10. <hi>Matchless,</hi> Jer. 3. 1. <hi>Sure,
Isa.</hi> 55. 1.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 32. p 30. before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> Mercy as one observeth, is the chief of
all Gods attributes, though in themselves they are
all equal; but in regard of our necessities, as Oyl
swims above all other liquors, as the Eagle is the
chief of Birds, the Lion of Beasts, Gold of metals; so
mercy is the chief of all Gods attributes. He hath a
Mercy-seat, to note that he sitteth at ease when he is
shewing mercy. Whereas judgement is his strange
work, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 21. we read likewise that mercy pleaseth
him, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7. 18. Thus the Gods should be mercifull
men, your hearts should be full of mercy, and pitty
to the sinner, when your hands are executing justice
against the sin.</p>
                        <p>The Bee doth not sting till provoked: <hi>God doth

I do not now dispute the question, Whether any

their Axes and Rods carried before their Consuls,
to shew that if the lesser punishments, as of the rods,
would serve, the greater of the Axe should not be
used. And they did justly lament the cruelty of those
tribunals where the cheap prescription of lives made
the Judgement-seat differ little from a Shambles.</p>
                        <p>3. Work as Gods among men in promoting piety
to your power. The great design and work of God
is to promote holiness in the world. This was his
aim in his internal work of his decree, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4.
This is the great end he drives at, in his external
works. As in the work of redemption, <hi>Tit. 2. 14.
Luke</hi> 1. 92. In bestowing his word. (The precepts
in it are the perfect rule of godliness, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16.

2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. the threatnings are like the Angel
with a drawn sword in his hand to deter men from
the way of ungodliness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18.) And his works
of providence are to the same purpose. Afflictions
are like the fire to consume the dross, and purifie
the gold, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. Mercies are like the warm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the vernal Sun to draw forth the Sap of
grace, and hasten mens growth in holiness.</p>
                        <p>Thus should the Gods promote godliness as the
chief business which the most high God hath given
them to do.<note place="margin">Prima Magistratus cura debet esse, religionem veram promovere, &amp; impietatem probibere. <hi>Ames. de consc lib. 5. cap.</hi> 25.</note> Other things of what nature soever

should do,<note place="margin">Ia boc reges Deo serviunt in quantum reges. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                           </note> Partly by their patterns in being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of godliness to their people; Their lives
should be so exact that they should be able to say as
<hi>Gideon,</hi> Judges. 7. 17. <hi>Lock on us and do likewise,</hi> or
as <hi>Paul,</hi> Walk as ye have us for an example.</p>
                        <p>Partly by your precepts; your edicts and commands
should be like those of <hi>Asa, 2 Chron. 14. 2. 4. Asa
did that which was right in the sight of the Lord. He
commanded</hi> Judah <hi>to seek the Lord God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and to do the Law and the Commandment.</hi> Mark,
upright <hi>Asa</hi> did not leave men to choose their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor to live as they listed, but be commanded
them to obey Gods Law. He did not strictly enjoyn
the payment of Taxes or Customs, and such civil
things, and leave it as a matter of indifferency whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men would mind religion or no, but his Laws
did enforce and confirm the Laws of God, as far
as he was able.</p>
                        <p>Partly by countenancing, maintaining and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able Ministers, 2 <hi>Chron. 19. 8. 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 13. for
the Church; as also by taking care that they discharge
their trusts faithfully, 2 <hi>Chron. 29. 3, 4, 5. 1 Chron.</hi> 16.
It is observed of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, that to root
up Christianity he disgraced the Orthodox Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
took away Church maintenance and forbad
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96886:141"/>

to be a publike Preacher, but he hath a call to
see that none abuse that calling to the hurt or poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his people.</p>
                        <p>Partly by suppressing and discountenancing them
whose doctrines or lives hinder godliness.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Plato</hi> would not permit in his Common-wealth any such person as asserted God the Author of sin.</note> Suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
evil is necessary for the promoting good. Holy
<hi>Asa</hi> removed his Mother from being Queen upon
this very account, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 12, 13. The tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any in such sins is an intolerable sin. And
the jealous God will one day make Magistrates
know, that they shall bear his anger for bearing
such evill doers as blasphemers and Hereticks are.

                        <p>First, from the practices of godly Rulers; What
<hi>Asa</hi> did, hath been already mentioned. <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
was a Prince that did also promote Piety, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
29. 2. 3, 4, 5. 25. 30. &amp; in 2 <hi>Cbron. 30. &amp;</hi> 5. which
places are large (therefore not here recited) but full
to our purpose, wherein <hi>Hezekiah</hi> commanded the
Levites to sanctifie themselves, to praise the Lord
with the words of <hi>David,</hi> and both Priests and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to keep the Passeover.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>So</hi> Iosiah, 2 Chron. 34. 3. ult. And the King stood
in his place, and made a Covenant before the Lord,
to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And <hi>(mark)</hi> he caused all that were present
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96886:142"/>
in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> to stand to it. And
the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did according to the
Covenant of God. And <hi>Josiah</hi> took away all the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
out of all the Countries that pertained to
the children of <hi>Israel. (Observe)</hi> And made all
that were present in <hi>Israel</hi> to serve, even to serve the
Lord their God. And all his dayes they departed not
from following the Lord. <hi>He made them to serve
the Lord both by his precepts, and by the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he inflicted on them that would not. This text
can never be answered. All the subtile evasions which
Jesuitical heads have used to make it invalid, could
never do it. For if as some affirm, it is not binding
to us under the New, because it is delivered in the
Old Testament, then Faith in Christ and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which are the sum and substance of the
Old Testament are void also; and so they may rob
us, if we will believe them, both of our Saviour and
Salvation</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">It is observable that in the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> when <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth the lives of the Kings of Israel, he doth in the first place take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how they de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Nay an Heathen King enacted a law, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

the Law of the King, that judgement should be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

like in Ecclesiastical Writers. <hi>Constantine</hi> a godly
Emperour,<note place="margin">Theodoret. lib. 5. cap. 20.</note> purged the Church of Idolatry, and
established the worship of God by his own Imperial
commands. <hi>Iovinian</hi> also and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> by their
Royal Edicts set up and restored the true Religion,
which <hi>Iulian</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> had put down and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The precepts given by God to Rulers,
speak this to be their duty. God commandeth him to
write him a copy of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18. For what
end, but that he might keep it himself, as he is a man,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96886:142"/>
and take care that others should not break it, as
he is a Magistrate. It was an ancient Ceremony in
<hi>Israel</hi> at the Kings Coronation, that when the
Crown was set on his head, the Book of God should
be given into his hand, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 12. to shew that
God committed the care of Religion principally to
him, that by his power and authority it might be
established in his Dominions.</p>
                        <p>God commandeth Magistrates to be for the good<note place="margin">

for thy natural good in preserving thy life in safety;
for thy civil good in securing thine estate; for thy
spiritual good in establishing the true worship of
God, as a keeper of the first Table; Nay, the way to
promote the civil good of a people, is, by promoting
their spiritual good. That Common-wealth will
certainly stand longest, which hath not State-Policy,
but State-Piety for its foundation. How many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have confirmed this truth, <hi>Vbi non est sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,
pietas, fides, instabile regnum est!</hi> A Nation
without Religion, is like a City without walls, naked
and open to all enemies; like a building without a
foundation, which will quickly be overthrown. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to a people is as the <hi>Palladium</hi> to the <hi>Trojans,</hi>
as the <hi>Ancile</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> which kept them safe.
The want of this overthrew the great Monarchies
of the world. What besides this, hath turned so
Kingdoms into ruined heaps, and Cities into solitary
Deferts? If a fruitful land be turned into barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is it not for the iniquity of them that dwell
therein! <hi>Psal. 107. 34. Tully</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Cicero de legib.</note> observed, that the

                        <p>Besides, God promiseth that Magistrates shall in

to deal moderately with the King, <hi>Clavum teneo &amp; ad

for the furthering Piety, &amp; the Lord will be with you.</p>
                        <p>Now that Magistrates may be enabled and incited
to walk, and to work, as Gods among men; I shall
deliver a few directions, and two or three motives,
and then conclude.</p>
                        <p>First, If you would walk and work as Gods, then
get divine principles. According to your principles,
such will your practices be; water riseth no higher
then its Fountain: If therefore you would walk as
God, and work for God, you must both walk and
work from God. If ever the hand of the dial point,
and go right without, the wheels and poises
must be right within. It is noted of true and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Saints, that acted for God in the Regal Office,
That their hearts were perfect with the Lord, 1 <hi>King.
15. 14. Isai.</hi> 38. 3. This spiritnal life in their souls
made them warm and zealous for their Saviour.
<hi>Caleb</hi> that followed the Lord fully, had another
spirit, a different principle from the ten carnal
Princes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 24. Mens actions will then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> sacred, when their affections are sanctified. He
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96886:143"/>
that followeth God he knoweth not why, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
God he knoweth not how. A Magristrate that
is zealous for God only because the times favour
such, may soon be brought to be as zealous against
God. He that is not knit to his service with the
heart-strings of love, spun out of a renewed nature,
will easily be parted from his service. Such slavish
spirits will serve God no longer then they can serve
themselves of God. When <hi>Iehu</hi>'s interest &amp; Gods are
conjoyned, as in rooting out the idolatry of <hi>Baal,</hi>
how fiery is <hi>Iehu?</hi> how furiously doth he drive? He
slayeth all the false Prophets, he breaketh down the
Images of <hi>Baal,</hi> and the house of <hi>Baal,</hi> and maketh it
a draugh-house, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 25, 27. But when
Gods Interest and <hi>Iehus</hi> are divided, as in the Calves
at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> there <hi>Iehu</hi> must be excused, he will
uphold them (as some do by that Monster of Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
out of State policy, expecting that they
should uphold him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 27, 28. But what
was the reason of this? Surely the want of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
principle; the fire of <hi>Iehu</hi>'s zeal was (not
lighted at the Altar, for then it would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
burning, but) kitchen fire kindled at a common
hearth, and therefore would burn no longer then it
had such grols matter as his own credit or profit to
feed it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when this suel was taken away, his fire went
out; look in vers. 31. <hi>Iehu walked not in the law of
the Lord with all his heart;</hi> his heart was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
it was not cast into the fire of the Word, and
new-moulded by the Spirit of God. The want of
this foundation over-turned all that beautiful build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which <hi>Iehu</hi> had set up.</p>
                        <p>It is a question in Politicks, Whether a wicked man
may be a good Magistrate? It is I suppose possible
for a wicked man when he is in authority to do some
good; but I conceive he will hardly do the good he
ought; or like <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96886:144"/>
him; but like the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> he will launch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
no further into the Ocean then he can be sure to
get back safe. Such a man is like an Horse with a
thorn in his foot, which may go fairly on in good
wayes, but if he come to hard wayes, he will halt,
and discover himself. He that hath not gone
through the pangs of the new birth, and heartily
taken God in Christ for his All, and thereby secured
his eternal estate, will scarce hazard his name or
estate, much less his limbs or life for God, as he
must do that will be faithful unto the death: For
with what heart can he look that danger in the
face, which for ought he knoweth may kill both
body and soul?</p>
                        <p>Or if he be very bold and venturous for God, yet
being an evil man, he can never do good (by all
his activeness as a Ruler) to his own soul. God may
give him parts, and gifts, and courage, (as a Noble
man giveth dainty fare to his Nurse) not out of love
to him, but for his childrens sake. He may like a
ship, be instrumental, to land others at some happy
Port whereon it never entereth it self; He may be
very helpful to others temporal; nay and eternal
salvation, and yet miss himself: <hi>Iehu</hi> by acting for
God, got a lease of an earthly Kingdom for three or
four lives, but he lost the heavenly one for ever.
The most that I know, that a civil yet unsanctified
Magistrate gets by his forwardness and heat for God,
is only a cooler hell; though your names are divine,
yet if ye be not partakers of the divine nature, ye
are lost for ever. Now what advantage will it be
to you, like <hi>Noahs</hi> Carpenters, to build an Ark for
the saving of others, and to perish your selves!</p>
                        <p>Believe it Sirs, If ye would have good fruits in
your lives, there must be this root of holiness in your
hearts; <hi>A good man out of the good treasure of his
heart bringeth forth good things.</hi> What water is in the
Well, such will be in the bucket; and what ware
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96886:144"/>
is in the shop, such will be on the stall; therefore
when God promiseth that men shall walk in his
wayes, and keep his judgements, and do them; he
promiseth also to put his Spirit, or a new spirit into
them, which should enable them thereunto. <hi>Ezek.
11. 19. Ezek 36. 26, 27.</hi> The flesh will serve to
enable a man to walk after the flesh; but the Spirit
of God alone can enable man to walk after the
spirit. Natural light is not sufficient to mortifie
natural lusts: It may cover for some time, but can
never kill sin. Some men may be like the Lyons
in <hi>Daniels</hi> den, chained up, or restrained, and yet
have their ravenous dispositions, their old carnal
hearts still. Civility though commendable, yet
without inward sanctity, is not sufficient to prove
one interested in a Saviour, or in a state of salvation.
There is as much difference between a Moral man
and a real Christian, as between a liveless picture
and a living person: A Lion and a Lamb, a Raven
and a Dove, darkness and light, death and life do
not differ more then a sinner and a Saint, then a man
only civilized and a sanctified Christian.</p>

by the indwelling of Gods Spirit renewing you in
the Spirit of your mind, it is impossible that ever
you should be in heaven. The tide of your natures,
and the wind of your affections must be turned the
clean contrary way to what they are by your birth,
if ever you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therefore as for life, for this principle of spiritual
life, without which you cannot escape the second
death.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If ye would walk and work as Gods
among men, then your rule must be divine as well
as your principle. Every calling hath some rule
to go by, in conformity to which, their excellency

shall not depart out of thy mouth,</hi> (saith God to the
chief Governour of <hi>Israel) but thou shalt meditate
therein day and night, that thou maist observe to do
according to all that is written therein: for then thou
shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt
have good success.</hi> And <hi>Deut. 17. 18, 19. The King
that sitteth upon the Throne, shall write him a copy
of the Law: And it shall be with him, and he shall
read therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn
to fear the Lord, and to keep all the words of this
Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a Maxim of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> that the
Law it self ought to be the rule by which all Judges
must be regulated, all controversies tryed, and all
cases decided. It is good to keep close to the
laws of men (that are warrantable by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
but it is best to keep close to the
Word of God; There are the best precepts for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
the best patterns of just men; nay, and of the
Infinitely righteous God. You have the example
of God himself, how just, how holy he is in all his
doings, how he walketh, how he worketh. <hi>Caesars</hi>
ambition was to imitate <hi>Alexander; Themistocles</hi>
endeavoured to resemble <hi>Miltiades.</hi> Do you labour
to be like God, to hate sin, to love holiness, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the prophane, to countenance the pious, to
be active and zealous both by your patterns and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
for the glory of God.</p>
                        <p>In all your difficulties make the Word of God
your Counsellor; in all your doubts let Scripture
resolve you: You may look too much to the light

rule whereby she would frame her Government.
This was the delight, the joy, the counsellor of that

And indeed this Book of Books only can make a

Ruler. Let therefore the ballance of the Sanctuary
weigh all, the Oracles of God decide all, the rule of
the Word square all, and then nothing will be amiss.

If ye love your souls, take heed of self. O how
many millions by seeking themselves have lost
themselves! by seeking their own glory, pleasure,
and profit for a time, have brought themselves
to shame, pain, and loss to all eternity! O Beware
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96886:146"/>
of this root of bitterness, Self. Do not like <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi>
pretend to be zealous for the Goddess,
when in truth it was for his gain. Or like water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
row one way towards God and Christ, and
Heaven, and look another way, towards the world,
and the flesh; but give up thy self wholly to him;
Lay out thy talents altogether for him; esteem it
thy felicity and priviledge that thou hast more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
then others, whereby thou mayst exceed
others in serviceableness to thy Maker, Preserver,
and Redeemer.</p>

                        <p>I come now to the Motives, to stir you up both to
walk and work as Gods among men.</p>
                        <p>1. Consider, God beholdeth you this day; He
taketh notice, and observeth how ye walk, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96886:147"/>
how ye work. <hi>All the wayes of man (Prov. 5. 21.)
are before the Lord, and he pondereth all his paths.</hi>
Be your works what they will be, God seeth them,
and he weigheth them in the balance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
and that beam will discover it, if they be never
so little too light.</p>
                        <p>He beholdeth not only your practices, but your
principles; he knoweth what is the wind which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Mill to go; he knoweth by what rule, and
for what end, and from what principle ye act; all
things are, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, naked and open
in the eyes of him with whom we have to do, <hi>Heb.
4. 13.</hi> The words are very Emphatical, and signifie
thus much, That as the Lineaments and outside of
the Body is very visible when it is naked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed;
and as the bowels and inside are discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when the body is dissected and anatomized; So
are both your outwards and inwards, your actions
and affections manifest, naked and open to God.</p>
                        <p>Nay, he beholdeth what ye do in the dark; you
may work so cunningly as to hide your designs and
works from men, but not from God; there is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
nor shadow of death where the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
can hide themselves, <hi>Iob 34. 22.</hi> This Sun
knoweth no night, no darkness; where ever he is
(and he is infinite and omnipresent) it is light, and
day; therefore the eyes of Christ, <hi>Rev. 1. 14.</hi> are
said to be as a flame of fire, implying his omniscience,
and that he is able to disperse all darkness. For Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
and experience teach us, that those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which have fiery eyes can see in the dark; and
the reason is clear, because they do not see as we do
<hi>(Recipendo species ab objecto, sed extra-mittendo spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)</hi>
by receiving species from the Object, but by
sending out species or rays, which do both inlighten
the <hi>medium,</hi> the ayr, and apprehend the Object.
Thus Christ seeth in the dark ye see: yea the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hideth not from him, but the night shineth as
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96886:147"/>
the day; to him the darkness and the light are both
alike, <hi>Psal. 139. 12.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ponder then this omnipresence and omniscience of
God, and walk before him, and be upright, <hi>Gen. 17. 1.</hi>
The Moralist would have his Scholars to live always
as in the eye of <hi>Cato:</hi> O do you live ever as in the
eye of God. Beware what thou dost; for God seeth
thee: God standeth in the Congregation, he judgeth
among the Gods, <hi>Psal. 82. 1.</hi> He judgeth among you,
he is present with you; not always in regard of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;
for your deeds may be evil; but always
in regard of observation.</p>
                        <p>This was <hi>Iehosaphats</hi> Argument to incite his Iudges
to care and caution, <hi>2 Chron. 19. 6, 7. Take heed
what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for the
Lord, who is with you in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you in the judgement; With you to commend and
praise you if ye do well; to condemn and punish you
if you do ill; to observe and take notice whether ye
do well or ill. As if <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> had said, I cannot
ride circuit with you, nor be present with you in all
your Councils, but the Lord a greater then I, can
and doth; he is with you in the Judgement: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take
heed, and do it; for there is no iniquity with the
Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of
Gifts,</hi> ver. 7.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Judges were set in their seats
of Judicature,<note place="margin">Quintus Pius <hi>in 2 Chro.</hi> 19.</note> certain empty Chairs were placed
about them (some say twelve) into which they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
the holy Angels came. And this they hoped
would work in their Magistrates circumspection and
fear of doing any thing unworthy the Angels eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>observation:
I must tell you a greater then Angels

and watchfull, take heed what ye do.</p>

<hi>Cesars</hi> Souldiers were prodigal of their blood, when

have other thoughts of sin and holiness, then now ye

have; Sin will not be so pleasant and lovely, nor holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
so mean and unworthy as now it is in your eyes.</p>
                        <p>Probably you can hear of death by the reports of
others,<note place="margin">As birds build in steeples, and are never troubled at the noise of Bells, being used to it; nor ye at the sight of graves or coffins.</note> and be little troubled; ye can <hi>stand it out
stiffly against such false fire, with We must all die,</hi>
and Nothing so sure; God knoweth who shall go
next, and the like: all this while, the heart not with
seriousness considering of it, so as to be preparing
for it: The soul as much neglected, God as little
regarded, and the affections as much inslaved to flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lusts as before. But when Death<note n="*" place="margin">That King of terrors and terror of Kings.</note> climbs up to
your own windows, and entereth into your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and comely with its pale face to your bed side,
and boldly arresteth you with a warrant from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
assuring you by its symptoms on your body,
that you must in good earnest into the other world,
and there have all your walkings and workings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
and examined by the infinitely pure
and righteous God, and your souls (according to
your deeds) sentenced impartially, and sent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to Heaven or Hell, then surely your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of a new Nature, and strict Conversation,
will change, and you will wish with all your souls for
a little of others oyl; for your Lamps will go out.
The stourest unregenerate heart alive will droop at
last, when God cometh to take away his soul, then
his crest-falls, and his plumes flag.</p>
                        <p>Now possibly thy Cup overfloweth, thou hast a
large portion of the good things of this world, and
they have so much of thy heart, that thou art little
troubled about the things of the other world; the
Table of thy life now is richly spread with honours,
pleasures, relations, possessions, and these have the
largest share in thy heart; in these thou solacest thy
self, desiring no other Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what wilt thou
do when Death shall come with a Voider, and take
all away, even all thy treasure on earth? then thou
wilt wish thou couldst find a treasure in Heaven, that
thou mightest die the death of the Righteous, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96886:151"/>
have thy latter end like his: But oh Friend, thou
shouldst then have lived their lives, and have had thy
conversation like theirs: as the Crab in the Fable
told the Serpent (who when she had received her
deaths wound for her crooked conditions, stretched

she should have been straight in her life time. The
way to make thy death comfortable, is to make thy
life serviceable to God, and thy soul. He that would
enjoy true rest when he dyeth, must labour faithfully
and diligently whilst he liveth. It will be like a
dagger at the heart in an hour of death to reflect
upon the talents misimployed, and opportunities
misimproved, which free grace afforded you for the
honouring of God, and furthering of your own
salvations. Sins of omission will wound deeper
at a dying hour then most are aware of. God hath
committed a great trust to you, and the day of your
lives is the only time of discharging it; besides, ye
know not how few hours ye may have to your day,
whether it shall be a Winter or a Summer day; the
shadows of the evening may suddenly stretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon you, and then it will be no longer day;
therefore <hi>work the work of him that sent you into
the world, while it is day, for the night cometh wherein
no man can work, Iohn 9. 4.</hi> Is it not sad, that our
common observation should be so much verified in
the practices of great men, That Bells strike thick
while they are rising, but stand still and give no
sound at all when they are at full pitch! That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
should like the Sun, the higher in the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,
move the slower!</p>
                        <p>The more noble creatures are, the more active
they are, Men more active then Beasts, Angels then
men. One I remember observeth, that God would
not accept the first-born of an Ass, because it was a

(which is in all that are sanctified) is compared to
fire, <hi>Acts 2.</hi> therefore they that would not grieve

(seething hot, as the word signifieth) in spirit,
serving the Lord, <hi>Rom. 12. 11.</hi> Hence it was that
the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> got letters testimonial from
Heaven, <hi>Revel. 2. 2. I know thy works and thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
how thou canst not bear them that are evil.</hi> And
indeed the more good a Justice hath in himself, the
less he will bear with evil in others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Augustine</hi> hath a true saying, <hi>Qui non zelat, non
amat,</hi> He that is not zealous for God, hath no true
love to God. For though love be a passion, yet it
delighteth to shew it self in acting for the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Calvin</hi> grew sickly, some friends disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him from hard studying, but he gave them this
answer, <hi>Vultisne Christum me invenire otiosum,</hi>
would you have Christ when he comes (to me by
death) to find me idle? So do ye think, that when
sinners <hi>Iehu</hi>-like drive furiously, ye should not like
<hi>Aegyptians,</hi> go heavily, least death find you idle?
Observe what became of the idle servant, that hid
his talent in a napkin, <hi>Matth 25. 30.</hi> He was punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an eternal long night, who would not work
in his short day.</p>
                        <p>3. Consider the day of Judgement, God will
then search and sentence you, discover and reward
you according to your works. Ye that examine and
try others, shall then be examined and tryed your
selves, and ye that acquit or condemn others, shall
then be acquitted or condemned your selves.</p>
                        <p>How should this thought move you to walk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
since your hearts shall be anatomized, and
your lives manifested before God, Angels and men!
Could ye but as <hi>Ierom,</hi> hear the sound of the last
trump always in your ears, Arise ye dead; and come
to judgement, surely ye would be holy Judges and
Justices indeed. <hi>Peter</hi> maketh this argument a
strong enforcement to holiness, <hi>2 Pet. 3. 10, 11.

to purity, this terrible day can do it. The sound of
the last Trump may well cause a retreat, and call us
off from an eager persuit of the flesh and world,
<hi>Eccles. 11. 9.</hi> and it may also stir you up to purity,
if ye would meet Christ at that day in peace. The
Throne of Christ is a white Throne, <hi>Rev. 20. 11.</hi> and
O with what trembling heart wilt thou O black
sinner stand before this white Throne, <hi>1 Pet. 4. 18.
If the righteous be scarcely saved</hi> (not in regard of
the uncertainty, but difficulty) <hi>Where shall the sinner
and ungodly appear?</hi> Surely the drunkards cup then
will be Wormwood, not Wine; The sentence on the
swearer then will be of cursing, not blessing; as he
loved cursing now, so then will it come to him; the
Adulterers pleasure now will then prove poyson; and
the prayerless man now, will then pray hard, work
in prayer for some ease, some end, if not a pardon,

yet a reprieve, for one hour, at least one drop of
water to cool his tongue; but he shall work at

                        <p>O look therefore, and make sure of true holiness,
of the power of godliness; for the fire of that day
will discover whether you are dross or gold: look
that the rule by which you walk be right, even the
Word of God, for by that you shall be judged for
your eternal life or death, <hi>Iohn 12. 36.</hi>
