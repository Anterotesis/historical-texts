            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of many godly friends herein, I should
not haue bin easily inclined to harken
to it (the world abounding with books
euen to loathing) but that in writings

there is some want, and that I haue

               </hi> is amplified: 1. By the
foundation of it, <hi>the fore-knowledge of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
2. By the meanes of execution of it, <hi>the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>tification
of the spirit.</hi> 3. By the ends of it, which
are two: 1. <hi>the obedience of their liues.</hi> 2. the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the benefits purchased by the <hi>blood of
Christ,</hi> and applied by the <hi>sprinkling of his blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The forme of the salutation is in the end of the
second verse: <hi>Grace and peace be multiplied</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the salutation: the doctrine of
the Chapter followes, which conteines both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of consolation, and matter of exhortation.</p>
            <p>The consolation is from verse 3. to verse 13:
where consider both the proposition of the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
verse 3, 4, 5. and the confirmation of it,
verse 6. to 13.</p>
            <p>In the proposition consider first the manner of
propounding it. 2. The arguments themselues.</p>
            <p>The manner of the propositions is, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> of thanksgiuing, <hi>Blessed be the God
and father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The arguments are three. The first taken from
their regeneration, <hi>verse</hi> 3. The second from their
glorifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ation, <hi>verse</hi> 4. The third from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
vnto glory, <hi>verse</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>The consolation raised from their regeneration
is amplified, 1. By the impul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>iue cause, <hi>the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
mercy of God.</hi> 2. By the effect, viz: <hi>a liuely
hope.</hi> 3. By the cause of merit, or efficacie, viz: <hi>the
resurrection of Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second argument is taken from our <hi>glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21069:4"/>
which is said to be the <hi>inheritance</hi> of the
Saints; which is amplified, 1. By the properties
of it, which are three. For it is first <hi>incorruptible.
2. vndefiled. 3. immarcessible,</hi> it withereth not.
Secondly, by the manner of their present interest;
It is not now possessed, but <hi>laid vp for them.</hi>
Thirdly, by the place, where it lieth, and that is
<hi>heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Argument is taken from our <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation</hi>
vnto glory, <hi>verse</hi> 5: where consider, 1. the
meanes of our <hi>preseruation,</hi> which is both <hi>power</hi> in
God, and <hi>faith</hi> in vs. 2. The end, which is <hi>salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which is amplified by the things that goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, viz: <hi>preparation</hi> and <hi>reuelation,</hi> in these
words, <hi>prepared to be reuealed:</hi> as also for the time,
when it shall bee communicated, viz: <hi>in the last
time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus of the proposition of the consolation:
the confirmation followes, which is performed
two waies. 1. By <hi>prolepsis,</hi> or the answer of obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>verse</hi> 6. to 10. 2. By the testimonie of
the Prophets, <hi>verses</hi> 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>For the first: the Apostle labours to confirme
them against two obiections.</p>
            <p>The first obiection might be taken from their
crosses, to which the Apostle giues answer, by
yeelding foure reasons, why their <hi>manifold tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
should not dismay them. 1. Because they
may haue much <hi>ioy</hi> in the midst of many crosses,
<hi>verse 6. 2. Their heauinesse is but for a season,
verse</hi> 6 also. 3. They are not bound alwaies to
greeue at their crosses, but <hi>when neede requires,
<pb facs="tcp:21069:5"/>
verse</hi> 6 also. 4. Because their temptations doe
them good: for they <hi>try their faith,</hi> verse 7: this
effect is both propounded, and amplified: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in those words, <hi>The triall of your faith:</hi>
amplified, 1. by comparison with <hi>gold tried</hi> in the
furnace. 2. by the euent; it <hi>will be found to praise,
and honor, and glory at the appearing of Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second obiection might be made thus: We
know not whether the former comforts belong
to vs; to which the Apostle answers by giuing
three signes, by which men might try themselues:
1. The <hi>loue of Christ, whom they haue not seene.
2. Beleeuing.</hi> 3. The <hi>vnspeakable and glorious ioyes
of the Holy Ghost,</hi> verse 8. The <hi>end of all,</hi> which
is, <hi>the saluation of their soules,</hi> verse 9.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>Prolepsis:</hi> The testimonie of holy
men followes, where consider fiue things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Who testifie? In generall,</hi> Prophets: <hi>In spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,</hi>
those Prophets, <hi>which were appointed</hi> to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
of the grace that should come vnto vs Christians.</p>
            <p>2. Their adiunct precisenes to furnish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
for the knowledge of the things they testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d,
<hi>They searched and inquired diligently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The question they studied, or vnto which
they testifie: In generall, it was <hi>of saluation,</hi> ver. 10.
In speciall, it was of <hi>the manner, and time of the
grace foretold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The occasion, that fired them to this earnest
desire after this knowledge, and that was the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Holy Ghost, driuing them to foretell
<hi>of the passion of Christ, and glories that should follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The successe, and that is, that they were
<pb facs="tcp:21069:5"/>
               <hi>answered of God,</hi> where obserue two things. 1. The
manner of the giuing the answer, it was <hi>by reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

that two waies. 1. By the glory of their effi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ient
causes, which were lesse principall, <hi>the Apostles:</hi>
and more principall, the <hi>Holy Ghost sent downe
from heauen.</hi> 2. By the <hi>adiunct</hi> respect of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<hi>which things the Angels desire to looke into.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto of the consolation. The exhortation
followes from <hi>v.</hi> 13. to the end, where obserue:
1. The things, vnto which they are exhorted, <hi>v.</hi> 13.
2. The reasons, by which the exhortation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced.</p>
            <p>The things to which he doth exhort are three:
1. The first concernes the renouation of the mind,
<hi>Girde vp the loynes of your minde.</hi> 2. The second
concernes the moderation of life, <hi>be sober.</hi> 3. The
third concernes the confirmation of their hope,
<hi>Trust perfectly on the grace to be brought</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>The reasons follow, and they are 6 in number,
taken from the consideration, 1. Of the image of
God, <hi>verses</hi> 14, 15, 16. 2. of the iudgement of
God, <hi>verse</hi> 17. 3. of the redemption in Christ,
<hi>verses</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21. 4. of the relation to the
godly, <hi>verse</hi> 22. 5. of the immortality of the
<pb facs="tcp:21069:6"/>
soule, <hi>verse</hi> 23. 6. and sixtly, of the mortalitie
of the body, <hi>verses</hi> 24, 25.</p>
            <p>The first reason taken from the image of God
is both propounded, and expounded: propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in these words, <hi>as obedient children:</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
two waies, 1. by description. 2. by testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
By description, 1. <hi>negatiuely,</hi> shewing what
they should shunne, <hi>Not fashioning your selues to
the lusts of your former ignorance,</hi> verse 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>2. He
sets it out <hi>affirmatiuely,</hi> both by shewing the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
to be imitated, viz: <hi>the holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>sse of him that
called them;</hi> and also the manner of imitation,
<hi>viz: to be holy in all manner of conuersation,</hi> vers. 15.
In the testimony two things are to bee noted.
1. whence the proofe was fetched in these words,
<hi>As it is written.</hi> and 2. what was alledged, viz: <hi>Be
yee holy, as I am holy,</hi> v. 16.</p>
            <p>The second reason is taken from the iudgment
of God, where note, 1. The proposition of the
reason, viz: <hi>He that yee call vpon as father,</hi> &amp;c.
2. The inference, or vse of the same, viz: <hi>Passe the
time of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>oiourning in feare.</hi> In the proposition
consider, 1. who shall be iudge, viz: <hi>he that was
called vpon as a father.</hi> 2. how hee shall iudge,
viz: <hi>without respect of persons.</hi> 3. whom he shall
iudge, viz: <hi>euery man.</hi> 4. for what they shall be
iudged, <hi>viz: according to their works,</hi> verse 17.</p>
            <p>The third reason is taken from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our redemption, and this reason should
moue the more,</p>
            <p>1. Because all the <hi>pretious things</hi> in the world
could <hi>not redeeme man,</hi> verse 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21069:6"/>
2. Because the deliuerance from <hi>our vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation,</hi>
was one of the maine ends of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<hi>verse</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>3. Because our redemption was effected by a
matchles price, <hi>viz: the passion of Christ,</hi> which is
increased, 1. In that it was a suffering euen to the
effusion <hi>of blood.</hi> 2. that it was a suffering of one,
that was so infinitely pure, <hi>without spot or blemish,
vers.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>4. Because our redemption was ordained in
Gods counsell, <hi>verse</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>5. Because the honor of manifesting Christ in
the cleare preaching of the Gospell is done now to
vs Christians, and not to the fathers of old, <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>6. Because our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>demption was ratified by God
the Father, and that two waies. 1. By <hi>raising Christ
from the dead.</hi> 2. By <hi>giuing him glory,</hi> v. 21.</p>
            <p>7. Because all this was done, that our faith and
hope might be in God, <hi>verse</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>The fourth reason is taken from our relation to
the godly, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. In which reason obserue, 1. A
proposition of doctrine. 2. An exhortation by
way of vse. The proposition in it selfe properly
concernes sanctification, which is described, 1. By
the nature of it, imported in the metaphoricall
terme, <hi>purified.</hi> 2. The subiect of it, <hi>your soules.</hi>
3. The forme of it, <hi>in obeying the truth.</hi> 4. The
cause of it, <hi>the spirit.</hi> 5. The end of it, which was
<hi>brotherly loue,</hi> amplified by the property of it, <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained.</hi>
The exhortation is therefore to <hi>loue one
another with a pure heart feruently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fift reason is taken from the immortalitie
<pb facs="tcp:21069:7"/>
of the soule, which is considered two waies. 1. In
respect of the fountaine of it, which is the <hi>new
birth.</hi> 2. In respect of the meanes of it, which is
set downe, 1. negatiuely, <hi>not of corruptible seede.</hi>
2. affirmatiuely: where consider what the meanes
is, and by what it is. What it is, <hi>viz: incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seede.</hi> By what it is, <hi>the word,</hi> which is praised
for three things: 1. It is <hi>of God. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>eth.</hi> 3. It
<hi>abideth for euer,</hi> verse 23.</p>
            <p>The sixt reason is taken from the mortalitie of
the body compared with the eternity of the word
of God, <hi>vers.</hi> 24, 25. Of the vanity of man, <hi>v.</hi> 24.
which is both propounded, and repeated: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
as it concernes either the person of man,
<hi>All flesh is grasse:</hi> or the condition of man, <hi>All the
glory thereof is as the flower of grasse.</hi> The repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as it concernes both is in these words, <hi>The
grasse withereth, and the flower falleth away.</hi> The
eternitie of the word of God is propounded in
these words, <hi>but the word of the Lord endureth for
euer:</hi> and explained by shewing of what word he
speaketh in these words, <hi>and this is the word which
is preached vnto you.</hi>

of the Apostles, who haue published the same
things to you in the preaching of the gospell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men inspired by the Holy Ghost from heauen,
and assisted with the visible-gifts of the Holy

Angells of heauen (like the Cherubins, that

admiration stand and wonder at, and search
into the manifold wisdome of God in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,

you neede to bee comforted, so haue I thought
it fit to exhort you, and first in things that
are generall to you all, both concerning the
matter of holinesse, and concerning the meanes
of it.</p>
            <p>There are three things you should labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. Wherefore girde vp the loynes of your minde: be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and hope to the end, for the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ace that is to be brought vnto you at the reuelation of Iesus Christ.</note>
1. The first is the restraining and resisting
of all lets of godlinesse, which within from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of nature are wont like long garments to
hinder you in the labour and race of a holy life.
2. The second is the moderation of your selues,
and that right temper in your hearts and liues,
especially in the vse of the outward things of
this world. 3. The third is, the perfecting of

               <pb facs="tcp:21069:11"/>
the assurance of your hope concerning the glory
of heauen, which God hath giuen of his free
grace, and shall be fully brought vpon you at
the last day, when Christ shall be shewed in his
glory to the world.</p>
            <p>Now there are six reasons, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
you to the care of a holy conversation
intended in the former duties.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. As obedient children, not fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your selues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former lusts in your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> 1. The first
concernes the image of God: yee are the
children of God, and therefore you should liue
so, as becomes Gods children, and expresse in
your cariage the resemblance of the nature of
God, not giuing your selues ouer out of the
liking of sinne to the seruice and obedience
of any of those corruptions, which either
your selues liued in before your calling, or
are vsually found in such onely, as know not
GOD.</p>
            <p>But as God, who by the power of his word
hath converted you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. But as he which hath called you is holy, so be yee holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation.</note> is holy; so should you
striue with respect of all his co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>andements
to resemble the praises of God in all your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
striuing in euery duty to follow your
patterne.</p>
            <p>And the rather, because this hath been ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
required in the old Testament of Gods people,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. Because it is written, Be yee holy, for I am holy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </note>
to propound vnto themselues the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>itation of
Gods holinesse, and to detest sinne, because they
would not be vnlike to God.</p>
            <p>2. A second reason may be taken from the
iudgments of God. For the time must certainly
come, when God, whom we call a father, and call
<pb facs="tcp:21069:11"/>
vpon as a father in this life,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. And if yee call on the Father, who without respect of persons iudgeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto euery mans worke, passe the time of your soiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning here in feare.</note> will summon
vs before his Tribunall certainly, and speedily,
and then no man shall escape, but shall bee
delt with without partiality, or any corrupt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
according as mens workes haue beene
either good or euill, and therefore it beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ues vs,
that are in this world but as s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iourners for a
time, to spend our daies in all carefullnesse, and
godly feare.</p>
            <p>3. A third reason may be taken from the
consideration of our redemption,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. Forasmuch as yee know that yee vvere not redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vvith corruptible things, as siluer and gold, from your vaine conuersatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by tradition from your fathers.</note> which hath
many important moti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>es in it: For it cannot
be, but yee all know, that your misery by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was so great, that yee could not be ranso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
if all the treasures of gold and siluer in
the world had beene giuen for you; and when
you were redeemed, a cheefe respect was had
to the freeing of you from the viciousnesse of
your conuersation, in which vainely yee spent
your times, and which corruption in many
things yee sucked in from the sinfull examples,
and precepts, and ill education of your Parents,
and ancestors.</p>
            <p>But especially,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. But vvith the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb vvithout blemish, and vvithout spot.</note> if yee consider, what a matchles
price was giuen for your ransome, euen the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

was the true lambe without blemish, or

This is he, to whom the Lord after his resurrection
three times said: Ionah, louest

storied of him, that in one day he converted 3000
soules: Hee cured <hi>Aeneas</hi> of the palsey: raised
a to life, first preached to the Gentiles being
instructed by a signe from heauen, and baptized
<hi>Cornelius</hi> with his houshold; He was by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>
               <hi>Apostle] Peter</hi> had a threefold call from Christ.
1. To the Discipleship<note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 4. Ioh: 1.</note>. 2. To the Apostleship<note n="g" place="margin">Mark. 3.</note>.
3. and then to the Apostleship<note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 21.</note> againe, hauing

of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An Apostle</hi> was the highest office in the Church.
The Apostle <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. reckons the callings of the

Thus of the person saluting.</p>
            <p>The persons saluted are first described by their

               </note> that dwell here and there.</p>
            <p>There are three opinions about these strangers,
who they should be: 1. Some thinke they were
the <hi>provinciall Iewes,</hi> who were scattered into
these parts, and converted to the faith of <hi>Christ</hi> by
<hi>Paul</hi> and Silas,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note> and because <hi>Siluanus</hi> (which is <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las)</hi>
was about to returne to visit these Churches,
therefore <hi>Peter</hi> writes by him: <hi>Hierome</hi> thinkes,
they were converted by <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe, who had
preached vnto them, when he was Bishop of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia.
In the sixt of the Acts, there are two sorts
of Iewes, <hi>viz:</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note> Grecians, and Hebrewes: The
Grecians were such Iewes, as were scattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
The Hebrewes were such, as kept their
owne state, and remoued not. There are two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
alledged, why these prouinciall Iewes should
be meant: 1. Because they are not simply called
strangers, but <hi>strangers of the dispersion,</hi> which
should note such Iewes, as were driuen thither
either of old, or by the persecution about <hi>Stephen,</hi>
or at other times after. 2. Because it was agreed,
that <hi>Peter</hi> should be the Apostle of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision.</p>
            <p>Others thinke, they were Gentiles converted to
the Iewish Religion,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> and so they take strangers and
<hi>Proselites</hi> to be all one; and to such <hi>Peter</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Act: 2. and converted many of them, and they
thinke he writes to them now.</p>
            <p>Others thinke, that this Epistle is so written to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21069:19"/>
the Iewes, as it is intended also for those elect
Gentiles in those parts,<note place="margin">

that these <hi>people were not in times past a people, nor

agree to the Iewes, and so all the Elect of God are
strangers in this world, and so the word is euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vsed, ch: 2. 12. and I thinke it is to be taken in
this last sense.</p>

and his natiue soile: so <hi>Abraham</hi> was a stranger in

            <p>2. <hi>In respect of the want of Gods fauour and

<hi>and</hi> from the life of God<note n="n" place="margin">Eph. 2. 12. &amp; 4. 17.</note>.</p>
            <p>3. In respect of the contempt of the world: so
Gods children, when they begin to feare God, the
world accounts them <hi>as strangers,</hi> &amp; auoids them:
so <hi>Dauid</hi> was <hi>a stranger to his brethren &amp; kinred</hi>

befall them<note n="p" place="margin">1 Pet: 4. 12.</note>.</p>
            <p>5. In respect of absence from the heauenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
and the troublesome condition in this

            <p>Gods elect then are strangers in this world:<note place="margin">Doctrin.</note> this
point is abundantly confirmed in these places:

And it may teach vs many excellent things for

toward others.</p>
            <p>There are 12 things,<note place="margin">14 Things Wherein wee should be like strangers.</note> which may be gathered out
of this metaphoricall tearme, to teach vs (with
much life) by the comparisons may be taken from
thence: Or there be 14 things, wherein we should
be like to strangers.</p>
            <p>1. A stranger is vnacquainted, and hath little to
doe, but with his iourney: so while we are in this
world, we should thinke chiefly on our iourney,
and keepe our selues estranged from the world,
dissoluing our sinfull acquaintance, and keeping
our hearts from the cares of life.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>A stranger vseth to be much affected with
lesser curtesies in a strange place,</hi> Ruth 2. 10. <hi>so
should we be thankfull to God for any kindnesse
in this world: it is enough it shall goe well with
vs in heauen, we should say with Dauid,</hi> who am I,
and what is my people, that we should <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all
things come of thee? Now therefore our God wee
thanke thee, and praise thy glorious name: for we are
strangers before thee, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>iourners, were all our
fathers: our daies on earth are as a shadow, and there
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 29. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>3. A stranger is wont to be glad of any good
company, that will go with him, thogh it were but
a part of the way: How should we then with all
ioy, and dearenesse intertaine Gods seruants into
our inward and perpetuall society? These are they
will goe with vs to heauen.</p>
            <p>4. A stranger will bee carefull to inquire his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21069:20"/>
way, feares to misse it, seekes best directions, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> euery day, yea and at euery turning: It will
not serue his turne once, or twise, or seldome in his
iourney to take generall directions: yea he is glad
to aske of any body, euen children, when he is out
of his way, or doth but feare it, or is in danger of
it: And shall not this teach vs to make more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of asking the way to heauen? how should
we goe to God to seeke a way of him? <hi>yea going
and weeping we should goe, and aske the way with our
faces thitherward,</hi> Ier: 51. 4. Ezra 8. 22. How
should we be glad of guides, and make our selues
also <hi>equall to them of the lower sort,</hi> that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and all good helps from Ministers, and
godly people we might receiue daily directions?
It is a horrible plague to haue a heart, that is not
willing and forward to aske questions about the
way to be saued, and intolerable pride not to make
vse of any that can giue vs counsell. O the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
stupiditie of our spirits! we that cannot tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in a road-way, that perhaps wee haue gone
before, without euery houres questions, yet thinke
our selues wise enough to finde the way to heauen
with little, or no directions.</p>
            <p>5. A stranger lookes not for great things for
himselfe, he doth not seeke honors, and offices, and
possessions in the Citty he trauells through: his
care is onely for necessaries for his iourney. And
are not we strangers on earth, and is it now a time
for vs to take vp our dwellings here, and to <hi>seeke
great things for our selues</hi> in this world? Ier: 46. 5.
a stranger neuer pleads any priuiledge in the place
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21069:21"/>
he comes to: and this was the ancient minde of
the godly Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the promises</hi> as their portion, and so set vp their
rest in their hopes, <hi>Heb:</hi> 11. 3.</p>
            <p>6. A stranger can endure wrongs: He staies not
his iourney to turne againe to euery dogge, that
barkes at him, nor to seeke reuenge for euery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:
He lets not his iourney for euery showre of
raine, and should it not be thus with vs? Why do
wee feare reproch? what stand wee still at euery
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ander? why busie we our heads for proiects of
reuenge? or our hearts with indignation at euery
currish caitiff, or dogged <hi>Doeg,</hi> that will <hi>falsely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
our good conversation in Christ?</hi> When will we
come to our iourneyes end, if we euery day trouble
our selues with the indignities we receiue in this
strange world? let the currs barke, ride thou on,
and minde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thy way. What if thy crosses fall like
raine? ride on, it is but a shower, it will be ouer.</p>
            <p>7. A stranger or tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ueller, so thinks of his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in the day, that he lookes for rest at night, and
so takes his rest at night, as he resolues to trauaile
againe in the morning: so should we be minded:
In prosperitie to prouide for aduersitie, and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
to hope for prosperitie againe, as assured,
that man abideth in no certaine stay here.</p>
            <p>8. A stranger neuer measures his owne worth,
by what he findes in the way, but by what he shall
possesse when he comes home:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 6, 7.</note> so should a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
doe, he should liue by faith, and not by sight:
It matters not, what the world thinkes of him,

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>9. A stranger will be glad to send home vpon
any opportunitie, and to get any friend to prouide
for him against he come: should not wee then be
glad of any opportunities to send home to heauen
by our prayers, and to beseech Christ (our friend,
Ioh: 15. 15.) to prouide our place for vs, who is
ready with all willingnes to doe all our busines in
heauen for vs?</p>
            <p>10. A stranger is vnskilfull in the language of
the seuerall people, where he comes, only cunning
in his owne language: So it should bee with vs,
though wee finde in one place the ambitious man
telling of his honors, offices, liuings; and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place the couetous man telling of his barnes,
wares, bargaines; and in another place the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
man telling of his dogges, sports, whores;
and in another place the wrathfull man, telling of
his aduersarie, wrongs, reuenge, &amp;c: yet we should
keepe vs to the language of Canaan, and speake <hi>as
becomes the oracles of God,</hi> and the gifts God hath
made vs stewards of.</p>
            <p>11. A stranger is cautelous and wary, he lookes
to his words, and behauiour: So should a Christian
be circumspect, and get the wisdome of a serpent
with the innocency of a doue, hee should not be
curions, nor inquisitiue, but <hi>studie to be quiet, and
meddle with his owne busines,</hi> Phil: 2. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>12. A stranger striues to ride on merrily, and to
weare out the tediousnes of the way with singing
sweet songs to himselfe: So should wee: <hi>our

            <p>13. A stranger, if by ignorance or passion bee
haue brought restraint, or bonds vpon himselfe, hee
will vse all possible intreaties, and meanes to get
himselfe loose againe, that hee may goe on in his
iourney homewards: so should we, it by sinne we
haue brought restraint vpon our selues, wee should
neuer be quiet, but powre out our teares &amp; prayers
vnto God, and vrge him to be good vnto vs euen
for this reason, as Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wishes, and all for his iourneyes end: So
should it be with a Christian, his <hi>conuersation should
be in heauen,</hi> and our affections continually run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
after God, and heauenly things, <hi>Phil. 3. 20.

            <p>This also should teach vs, seeing Gods children
are strangers in this world, to vse Gods pilgrims
with all honor and kindnes: let them be <hi>as princes
of God</hi> amongst vs, though they be now far from
home, yet they are noble persons, they are Gods
heires, learne of the very Hittites, <hi>Gen:</hi> 23. 4. 6.</p>

this meanes, they preserue the whole earth. For
they are the worlds guard: they beare vp heauen
as it were: were it not for these the world would
be destroyed: and by their dispersion they binde
Gods hands, as it were, from the places, wherein
they are, and keepe off his fierce iudgements; and
besides it is good for the godly themselues to be
a sunder thus: It quickens them to prayer: It
makes them loue and long one for another more:
It prepares them for hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dally with disobedience, seeing all <hi>is naked and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
before him, with whom we haue to deale,</hi> Heb:
4. 13: and wee may be the surer of it, seeing his
very word can tell vs of our thoughts, and the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
intent of our hearts, v.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>2. To trust vpon God, and rely vpon him in all
estates, seeing there is nothing but he knowes it,
and hath considered of it long since.</p>
            <p>3. It should inflame vs to piety, seeing no good
can be done, but he will know it, though it be done
neuer so secretly: It should make euen <hi>holy
thoughts precious,</hi> and deare to <hi>vs,</hi> and it should
make vs abho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> seeing it is so vaine, and
God seeth so euidently through vs, at all times, and
in all actions. <hi>Ps: 139. 17. 1 Thess:</hi> 5. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:21069:28"/>
4. It should quicken vs to the meditation and
care of our assurance of our eternall saluation:
God hath delighted himselfe to foresee it from
eternitie, and shall not we fore-know, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate
of our owne glory?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Paul</hi> vseth this as a reason, why we should
helpe and incourage Christians, and doe all the
good we can for them. For their <hi>names are in the
booke of life.</hi> Phil. 4. 3. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6. When we are to choose men for any Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
we should learne of God to <hi>know before,</hi> and
those we see to be wicked, we should neuer <hi>Elect:</hi>
custome, riches, friends, intreaty, kinred, &amp;c, should
neuer preuaile with vs.</p>
            <p>7. It shewes vs, how we should loue one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
wee should imitate God, no time should
weare out our affection, God is not <hi>sadded</hi> with
loue, though he set his affections vpon vs before
the beginning of the world was.</p>
            <p>4. This doctrine of Gods eternall knowledge is
terrible for wicked men, and that in foure respects:</p>
            <p>1. Against the conceit of their owne parts,
and praises, <hi>Iob</hi> 11. 11. If God should set in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
before thee, what he knowes by thee, thou
wouldst appeare more vgly then any Leper.</p>
            <p>2. Against their perswasion of secrecy in
their sinnes, as these places tell them: <hi>Psal: 90. 8.
&amp; 139. 1. 11. to 16. Ier:</hi> 17. 9, 10, 11: yea this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
tells them, that God hath had time enough
to know them, hee hath ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d them from
eternitie.</p>
            <p>3. Against their perswasion of impunitie, they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21069:28"/>
thinke, they shall escape punishment for their sins,
but they are deceiued, as is at large shewed, <hi>Psal:
94. 1. to 11. &amp; 139. 8, 9. Reuel.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
            <p>4. Lastly, woe to the man, whom the Lord
doth not acknowledge by his word, spirit, and
children in this world: This imports, that he shall
not be knowne in the day of Christ: oh how woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
will that sentence be, when he shall say, <hi>away
from me yee workers of iniquitie, I know you not:</hi>
Matth: 7. 27.</p>

            <p>Of God.]</p>
            <p>To be elect and knowne before others is a great
benefit: but to be chosen of that dreadfull and
immortall being, and that when nothing was, must
needs adde to this prerogatiue. If God choose
them, it matters not, who refuse them: If God
know them, it matters not, who is ignorant of

            <p>What God hath done in time, is done, that wee

might know, and praise him: but what hee did

commeth neerer to Gods nature; so it goeth far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from our apprehension; at least, till we be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in heauen.</p>
            <p>But this is a sea, ouer which no ship hath failed:
a mine, into which no spade hath delued: an <hi>Abis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
into which no bucket hath sunke, our sight is

in himselfe, to consider, what he is to vs.</p>
            <p>The Father.</p>
            <p>God is Father to Christ, to Angells, to Men: To
Christ he is Father by nature, as he is God, and by
personall vnion as he is man: To Angells hee is
father by creation, and to faithfull men by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
As hee is father to Christ, I consider of it

            <p>God hath an euerlasting fatherly care and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
ouer the faithfull and elect,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and this may

them and euer will vse them like a Father, both for
the affections of a father, and for the prouisions of
a father: he both loues them, and prouides for
them, as a father for his children. Gods affection
to the godly is a fatherly affection: for it is 1. free,
and 2. reader, and 3. constant. 1. A fatherly

with an <hi>euerlasting loue,</hi> Esay 49. 14. and is called
an <hi>euerlasting father,</hi> Esay 9. 6. Adde vnto these,
that a father will loue his childe, though no body
else doe: so can God loue vs, though he <hi>loue alone.</hi>

7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>As is the affection of God, so is his prouision

to three things.</p>
            <p>1 That they liue <hi>without sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How we may liue like Gods children.</note> and not shame
their father by their wicked liues: their workes
should shew, and beare witnesse by their care to

about them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 36. Their righteousnes must
exceede the righteousnesse of ciuill men in this
world: <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 20. and therefore their daily
prayers vnto God should be, that he <hi>would establish
them in holinesse before him, till the comming of Iesus
Christ, 1 Thess.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly that they liue <hi>without care,</hi> hauing
such a heauenly father to prouide for them, <hi>Math.</hi>
6. 25. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly that they liue out of the societie
with wicked men cleauing onely to the houshold
of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. they should loue their fathers
house, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4. and deny vtterly the loue of this
world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 15. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:21069:31"/>
2. Carnall men should hence take notice, if it
may be, to be better aduised, and not meddle with
the godly, no not to despise the least of these little
ones: <hi>Their Angells alwaies behold the face of God for
them,</hi> and their heauenly father will requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wrongs, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 10. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3 Earthly parents should heare learne of God:
God cares for his children before they were, and
shall not they care for their children, when God
hath giuen them to them: Gods greatest care is to
prouide holines for his children, and should not
they learne of God therein?</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> this may serue for reproofe both of some
of the godly, and also of the wicked, that liue in
the Church of God: some of the godly do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forget themselues about this point, that is such,
as stirre not vp themselues to take hold of God,
and to call vpon his name in their distresses, but
sit downe dismaide and dead hearted, as if there
were not the compassion, care, or helpe of a father
in God: this is reprooued, <hi>Esay</hi> 64. 8. Those sons
of <hi>Belial</hi> also, that liue in the Church, and call God
father, but liue like the Deuill, who indeed is their
father, whose workes they do: those I say are most

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:21069:32"/>
Some take <hi>sanctification</hi> in a large sense for mans
righteousnesse in generall, and obedience and
sprinckling of the blood of Christ: as the two parts
or kindes of it: by obedience vnderstanding mans
righteousnesse, or holinesse in himselfe, and by
sprinckling of Christs bloud, that righteousnesse
of Christ, that righteousnes (I say) made ours by
imputation, both which are applied or wrought by
the spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Some others make sanctification the end, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,

that before mans sanctification there goes
two things in God: <hi>Election,</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge:</hi>
and two things in <hi>Christ, obedience</hi> and sufferings,

            <p>Others vnderstand sanctification of the heart, or
spirit of man, as a meanes intended in Gods <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
for the fitting of vs vnto obedience of life, and
the fruition of the benefits purchased by the bloud
of Iesus Christ, and thus, I take it, it is meant here.</p>

more largely for the whole inward man, the
whole soule with all the faculties of it, and so I
take it here.</p>
            <p>Diuers things may be noted here in the generall.</p>
            <p>1 First that without sanctification we can neuer
haue comfort of our Election; by our obedience
others may discouer our Election, and by inward
holinesse we may discerne it of our selues.</p>
            <p>2 That ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> sanctification hath some dependance

            <p>3 That an outward ciuill life will not serue the
turne, God requires especially the sanctification of
the heart of man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 17. when God looks
for the markes of his own people <hi>he trieth the heart
and reines, Ier. 11. 20. &amp; 4 14. Pro. 4. 23. &amp; 23. 16.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21069:33"/>
Gods waies are in the blessed mans heart, Psal.</hi> 84. 5.</p>
            <p>4 That there is flesh in the best of Gods Elect
in this life, their spirits onely are sanctified.</p>
            <p>Thus in generall, more particularly concerning
the sanctification of the spirit, I propound two
things distinctly to be considered of:
<list>
                  <item>1 What neede our spirits haue to be sanctified?</item>
                  <item>2 Wherein lieth the sanctification of the spirit
of man?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Our spirits haue great neede to be sanctified:<note place="margin">What need our spirits haue to be sanctified.</note>
1 By reason of the first sinne, they want originall
righteousnesse, and they are corrupt and infected
with a generall leprosie. 2 By reason of the steine
and vncleanenesse all our actuall sins haue added
to the former corruption. 3. By reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation
of vncleane spirits our spirits haue in

               </gap> 
               <hi>sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 The <hi>minde</hi> is couered with a vaile, wrapped in
an vgly mantle of darkenesse, distracted with error,
coupled with a thousand formes of euill thoughts.</p>
            <p>2 The <hi>memory</hi> performes no seruice to God:
it should be Gods Treasurer, and Register, but no
body is in the Office to keepe record.</p>
            <p>3 The <hi>Will</hi> is grieuously diseased, and with
sicknesse so distempered, that it will not bee ruled
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21069:33"/>
by any, not by God, not by men, not by reason,
not by religion, nor doth it agree with it selfe. For
man wills not alwaies the same thing.</p>
            <p>4 The <hi>affections</hi> out of the first poison of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
corruption, haue such monstrous births of euil,
that the spirit by them is set out of all order, they
are compared to beasts, <hi>Esay</hi> 11. To fighting soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. To Tyrants making cruell
lawes, and leading into bondage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>5 The wretched <hi>Conscience</hi> (then which there
was once no diuiner thing on earth) is now in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
case. For either it is sicke of a Lethargy,
and sleepes, or if it waken it is like a madde Dog,
or Lion, or a Iudge transported with rage: It is
ignorant without light: it is soiled or steined with
a thousand sinnes: It is impure, and exceeding
base, and without all properties of a diuine Iudge.
For it is blinde and will be corrupted, and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the Assise &amp;c. In steed of a throne of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is thrust into a hole, and horrible dungeon
of darkenesse, where the <hi>Sunne</hi> of righteousnesse
shineth not, and there for the most part, as if it were
still night, it lieth obscure and sleepeth.</p>
            <p>And thus of the neede we haue of sanctification

            <p>I answer:<note place="margin">Ans.</note> That besides what hath beene shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
many more particulars may be set out thus:
There are vile both impieties, and vnrighteousnes
in our spirits must be done away. For impieties:
There is ignorance, error, atheisticall thoughts,
pride, hypocrisie, inconstancie, hardnes of heart,
and diuision of heart, conceitednes, vanitie, self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hatred of goodnes, false feares, carnall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
forgetfulnes, doubts, vnsetlednes, vnbeliefes
of all sorts, and loue of the world.</p>
            <p>For vnrighteousnes: There are euill cares, and
couetousnes, lusts of all sorts, hatred, malice, desire
of reuenge, anger, fretting, worldly griefe, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
discontentment, vaine-glory, emulation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
affection, and euill concupiscence: as
good as men thinke their hearts and meanings are,

are.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The minde is adorned with three things,<note place="margin">Three things which adorne the minde in sanctification.</note> which
come new into it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The first is a heauenly <hi>light.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The second is <hi>humblenes of minde.</hi>

               <item>3. The third is <hi>puritie of imaginations.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. This light comes in by the illumination of
the spirit, setting in the minde a celestiall kinde of
knowledge, and this stands in two things: For
first this sanctification breakes open a way, and
sets at liberty the <hi>light of nature,</hi> which was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
and <hi>withheld in vnrighteousnesse,</hi> and then
there is besides infused a new <hi>light from aboue,</hi> and
this light hath in it:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A holy discerning</hi> of good and euill,<note place="margin">The light of the minde hath 5 things in it.</note> truth
and falshood, by which the minde in a measure
discerneth a generall course of auoiding <hi>the waies
of death,</hi> and the <hi>doctrine of hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>A holy inquiry,</hi> by which the minde aspireth
after God and truth, and <hi>tryeth things that differ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Wisdome from aboue,</hi> by which the minde is
caried not onely to a foresight, and <hi>forecast</hi> for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

persons, manner, end, occasions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. A sacred frame of piety, and <hi>patterne of

to the vnderstanding, that it is <hi>indelible,</hi>
no dangers, sinne, or death can euer vtterly abolish
it. This frame of truth is perfected by degrees.</p>
            <p>5. There is planted in the minde <hi>Gods watch,</hi>
by the light whereof all the waies of the heart, and
life are ouer-looked.</p>
            <p>2. The second grace planted in the minde,<note place="margin">Humblenes of minde hath 6 things in it.</note> is
<hi>humblenes of minde.</hi> 1 Pet: 5. 5. and this hath in it,</p>
            <p>1. A sense of the wants of the soule, and
life of man.</p>
            <p>2. A lowly kinde of forecast in all things to
glorifie God, and profit man, accounting it no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement
to serue and please with all readinesse.</p>
            <p>3. A thankfull acknowledgment of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God infinitely aboue desert, by which a
man holds himselfe <hi>not worthy of the least of Gods
mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. A freedome in matters of opinion, from
selfe-conceit, by which a man attaines to that, not
to <hi>be wise in himselfe,</hi> or to rely vpon his owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or iudgment. Thus a man is <hi>not high-minded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. An accounting of others of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<hi>better then our selues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. A pronenesse to humiliation for sinne,
and humilitie in cariage.</p>
            <p>3. The third thing brought into the minde is

            </p>
            <p>The first end of our sanctification is, that our
liues may be brought into obedience.</p>
            <p>This obedience must bee considered eyther in
the 1. whole, or in the 2. parts. 1. In the whole it is
profitable to obserue three things:<note place="margin">Of obedience in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>1 The cause of this obedience is 1. eyther with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vs, or 2. within vs: without vs it is both God,
and the word of God;<note place="margin">Of the causes of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> God the Father causeth it
by electing, &amp;c: the Sonne by redeeming: the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost by calling. The word of God is the sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler
or patterne of our obedience; for if euer wee
would bring our liues into order, wee must resolue
not to follow mens examples, wills, lusts, or our

owne reasons, inclinations, or coniectures; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to haue recourse to the Law of God: this must

            <p>2. The causes within vs are either 1. generall: the

               </gap>or the first, the coherence shewes, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
our hearts be sanctified, our liues can neuer be
framed to true holinesse and obedience; and for
faith, it is certaine before euer we can practise true
obedience to the Law, wee must haue the <hi>obedience
of Faith,</hi> that is, wee must bee perswaded of Gods
loue to vs, and receiue his promises in Christ, and
<hi>repenting</hi> of our sinnes, <hi>beleeue the Gospell:</hi> Rom. 1.
5. &amp; 10. 16. 2 Thes. 1. 8. <hi>The faith of the Truth</hi> is

they be workes of reformation, or of our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
calling, or particular carriage: 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 16.
For wee must beleeue Gods threatnings, power,

               </gap>ses, assistance and reward, or else our worke
will goe slowly forward.</p>
            <p>2 Now for the second: there are sixe things to
be obserued in the manner of our obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>1 The first is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>are. The Apostle saith, we <hi>must
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21069:38"/>
yeeld our selues as seruants to obey:</hi> Rom. 6. 16.
which notes, that we must doe the workes of God,
and shew our obedience to him, as the seruant doth
his worke, that is with great heed, forecast, &amp; care:
God doth not onely require wee should obey, but
obey as seruants obey.</p>
            <p>2 The second thing required in our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is <hi>Wisedome:</hi> It is not enough to doe good,
but wee must be <hi>wise to that which good,</hi> and <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
concerning euill:</hi> This the Apostle shewes, <hi>Rom.</hi>
16. 19.</p>
            <p>3. The third is <hi>Constancy,</hi> our <hi>obedience</hi> must
be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> 2. Cor. 10. 16. Wee must <hi>not be weary of
well-doing:</hi> 1. Thes. 3. 13.</p>
            <p>4 The fourth is <hi>abnegation:</hi> In obeying Gods
will, we must throughout the course of our liues be
contented to deny our selues, so as we would doe
Gods will <hi>with patience,</hi> though crosses follow,
<hi>Luke</hi> 8. A signe of the seed sowne in good ground,
it <hi>bringeth forth fruit with patience:</hi> and besides it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
that if we meane to reforme our liues aright,
wee must liue <hi>soberly,</hi> shewing our moderation in
diet, apparell, recreations, and the like: yea wee
must not thinke it much to be crossed in our reason,
desires, ease, profits, or preferments: but bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be that we may be, with a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<hi>Heb. 11. 8. Gen.</hi> 22. 18.</p>
            <p>5 Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> fifth is <hi>sincerity:</hi> and the sincerity of
our obedience appeares, both when we shew <hi>respect
to all Gods Commandements,</hi> as well as one, <hi>obeying
in all things:</hi> as also, when wee obey without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and carnall ends and respects: <hi>Genesis 26. 5.
Phil.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:21069:39"/>
6. The sixth thing is <hi>peace:</hi> wee must lay our
proiects so for holinesse, as we <hi>follow after peace,</hi> as
<hi>much as is possible,</hi> and <hi>that with all men,</hi> much more
with the Church and people of God, <hi>Rom. 12. 19.
Heb.</hi> 12. 14. so as our <hi>conuersation be without diuision
or offence:</hi> Rom. 16. 18. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> For the third point,<note place="margin">Motiue to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nence.</note> wee may remember that
it was long since noted by <hi>Samuell,</hi> that <hi>obedience is
better then sacrifice:</hi> 1 Sam. 15. This obedience is
the end of the writings of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
If we be not trained vp by the Scriptures to
good workes, wee doe nothing with generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the name of Christ: <hi>Rom. 1. 5. 2. Tim.</hi> 3.
15. &amp;c. If wee obey not, we <hi>are the seruants of sin,</hi>
and it will be our ruine, wee shall <hi>dye in our sinnes:</hi>
The Ministery had neuer beene broken open, but
that the <hi>Nations might be brought to obedience:</hi> Rom.
16. 26. If you obey not, you breake the hearts of
your teachers: it is not good words, and liberall
pensions will serue the turne, you must yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to our Ministery in your liues, or else you
doe nothing: <hi>Phil. 1. 15. 16. 2. Cor. 7. 15. Vengeance is
ready against all disobedience,</hi> euery whit as ready
in Gods hand, as in the Ministers mouth, 2. Corin.
10. 4. 5. In this text we may see God delights to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the obedience of his people from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and all the benefits purchased by Christs bloud,
shall be giuen to them that obey, he is <hi>author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
saluation to them that obey:</hi> Heb: 5. 9.</p>
            <p>Thus of obedience in generall:</p>
            <p>Externall obedience which is heere entreated of,
is distinguished by the Apostle: <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18. into
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21069:39"/>
two kindes.<note place="margin">Of obedience in words.</note> For eyther it is obedience in word, or
obedience in deed.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> Heere might some one say, what need
the obedience of the tongue, our tongues are free?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It seemes some men thinke so: Those hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall,

they cannot commit dishonesty and impiety by
their words: There is a <hi>world of wickednesse in the
tongue,</hi> Iam. 3. 6. There are many sinnes which are
most vile and hatefull, which haue their principall
seat in the tongue, or are practised in wordes, as
blasphemy, murmuring, desperation, lip-seruice,
swearing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with diuers sinnes of deceit, hypocrisie, heresie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And on the other side excellent graces, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
depend much vpon the seruice of the tongue:
Gods glory; our owne Callings, and other mens
good are much furthered by the tongue. By the
tongue men preach, pray, confesse their sins, giue
thanks, comfort, exhort, rebuke, sweare, vow, &amp;c:
and therefore great reason, wee should shew our

               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:21069:40"/>
Vnder the obedience of conuersation are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
duties of piety to God, of mercy to
the distressed, of iustice to all men, of temperance
to our selues. The catalogues of the sinnes wee
should auoide in our conuersation, or of duties we
should doe, I omit here, hauing some purpose, if
God will, to handle them more largely in Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
by themselues.</p>
            <p>And thus of obedience.</p>
            <p>And sprinkling of the blood of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the more particular, and full
opening of these words, these things may be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the generall.</p>
            <p>1. There was blood in Christ, he tooke the true
nature of his brethren, true flesh and blood, that he
might serue and satisfie God in the same nature,
that had offended.</p>
            <p>2. This blood was shed. If you aske, who
shed it? I answer: <hi>Iudas</hi> by selling it: the Priests
by advising it: the people by consenting to it: <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
by decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ing it: the soldiers by effecting it:
CHRIST himselfe by permitting it, and after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
it to God <hi>(Heb:</hi> 9. 14): our sinnes, that
chiefly caused it. If any aske for whom it was
shed. I answer briefely for the Church, <hi>Act:</hi> 20.
not for himselfe, nor for impenitent, and obstinate
sinners, that dye in their sinnes.</p>
            <p>3. It is not enough, that the blood of Christ be
shed to make vs happy, vnlesse it be applied also:
which the word <hi>sprinkling</hi> notes.</p>
            <p>4. This effusion of blood was solemnly prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured,
or foretold by the sacraments, and sacrifices
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21069:40"/>
of the Law. For this word <hi>sprinkled</hi> is a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,
borrowed from the legall sprinkling; which
shewes vs two things: 1. The great account that
God and good men make of it, in that it was so
solemnely and anciently typed out: 2. That the
ceremonies of that Law are now abolished, seeing
wee haue here the true sprinkling of the blood
fore-shadowed out.</p>
            <p>5. That our estate in Christ is better now,<note place="margin">Our estate in Christ better then our estate in Adam here in this life.</note> then
our estate in Adam was. For God here in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
counsell is brought in ouer-looking that first
estate in Adam, and setting vp his rest in this estate
purchased in the blood of his sonne. If any man
maruell at this, he shall be thus satisfied: Our estate
in Christ is better, then our estate was at the best in
Adam, euen in this life, and therefore much more
in the world to come: In this life, it is better one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in two respects. 1. That wee cannot fall from
this happines. 2. That Christs righteousnes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to vs is better, then that righteousnes was
inherent in Adam. Now for the world to come,
heauen is better then paradise.</p>
            <p>6. We can neuer discerne our comfort in the
blood of Christ, till we be sanctified in spirit, and
set vpon the reducing of our liues into the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Christ. <hi>Iustification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> are
inseparable. Thus much for the generall.</p>
            <p>In particular, concerning this <hi>sprinkling of the
blood of Christ,</hi> I consider two things: 1. What
benefits the Christian enioyes by the blood of
Christ, which is here noted, as the end of his sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
2. The mysterie of this sprinkling, or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21069:41"/>
applying of the blood of Christ, as it was shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out by the legall sprinklings.</p>
            <p>The benefits which flow from the effusion of
the blood of Christ are either generall,<note place="margin">The bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

what an honor is it to be descended of the blood
of Christ? How doth a Christian mans new birth
in this respect excell all the nobilitie of birth in the
world? <hi>Ioh:</hi> 1. 13. What reason haue we of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
for so happy a condition? what should wee
complaine of? what matters it, what we loose, or
want, if we neither loose nor want the blood of
Christ? How incomparable are these benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all the glory of this world, if we haue eyes to
see them, and hearts large enough to conceiue of
the glory of them? The Lord from eternitie
looking vpon the blood of his Sonne sets vp his
rest there, as hauing prouided a sufficient portion
for all that shall be sanctified by his spirit.</p>
            <p>2. For instruction: we should euery one of vs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21069:42"/>
be incited to all possible care of assurance, that
Christ died for vs, and get it ratified to our hearts
by all the testimonies we can. There be three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of a mans happinesse: 1. The water: 2. the
blood: 3. and the spirit, 1 <hi>Ioh:</hi> 5. 6. The water of
repentance: the blood of expiation in the passion
of Christ applied by faith; the spirit of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
testified by sauing graces, &amp; new diuine gifts.</p>
            <p>3. For terror to all wicked men: that sin against
the blood of Christ, by despising &amp; neglecting the
grace of the couenant, by swearing, by unworthy
receiuing the sacrament, &amp; by their obstinate vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
&amp; impenitencie. Shall the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> cry
for such vengance, &amp; shall not the blood of Christ
much more? What a blood-guiltines doe these
men draw vpon themselues, that sinne against the
blood of <hi>Christ?</hi> If <hi>Iudas</hi> burst his he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for betraying it, how can their case be better
for despising it?</p>
            <p>Thus of the benefits, which come by the blood
of Christ: Now it followeth, that I should open the
meaning of those ceremoniall legall sprinklings, &amp;
shew, how they did in their kinde fore-signifie the
mysterie of this sprinkling of the blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>There was a fourefold legall sprinkling. 1. The
first was of the blood of the red Cow, and of a
water made of the ashes of the red Cow, <hi>Nom:</hi> 19
2. The second was of the blood of the Paschall
Lamb, <hi>Exod:</hi> 12. The third was of the bullock
by the High Priest, clensing the Tabernacle, <hi>Leuit:</hi>
16. The fourth was of the blood of the burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
at the ratification of the couenant: &amp; that
these things may bee made more plaine, I would
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21069:42"/>
take liberty to explaine those types, as they lye in
the text, though the explication thereof will in
some things conteyne a little digression from this
Text. And first for the sprinkling mentioned
<hi>Nomb:</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>The Israelites by their wicked murmurings had
brought the plague of God vpon themselues:<note place="margin">An explication of the whole Ceremonie of the sprinkling of the blood of the red Heifer, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mb:</hi> 19.</note> In
their distresse they cry &amp; seeke reconciliation: The
Lord makes an ordinance, &amp; shewes a way, how he
may be pacified, where many things may be noted.</p>
            <p>1. That of necessitie the expiation must be made
in blood, which was a type of the blood of Christ:
God will neuer be friends with offenders, till they
bring him the blood of his sonne to make attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and this is of such absolute necessitie, that
in the second verse the direction is called, <hi>the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of the law commanded of the Lord.</hi> Note:
an ordinance, a law, and commanded: to shew the
peremptorinesse of the Lord in this point, we must
lay hold vpon the blood of Christ, or God will
neuer turne away his displeasure from vs.</p>
            <p>2. That this expiation belongs onely to <hi>the
house of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That they <hi>of the house of Israel,</hi> that is, the
members of the true Church neede to be called
vpon in this point, he must <hi>speake to the children of
Israel,</hi> vers: 2.</p>
            <p>4. That Christ, that should be the true sacrifice,
must be one taken out of the Congregation: one,
that liued amongst men on earth, and should bee
offred vp in the flower of his youth, and should
likewise take the very infirmities of our nature vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21069:43"/>
himselfe: This was shadowed by the <hi>Heifer
taken out of the heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Heifer</hi> was <hi>red,</hi> to shadow out the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
passion of Christ: The Church saies of Christ,
<hi>my loue is white, and ruddy: white,</hi> in respect of the
righteousnes of his life; and <hi>ruddy,</hi> in respect of
his passion vnto blood.</p>
            <p>6. The <hi>Heifer</hi> was <hi>without spot, and blemish,</hi> to
signifie, that Christ should be without sinne: Hee
was indeed in the <hi>similitude of sinful flesh,</hi> but <hi>had no
sinne in his flesh:</hi> It is somewhat, that the <hi>Heifer</hi>
must be such, as had <hi>in her-selfe no blemish:</hi> Note,
<hi>in her-selfe;</hi> for it is true, Christ had no fault <hi>in
himselfe,</hi> but his members were not without fault.
For no flesh in this life is without sinne, but the
flesh of Christ.</p>
            <p>7. The <hi>Heifer</hi> must be such, as vpon which <hi>neuer
came yoke,</hi> and that fitly and significantly required.
For such was Christ: for he neuer bare the yoke,
in that he neuer sinned; he came to deliuer those,
that were vnder the yoke, and seruants of sinne,
but <hi>knew no sinne himselfe.</hi> Besides, the yoke was
not put vpon his flesh, because he had power vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compelled
to lay downe his life, and to take it vp
againe. Some say, that a <hi>Heifer</hi> was to be offred
to expiate the idolatry in the Calfe, and it was to
be brought to <hi>Moses,</hi> because <hi>Aaron</hi> had sinned:
and must be without yoke, to note, that the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
had cast of the yoke of Gods law, but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sense is the right.</p>
            <p>8. This <hi>Heifer</hi> was to be brought to <hi>Moses;</hi> and
why that? not only to signifie, that Christ should
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21069:43"/>
bee condemned vnder pretence of the breach of
<hi>Moses</hi> law; nor onely because he should dye by
the appointment of the Magistrate; but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that Christ must be offred vp to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>the Law-giuer,</hi> who was the party offended.</p>
            <p>9. Who must bring this <hi>Heifer</hi> to <hi>Moses? Ans:
All the Congregation of Israel,</hi> they must all get
them a <hi>red Heifer,</hi> that is, a bloody Sauiour, or else
they can neuer be accepted: This is the best, yea
the only present they can bring to God to pacifie
his displeasure toward them.</p>
            <p>10. Vers. 3. It is said, <hi>He shall giue her to Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar
the Priest.</hi> Who deliuered vp Christ to bee
slaine? In the letter, the <hi>Iewes;</hi> in the mysterie, the
<hi>Elect.</hi> But why deliuered to the Priest? to note
(as in all other sacrifices) the priesthood of Christ
<hi>by his eternall spirit offering vp himselfe to God, Heb:</hi>
9. 14. perhaps to foretell, that the Priests should
kill Christ. But why to <hi>Eleazar,</hi> rather then to
<hi>Aaron?</hi> Some say, because <hi>Aaron</hi> had offended in
the Calfe: But others say, to note, that the passion
of Christ should not onely serue for that time, or
the time vnder the law; but for their successors,
and all successions to come; and to note, that this
was a doctrine to be deliuered downe by all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
one after another.</p>
            <p>11. It must be <hi>without the campe,</hi> to praefigure,

The flesh of Christ was slaine before the face of

vnderstand the Iewish synagogue, vpon which the
curse for the effusion of Christs blood came most
exquisitely, according to their owne desire, when
they said, <hi>His blood be vpon vs, and our children:</hi>

gathered, as the Apostle doth gather it, the great
excellencie of Christs Priesthood aboue all those
legall Priests. For they in their solemnest sacrifices
were impure themselues, and needed clensing: but
Christ was not so, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How could the Priests be made vnclean
by that, which did purifie the people? <hi>Answ.</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenesse
was two waies contracted. 1 First
by the foulenesse of the things touched, and so hee
that touched a dead corpse was vncleane. 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
by the vnworthinesse of the man touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and so it was here: He must professe himselfe
vnworthy to touch so sacred an expiation; we had
need to take time euen till the euening to humble
our soules, and bewaile our vnworthinesse of the
blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>18 Now after the death of the Heifer, it is said
Verse 9. that <hi>a man that is cleane, must gather vp the
ashes of the Heifer, and lay them vp without the
Campe in a cleane place.</hi> This <hi>man, that is cleane,</hi> is the
Gentile <hi>purified by faith</hi> (For this is after the death
of Christ) the gathering of the ashes is the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the merits of Christ, and laying hold of the
mysteries of his kingdome. The laying vp of the
ashes imports the Christians accounts of Christs
merits, as his chiefe treasure: The cleane place is
the cleane heart, for the merits of Christ belong
not to all Gentiles, but to such as haue a cleane
heart, and will <hi>keepe the mysterie of faith in a pure
conscience.</hi> Without the Campe notes the natiue
condition of the Gentiles, who were without the
law: strangers from the common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:21069:45"/>
and from the couenant of promise, without sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and out of the Synagogue of the Iewes.</p>
            <p>19 These ashes <hi>are kept for the congregation;</hi> to
note, that there shall neuer be want of merit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Christian, to any member of the congregation
of Christ: when he saith, it is to make a <hi>water of
separation,</hi> it notes, what our sinnes bring vpon vs
by nature, we are separate and cast out of Gods
sight, and neede the bloud of Christ to recouer vs
from our separation. This water was made of the
<hi>ashes of the Heifer, and running water,</hi> to note, that
after separation, to clense vs againe wee must bee
sprinkled with a water made of the ashes of Christs
merits, and the water of the grace of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God: This is the perpetuall <hi>way of purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for sinne,</hi> and in that it must be <hi>sprinkled vpon vs
with Hissop,</hi> it notes, that wee can haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
either of the merits of Christ, or the grace of
the spirit, without the hissop of true mortification.</p>
            <p>20 Hee that <hi>gathereth the ashes, must wash his
clothes and be vncleane, till the Euen:</hi> to note, that
euen the neerer a Christian comes to the merits of
Christ, the more he is affected with the sense of his

doth most wash his clothes, yea hee retaines the

            <p>The other part of the <hi>bloud sprinkled on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
notes the application of the merits of Christ to
the faithfull, and of his graces without diminishing

            <p>The Vse of all may be briefly both for instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Vse</note> and consolation. For instruction:</p>
            <p>1 To the people, who should be aboue all things
carefull to seeke the comfort of the application of
Gods fauour in Iesus Christ: oh we must aboue all
things by faith <hi>keepe this sprinkling of bloud,</hi> as is
said of them, <hi>Heb:</hi> 11 28.</p>
            <p>2 Ministers should hence take notice of the <hi>maine</hi>
end of preaching, which is to sprinkle bloud vpon
the hearts of the people, that they may both bee
setled in the knowledge, and assurance of their
right in Christ, and the couenant of grace, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
purged in their consciences from dead works:
we do little by preaching, if we beget not reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and assurance in the hearts of the people; <hi>he
preacheth</hi> not that sprinkles not.</p>
            <p>2 For Consolation.</p>
            <p>Be not fearefull, Christs bloud will protect thee,
as safely, as euer did the bloud of the paschal lambe

            <p>
               <hi>Be not doubtfull, of the efficacie of it: For</hi> if the
bloud of buls and goates &amp;c. could purifie in respect of
legall clensings? how much more shall the bloud of
Christ, who by the eternall spirit offered vp himselfe to
God, purge thy conscience from dead workes, and make
attonement <hi>for all thy sins,</hi> clensing thee from all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse,
<hi>Heb. 9. 13. 14. 15. 1 Ioh.</hi> 1. 7.</p>

Be not discontent, with thy condition, thou hast,
what was merited, and purchased with bloud, how
little soeuer it seeme in thy eyes.</p>
            <p>But especially be not vnthankfull for such a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

               </gap>dered two waies. 1 First, as
it is in God, and so it is his free loue and gracious
disposition to shew mercy in Christ. 2 Secondly,
as it is in man, and so it notes either the gifts of
their minde, or their condition, or estate in Christ,
and so the faithfull are said to be <hi>vnder grace,</hi> and
<hi>not vnder the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peace</hi> is both inward, and outward: Inward peace
consists in the contentation and rest of the soule,
and so it is both the rest of the conscience from
terrors, and the rest of the heart from passions and
perturbations. Outward peace is nothing else, but
prosperity, or an estate free from vnquietnesse and
molestation, and adorned with needfull blessings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grace and Peace</hi> are the two principall things to
be sought, and wished in this world, when Christ
comes to inrich the world, hee comes with grace
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21069:48"/>
and truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. he cannot be miserable, that hath
these two, nor happy, that wants them altogether.
Which may be a singular comfort to a Christian:
in grace and peace is his portion, and hee may <hi>go
boldly to the throne of God</hi> in the intercession of
Christ <hi>to begge</hi> either of these <hi>in his need</hi> Heb. 4. vl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.
God may deny him other things, but he will neuer
deny him <hi>grace and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore also Christians should <hi>ioy in the
grace of God, wherein they stand,</hi> Rom: 5. 3: and be
resolued in themselues, that the <hi>grace</hi> of God <hi>is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for them, 2. Cor.</hi> 12. 9. Especially they should
praise and esteeme and <hi>glorifie the grace of God:</hi> It is
all God askes for as it were at our hands, euen to
honour him, by praising his grace and free loue to
vs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>Woe vnto wicked men, that neglect the grace of
God, what shall it profit them to gaine the world
(which yet they doe not) and want grace and
peace: but especially why doe they not let Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
alone with their portion? why doe they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them in their peace, and despight them for
their grace? can they not follow their pleasures,
lusts, profits, honors, &amp;c. and let Christians liue
quietly by them, who desire but libertie to enioy
grace with peace?</p>
            <p>There is something also to be noted from the
order of placing: <hi>grace</hi> must bee had before <hi>peace,</hi>
there can bee <hi>no peace to the wicked,</hi> and he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
wicked, that hath not the grace of God.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> is multiplied. 1 First when the

            <p>HEtherto of the salutation: the substance or
the body of the Epistle followes: the doctrine
whereof is two waies to be considered,<note place="margin">The order of the body of the Epistle.</note> 1 as it is
propounded, 2 as it is repeated: Three things are
principally propounded, and the same also repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or gone ouer againe. For there is first matter of
consolation. 2 Matter of exhortation. 3 Matter
of dehortation. The consolation is from this third
verse to the thirteenth of this Chapter. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
is from vers. 13. of this Chapter, to vers.
eight of the 3. chap. The Dehortation is from v: 8.
of the 3. chap. to the end of that chapter.</p>
            <p>Then doth the Apostle a little changing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
go ouer the same three things againe. For hee
exhorts from vers. 1. of chap. 4. to the 12. vers. of
the same chap. and then he comforts from vers. 12.
to the end of the 4. chap. and the Dehortation hee
lodgeth vnder request to the Elders, and the people
chap. 5. 1. to 12.</p>
            <p>In this first part he intends to comfort, where I
consider, first, the Proposition of comfort, vers: 3.
4. 5. Secondly, and the confirmation of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
vers. 6. to the 13.</p>
            <p>In the Proposition I obserue, first, the manner of
propounding, and the arguments themselues, by
which he would comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:21069:50"/>
The manner of the Proposition is, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in forme of thankesgiuing in these words:
<hi>blessed be the God and father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
The arguments of consolation are 3. The first is
taken from our Regeneration vers. 3. the second
from our Glorification vers. 4. the third from our
Preseruation vnto glory vers: 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed bee the God &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Obseruation from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence.</note> Two things I obserue
from the coherence of these words: First, that a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Christian can be in no such distresse, but hee hath

though he be a <hi>stranger</hi> and vsed like a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

many memorable things, for which hee ought to

thinke of spirituall blessings, but his heart
should kindle in him with desire to praise God for
them.</p>

            <p>Two things are here affirmed, 1 that God is
the God of Christ. 2 That hee is the Father of
Christ: It is not against the vse of Scripture to say,
that God is the God of Christ, for <hi>(Ioh. 20. 1.)
Christ</hi> saith, I go <hi>to your God, and to my God,</hi> and
<hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 7. It is said to Christ, <hi>God euen thy God hath

               <note place="margin">How God is the God of Christ.</note> Now if any aske, how this can be; that God
is the God of Christ, I answere by distinguishing

and his father in respect of his diuine nature: <hi>such
an high Priest it became vs to haue, as was after the

so was Christ without father, as man, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21069:51"/>
as God: now in that he is here said to haue a
father,<note place="margin">How Christ is without Father or Mother.</note> it is to be vnderstood of his diuine nature,
in respect of which by an eternall generation the
person of the sonne was begotten of the Father:
dreadfull is this mysterie, and most difficult to bee
vnderstood, or conceiued, and the rather because
nothing carnall or earthly is here to be imagined.
For the sonne was not begotten, as sons amongst
men are: but after a more admirable and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
manner, neither know I how to expresse a
way of conceiuing of this generation better then
by <hi>way of negation,</hi> denying vnto it, whatsoeuer
hath imperfection.</p>
            <p>There is a threefold generation.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A threefold generation.</hi> Per se, de se, &amp; extra se.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first is <hi>corporeall,</hi> called in Schooles <hi>Logicall</hi>
and <hi>predicamentall,</hi> and this is of bodily things,
which by themselues, and out of themselues, and
without themselues do beget. The second is <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent</hi>
and <hi>metaphyficall,</hi> and this is of spirits, and
is mentall. For here the minde as an vncompoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

and in it selfe beget, and thus it begets contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

is <hi>supreame</hi> and <hi>singular,</hi> or <hi>diuine,</hi> and that is that
generation, by which the Father in himselfe, and
by himselfe, by nature, &amp; not by faculty or power,
begets the sonne, and this is that, which in this
place is to be conceiued of: so that we must ascend
higher, then the geniture of bodies, or soules, and
when we are come to the <hi>Ocean,</hi> that is beyond and
higher, then either of those, we must rest and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

things, so that in three things we imagine no likenesse

               </gap>e
in the Trinity, and earthly fathers begetting their
sonnes in the world.</p>
            <p>First here is no prioritie in time betweene the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the sonne,<note place="margin">Three things wherin Christs generation is not like ours.</note> as in some sense there is in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
generations. For Christ <hi>is of the Father,</hi>
but not <hi>after the father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, there is no inequalitie: the sonne is
not lesser, then the father. For Christ is <hi>coequall,</hi> as
well as <hi>coeternall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is no diuision: the sonne is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
from the father. For Christ is not only like
the father <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>The consideration of this doctrine, that Christ
is Gods soone,<note place="margin">Vses.</note> may serue for diuers vses. For as
it may confirme vs in the detestation of the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
wickednesse of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that would
neuer receiue the doctrine, that<note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 6. 41. 3. 19.</note> Christ was the
sonne of God: so it may diuersly both instruct, and
comfort: It may instruct vs three waies. For first,
here we may see, that it is a matter of necessity to
be beleeued, and accordingly we should labour to
enforme our selues aright in this doctrine, as being
a point should be illustrious in the Churches of the
Christians, and the rather because of that promise,
that whosoeuer <hi>shall confesse that lesus is the sonne
of God</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">1 Iob. 4. 15.</note>, <hi>God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
we may hence gather our owne dignitie.
For if this be an honour vnto Christ to haue God
to be his father, then what reason haue poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ians
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21069:52"/>
to reioyce, considering that whatsoever they
are in this world, yet they haue no worse then the
true God, the great <hi>Ieho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ab</hi> to be their father also?
Thirdly, from hence by inference wee may learne
our duty to God: For by this doctrine we heare,
that God is the father of Christ, now by other
Scriptures we may obserue, how Christ caried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
toward his father, and from him wee may
learne, how to order our behauiour also.</p>
            <p>Three things are memorable in Christ.<note place="margin">In three things wee should learne of Christ to cary our selues towards God as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 1. His
obedience. 2. His patience and humility. 3. And
his willingnesse to die: all inferred vpon this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that God was his father. For first,<note n="k" place="margin">Ioh: 5. 17. 19. 6. 38.</note> 
               <hi>If
the father worke, the sonne worketh also, yea whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the Father did, the Sonne did also.</hi> Yea Christ
did not desire to be beleeued, when he said, he was
God sonne, further, then hee proued it,<note n="l" place="margin">Ioh: 10. 36.</note> 
               <hi>by doing
the workes of his Father.</hi> And for his patience and
humilitie it was admirable. This sonne of God <hi>had

            <p>In all these wee, that are yonger brothers, should
learne, how to order our selues aright toward God.
If we call God Father, wee should doe the workes
of our father, and neuer desire to be longer reputed
the children of God, then by our workes we could
shew our generation to be of God by resembling
his holines. And for patience and humilitie, wee
are specially charged with it by Christ, euen to
learne of him to bee lowly and meeke, and it is a
great shame for vs to make so much adoe about
our crosses, when wee consider the patience of
Christ, or to thinke it much if wee be not heard in
our prayers at the first, or as wee would haue it in
the letter of our desires, when we obserue the cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
herein of God towards Christ <hi>the sonne of his
loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this doctrine doth instruct, so it doth
comfort, and that especially three waies: 1 For
first it may comfort vs against all the difficulties of
sanctification, and against all the power of Sathan.
For as this doctrine tells vs, that Christ is the sonne
of God, so other Scripture doth assure vs, that he
will mightily proue himselfe to <hi>be the sonne of God
by the spirit of sanctification,</hi> shewing his power in
throwing downe and <hi>dissoluing</hi>

               <hi>the workes of the

suites to God. For as by other Scriptures we know,
that Christ is our aduocate and hath taken vpon
him to present our praiers to God: so by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
we may gather the successe. We are sure to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21069:53"/>
speede well, when we haue the Kings sonne to put
vp our petitions, and the rather because Christ doth
desire to shew his greatnesse with his Father by
obtaining our requests at his hands. For <hi>thereby
the Father is glorified in his sonne,</hi> and God loues vs
so much the better, because we loue Christ, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that he came from his father,</hi> and shew it by

of the hope of preferment by his seruice: wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serue a more honourable Lord. Many times if
we serue earthly Princes, they may neglect vs. For
wee seldome see all the Followers of the greatest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Princes come to preferment: but if Princes on
earth were neuer so honourable, that they did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to exalt euery one of their seruants, yet vnder
that hope men may consume all their meanes, and
in the end dye beggers, because the Prince may
dye, before they get their preferment; but it is not
so with Christians in their seruice of Christ. For
as <hi>for greatnesse</hi> he is the <hi>king of all Kings,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<hi>Lord of all Lords:</hi>
