         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
VINDICATION
OF THE
Thirty Queries,
(Together with the Author)
Againſt the
Mock-Apology for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> John Goodwin.</head>
            <p>THe Gentleman the Apologiſt, being (as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand)
a Graceling of the Greatneſs of this
World, can have (in my underſtanding) no
other reaſonable ground for his taking ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
behind the Curtain, but only ſome conſcienciouſneſs
that his Pamphlet is beneath him, and that it would rather
take from, then add to, him, if his Name were known.
He ſeems to be of that race of men, whoſe Conſcience
will allow them to do evil, but their prudence will not
allow them to bear the ſhame belonging to it, if they
know how to help it.</p>
            <p>It is obvious to every eye that looks into the ſaid
<hi>Mock-Apology,</hi> that the main projecture of it, was only
the propounding of this <hi>main Query and Wonder</hi> (as the
worthy Author terms it, pag. 1.) <hi>How the ſame hand could
ſubſcribe the Miniſters Propoſals for advancement of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114806:3"/>
on to the Supreme Magiſtrate, and yet propoſe this Queſtion;
Whether the Magiſtrate ſtands bound by way of Duty to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his Power or Authority in matters of Religion, &amp;c.</hi> He
ſeems to promiſe unto himſelf the preſent downfall of the
credit and eſteem of the Queriſt; and conſequently, of
his Queries alſo, upon the ſound of his Rams horn, the
bare propoſal of this Query.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the hand he ſpeaks of had ſubſcribed the
ſaid Propoſals upon the terms inſinuated in this <hi>main
Query and Wonder,</hi> (which yet will be found to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
inſinuation,) is it ſuch a ſtrange <hi>Query</hi> or <hi>Wonder,</hi>
how <hi>Peter</hi> that had denyed his Lord and Maſter before a
Damoſel, could yet confeſs him with ſo much courage,
as he did, before a Council afterwards? Or is it ſuch a
Wonder, how he that doth weakly once, ſhould at any
time after do more wiſely? Nay (queſtionleſs) of the
two it is the greater <hi>Wonder,</hi> that He, who hath ſtumbled
and fallen to the Earth, ſhould not riſe and get up, then
that he ſhould not always lie upon the ground.</p>
            <p>But may not the Apologiſt bear the ſhame of being a
falſe Witneſs againſt the Queriſt, upon the like account,
on which they that witneſſed againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he had
ſaid, <hi>I am able to deſtroy the Temple of God, and to build it in
three days,</hi> are ſtigmatized by the Holy Ghoſt, for <hi>falſe
Witneſſes</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 26. 61.</note>? For doth he not repreſent the Subſcription
of the Queriſt to <hi>the Miniſters Propoſals,</hi> as if he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
the reaſonableneſs of the ſaid Propoſals, or the
meetneſs of them to be put in execution; when as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
declared, together with a Friend of his, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
at the ſame time with him, unto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Nye</hi> (who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately
ſollicited our ſaid Subſcriptions) that he was
not ſatisfied with the Contents of the ſaid Propoſals, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could be own or ſubſcribe them, as meer to be put in
practiſe. Hereupon the ſaid M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Nye,</hi> affectionately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
his motion to us for our ſubſcriptions, expreſſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114806:3"/>
himſelf to this effect, That though we were not ſatisfied
touching the lawfulneſs or meetneſs of things contained
in the ſaid Propoſals, to be practiſed, yet we might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſubſcribe them, as meet to be delivered unto, and to
be taken into conſideration, by the Committee. We at
preſent apprehending no ſnare, danger, or inconvenience
in it, to ſubſcribe them in ſuch a notion, and with ſuch a
declaration of our ſelves, as this, and being deſirous to go
as far with our Brethren of the Miniſtry, as ever our
Judgments and Conſciences would permit us, yielded
accordingly, and ſubſcribed. But to mention this by way
of <hi>Apology for Mr J. Goodwin,</hi> had been to prevaricate
with the deſign: and beſides, to act at any ſuch rate of
fairneſs, is a ſtrain of ingenuity higher (I fear) then the
heart of a Propoſaliſt is willing to be wound up unto. It
is no marvel that he hates the light, this (as our Saviour
obſerveth) being the property of him that doth evil. In
the mean time, I find how hard a thing it is, ſo much only
as to <hi>touch pitch,</hi> and <hi>not be defiled.</hi> I ſhall (I truſt) from
henceforth remember, that that generation of men, with
whom I had to do in this buſineſs,
<q>
                  <l>Foenum habet in cornu: longè fugiam.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>A lock of hey tied to their horn they have:</l>
                  <l>Far from them I ſhall flee my ſelf to ſave.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuſpecting (it ſeems) that the <hi>Wonder</hi> he ſpeaks of,
will not procure ſufficient credit to his cauſe againſt the
Queriſt, and his Queries together, having (as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth)
by his lenſey-woolſey ſtory done well towards
the laying the honor of the one in the duſt, he attempteth
the diſparagement of the other alſo. <hi>Amongst the Thirty
Queries</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>propounded by him, there is not one to be
found, but is either, 1. Impertinent, or, 2. Impotent.</hi> Pag. 7.
he ſmiteth me with his Cenſorian rod for an imaginary
defect in a <hi>contradiſtinction</hi> I make between <hi>evil doers
againſt the light of Nature,</hi> and, <hi>worſhippers of God in a falſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114806:4"/>
manner;</hi> but himſelf in ſaying, that all my Queries, are
<hi>either impertinent, or impotent,</hi> contradiſtinguiſheth twice
two againſt four. For that which is <hi>impertinent,</hi> muſt
needs be <hi>impotent,</hi> unleſs he will ſay, that that which no
ways concerns a cauſe, may yet have ſtrength enough in
it to overthrow it. And again, that which is <hi>impotent,</hi>
muſt needs be <hi>impertinent,</hi> or to little purpoſe, unleſs he
will ſay that that which hath nothing in it to countenance
or ſupport a cauſe, is yet <hi>pertinent</hi> to it. Yea impotency,
and impertinency, are identical, after the manner of
things which are mutually exegetical the one of the
other.</p>
            <p>But what may the Gentleman mean by his, <hi>Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
Impertinent</hi> imports Relation, or rather a want of
<hi>relation</hi> in point of uſefulneſs, and this either to ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
and particular term, or elſe to a general. He ſeems
by charging the Queries with <hi>impertinency,</hi> only to imply
that they are irrelative to ſuch a ſpecial or particular
term, unto which he was afraid they might have proved
more <hi>pertinent,</hi> then he could have wiſhed. And for all
his rejoycing in face over their <hi>impertinency,</hi> in reference
to ſuch an end and purpoſe, as he ſpecifieth, yet I beleeve
his heart partaketh not with his face in this joy. For when
he ſaith (pag. 2.) that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Goodwin not only may, but indeed
muſt be ſo underſtood (viz.</hi> as not to query, at leaſt in the
<hi>major part of his Queries,</hi> the exerciſe of the Magiſtrates
<hi>power</hi> in <hi>matters of Religion, ſave only that which is coercive,
and like a Spaniſh Inquiſition, or Engliſh High-Commiſsion-Court,
&amp;c.</hi>) he tacitly grants (I will not add, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
troubled) that in ſundry of my Queries I am
<hi>guilty of ſuggeſting pertinent ſcruples</hi> even againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſure
of ſuch a Power by the Magiſtrate in matters
of Religion, which falls much ſhort of that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
by <hi>mulcts, fines, impriſonments, &amp;c. to a conformity
unto the publique Profeſsion and Practiſe.</hi> Yea they who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114806:4"/>
ſhall pleaſe to peruſe the Firſt, the Seventh, the Tenth, the
the Eighteenth, with moſt of the Queries following, will
find me <hi>guilty of ſuggeſting ſcruples of</hi> that <hi>pertinency</hi> even
againſt the interpoſure of ſuch a Power by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
which the Apologiſt claims for him, that he fairly
paſſeth by them, leaves them as he finds them; and in
ſtead of healing or removing them, only dawbs with a
little untempered mortar, telling the Magiſtrate (pag. 4.)
that <hi>things of a Religious nature, are either abſolutely ſuch,
or mixily;</hi> and telling him again (without any limitation
or caution) that He may <hi>intermeddle,</hi> though <hi>not in the
former, yet in the latter.</hi> And how doth he prove this?
Only by putting it upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Goodwin to reſolve, whether a
Chriſtian Magiſtrate were obliged to ſuffer a Heathen under
his Juriſdiction to ſacrifice his Child to Moloch, &amp;c.</hi> A wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Demonſtration!</p>

            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s ſence about the caſe propounded, is,
That a Magiſtrate, whether <hi>Christian,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
not to ſuffer the perpetration of Murther, whether
by an <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> under his Juriſdiction; nor
to ſuffer either the one, or the other, to ſacrifice their

He that from this Reſolution of the caſe is able to gather
a Ground or Argument to prove, That a Magiſtrate
may uſe what power he pleaſeth, or umpire as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>in matters of Religion,</hi> ſo they be not <hi>purely, but
mixtly ſch, as the publique circumſtance of Time, Place,
Revenue, ſome opinions, &amp;c.</hi> may as well (for ought I
underſtand) bring up the Element of fire from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the Sea. For what face of a conſequence is there
in this <hi>Enthymeme:</hi> A Magiſtrate may interpoſe his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
againſt the commiting of Murther in his Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114806:5"/>
Therefore he may interpoſe his power alſo to puniſh
men in his Juriſdiction for what Opinions he thinks
meet, to conſtrain men to allow to what Miniſters he
pleaſeth what proportion of their eſtates he pleaſeth, to
compell them to repair to ſuch places for the publique
worſhip of God, as he pleaſeth, &amp;c. <hi>P.</hi> 4. 5. he be-jear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(after his manner) the poor <hi>Querist,</hi> as propoſing
(in his laſt Querie) this conſiderable queſtion, <hi>Whether
the Civil Magiſtrate be not a kind of Bat, that is confin'd to
the twilight of nature.</hi> I confeſs ſuch a <hi>queſtion</hi> as this
(though the <hi>Querist</hi> owneth it not for his, but muſt
charge it upon the Apologiſt to anſwer for the calumnie)
might be more reaſonable (of the two) propoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſuch <hi>Propoſalists,</hi> who reaſon at the rate lately
ſpecified, and decline the light, then concerning the civil
Magiſtrate. Only they ſeem to be confined to a light ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

ſuch a <hi>light,</hi> which our Saviour term's, <hi>darkneſs</hi>

to the buſineſs he had in hand, hopes to afford it
better promotion by a mixt diſcourſe of an unchriſtian

falſhood, and flearing, pag. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But leſt the Reader be miſtaken, he muſt remember, that
the Book of Nature, according to Mr</hi> Goodwin's <hi>Edition,
comes forth in a juſt volume: the light of Nature, in his
Aſtronomy, is a Star of the firſt magnitude. And therefore
whileſt he allows the Magiſtrate a Power to puniſh Offenders
againſt the Light and Law of Nature, he outvies the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals,
if he be true to his own principles.</hi> If he that writes
theſe things, be, in ſo doing, <hi>true to his own principles,</hi>
moſt certain it is that he is <hi>Principled</hi> by the <hi>Prince that
ruleth in the ayr,</hi> and not either by <hi>the Light,</hi> or God, <hi>of
Nature.</hi> For what ground he ſhould have, excepting
(haply) his Devotion to the Goddeſs <hi>Mendacina,</hi> to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch things as theſe, is not eaſily imaginable. For
what <hi>edition</hi> of the <hi>Book of Nature</hi> hath M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Goodwin</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
that <hi>comes forth in a juſt volume?</hi> Or what hath
he ever ſaid, or written, that adminiſtreth ſo much as
any tolerable occaſion, colour, or pretence, for ſuch a
ſaying? I no where aſcribe to the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> ſo
much as the leaſt ability of diſcovering or diſcerning
any truth, but only in conjunction with the Grace or
good Spirit of God. It may be I do not always men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this Conjunction, when I ſpeak of the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but I frequently, and upon ſundry occaſions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
my ſence and meaning in this behalf. If the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt
himſelf, ſaying, that <hi>the Light of Nature may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114806:6"/>
the Truth of his few</hi> (i. e. ſix) <hi>Corollaries, or at leaſt
being diſcovered, muſt aſſent unto it,</hi> meaneth by <hi>the Light
of Nature,</hi> any principle, faculty, or ability veſted in
<hi>Nature,</hi> capable of ſuch actings, as here he aſcribeth unto
it, without the gracious and merciful aſſiſtance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the Spirit of God with it, he ſets <hi>forth</hi> the
<hi>Book of Nature</hi> in a far larger and fairer <hi>Edition,</hi> then ever
it was, or is like to be, ſet forth by me.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, that <hi>whileſt I allow the Magiſtrate
a Power to puniſh Offenders againſt the Light and Law of
Nature, I outvy the Propoſals, &amp;c.</hi> if by, <hi>Offenders,</hi> he
means, all <hi>Offenders,</hi> his ſuggeſtion is moſt untrue: I no
where <hi>allow</hi> him <hi>a Power to puniſh</hi> ALL <hi>Offenders against
the Light of Nature,</hi> but <hi>Offenders</hi> only <hi>againſt the</hi> CLEAR
<hi>Light of Nature,</hi> (ſee Query 2. and 30.) If by <hi>Offenders,</hi>
he means, ſome <hi>Offenders</hi> only, I cannot <hi>outvy the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals</hi>
in ſuch an <hi>allowance,</hi> unleſs it be ſuppoſed, that theſe
<hi>allow</hi> no <hi>Power to the Magistrate</hi> to puniſh any Offender
whatſoever againſt the Law of Nature; which far be
it from my good Friend, my Apologiſt, either to ſay, or
think.</p>
            <p>I made a while ſome Treaſure of thoſe words of his
(pag. 2.) <hi>With ſuch a Power</hi> (i. e. <hi>a Coercive Power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, and Worſhip, a Power which would compel unto
the publique Profeſsion and Practiſe) the Miniſters hold as
little correſpondency, as Mr Goodwins Queries.</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
this my ſuppoſed Treaſure proves Coals.
For if the Magiſtrate be <hi>allowed</hi> a <hi>Coercive Power</hi> for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a <hi>revenue</hi> and maintenance for what, and how many,
Miniſters he pleaſeth, and withall, what proportion of
revenue and maintenance he pleaſeth (which is the
golden Apple for which my Apologiſt chiefly runneth,
and unto which all the reſt of his pleadings for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
are Debtors) this, being rightly conſtrued, makes
the perfect ſence of a <hi>Coercive Power,</hi> even <hi>in matters of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114806:6"/>
Faith and Wirſhip,</hi> and which <hi>compelleth unto the publique
Practiſe, &amp;c.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>1. Is it not a branch of the Faith of many in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and theſe not of the worſt, nor worſt-conſcienced
men, that they ſhall ſin againſt God in paying Tythes,
yea in allowing any maintenance at all to ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
whom they judg <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> in their Office, and
Call?</p>
            <p>2. What doth it eaſe or advantage me, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
ſhould force me to allow, or part with, ſuch or
ſuch a proportion of my Eſtate, for the maintenance of
ſuch or ſuch a Miniſter, more then it would, in caſe he
ſhould compel me to pay a fine of like value for holding
ſuch or ſuch an Opinion, or for joyning in ſuch or ſuch a
way of worſhipping God? I am equally damnified in
my Eſtate in the one way and the other: nor is it any
ways material unto me, upon which account I part with
my ſubſtance. Or if there be any difference in the caſe,
certainly it would be more paſſable with me, to ſuffer
for an Opinion, or Practiſe, which I conſcientiouſly
love and profeſs, then for the ſake of ſuch a perſon, be
he Miniſter, or other, to whom I am a ſtranger, and no
ways obliged, yea who (haply) is an offence and burthen
unto me. Therefore a <hi>Coercive Power</hi> in the Magiſtrate,
about <hi>publique Circumſtances, as of Time, Place, Revenue,
and ſome Opinions, &amp;c.</hi> differs only in face, not in heart,
from a <hi>Coercive Power in Faith and Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas he informs me (in his fifth Corollary, p.</hi> 6.)
<hi>that</hi> The wiſe and faithful Chriſtian Magiſtrate may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of ſome Truths in Chriſtian Religion, and their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Errors;</p>
            <p>1. I marvel how (the Principles of the Apologiſt
ſalved) the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> ſhould <hi>diſcover</hi> any ſuch
<hi>Truth</hi> as this, that there is ſuch a thing <hi>in rerum Naturâ.</hi>
as a CHRISTIAN Magiſtrate; or <hi>being diſcovered, ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114806:7"/>
aſſent unto it;</hi> which notwithſtanding he affirms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this, and all the reſt of his Corollaries. For if
the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> be in no capacity to <hi>diſcover</hi> that
there is a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor ſo much as to <hi>aſſent to</hi> any <hi>diſcovery</hi>
that is made of him (which is one main Article, it ſeems,
of the Apologiſt's Faith) how ſhould it <hi>diſcover,</hi> or
come to own or acknowledg, a <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate?</hi>
Can a man beleeve or think, that the Stars derive their
light from the Sun, and yet be in no capacity of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that there is a Son, or ſo much as knowing whether
there be a Sun, or no?</p>
            <p>2. What if <hi>the wiſe and faithful Chriſtian Magiſtrate
may be aſſured of ſome Truths in Christian Religion;</hi> can
any <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian</hi> State (ſo called) be <hi>aſſured,</hi>
that all their <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> are, or always will be, <hi>wiſe and
faithful?</hi> If not, then is it not ſafe, or reaſonable, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt
the Magiſtrate, as a Magiſtrate, or ſimply as bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the additional external denomination of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
with ſuch a Power, of the regular adminiſtration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
only ſuch <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> are capable, who are not only
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but <hi>wiſe and faithful</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>3. Suppoſe not only the <hi>wiſe and faithful Chriſtian
Magiſtrate,</hi> but every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtrate (ſo called)
without exception, may be <hi>aſſured of ſome Truths in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion,</hi> what follows? Doth it either (in the firſt
place) follow, that therefore he may raiſe, or force from
the people, what Maintenance or Revenue he pleaſeth
for the ſupporting, or inriching, what Miniſters he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth?
Or, 2. Doth it follow, that therefore he may
puniſh men with mulcts, fines, impriſonments, &amp;c. for
ſuch <hi>Opinions</hi> as he pleaſeth, or which he deemeth <hi>erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous?</hi>
yea or ſuch, concerning which he thinks himſelf
moſt <hi>aſſured</hi> that they are <hi>erroneous?</hi> Or was not <hi>Paul</hi>
before his Converſion to <hi>Chriſt aſſured of many Truths</hi>
in that Religion, which was delivered by God himſelf
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114806:7"/>
unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> (and conſequently, <hi>of their oppoſite Errors</hi>)
and yet <hi>thought verily</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<hi>Meſsiah,</hi> (which yet was a main Point to be known,
and beleeved, according unto the Principles of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,)
yea and that he <hi>ought to do many things againſt</hi>
him, and thoſe that beleeved on him, and practiſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly?
Or, 3. (and laſtly) Doth it from the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
premiſſes, follow, that therefore the <hi>Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi>
may appoint what perſons he pleaſeth to elect and
reprobate whom they ſhall pleaſe, either to, or from,
the work of the Miniſtry, and preaching of the Goſpel?
If all theſe conſequents, or deductions, be palpably irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
to the ſaid Premiſſes and <hi>Corallary,</hi> why doth the
Apologiſt preſent the Magiſtrate with ſuch aſhes as theſe
to feed upon?</p>
            <p>But how cometh it to paſs that we hear ſo little (or
rather nothing at all) all this while, for the Juſtification
of the Miniſters Propoſals touching that inveſtiture of
ſome <hi>Clergy-men</hi> with Authority and Power to put the
Miniſtry and Preaching of the Goſpel into what hands
they pleaſe; conſidering that this is one of thoſe Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities,
at which the Queries principally ſtrike? The
Maſter of the Feaſt (it ſeems) judged what he had to
bring forth upon this account, to be his beſt Wine, and
ſo kept it to the laſt. Therefore pag. 6. 7. &amp;c. we have
this cauſe mooted (though little promoted) thus:</p>
            <p>Beſides, who can deny it to be the priviledg and duty of a
Maſter of a family, to admit ſuch only to teach in his houſe
as his Conſcience ſhall be ſatisfied in, and warrant him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive?
Or to come yet a little nearer [<hi>even as Nye as you
will</hi>] will the Churches diſtinguiſhed by the Name of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
and Anabaptiſts (ſuppoſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s
Church) admit of any perſon, either wholly unknown, or
known to be either groſly ignorant, or ſcandalous (ſuppoſe a
known Mahumetan, or one of their own judgment, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114806:8"/>
without ſcandal, but wholly unknown) to teach in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
without their approbation, and aſſent firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?
If not (as it is preſumed they will not) let no man
ſcruple to allow that thing to be the right of the Magiſtrate as
a publique Parent, in the diſpoſal of publique places and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
to perſons to be approved by himſelf, or ſuch as he ſhall
think meet to be truſted therein, which is claimed as a right
by every private Parent and Congregation. <hi>Thus far our
Apologiſt: but quite out of his way. For this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is built upon ſundry looſe and groundleſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions;
As,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the reſpective Congregations of Men under
the Magiſtrates Juriſdiction, have no more right, are in
no more, no better capacity, to chuſe their own Teachers,
then children or ſervants in a family, are to chuſe theirs.
This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>2. That the reſpective Congregations within the
Magiſtrates Juriſdiction are no more bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to afford maintenance unto him that teacheth them
(I mean, faithfully, and with their own conſent) then
children or ſervants in a family are bound to maintain
him, who by the Maſter of the family is appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
or teach them. This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>3. That the ſaid reſpective Congregations may have
Miniſters or Teachers impoſed upon them by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
upon the ſame account of reaſon and equity, on
which they may chuſe them themſelves, or on which
Children may have Teachers provided for them by
their Parents. This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>4. That the Magiſtrates providing maintenance for
Miniſters of Flocks and Congregations, doth not make
voyd that Commandment of God, (in our Saviours
ſence to the like expreſſion and charge, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 6.) by
which theſe Congregations ſtand charged to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for them themſelves. This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:114806:8"/>
            <p>5. That there is any ſuch thing, or things, as thoſe
here termed <hi>publique places and revenues,</hi> wherein the
Magiſtrate hath the like Intereſt, or right of property,
with that, which every Maſter of a family, and ſo every
reſpective member of a Congregation, hath in that
eſtate, wherewith the Providence of God hath bleſſed
him, and the juſt Laws of the Land adjudg his. This is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For Tythes are not a <hi>publique Revenue,</hi> at
leaſt not in ſuch a ſence, which gives the Magiſtrate a
like, or the ſame, right in the diſpoſal of them, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
private man hath in the diſpoſal of his Eſtate. A pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man may remove his Eſtate from, and to what
place he pleaſeth, may beſtow it, or what part of it he
pleaſeth, upon perſons of what calling he pleaſeth, yea
or may keep it to himſelf: but I preſume it to be the
ſence of the Apologiſt himſelf, that a Magiſtrate hath no
ſuch right to diſpoſe of the <hi>publike Revenue</hi> (as he termeth
it,) as, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> the Tythes growing in one Pariſh,
to the Miniſter or Teacher of another, much leſs to
a private man who is no Teacher at all, leaſt of all, to
himſelf.</p>
            <p>6. (And laſtly) That the <hi>publique Revenue</hi> of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
(by which I ſuppoſe the Apologiſt, either only, or
chiefly, meaneth, Tythes) is ſuch a Maintenance or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
which by the Law of God may be forced or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from the people by the Magiſtrate, and that upon
ſuch terms, that when he hath ſo extorted it, he hath as
abſolute a right in the diſpoſal of it, as the perſons from
whom he extorteth it, have in the diſpoſal of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of their Eſtates. This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. No Law of God
can be produced, by which the lawfulneſs of theſe things
can be evinced, or maintained. So that our Apologiſt in
all this quarter of his diſcourſe <hi>extrà oleas vagatur,</hi> and
begs his bread in deſolate places.</p>
            <p>Whereas he adds (pag. 7.) that in my <hi>laſt Query I have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114806:9"/>
appealed to the Law of Nature, as to my Caeſar;</hi> let him but
read this Query the ſecond time, and then I ſhall <hi>appeal</hi> to
his Conſcience, whether there be any truth in ſuch a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or no. And when he deſires that this <hi>may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered,
that ſo far Power is granted by me to the Magiſtrate in
Religion, as the Law of Nature doth dictate,</hi> he deſires a
<hi>remembrance</hi> of that which (I beleeve) was never known;
at leaſt if his meaning in the clauſe be (for the words are
ambiguous, and hardly intelligible) that I grant a power
to the Magiſtrate in all ſuch matters of Religion, which
by the light or Law of Nature may be proved to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
or unſeemly to be done. I have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned
any ſuch grant as this; and elſwhere given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
at large of my ſence in this behalf. The brief
hereof is this: By the light or Law of Nature, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
penuriouſneſs in giving upon occaſion, timidity or
fearfulneſs, diffidence or diſtruſtfulneſs in the Divine
Providence; and generally, whatſoever comes ſhort of
that worth and excellencie, which by the light of Nature
may be diſcerned ſuch (I mean matter of worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie)
in men, may be the ſame light be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be unlawful, or uncomely. Yet it is far from me
to think, that therefore the Magiſtrate hath power to
puniſh men for ſuch infirmities or defects as theſe. Laws,
eſpecially ſuch as are punitive, are not wont to be enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt perſons who do not attain that pitch of worth
and excellencie, which is deſireable in all men, and
which if accordingly found in all, would highly conduce
to the honour and proſperietie of a Common-wealth;
but againſt ſuch perſons onely, who either do ſuch things
which are notoriouſly deſtructive to the peace and well
being thereof, and from which the generality of men,
do, and eaſily may, abſtain; or elſe who refuſe or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the doing of ſuch things, which in certain caſes are
neceſſary to be done, and may eaſily, and without much
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114806:9"/>
prejudice or danger, be done, for the preſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>Preſently after the Gentleman finds himſelf aggrieved
at the <hi>Contradiſtinction</hi> (as he called it) in my laſt Query,
<hi>as</hi> being <hi>unſound,</hi> becauſe here <hi>I diſtinguiſh the worſhipping
of God in a falſe manner, from evil doing againſt the Light
of Nature.</hi> I ſuppoſe his offence taken here (though he
repreſents my <hi>contradiſtinction</hi> but by halfs, and to the
obſcuring of my meaning in theſe words, <hi>the worſhipping
of God in a falſe manner</hi>) is not with the good leave of his
own principles otherwiſe. Theſe (I preſume) form his
Judgment on this wiſe; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Light of Nature
is not ſufficient to diſcover the <hi>worſhipping of God in a
falſe manner,</hi> at leaſt, not every worſhipping of him in
ſuch a manner. For then, wherein ſhould the light of the
Scriptures themſelves, exceed the light of Nature, in that
important affair of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion? Therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there is a real Diſtinction, and this broad enough,
between <hi>worſhipping God in a falſe manner,</hi> and, <hi>doing evil
againſt the light of Nature.</hi> And if he would have pleaſed
only to peruſe thoſe few Pages in another Treatiſe of
mine, which (for brevity ſake) I refer unto, in the end
of this Query, he might (I ſuppoſe) have been better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
touching the Apoſtles meaning (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4.) by,
<hi>him that doth evil;</hi> and that by this expreſſion, he could
not mean, or intend, any ſuch <hi>Spiritual Delinquent</hi> as I
deſcribe by ſome particular inſtances in the ſaid Query.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He yet addeth: that</hi> the Law of Nature teacheth the
Magistrate to make Laws againſt falſe Worſhip, and Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry.</p>
            <p>I beleeve my Apologiſt ſpeaketh this without Book.
For what Laws <hi>againſt falſe Worſhip and Idolatry,</hi> can he
produce, or inſtance, the <hi>making</hi> whereof was <hi>taught by
the Law of Nature?</hi> All <hi>Laws</hi> of this kind made by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
States and Magiſtrates, he hath no reaſon to judg
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114806:10"/>
were <hi>taught by the light of Nature,</hi> but rather by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
(whether rightly, or amiſs, as to this point, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
I now diſpute not.) If there were any ſuch <hi>Laws</hi>
made by <hi>Pagan</hi> States or Magiſtrates (I mean, <hi>Laws made
againſt</hi> ſome particular kinds of <hi>falſe Worſhip and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>)
the ſpirit and intent of theſe Laws was rather for
the countenance and ſupport of one <hi>kind of Idolatry or
falſe Worſhip (viz.</hi> that which was more generally prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,
and perhaps commanded, in this State) then for the
puniſhing, or ſuppreſſing, of thoſe prohibited, and made
puniſhable, by ſuch Laws; as <hi>Lerinenſis</hi> reports of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius</hi>
the Heretique, that to make way for the credit and
propagation of his own, he fiercely oppoſed all other
Hereſies<note n="a" place="margin">Hic ut utini haec eſt ſuae ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itum pateface<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Cunctarum haereſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of (made againſt particular Idolatries) were <hi>taught by the
Law of Nature</hi> (which yet is evident enough in the caſe in

            </p>
            <p>2. If the <hi>Law of Nature teacheth the Magiſtrate to make
Laws againſt falſe Worſhip and Idolatry,</hi> I would gladly
know of my <hi>Apologiſt</hi> whether it <hi>teacheth</hi> him to do it
againſt all, and all manner of falſe Worſhips, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
whatſoever; or whether againſt ſome particulars
only in this kind. If againſt all in general, then are the
<hi>teachings of the Law of Nature</hi> in this great Affair of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
Religion, as compleat and abſolute, as the teachings
of the Scriptures, yea and of the Spirit of God himſelf,
which (I know) is none of my Apologiſts thoughts. If
againſt ſome particulars only, let my <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> either by
the light of the Scriptures, or by any other light that
ſhineth clearly, particularize them, and ſeparate them
from their fellows, againſt which the ſaid <hi>Law of Nature
teacheth</hi> no <hi>making of Laws,</hi> and his reward ſhall be this:
<hi>Erit mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Great <hi>Apollo</hi> he ſhall be to me.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:114806:10"/>
            <p>If he ſhall not do this, and that <hi>ſecundum ſub &amp; ſuprà, i. e.</hi>
as well in all particulars, againſt which <hi>the Law of Nature
teacheth him to make Laws,</hi> as in all thoſe alſo, againſt
which <hi>this Law of Nature teacheth him</hi> no ſuch thing, but
rather prohibiteth him the doing of it, he doth but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
and enſnare the Magiſtrate, in telling him, that <hi>the
Law of Nature teacheth him to make Laws againſt falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Premiſſes of my <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> p. 7. warily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
are good: <hi>Ignorance of the true God is the greateſt
plague</hi> [I preſume his ſence is, <hi>cauſalis,</hi> not <hi>formalis] of all
Commonwealths:</hi> And again; <hi>He pulls down the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all humane Society</hi> [I ſuppoſe he ſpeaks of the beſt,
and moſt worthy <hi>foundation] who takes away Religion, or
aboliſheth it out of the minds of men.</hi> But the Concluſion
which he infers from hence is extreamly inconſequent:
<hi>Whence it is that all Impiety is to be puniſhed with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt grievous puniſhments.</hi> How doth the man
wring the noſe of his Premiſſes to force the blood of this
Concluſion from it? Certainly this grape, that <hi>all Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
[i. e.</hi> all, and all manner, and all degrees, of <hi>Impiety]
is to be puniſhed with the greateſt and moſt grievous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
is ſo harſh and ſowre, that it never grew upon any
vine of Gods planting. Nor hath the ſaid inference any
tolerable connexion with his Premiſſes. For if <hi>the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God be the greateſt plague in all Commonwealths,</hi>
then ought the Magiſtrate to uſe all wiſdom and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and good conſcience, to introduce and plant the
knowledg of the <hi>true God</hi> in his Commonwealth. But
<hi>to puniſh</hi> ALL <hi>Impiety with the greateſt and moſt grievous
puniſhments,</hi> is ſo far from being a prudential, or likely
method, or means, to produce this effect, that of the two,
it is more proper and likely to <hi>aboliſh</hi> all <hi>Religion,</hi> and
true knowledg of God, out of the <hi>minds</hi> of men. And
where a Nation is generally prophane, or Atheiſtically
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114806:11"/>
diſpoſed, as all thoſe are, who <hi>deny God in their works</hi>
(which is more then to be feared, is, not <hi>morbus Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
but <hi>Oecumenicus</hi> alſo, the temper of the generality of
all, or the greateſt part of, the Nations under the whole
Heavens) in caſe my <hi>Apologiſt's</hi> Concluſion ſhould take
place, and ALL <hi>Impiety be puniſhed with the greatest and
moſt grievous puniſhments,</hi> the Inhabitants of ſuch a Land,
though before as the ſtars of Heaven for multitude,
would ſoon be left <hi>few in number, that a child may write
them.</hi> So that the Concluſion we now ſpeak of, may
very properly be called, <hi>The Abomination of Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas (in proceſs of diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 8.) he
ſaith, <hi>He diſturbs Religion, who ſpeaks, or writes, impiouſly
of the Nature of God, therefore he is to be puniſhed, and truly
with death,</hi> hath he not ſpoken this againſt himſelf, and
his own life, (yea and againſt the lives of all his beloved
fellow-Propoſaliſts,) if the ſeverity and ſtrictneſs of his
own Law ſhould be put in execution upon him? For
doth not He that repreſenteth God, whether by words,
or writing, either as unmerciful, or as unjuſt, as tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
as a Diſſembler, as walking contrary to his Oath,
as imprudent, as mutable, &amp;c. <hi>ſpeak, or write, impiouſly of
the Nature of God?</hi> And hath not the Apologiſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
if not by writing (which whether he hath done, or
no, certain I am that many of his Judgment touching
the Nature of God, have) yet by words, repreſented him
under the Reproach and deep diſhonor, of ſome, or all,
of theſe Abominations? <hi>Dies indicabit:</hi> The day will
declare it. I know the men of this demerit and guilt,
will reſent the Charge with as much indignation, as the
<hi>Jews</hi> did that of our Saviour againſt them, wherein he
charged them with going about to kill him: <hi>Thou haſt a
Devil</hi> (ſay they) <hi>who goeth about to kill thee</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">John 7. 19.</note>? as if they
had been the moſt innocent perſons under Heaven in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114806:11"/>
of any ſuch vile and bloody intentions, and He a
perſon of a Diabolical ſpirit to lay any ſuch thing to their
charge. Yet we know they were never the more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
(but the more guilty rather) for their peremptory
and high rejection of their Charge: nor he at all guilty,
or blame-worthy, for charging them, notwithſtanding
their deep offence and exulceration of ſpirit thereat.
Moſt certain it is, that all the water in the Sea will not
waſh the heads (whatever it may the hearts) of the men
I now ſpeak of, from the guilt and crime of <hi>writing, and
ſpeaking impiouſly of the Nature of God.</hi> They may, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus</hi>-like,

            <p>Concerning the <hi>Teſtimonies both of Gentiles and Jews</hi>
(for it ſeems he layeth his hands acroſs upon the heads

his worthy Apology; firſt, he giveth inſtance in
<hi>the firſt founding of Rome (bonis avibus,</hi> for good ſucceſs
ſake) telling us, that <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Numa Pompilius,
the firſt Kings, layd the Foundations of their Law-making
in Piety and Juſtice; and that of</hi> Romulus <hi>it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
ſaid, that before all things he began with the Divine
Worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> I marvel to what account theſe Inſtances
turn for his purpoſe? Do they not rather prove, that
Kings and Magiſtrates, and Rulers of the Earth, have
(more generally) an itching humor, and love to be tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
in matters of Religion and Divine Worſhip, and
to have Religions and Worſhips of their own calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and contrivance, how blind or inſufficient ſoever
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114806:12"/>
they be for the managing or regulating ſuch an affair, then
that they have any regular Intereſt or right of Power to
intermeddle therein? Or doth the Apologiſt intend to
commend the examples of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Numa Pompi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
in ſetting up what Religion, and what Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
they thought beſt, amongſt their people, unto the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtrate for his imitation, or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Certainly that Religion, and kind of Worſhip,
which theſe Kings ſet up in their dominions, was not
<hi>taught</hi> them by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> unleſs it be ſuppoſed
that the one was the true <hi>Religion,</hi> and the other, the true
<hi>Worſhip.</hi> For the Law of Nature teacheth no man any
falſe Religion, or falſe Worſhip; much leſs doth it
teach any man to compel others to ſubmit either to
the one, or the other. Therefore the Gentleman is no
<hi>Debtor unto the Gentiles</hi> for any contribution from them
towards his cauſe.</p>
            <p>For what he cites from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Selden's</hi> Book <hi>De Jure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi>
&amp;c. about <hi>the Opinion of the Jews concerning the

it, &amp;c.</hi> not having the Book by me (nor leaſure at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to enquire after it) I cannot examine the truth of his
citations. But whereas he attempts to overawe me with
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Selden's learning and judgment,</hi> ſaying, that <hi>perchance
Mr</hi> 
               <hi>Goodwin will think fit to comply with them, rather then
to conteſt;</hi> I freely and clearly ſay, that I am moſt ready
to <hi>comply with the learning and judgment</hi> of a man by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees inferior to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Selden</hi> in the honour which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth

but otherwiſe, Angels from Heaven, and Scara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,

between them, I have no more Faith for the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the one, then of the other. Were M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:114806:12"/>
and my Apologiſt, <hi>Plato,</hi> I muſt commend them;
but not forſake my ancient and faſt Friend, Truth, for
their ſakes. But touching the <hi>Jews</hi> (in a word)</p>
            <p>1. By the courſe and current of the Scriptures it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that they were no Great Students in the Law of
Nature; neither had they the like occaſion, or neceſſity,
which other Nations had, to engage themſelves much
in this ſtudy. For they, from their great Progenitor and
Founder of their Nation, <hi>Abraham,</hi> were diſcipled and
trained up to a religious and holy Converſation, by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
Signs, and Wonders, by extraordinary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of God, by literal and expreſs Revelations
and Diſcoveries from Heaven of the Mind and Will of
God concerning them: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
<hi>I have taught you Statutes and Judgments, even as
the Lord my God commanded me, that ye ſhould do ſo in the
Land, whither ye go to poſſeſs it. Keep therefore and do them:
for this is your wiſdom and underſtanding in the ſight of the
Nations, which ſhall hear all theſe Statutes, and ſay, Surely
this great Nation is a wiſe and underſtanding people. For
what Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto
them</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 4. 5 6. 7, &amp;c.</note>? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore this Nation, having God <hi>ſo
nigh unto them</hi> (as it follows) to inſtruct and teach them
all things, that were needful for them, either to know, or
practiſe, had no occaſion to pore much on the Book of
Nature, nor to ſeek that by labour and travel, which was
brought unto them in ſuch abundance by the immediate
hand of God himſelf. Whileſt they were dayly fed with
<hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, ploughing and ſowing had been
but loſt labour. The caſe was otherwiſe with the reſt of
the Nations on the Earth.</p>
            <p>2. (And with more particularity to what the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt
alledgeth concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> their making Laws
againſt Idolatry, and falſe Worſhip) What occaſion, or
neceſſity, can it be imagined they ſhould have to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114806:13"/>
their Laws or Conſtitutions (Laws I mean of their
own framing and enditing by the Light of Nature) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
or about, Idolatry and falſe Worſhip, when as
they had ſo many particular, full, and expreſs Laws
touching matters of this nature, delivered unto them by
God himſelf? Nay,</p>
            <p>3. They had not only no occaſion, or neceſſity upon
them to trouble themſelves <hi>with making Laws againſt
Idolatry and falſe Worſhip,</hi> being ſo plentifully in this
kind provided for by God himſelf; but they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by an expreſs Law given unto them in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
by God, from ſetting their threſhold by his, I mean,
from ſuper-adding any Laws of their own unto thoſe
which he had delivered unto them. <hi>Ye ſhall</hi> NOT ADD
<hi>unto the Word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh
ought from it, that you may keep the Commandments of the
Lord your God</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Deut 4 2.</note>. And again: <hi>What thing ſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you, obſerve to do it: thou ſhalt</hi> NOT ADD <hi>thereto,
nor diminiſh from it</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 12. 32.</note>. Doubtleſs though my Apologiſt
judgeth the Laws <hi>againſt Idolatry and falſe Worſhip</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by God unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> to be defective and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
and ſuch, whoſe defects were ſupplyed by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Laws made by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
had with the Light and Law of Nature; yet
God himſelf, both his God, and my God, judgeth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of them; otherwiſe he would not have ſo expreſly
and ſeverely prohibited a ſuper-addition of other Laws
unto them. Therefore,</p>
            <p>4. In caſe all that be true which the Apologiſt cites
from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Selden</hi> and his Rabbies, touching the <hi>Jews ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Laws againſt Idolatry and falſe Worſhip, by the Light of
Nature;</hi> yet their practiſe herein being evidently unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,
and condemned by God himſelf, he doth rather
prevaricate with his Cauſe, then any ways promote it, by
inſiſting on it, or ſo much as mentioning it.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:114806:13"/>
            <p>5. (And laſtly) Concerning the Laws delivered unto
the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt Idolatry and falſe Worſhip, by God
himſelf, I have heretofore demonſtratively proved that
they are, or were, ſo appropriate to this Nation, that they
were not intended by God as obligatory upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
the tenor and import of them being proportionable
and fitted unto ſuch a people, or Nation only, who had
ſuch extraordinary, miraculous, and ſupernatural Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of the true God, ever and anon vouchſafed unto
them, as the Jews had. See and conſider to this purpoſe,
<hi>Deut. 4. 15, 16, 17, &amp;c.</hi> And if theſe, or any the like, Laws
ſhould have been put in vigorous execution in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
part of the world, that univerſal over-ſpreading of
Idolatry conſidered, which covered (in a manner) the face
of the whole Earth, they would have drawn more blood
then the world could have ſpared without fainting, and
ſinking right down. Yea if ſuch Laws as he ſpeaks of,
had been only executed among the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves,
who are known to have been formerly as much addicted
to ſtrange (<hi>i.e.</hi> falſe) Gods, and falſe Worſhips, as other
Nations, of their multitudes like unto the ſand of the
Sea, they would have left them a ſmall remnant only.

M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> J. Goodwin's Queries Queſtioned.</head>
            <p>COncerning the Author of the Pamphlet, ſtiled, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>John Goodwin's Queries Queſtioned,</hi> together with
this his Diſcourſe, I ſhall not need to ſay much, ſince he
hath befriended me with the gentle <hi>oppoſition</hi> of <hi>one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
only, to my <hi>Thirty;</hi> and this ſo well conditioned, that
it may be eaſily reſolved, without the leaſt detriment,
or damage, to the Cauſe pleaded in my Queries. For is
not his one <hi>Query,</hi> this; <hi>Whether the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth not ſufficiently juſtifie and enjoyn the Power of the
Civil Magiſtrate in matters of Religion?</hi> I muſt confeſs
that this Commandment doth (in one ſence) <hi>ſufficiently
juſtifie and enjoyn the Power of the Civil Magiſtrate in
matters of Religion;</hi> but in this ſence, the firſt, and the
ſecond, or any other of the nine, doth both <hi>juſtifie and
enjoyn</hi> the ſame, altogether as <hi>ſufficiently</hi> as this. For that
which is neither <hi>juſtifiable,</hi> nor meet to be <hi>enjoyned,</hi> may
be ſaid to be <hi>ſufficiently juſtified and enjoyned,</hi> when there
is nothing at all ſaid, or done, either for the one, or the
other. An innocent perſon is <hi>ſufficiently</hi> puniſhed, when
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114806:14"/>
he is not puniſhed at all: and the Gentleman the Author
of the <hi>Query</hi> in hand; is <hi>ſufficiently</hi> commended for
the ſame, when he is not commended at all. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the treaſure of the duty, or power, of the <hi>Civil
Magiſtrate,</hi> as ſuch, was never judged by any ſober man
to be hid in the field of the fourth Commandment, nor
in any part of the firſt Table, nor did ever any labourer
in Gods vineyard dig here to find it. It is the ſence of all
judicious men, as far as my reading extendeth, that the
firſt of the two Tables doth not preſcribe, or intermeddle
with, the duties of one man to another, nor yet the duties
appertaining either to any natural, or politique Office, or
Relation; but only enjoyns ſuch duties, wherein the
Worſhip of God conſiſteth, and which equally relate to
all perſons whatſoever. Of this mind is <hi>Calvin</hi>

            <p>Beſides, the tenor of the words in this Commandment
running after the ſame manner, and carried on by the
ſame pronoun, or term of addreſs, <hi>thou, thou,</hi> as well in
the ſubſequent part of the Command, as in the <hi>two firſt
clauſes,</hi> it is extreamly incongruous to ſay, or think (as
my Anti-Queriſt doth) that <hi>in the two first clauſes the
perſonal obſervation</hi> of the Command, <hi>is commanded to all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114806:15"/>
in general, and to men, as men,</hi> and that in the reſt, the
obſervation of it ſhould be commanded unto Parents,
as ſuch, and unto Magiſtrates, as ſuch. For, according
to this notion, the firſt and ſecond, <hi>Thou,</hi> muſt ſignifie,
<hi>Thou man,</hi> and again, <hi>Thou</hi> man: The third <hi>Thou, Thou</hi>
Parent, and <hi>Thou</hi> Maſter too: the fourth and laſt <hi>Thou,
Thou</hi> Magiſtrate. If my Anti-Queriſt can ſhew any
other period, or ſentence throughout all the Scripture,
of like interpretation, with this, and wherein the ſame
pronoun and term of addreſs, muſt import and ſignifie
ſuch variety of capacities, relations, and formal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
it is probable I ſhall conſider further of his
notion about the fourth Commandment, then yet I think
it worth the while to do; although a parallel in this caſe
would be no ſufficient demonſtration of the truth or
ſoundneſs of the conceit.</p>
            <p>2. If the Maſter of the Family (whether Father, or
Maſter) or Magiſtrate, be impowered and enjoyned by
this Commandment, the former, to compel, and by
puniſhment force, his children, or ſervants, to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Worſhip of God; the latter, to do the like unto
<hi>ſtrangers,</hi> by mulcts, fines, impriſonments, &amp;c. then
are they equally impowered, and enjoyned, to exerciſe
the ſame compulſive authority upon their <hi>Cattel</hi> alſo
(their OX, Aſs, and Horſe) and commanded to force
theſe alſo unto the outward means of Gods Worſhip.
For the tenor of the Commiſſion, or Injunction (ſo fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
by the <hi>Anti-queriſt</hi>) impoſed by this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Magiſtrates, and Maſters of families, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as well, and as much, the one, as the other. <hi>In it thou
ſhalt not do any work: thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy daughter,
thy man-ſervant, nor thy maid-ſervant, nor thy</hi> CATTEL,
<hi>nor the ſtranger within thy gates,</hi> &amp;c. Here is not the
leaſt difference made, nor intimated, between the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114806:15"/>
Power given to the Maſter, or Magiſtrate, over their
<hi>children, ſervants, ſtrangers,</hi> &amp;c. and that given them
over their CATTEL.</p>
            <p>3. If there were any Injunction intended by God in
this Commandment to be layd upon the Magiſtrate, to
compel thoſe under his Juriſdiction, unto the outward
or publique means of Gods Worſhip, doubtleſs ſuch an
<hi>Injunction</hi> ſhould rather reſpect, and be extended unto,
the generality of his own people, and native Subjects,
then <hi>Strangers</hi> only: Whereas here is not the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or intimation, of any other perſon, that can with
any colour be pretended to be made obnoxious to the
(imaginary) compulſive Power of the Magiſtrate, but
the STRANGER only.</p>
            <p>4. One main end of the Inſtitution and gift of the
Sabbath by God, was that ſuch perſons (eſpecially) who
were under ſuch a Power and Authority of others, by
which they might be, and ordinarily were, compelled to
labour, work, and pains-taking, as children and ſervants,
together with laboring <hi>cattel,</hi> might have a ſeaſonable
and competent reſt, and refreſhing, from their accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
labour. This is evident from ſeveral places. <hi>Six days
ſhalt thou do thy work, and on the ſeventh day thou ſhalt reſt:</hi>
THAT <hi>thine OX and thine Aſs may reſt, and the ſon of thine
handmaid, and the ſtranger may be refreſhed</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Exod. 23. 12.</note>. So again:
<hi>But the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in
it thou ſhalt not do any work, thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy
daughter, nor thy man-ſervant, nor thy maid-ſervant, nor
thine OX, nor thine Aſs, nor any of thy Cattel, nor thy ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that is within thy gates;</hi> THAT THY MAN-SERVANT
AND THY MAID-SERVANT MAY REST AS WELL
AR THOU. <hi>And remember that thou waſt a ſervant in the
Land of Egypt</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Deut 5, 14 15</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This laſt clauſe, <hi>and remember that
thou waſt a ſervant, &amp;c.</hi> added by way of motive, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114806:16"/>
enforcement of obedience unto the preceding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
from thoſe, to whom it was more peculiarly
given (as <hi>viz.</hi> Parents, and Maſters) plainly ſheweth, that
God in this Commandment did in a very ſignal and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner, aim at and intend the eaſe, comfort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
of thoſe, who otherwiſe were ſubject and in
danger to have been over-wrought, ſurcharged, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with labour, by others. Now then, if it ſhall be
ſuppoſed, that theſe Parents, or Maſters, who have the
Command of their childrens and ſervants labours, all
the week beſides, are either <hi>impowered,</hi> but eſpecially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
by God in this Commandment, to compel or
force them againſt their wills by ſtripes, or otherwiſe,
to the <hi>outward means</hi> of Divine Worſhip, he ſhould give
them a Commiſſion, nay lay an Injunction upon them,
to make the day intended by him for the comfort, reſt,
and refreſhing of theſe children and ſervants, a day of
greater ſorrow, trouble, and diſcomfort unto them, as the
caſe might be (and was frequently not unlike to be) then
any, or all the days of the week beſides; and ſo ſhould
plainly prevaricate with one of his chief intentions in the
Command, and be divided in himſelf.</p>
            <p>5. If the Magiſtrate be impowered, or enjoyned, by
the Commandment before us, to <hi>compel</hi> (either by fines,
impriſonment, or the like) <hi>ſtrangers</hi> or others, <hi>to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Worſhip of God,</hi> then in caſe that Worſhip, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he is ſuppoſed to be <hi>impowered</hi> or enjoyned to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
them, be, in the Judgment and Conſcience of him
that is compelled, ſuperſtitious, idolatrous, or unlawful,
then the Magiſtrate hath not ſimply a Power, but a
Command layd upon him by God, to force men, and
particularly <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> to pollute their Conſciences, or at
beſt to play the hypocrites by drawing near unto God
with their lips, whileſt their hearts are far from him.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:114806:16"/>
            <p>6. (And laſtly) If the Magiſtrate hath a Power or
Command from God to compel <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> or others (by
the means aforeſaid) to the outward Worſhip of God,
then muſt he be ſuppoſed to be anointed by God with an
infallible ſpirit of diſcerning, which is the true Worſhip
of God, and inſtituted by himſelf. Otherwiſe God muſt
be ſuppoſed not only to give a Commiſſion unto, but
even to lay an Injunction upon, the <hi>blind to lead,</hi> yea to
hale and drag, <hi>the blind;</hi> and not only ſo, but as the caſe
may be, and is like to be very frequently, to lay an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
upon <hi>the blind,</hi> to lead, hale, pull, and drag, even
the <hi>ſeeing</hi> themſelves: which is a much more unnatural
abſurdity, then the other.</p>
            <p>Theſe things (with ſome others, which I ſhall not
trouble either my ſelf, or Reader, to mention, at preſent)
conſidered, make it a thing very apparant unto me, that
that which led my Anti-queriſt out of the way of the
mind of God in the fourth Commandment, was partly
his pre-conceived opinion of the Magiſtrates Power in
matters of Religion, together with his inability where to
find a more plauſible or colourable ground for it in all
the Scripture; partly his non-advertency that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
or bodily reſt from labour, is the only literal and
expreſs end of God in this Commandment, (however
this literal reſt was typical, pointing at both thoſe reſts
ſpoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11.) partly alſo the tenor and
carriage of the Commandment it ſelf, expreſly calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
according to the exigency of ſuch an end.</p>
            <p>For the reaſon why this Commandment was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God in this tenor, or form of words,—<hi>in it thou
ſhalt not do any work, thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy daughter,
thy man-ſervant, nor thy maid-ſervant, nor thy cattel, nor
thy ſtranger, &amp;c.</hi> rather then in this, No perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
bond or free, young or old, ſtranger or home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114806:17"/>
no Ox or Aſs whatſoever, or the like, ſhall do any
work; the reaſon (I ſay) why God uſed the former tenor
of words in drawing up this Commandment, was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
that the Reſt of the Sabbath was not like to be
violated, or the Commandment it ſelf broken, but by
the covetouſneſs, cruelty, or oppreſſion of Parents and
Maſters, and ſuch who had power to exact and require
labour and work, from others, whether perſons, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
ſervants, and ſtrangers, or other creatures, as OX,
Aſs, or the like. As the Apoſtle ſaith, The <hi>Law was not
made (i.e.</hi> was not ſo much made) <hi>for a righteous man</hi>
[meaning, for ſuch a man who is under no likelyhood of
ſinning] <hi>but for the lawleſs and diſobedient</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 9.</note>, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> for
ſuch, who without the bar of the Law and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therein threatened, were, or would be, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
and apt to do wickedly, &amp;c. upon a like account
we may very reaſonably conceive and ſay, that the Law
of the Reſt of the Sabbath was not ſo much made for
children, or ſervants, or Oxen, or Aſſes, becauſe there is
ſo little propenſity in theſe, to work, or labour, when they
are not neceſſitated unto it by their Superiors, in as much
as they are no gainers by thir labours, but loſers rather;
but for Heads of Families, Maſters of Servants, Parents,
of Children, Owners of laboring Cattel, &amp;c. who by
reaſon of thoſe covetous and hard diſpoſitions, which
are ſo incident unto men, that have the opportunity
of inriching themſelves by the labour of others,
were likely to tranſgreſs in this kind. Or in caſe
there ſhould be found any diſpoſition in a child, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
man, or maid (and there is the ſame reaſon of the
<hi>ſtranger</hi>) to work on the Sabbath day without being
compel'd unto it by their Parents, or Maſters, this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
is ſufficiently reproved, or reſtrained, by God,
partly in his reſtraining their Maſters and Parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from working, partly by reſtraining them from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114806:17"/>
impoſing any burthen of labour upon them on this day.
Theſe two particulars are ſufficient to inform them, that
his will and mind is, that they ſhould reſt from labour on
the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>So that when God in the Commandment turns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo particularly unto Parents, and Maſters, charging
them they ſhall not do any work, <hi>they, nor their children,
nor their ſervants</hi> (of the one ſex, or the other) his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not, that they ſhould compel them to keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
(which is my Anti-queriſts notion) but that they
take heed that they compel them not to break it, <hi>viz.</hi> by
impoſing any ſervile work, or labour upon them on this
day. Thy children, thy ſervants, ſhall do no work;
<hi>i. e.</hi> they ſhall not be employed, or required, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by thee, to work on the ſeventh day. This to be
the meaning of God, is yet more evident from hence,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the ſame Charge or Injunction is layd upon
the Parent, or Maſter, in reference to his Cattel, which is
layd upon him in reſpect of his Children, or Servants.
<hi>In it thou ſhalt not do any work, Thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy
daughter, thy man-ſervant, nor thy maid-ſervant, nor thy</hi>
CATTEL. Now ſure enough it is, that men are not
commanded to compel or force their <hi>Cattel</hi> to keep the
Sabbath day, but only not to compel them to labour on
this day, which is their breaking of it. But as touching
the work or interpoſure of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in one kind or
other, as ſuch, about the obſervation of the Sabbath, here
is <hi>altiſsimum &amp; profundiſsimum ſilentium,</hi> moſt perfect
and profound ſilence from the one end of the Heaven of
this Commandment unto the other.</p>
            <p>To conclude, whereas the <hi>Anti-queriſt</hi> informeth his
Reader, that my 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. Queries
<hi>concern only the Ordination of Miniſters,</hi> which (he well
ſaith) is nothing to the Queſtion about the Magiſtrates
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114806:18"/>
Power; the truth is, that to my beſt remembrance, the
Ordination of Miniſters was not ſo much as once in all
my thoughts, whileſt I was drawing up the ſaid Queries:
nor do any of them concern the Ordination of Miniſters
in the leaſt. Or if the Gentleman will needs, by an Acy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rology,
term the ſubject of thoſe Queries, the <hi>Ordination
of Miniſters;</hi> then I muſt crave leave to inform him,
that although the ſaid Queries do not concern the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of the Magiſtrates Power about matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the general, yet do they mainly concern a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
branch of that Power, which is aſſerted unto him
about ſuch matters in the Miniſters Propoſals; as the
Reader, if he judgeth it worth his time to compare the
one with the other, will readily find. But by the ſence
of this Anti-queriſt, and the Apologiſt touching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſure
of the Magiſtrates Power in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
it appeareth ſufficiently that if the Land had a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi>
King over it, there would be found more then one
<hi>Perillus</hi> to make him brazen Bulls for the tormenting of
ſuch Chriſtians, who are either too weak, or too wiſe,
to ſwim down the ſtream of a State Religion, or to call
men, <hi>Rabbi.</hi>
