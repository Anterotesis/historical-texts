            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Right Honourable
THOMAS
Lord FAIRFAX.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is with Your Lordſhip's leave,
that this ſhort Manuſcript
of my Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Your
Noble Predeceſſor, is now Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Original, written in
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:52907:4"/>
his own Hand, and left in Your
Study at <hi>Denton</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi>
for it was never intended by him,
to be Publiſhed, but to remain
for the Satisfaction of his own
Relations.</p>
            <p>But of late ſomething has
hapned, which in the judgment
of Your Lordſhip, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſons of Condition, makes
it neceſſary that theſe Papers
ſhould be ſent to the Preſs;
which is now done, without any
Material Alterations from the
Original, but only by placing
them in the natural order of
Time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:52907:4"/>
Tho' no Copy was ever taken
by Your Lordſhip's Conſent, yet
I know not how, ſome imperfect
Ones are got into other Hands.
And this being an Age, wherein
every Man preſumes to Print
what he pleaſes, of his own, or
other Mens, we are plainly told,
That my Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
are ready to be Publiſhed;
and by the very ſame Perſon,
who has lately ſet forth ſome
Memoirs, wherein his Lordſhip
is ſcarce ever nam'd but with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
not to be excuſed by
what the Editor himſelf confeſſes,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:52907:5"/>
That the Author was much out
of humour when he writ the
Book.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s True Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
is better known to many
Wiſe and Good Men, than to be
blemiſhed by ſuch envious Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Nor can his Reputation
thereby ſuffer with any who were
acquainted with his Perſon, and
the true Intentions of his Actions,
and knew him in the latter part
of his Life.</p>
            <p>His great Misfortune, and ſo
he accounted it, was to be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the Unhappy Wars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he deſired no other Memorial
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:52907:5"/>
than the Act of <hi>Oblivion;</hi> which
few that ever needed, better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but as a
<hi>Soldier,</hi> his Life would furniſh
as Noble a Memoir as the Age
has produced, from the time that
he began with a Troop of Horſe,
and a few undiſciplined Forces in
the <hi>North,</hi> to his being General
of a Victorious Army in the
<hi>South;</hi> which he Governed, not
as a Cypher, but with great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Conduct, in Councils of
War, as well as animated by his
Perſonal Courage in the Field, as
long as they had any Enemy to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:52907:6"/>
But after that, they broke into
Factions, and were over-run with
Enthuſiaſm, and became Vngo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable
by their General, when
they choſe their own <hi>Agitators,</hi>
and were managed by Men of the
deepeſt Diſſimulation and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie:
by whoſe fair but treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Promiſes, ſome Greater than
Himſelf, were deceived to their
own Ruin.</p>
            <p>That moſt Tragical and Deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of the Civil War, the
Death of the King, he utterly from
his Soul abhorred, and lamented to
his dying day; and never mentioned
it but with Tears in his Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:52907:6"/>
The retired part of his Life
gave him greater Satisfaction than
all his former Victories, when he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
quietly at his own Houſe at <hi>Nun-Appleton</hi>
in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> always
earneſtly wiſhing and praying for the
Reſtitution of the Royal Family,
and fully reſolved to lay hold on the
firſt good Opportunity to contribute
his part towards it; which made
him always lookt upon with a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
eye by the Uſurpers of that
time.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was invited by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Monk</hi> to aſſiſt him againſt
<hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army, he cheerfully
embraced the Occaſion, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:52907:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at the Head of a brave Body of
Gentlemen of <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Reputation and Authority of
his Name, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brigade of
Twelve Thouſand Horſe forſook
<hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army, and joyned with
him; the Conſequence was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
breaking of all <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s
Forces, which gave General
<hi>Monk</hi> an eaſy March into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was always acknowledged,
not only by General <hi>Monk,</hi> but
by the King himſelf, as a ſignal
Teſtimony of his Zeal to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for what was paſt, and of
the very conſiderable Aſſiſtance he
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:52907:7"/>
gave towards the reſtoring the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Family.</p>
            <p>After he had waited on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in <hi>Holland,</hi> as one of the
Commiſſioners ſent to invite him
home, and had ſeen the King eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
on his Throne, he retired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into his own Country, where he
died in Peace, in the 60th Year of
his Age, <hi>Anno</hi> 1671. leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him his only Daughter, the
Lady <hi>Mary</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſay no more of him,
but, That ſo long as Unfeigned
Piety towards God, Invincible Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
joyned with wonderful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:52907:8"/>
and exceeding Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Juſtice and Charity to all
men in his private Life; and
an Ingenuous Acknowledgment of
his Publick Error, with hearty
Endeavours to make Reparation,
as ſoon as he was convinced of it,
ſhall be eſteemed in the World: So
long ſhall the Name of my Lord
<hi>Fairfax</hi> be honoured by good Men,
and be had in perpetual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be born after the Storms and
Tempeſts of that Age: But you
have had the Honour to appear
eminently in defence of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

            <p>My Father was call'd forth
by the Importunity of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to join with them in their
own Defence, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by a Commiſſion from
the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The firſt Action we had was
at <hi>Bradford.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bradford.</note> We were about
three hundred Men, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſeven or eight hundred,
and two Pieces of Ordnance.
They aſſaulted us; We drew
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52907:10"/>
out cloſe to the Town to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them; They had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Ground, the
Town being encompaſſed with
Hills, which expoſed us more
to their Cannon, from which
we receiv'd ſome Hurt; but
our Men defended thoſe Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
by which they were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend,
ſo well, that they got
no ground of us; and now the
day being ſpent, they drew off,
and retired to <hi>Leeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A few days after, Captain
<hi>Hotham</hi> with three Troops of

came to us: Then We march'd
to <hi>Leeds;</hi> but the Enemy having

eight Miles from <hi>York,</hi> that we
might have more room, and
be leſs burthenſome to Our

the ſecuring of the <hi>Weſt</hi>-Riding,
or the greateſt part of it,

            <p>I was ſent to <hi>Wetherby</hi> with
three hundred Foot,<note place="margin">Wetherby.</note> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Horſe; The Enemy's
next deſign from <hi>York,</hi> was to
fall upon my Quarters there,
being a Place very open, and
eaſy for them to aſſault, there
being ſo many back-ways, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52907:11"/>
Friends enough to direct them,
and give them intelligence.</p>
            <p>About ſix a clock one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they fell upon us with eight
hundred Horſe and Foot, the
Woods thereabout favouring
them ſo much, that Our Scouts
had no notice of them, and
no Allarm was given till they
were ready to enter the Town:
Which they might eaſily do,
the Guards being all aſleep in
Houſes; for in the beginning
of the War, Men were as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient

            <p>I my ſelf was only on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,

above four Men at their Arms,
as I remember<note n="*" place="margin">One of them had a Penſion for his Life till 1670.</note>, two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants,
and two Pikemen, who
ſtood with me when Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Glenham,</hi> with about ſix
or ſeven Commanders more,
charged us; and after a ſhort,
but ſharp Encounter, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
in which one Major <hi>Carr</hi>
was ſlain; and by this time
more of the Guards were got
to their Arms. I muſt confeſs
I knew no Strength but the
powerful Hand of God that
gave them this Repulſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52907:12"/>
After this they made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Attempt, in which Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Atkinſon</hi> (on our part)
was ſlain: And here again
there fell out another remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Providence, during this
Conflict, our Magazine was
blown up. This ſtruck ſuch
a Terror into the Enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
we had Cannon, which
they were before inform'd we
had not, that they inſtantly
retreated; And though I had
but a few Horſe, we purſued
the Enemy ſome Miles, and
took many Priſoners: We loſt
about eight or ten Men,
whereof ſeven were blown up
with Powder; the Enemy loſt
many more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52907:13"/>
At this time the <hi>Earl of
Cumberland</hi> Commanded the
Forces in <hi>York-ſhire</hi> for the
King; He being of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Nature, and affable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
had but few Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
or rather, becauſe he
was an Enemy to few, he did
not ſuit with their preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Their Apprehenſions
and Fears cauſed them to ſend
to the <hi>Earl of Newcaſtle,</hi> who
had an Army of ſix thouſand
Men, to deſire his Aſſiſtance,
whereof he aſſured them by a
ſpeedy March to <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being now encouraged by
this increaſe of Force,<note place="margin">Tadcaſter.</note> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to fall upon <hi>Tadcaſter.</hi> My
Father drew all his Men thither;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52907:13"/>
but, in a Council of War the
Town was judged untenable, and
that we ſhould draw out to an
advantagious piece of Ground,
by the Town; But before we
could all march out, the Enemy
advanced ſo faſt, that we were
neceſſitated to leave ſome Foot
in a ſlight Work above the
Bridge, to ſecure our Retreat,
but the Enemy preſſing on us,
forced us to draw back, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Ground.</p>
            <p>We had about nine hundred
Men, the Enemy above four
thouſand, who in Brigades
drew up cloſe to the Works,
and ſtorm'd us. Our Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
their ſhot, till they came
near, which they did then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of to ſo good purpoſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52907:14"/>
that the Enemy was forced to
retire, and ſhelter themſelves
behind the Hedges. And here
did the firſt Fight continue
from Eleven a Clock at Noon,
till Five at Night, with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
and Muſquet, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion.</p>
            <p>They had once poſſeſſed a
Houſe by the Bridge, which
would have cut us from our
Reſerves that were in the Town,
but <hi>Major General Gifford</hi> with
a Commanded Party, beat
them out again, where many
of the Enemy were ſlain, and
taken Priſoners. They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
an another Place, but
were repulſed by Captain <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
who was there ſlain, a
great Loſs, being a Diſcreet
Gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52907:14"/>
By this time it grew dark,
and the Enemy drew off into
the Fields hard by, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to aſſault us again the next
day.</p>
            <p>They left that Night above
two hundred dead and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Place. But our
Ammunition being all ſpent
in this day's Fight, we drew
off that Night, and marched
to <hi>Selby,</hi> and the Enemy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the next Morning into the
Town.</p>
            <p>Thus by the Mercy of God
were a few delivered from an
Army, who in their thoughts
had ſwallowed us up.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earl of Newcaſtle</hi> now
lay betwixt us and our Friends
in the <hi>Weſt-Riding;</hi> but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52907:15"/>
and encourage them I was
ſent with about three hundred
Foot, and three Troops of
Horſe, and ſome Arms to <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi>
I was to go by <hi>Ferry-bridge,</hi>
Our Intelligence being
that the Enemy was advanced
no further than <hi>Sherburne,</hi> but
when I was within a mile of
the Town, we took ſome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
who told us, my Lord
of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> lay at <hi>Pontefract,</hi>
eight hundred Men in <hi>Ferry-bridge,</hi>
and the reſt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in all the Towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about:
So that our Advance
or Retreat ſeem'd alike diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.
Little time being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us to conſider, we reſolv'd
to retreat to <hi>Selby:</hi> three or
four hundred Horſe of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52907:15"/>
ſhewed themſelves in the
Rear, without making any
attempt upon us, ſo that, by
the Goodneſs of God, we got
ſafe to <hi>Selby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three days after this, upon
better Intelligence how the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
lay, with the ſame Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as before, I marched in the
Night by ſeveral Towns where
they lay, and came the next
Day to <hi>Bradford,</hi> a Town
very untenable, but for their
good affection to us, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all we could hazard for
them.</p>
            <p>Our firſt Work then was to
Fortifie Our ſelves, for we could
not but expect an Aſſault.
There lay at <hi>Leeds</hi> fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of the Enemy, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52907:16"/>
twelve hundred at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place above ſix or ſeven
Miles diſtant from us. They
viſited us every Day with their
Horſe, Ours not going far
from the Town, being very
unequal in Number: yet the
Enemy ſeldom return'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Loſs, till at laſt our few
Men grew ſo bold, and theirs
ſo diſheartned, that they durſt
not ſtir a Mile from their Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe daily Skirmiſhes
were among the Horſe, I
thought it neceſſary to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
our ſelves with more Foot;
I ſummon'd the Country, who
had by this time more liberty
to come to us. I preſently
Armed them with thoſe Arms
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52907:16"/>
we brought along with us; So
that in all we were about eight
hundred Foot.</p>
            <p>Being too many to lye idle,
and too few to be upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Duty, we reſolv'd through
the aſſiſtance of God, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
them in their Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>We ſummon'd the Country
again, and made a Body of
twelve or thirteen hundred
Men, with which we marched
to <hi>Leeds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leeds.</note> and drew them up
within half Cannon-ſhot of
their Works, in Battalia, and
then ſent a Trumpet with a
Summons to deliver up the
Town to me, for the uſe of
King and Parliament. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52907:17"/>
returned this Anſwer,
That it was not civilly done
to come ſo near before I
ſent the Summons, and that
they would defend the Town
the beſt they could with their
Lives.</p>
            <p>I preſently order'd the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Storm, and we all
fell on at the ſame time: The
buſineſs was hotly diſputed for
almoſt two Hours; but the
Enemy being beaten from their
Works, and the Barricado's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Streets forced open, the
Horſe and Foot reſolutely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and the Soldiers caſt down
their Arms, and rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Priſoners. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and ſome Chief Officers
ſwam the River and eſcaped,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52907:17"/>
only <hi>Major Beaumont</hi> was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
about forty or fifty ſlain,
good ſtore of Ammunition ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
of which we had great
want.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence of this
Action was yet of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
for thoſe who fled
from <hi>Leeds</hi> to <hi>Wakefield,</hi> and
quitting that Gariſon alſo, gave
my <hi>Lord of Newcaſtle</hi> ſuch an
Allarm at <hi>Pontefract,</hi> that he
drew all his Army again to
<hi>York,</hi> leaving once more a free
intercourſe, which he had ſo
long time cut off, betwixt my
Father and us.</p>
            <p>After a ſhort time the <hi>Earl
of Newcaſtle</hi> return'd again to
the ſame Quarters, and we to
our ſtricter Duties. But we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52907:18"/>
quickly found our Men muſt
have more room, or more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Captain Hotham</hi> and I took a
reſolution early one Morning
(from <hi>Selby)</hi> to beat up a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Enemies that lay at
<hi>Fenton;</hi> they being gone, we
marched to <hi>Sherburne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sherburn.</note> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there only to give them an
Alarm; but they might ſee us
a Mile or more, over a plain
Common, which lay by the
Town, and they ſent twenty
or thirty Horſe, to Guard a
Paſs near the Town; I had the
Van; for at this time we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
our Troops diſtinct
one from another, both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
five Troops of Horſe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52907:18"/>
and two of Dragoons. I
told <hi>Captain Hotham,</hi> that if he
would ſecond me, I would
Charge thoſe Horſe, and if
they fled, I would purſue them
ſo cloſe as to get into the
Town with them: He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſecond me; I went to
the Head of my Troops, and
preſently Charged them, they
fled, and we purſued cloſe to
the Barricado, but they got in,
and ſhut it upon us: Here
my Horſe was ſhot in at the
Breaſt: We ſo fill'd the Lane,
being ſtrait, that we could not
Retreat without confuſion, and
danger of their falling in our
Reer, ſo we ſtood to it, and
Stormed the Works with Piſtol
and Sword: At the end of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52907:19"/>
Barricado, there was a narrow
paſſage for a ſingle Horſe to go
in, I entred there, others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
me, one by one; and
cloſe at one ſide of the Entrance
ſtood a Troop of Horſe of
the Enemy: So ſoon as eight
or ten of us were got in, We
Charged them, and they fled;
by this time the reſt of our
Men had beat them from their
Barricado, and entred the
Town: We ſoon cleared the
Streets, and purſued thoſe that
fled: And now my Horſe
which was ſhot in the Lane,
fell down dead under me, but
I was preſently mounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52907:19"/>
The Enemy in the Towns
about having taken the Alarm,
it made us think of ſecuring
our Retreat, with the Priſoners
we had got, ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſiderable, among whom
was <hi>Major General Windham;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> eſcap'd.</note>
We ſcarce got into order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>General Goring</hi> came with
a good Body of Horſe up to
us, and as we marched off, he
followed us cloſe in the Reer,
without doing us any hurt,
only my Trumpet had his
Horſe ſhot cloſe by me,
and thus we returned to
<hi>Selby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though this did not free us
wholly from a Potent Enemy,
yet we lay more quietly by them
a good while after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52907:20"/>
In this receſs of Action, we
had ſeveral Treaties about Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners;
and this I mention the
rather, for that <hi>Captain Hotham</hi>
here firſt began to diſcover
his intentions of leaving the
Parliament's Service, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Conditions for himſelf,
with the <hi>Earl of Newcaſtle,</hi>
though it was not diſcovered
till a good while after, which
had almoſt ruin'd my Father,
and the Forces with him; for
being now denied help and
ſuccour from <hi>Hull,</hi> and the
<hi>Eaſt-Riding,</hi> he was forced to
forſake <hi>Selby,</hi> and retire to <hi>Leeds,</hi>
and thoſe Weſtern Parts where
I then lay.</p>
            <p>To make good this Retreat,
I was ſent to, to bring what
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52907:20"/>
Men I could to joyn with him
at <hi>Sherburne,</hi> for my <hi>Lord of
Newcaſtle</hi>'s Army lay ſo as he
might eaſily intercept us in our
way to <hi>Leeds,</hi> which he had
determin'd to do, and to that
end lay with his Army on
<hi>Clifford-Moore,</hi> having preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of our March.</p>
            <p>Whilſt my Father, with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Men, Ordnance,
and Ammunition, continued
his way from <hi>Selby</hi> to <hi>Leeds;</hi>
I with thoſe I brought to <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi>
marched a little aſide,
betwixt my <hi>Lord of Newcaſtle</hi>'s
Army and Ours. And to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe
them the more, made
an Attempt upon <hi>Tadcaſter,</hi>
where they had three or four
hundred Men, who preſently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52907:21"/>
quit the Town, and fled to
<hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we ſtayed three or four
hours ſlighting the Works,
which put my <hi>Lord Newcaſtle</hi>'s
Army to a ſtand, being on
their March to meet us, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was deceived in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
and that we had
ſome other deſign upon <hi>York;</hi>
He preſently ſends back the
<hi>Lord Goring</hi> with twenty Troops
of Horſe and Dragoons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Tadcaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were newly drawn off
when he came; my <hi>Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
paſt over the River to
follow us, but ſeeing we were
far unequal in Horſe to him,
(for I had not above three
Troops, and were to go over
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52907:21"/>
               <hi>Bramham-Moore</hi> Plain) I gave
direction to the Foot to march
away, whilſt I ſtay'd with the
Horſe to interrupt the Enemy's
paſſage in thoſe narrow Lanes
that lead up to the <hi>Moore.</hi>
Here was much Firing at one
another; but in regard of their
great Numbers, as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
we were forced to give
way; yet had gained by it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
time for the Foot to have
been out of danger.</p>
            <p>When we came up to the <hi>Moore</hi>
again, I found them where I
left them, which troubled me
much, the Enemy being cloſe
upon us, and a great Plain
yet to go over. So we march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Foot in two Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52907:22"/>
and the Horſe in the Rear,
the Enemy followed about two
Musket-ſhot from us, in three
good Bodies, but made no
Attempt upon us: And thus
we got well over this open
Campagn, to ſome Incloſures,
beyond which was another
<note n="*" place="margin">Seacroft Moore.</note> 
               <hi>Moore,</hi> leſs than the other.
Here Our Men thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſecure, were more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in keeping Order; and
whilſt their Officers were get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them out of Houſes where
they ſought for Drink, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an extream hot Day, the
Enemy got another Way as
ſoon as we into the <hi>Moore;</hi>
and when we had almoſt paſs'd
this Plain alſo, they ſeeing Us
in ſome Diſorder, charged Us
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52907:22"/>
both in Flank and Rear:
The Countrymen preſently caſt
down their Arms and fled; the
Foot ſoon after, which for want
of Pikes was not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
their Horſe: Some were
Slain, many were taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
Few of Our Horſe ſtood
the Charge. Some Officers
with me, made Our Retreat
with much Difficulty; in which
Sir <hi>Henry Fowlis</hi> had a ſlight
Hurt; my Cornet was taken
Priſoner. We got well to <hi>Leeds,</hi>
about an Hour after my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Men with him
got ſafe thither.</p>
            <p>This was one of the greateſt
Loſſes we ever receiv'd. Yet
was it a Providence it was a
part, and not the whole For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52907:23"/>
which receiv'd this Loſs;
it being the Enemy's Intention
to have fought us that Day
with their whole Army, which
was at leaſt Ten Thouſand Men,
had not Our Attempt upon
<hi>Tadcaſter</hi> put a Stand to them;
and ſo concluded that Day
with this Storm, which fell on
me only.</p>
            <p>We being at <hi>Leeds,</hi> it was
thought fit to poſſeſs ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Place; wherefore I was
ſent to <hi>Bradford</hi> with ſeven or
eight hundred Foot, and three
Troops of Horſe. Theſe two
Towns were all the Gariſons
we had;<note place="margin">VVake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</note> and at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> ſix
Miles off, lay three thouſand
of the Enemy; but they did
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52907:23"/>
not much diſturb us: And we
were buſied about releaſing Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
that were taken at <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft,</hi>
moſt of them being
Countrymen, whoſe Wives and
Children were ſtill importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
for their Releaſe, which
was as earneſtly endeavoured
by us, but no Conditions would
be accepted; ſo as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Cries, and Tears, and
Importunities, compelled us to
think of ſome way to redeem
theſe Men; and we thought of
attempting <hi>Wakefield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Intelligence was, that
the Enemy had not above
eight or nine hundred Men in
the Town; I acquainted my
Father with Our deſign, who
approved of it, and ſent ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52907:24"/>
Men from <hi>Leeds,</hi> ſo that we
were able to draw out eleven
hundred Horſe and Foot.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> early in the
Morning, we came before the
Town, but they had notice of
Our coming, and had manned
all their Works, and ſet about
five hundred Musketeers to line
the Hedges without the Town,
which made us now doubt our
Intelligence, but it was too
late.</p>
            <p>After a little Conſultation we
advanced, and ſoon beat them
back into the Town, which we
ſtorm'd at three Places; and
after an Hour's diſpute, the Foot
forced open a Barricado, where
I entred with my own Troop,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52907:24"/>
Colonel <hi>Alured</hi> and Captain
<hi>Bright</hi> followed with theirs:
The Street where we entred
was full of their Foot; We
charged them through, and
routed them, leaving them to
the Foot that followed cloſe
behind us: And preſently we
were charged again with Horſe
led on by General <hi>Goring;</hi> where,
after a hot Encounter, ſome
were Slain, and himſelf taken
Priſoner by Colonel <hi>Alured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but here acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God's Goodneſs to me
this day; for being advanced
a good way ſingle before my
Men, having a Colonel, and
Lieutenant-Colonel, who had
engaged themſelves to be my
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52907:25"/>
Priſoners, only with me, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Enemy now betwixt
me and my Men, I lighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Regiment of Foot ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Market-place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus encompaſſed, and
thinking what to do, I ſpied a
Lane which I thought would
lead me back to my Men again:
At the end of this Lane there
was a Corps-de-guard of the
Enemy's, with fifteen or ſixteen
Soldiers, who were juſt then
quitting of it, with a Serjeant
leading them off; whom we
met, and ſeeing their Officers,
they came up to us, taking no
notice of me, and asked them
what they would have them do,
for they could keep the work
no longer, the Round-heads
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52907:25"/>
(as they call'd them) came
ſo faſt upon them.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen who had
paſs'd their Words to me to be
my true Priſoners, ſaid nothing;
and looking one upon another,
I thought it not fit now to
own them as Priſoners, much
leſs to bid the reſt to render
themſelves to me; but being
well mounted, and ſeeing a
place in the Works where Men
uſed to go over, I ruſhed from
them, and made my Horſe
leap over the Work, and by a
good Providence got to my
Men again, who before I came
had, by Direction of Major-General
<hi>Gifford,</hi> brought up a
Piece of Ordnance, and placed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52907:26"/>
it in the Church-yard, againſt
that Body that ſtood in the
Market-place, which preſently
rendred themſelves.</p>
            <p>All our Men being got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Town, the Streets were
cleared, and many Priſoners
taken; but the Horſe got off,
almoſt entire.</p>
            <p>This appeared the greater
Mercy, when we ſaw Our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake;
for we found Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men in the Town, and
expected but half the number.
We brought away fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Priſoners, Eighty Officers,
Twenty eight Colours, and great
ſtore of Ammunition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52907:26"/>
But ſeeing this was more a
Miracle, than a Victory; more
the Effect of God's Providence,
than humane Force, or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
let the Honour and
Praiſe of all be His only.</p>
            <p>After this, we exchanged our
Men that were Priſoners, and
we were freed a good while
from any trouble or attempt of
the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, through God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
we had held up near two
Years againſt a potent Army;
but they finding us now almoſt
tired with continual Service,
treacherouſly uſed by Friends,
and wanting many things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for ſupport and defence,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52907:27"/>
the <hi>Earl of Newcaſtle</hi> marched
with an Army of Ten or Twelve
thouſand Men to beſiege Us,
and reſolv'd to ſit down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Bradford,</hi> which was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
untenable Place.</p>
            <p>Hither my Father drew all
the Forces he could ſpare out
of the Gariſons; but ſeeing it
impoſſible to defend the Town
otherwiſe than by Strength of
Men, and that we had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ten or twelve days Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for ſo many as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to keep it;<note place="margin">Adder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Moor.</note> We reſolv'd
the next Morning, very early,
with a Body of three Thouſand
Men, to attempt his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as they lay in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
three Miles off. Hoping
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52907:27"/>
by it to put him to ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,
which could not be
done any other way, by reaſon
of the unequal Numbers.</p>
            <p>To this End my Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Four o'th' Clock next
morning to begin Our March;
but Major-General <hi>Gifford,</hi> who
had the Ordering of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo delay'd the execution
of it, that it was ſeven or eight
before we began to move, and
not without much ſuſpicion of
Treachery; for when we came
near the Place we intended,
the Enemy's whole Army was
drawn up in Battalia.</p>
            <p>We were to go up a Hill to
them; That Our Forlorn Hope
gained by beating theirs into
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52907:28"/>
their main Body, which was
drawn up half a Mile further
upon a Plain called <hi>Adderton-Moore.</hi>
We being all got up
the Hill, drew into Battalia al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
I Commanded the Right
Wing, which was about One
thouſand Foot, and Five Troops
of Horſe. Major-General <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
Commanded the left Wing,
which was about the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
My Father Commanded
in Chief.</p>
            <p>We advanced through the
incloſed Grounds, till we came
to the <hi>Moore,</hi> beating the Foot,
that lay in them, to their main
Body.</p>
            <p>Ten or twelve Troops of
Horſe charged us in the Right
Wing; We kept the Incloſures,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52907:28"/>
placing Our Musketeers in the
Hedges next the <hi>Moore;</hi> which
was a good Advantage to us
who had ſo few Horſe.</p>
            <p>There was a Gate, or open
Place, to the <hi>Moore,</hi> where five
or ſix might enter a-breaſt. Here
they ſtrive to enter, we to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it; but after ſome diſpute,
thoſe that entred the Paſs, found
ſharp Entertainment; and thoſe
who were not yet entred, as
hot Welcome from the Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
that flanked them in the
Hedges. They were all, in the
end, forced to retreat, with the
Loſs of Collonel <hi>Howard,</hi> who
Commanded them.</p>
            <p>Our Left Wing at the ſame
time was engaged with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Foot, and gained Ground
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52907:29"/>
of them. The Horſe came
down again, and charged us,
they being about Thirteen or
Fourteen Troops. We defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Our ſelves as before, but
with much more difficulty;
many having got in among us,
but were beaten off again with
ſome Loſs. Collonel <hi>Herne,</hi> who
Commanded that Party, was
ſlain. We purſued them to
their Cannon. Here I cannot
omit a remarkable Inſtance of
Divine Juſtice. Whilſt we were
engag'd in the Fight with thoſe
Horſe that entred the Gate, four
Soldiers had ſtript Colonel <hi>Herne</hi>
naked as he lay on the ground,
Men ſtill Fighting round about
him; and ſo dextrous were
theſe Villains, that they had
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52907:29"/>
done it, and mounted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
again, before we had
beaten the Enemy off: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we had beaten them to their
Ordnance, as I ſaid, and now
returning to our Ground again,
the Enemy diſcharged a Piece
of Cannon in our Rear, the
Bullet fell into Captain <hi>Copley</hi>'s
Troop, in which were theſe
four Men; two of them were
killed, and ſome Hurt or Mark
remain'd on the other, though
diſpers'd into ſeveral Ranks of
the Troop, which made it more
remarkable. We had not yet
Martial Law among us; this
gave me a good Occaſion to
declare to the Soldiers how God
would puniſh, when Men want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Power to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:52907:30"/>
This Charge, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
our Men ſhewed in
the Left Wing, made the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
think of Retreating. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were given for it, and
ſome marched off the Field.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were in this
wavering condition, one Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Skirton</hi> deſired his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to let him Charge once
with a Stand of Pikes, with
which he broke in upon our
Men, and not being relieved
by our Reſerves, which were
Commanded by ſome ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Officers, chiefly <hi>Major
General Gifford,</hi> who did not
his part as he ought to do,
Our Men loſt Ground, which
the Enemy ſeeing, purſued this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52907:30"/>
advantage, by bringing on
freſh Troops; Ours being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
diſcouraged, began to fly,
and were ſoon routed. The
Horſe alſo Charged us again,
We not knowing what was
done in the Left Wing: Our
Men maintained their Ground,
till a Command came for us
to Retreat, having ſcarce any
way now to do it, the Enemy
being almoſt round about us,
and Our way to <hi>Bradford</hi> cut
off. But there was a Lane
in the Field we were in, which
led to <hi>Hallifax,</hi> which as a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Providence, brought us off,
without any great Loſs, ſave
of <hi>Captain Talbot,</hi> and twelve
more that were ſlain in this
laſt Encounter. Of thoſe who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52907:31"/>
fled, there were about ſixty
kill'd, and three hundred taken
Priſoners.</p>
            <p>After this ill Succeſs, we had
ſmall hopes of better, wanting
all things neceſſary in <hi>Bradford</hi>
for defence of the Town, and
no expectation of help from
any Place. The <hi>Earl of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi>
preſently Beſieg'd the
Town; but before he had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
it, I got in with thoſe
Men I brought from <hi>Hallifax.</hi>
I found my Father much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
having neither a place of
Strength to defend our ſelves
in, nor a Gariſon in <hi>Yorkshire</hi>
to Retreat to; for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Hull</hi> had declar'd if
we were forced to Retreat thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52907:31"/>
he would ſhut the Gates
on us.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was muſing on
theſe ſad thoughts, a Meſſenger
was ſent unto him from <hi>Hull,</hi>
to let him know the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had ſecured the Governour;
that they were ſenſible of the
danger he was in, and if he had
any occaſion to make uſe of
that Place, he ſhould be very
readily and gladly receiv'd there.
Which News was joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and acknowledged as a
great Mercy of God, yet it was
not made uſe of till a further
neceſſity compell'd.</p>
            <p>My Father having Order'd
me to ſtay here with eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Foot,<note place="margin">Bradford.</note> and ſixty Horſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
that Night to <hi>Leeds</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52907:32"/>
The <hi>Earl of Newcaſtle</hi> ſpent
three or four days in laying his
Quarters about the Town of
<hi>Bradford,</hi> and brought down
his Cannon, but needed not to
raiſe Batteries, for the Hills
within half Musket-ſhot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all the Town. Being
planted in two places, they ſhot
furiouſly upon us, and made
their Approaches, which made
us ſpend very much of our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Store, being not above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
five or twenty ſix Barrels of
Powder, at the beginning of the
Siege. Yet the <hi>Earl of Newcaſtle</hi>
ſent a Trumpet to offer us
Conditions, which I accepted,
ſo they were Honourable for
us to take, and ſafe for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:52907:32"/>
We ſent two Captains to
treat with him, and agreed to
a Ceſſation during that time;
but he continued working ſtill;
whereupon I ſent forth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
again, ſuſpecting a
deſign of attempting ſomething
upon us. They returned not till
Eleven a Clock at Night, and
then with a ſlight Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were delivering
it to us, we heard great ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Cannon and Muskets; all
run preſently to the Works,
which the Enemy was ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Here for three quarters of
an hour was very hot Service,
but at length they retreated.</p>
            <p>They made a Second attempt,
but were alſo beaten off; after
this, we had not above one Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52907:33"/>
of Powder left, and no
Match: I called the Officers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
where it was adviſed
and reſolv'd to draw off pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
before it was day, and
to retreat to <hi>Leeds,</hi> by forcing a
Way, which we muſt do, for
they had ſurrounded the Town.</p>
            <p>Orders were diſpatch'd, and
ſpeedily put in execution. The
Foot Commanded by Colonel
<hi>Rogers</hi> was ſent out, through
ſome narrow Lanes, and they
were to beat up the Dragoons
Quarters, and ſo go on to
<hi>Leeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I my ſelf with ſome other
Officers went with the Horſe,
which were not above fifty, in
a more open Way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52907:33"/>
I muſt not here forget my <hi>Wife,</hi>
who ran the ſame hazard with
us in this Retreat, and with as
little expreſſion of Fear; not
from any Zeal, or delight in the
War, but through a willing and
patient Suffering of this undeſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Condition.</p>
            <p>I ſent two or three Horſemen
before, to diſcover what they
could of the Enemy; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
return'd and told us there
was a Guard of Horſe cloſe by us.
Before I had gone forty Paces,
the Day beginning to break, I
ſaw them upon the Hill above
us, being about 300 Horſe. I,
with ſome 12 more, charged
them, Sir <hi>Hen. Fowles, Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Gefford,</hi> my <hi>Self</hi> and 3 more
brake through; <hi>Cap. Mudd</hi> was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52907:34"/>
ſlain, and the reſt of our Horſe
being cloſe by, the Enemy fell
upon them, and ſoon routed
them, taking moſt of them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
among whom was <hi>my
Wife,</hi> the <hi>Officer Will. Hill,</hi> behind
whom ſhe rid, being taken.</p>
            <p>I ſaw this Diſaſter, but could
give no relief; for after I was
got through, I was in the Enemies
Reer alone, thoſe who had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
through with me, went on
to <hi>Leeds,</hi> thinking I had done ſo
too: But I was unwilling to leave
my Company, and ſtay'd till I
ſaw there was no more in my
Power to do, but to be taken
Priſoner with them. I then reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Leeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like Diſaſter fell among
the Foot, that went the other
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52907:34"/>
way, by a miſtake, for after they
had marched a little way, the Van
fell into the Dragoons Quarters,
clearing their way; but through
a cowardly fear, he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
theſe Men, being in the
Reer, made them face about,
and march again into the Town,
where the next Day they were
all taken Priſoners, only 80 or
thereabout of the Front that got
through, came all to <hi>Leeds,</hi>
mounted on Horſes which they
had taken from the Enemy,
where I found them when I came
thither, which was ſome joy to
them all, concluding I was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſlain, or taken Priſoner.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Leeds</hi> I found all in great
Diſtraction, the Council of War
newly riſen, where it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52907:35"/>
to quit the Town, and
retreat to <hi>Hull,</hi> which was ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Miles off, many of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Garriſons being in the
way. This, in two Hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was accordingly done, leaſt
the Enemy ſhould preſently ſend
Horſe to prevent us; for they
had fifty or ſixty Troops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three Miles: But we got well
to <hi>Selby,</hi> where there was a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and hard by a <hi>Garriſon</hi> at
<hi>Cawood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Father being a Mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<note place="margin">Selby.</note> with a few Men, getting
over the Ferry, word came to
us that he was in danger to be
taken. I haſted to him with
about forty Horſe, the reſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in ſome diſorder. He
was newly got into the Boat,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52907:35"/>
when the Enemy with three Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
of Horſe entred the Town.</p>
            <p>I was drawn up in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
place, directly before the
Street they came down; when
they were almoſt half come into
the Market-place, they turn'd on
the Right Hand; with part of
my Troop I charged them in
the Flank, and divided them;
we had the Chaſe of them down
the long Street that goes to <hi>Bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hapned at the ſame time
that thoſe Men I left behind were
coming up that Street, but being
in diſorder, and diſcourag'd with
the Misfortunes of many Days
before, they turn'd about, and
gave way, not knowing we
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52907:36"/>
were purſuing the Enemy in their
Reer.</p>
            <p>At the end of this Street was
a narrow Lane, which led to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</hi>
The Enemy ſtrove to paſs
that way, but it being narrow,
there was a ſudden ſtop, where
we were mingled one among
another.</p>
            <p>Here I receiv'd a Shot in the
Wriſt of my Arm, which made
the Bridle fall out of my hand,
and being among the Nerves
and Veins, ſuddenly let out ſuch
a quantity of Blood, that I was
ready to fall from my Horſe:
But taking the Reins in the other
Hand in which I had my Sword,
the Enemy minding nothing ſo
much as how to get away, I
drew my ſelf out of the Crowd,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52907:36"/>
and came to our Men, who
turned about, and ſeeing me
ready to fall from my Horſe,
they lay'd me on the Ground;
now when I was almoſt ſenſeleſs,
my <hi>Surgeon</hi> came ſeaſonably, and
bound up the Wound, and ſtopt
the bleeding.</p>
            <p>After a quarter of an Hours
reſt, I got a Horſe-back again;
the other part of our Horſe had
beaten the Enemy back to <hi>Cawood,</hi>
the ſame way they came firſt to
us.</p>
            <p>Thus by the goodneſse of God,
our paſſage was made clear;
ſome went over the Ferry after
my Father, I my ſelf with others
went through the <hi>Levels</hi> to <hi>Hull,</hi>
but it proved a very troubleſome
and dangerous paſſage, being
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52907:37"/>
often interrupted by the Enemy,
ſometimes in our Front, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in our Reer.</p>
            <p>I had been twenty Hours on
Horſeback, after I was ſhot,
without any reſt or refreſhment,
and as many Hours before. And
as a further Affliction, my
<note n="*" place="margin">Duck. of <hi>Buck.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Daughter,</hi> not above five Years
old, being carried before her
Maid, endured all this Retreat
a Horſeback; but Nature not
being able to hold out any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
ſhe fell into frequent Swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and in appearance was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to expire her laſt.</p>
            <p>Having now paſt the <hi>Trent,</hi>
and ſeeing a Houſe not far off,
I ſent her with her Maid only
thither, with little hopes of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her any more alive, though
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52907:37"/>
I intended the next Day to ſend
a Ship from <hi>Hull</hi> for her.</p>
            <p>I went on to <hi>Barton,</hi> having
ſent before to have a Ship rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
againſt my coming thither.
Here I lay down to take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reſt, if it were poſſible to
find any in a Body ſo full of
pain, and a Mind yet fuller of
anxiety and trouble. Though I
muſt acknowledge it as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
goodneſs of God, that my
Spirit was nothing at all diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
from doing ſtill that which
I thought to be my Duty.</p>
            <p>I had not reſted a quarter of
an Hour, before the Enemy
came cloſe to the Town. I had
now not above a hundred Horſe
with me, we went to the Ship,
where under the Security of her
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52907:38"/>
Ordinance we got all our Men
and Horſe aboard; and croſſing
<hi>Humber,</hi> we arriv'd at <hi>Hull,</hi> our
Men faint and tired. I my ſelf
had loſt all, even to my Shirt,
for my Cloaths were made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to wear with Rents and Blood.
Preſently after my coming to
<hi>Hull,</hi> I ſent a Ship for my <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
who was brought the next
Day to the Town, pretty well
recovered of her long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Journey.</p>
            <p>Not many Days after the Earl
of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> ſent my <hi>Wife</hi> back
again in his Coach, with ſome
Horſe to guard her; which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
act of his gain'd him more
Reputation, than he could have
got by detaining a Lady Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
upon ſuch Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52907:38"/>
Many of our Men, who were
diſperſed in this long Retreat,
came hither again to us. Our
firſt Buſineſs was to raiſe new
Forces, and in a ſhort time we
had about 1500 Foot, and 700
Horſe.</p>
            <p>The Town being little, I was
ſent to <hi>Beverly,</hi> with the Horſe,
and 600 Foot, but my Lord of
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> now looking upon us
as inconſiderable, was marched
into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> with his whole
Army, leaving ſome few Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
He took in <hi>Gainsbrough,</hi>
and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and intended <hi>Boſton,</hi>
which was the Key of the <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
Counties;</hi> for his Orders,
which I have ſeen, were to go
into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and block up <hi>London</hi>
on that ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:52907:39"/>
Having laid a great while ſtill,
and being now ſtrong enough
for thoſe Forces which remain'd
in the Country, we ſent out a
good Party to make an Attempt
upon <hi>Stanford-Bridge,</hi> near <hi>York,</hi>
but the Enemy upon the allarm
fled thither, which put them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in ſuch a fear, that they ſent
earneſtly to my Lord of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi>
to deſire him to return, or
the Country would again be loſt.
Upon this he returned again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>York-ſhire,</hi> and not long after
came to beſiege <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I lay at <hi>Beverly</hi> in the way
of his March, and finding we
were not able to defend ſuch an
open place againſt an Army, I
deſired Orders from my Father
to retire back to <hi>Hull:</hi> But the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52907:39"/>
Committee there had more mind
of raiſing Money, than to take
care of the Soldiers; and yet theſe
Men had the greateſt ſhare in
Command at this time, and
would not let any Orders be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for our Retreat; nor was it
fit for us to return without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>The Enemy marched with
his whole Army towards us:
Retreat we muſt not; keep the
Town we could not. So, to
make our Retreat more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and uſeful, I drew out all
the Horſe and Dragoons towards
the Enemy; and ſtood drawn
up by a Wood ſide all that
Night.</p>
            <p>Next Morning by Day, our
Scouts and theirs fired on one
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52907:40"/>
another. They marched on
with their whole Body, which
was about 4000 Horſe, and
12000 Foot. We ſtood till
they were come very near to us.
I then drew off; having given
direction before for the Foot to
March away towards <hi>Hull,</hi> and
thinking to make good the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
with the Horſe.</p>
            <p>The Enemy with a good Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
came up in our Reer; the
Lanes being narrow we made
good ſhift with them, till we
got into <hi>Beverley,</hi> and ſhut
the Gate, which we had ſcarce
time to do, they being ſo cloſe
to us.</p>
            <p>In this buſineſs we loſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<hi>Layton,</hi> and not above two
more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:52907:40"/>
The Enemy not knowing
what Forces we had in the
Town, ſtay'd till the reſt of the
Army came up, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Mile behind. This gave
our Foot ſome advantage in their
Retreat, it being five Miles to <hi>Hull,</hi>
and the way on narrow Banks.
I ſent the Horſe by <hi>Cottingham,</hi> a
more open Road, who got well
thither; they overtook the Foot,
and made good their Retreat,
till we got to a little Bridge two
Miles from <hi>Hull,</hi> where we made
a ſtand: The Enemy followed
cloſe: Our Men gave them a
good Volley of Shot, which
made them draw back, and they
advanced no further.</p>
            <p>So leaving a ſmall Guard at
the Bridge, we got ſafe to <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52907:41"/>
Thus not only for want of
Military Skill in the Gentlemen
of the Committee, but to ſay no
more, for want of good Nature,
we were expos'd to this trouble
and danger.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> now
laid Siege to <hi>Hull,</hi> but at a great
diſtance, for the Sluces were let
open and drowned the Land for
two Miles about the Town.</p>
            <p>Yet upon a Bank, which was
the Highway, he approached ſo
near as to ſhoot Cannon Shot
at random into the Town, and
for the moſt part hot Bullets,
but by the Diligence and Care of
the Governour, who cauſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Inhabitant to watch his own
Houſe, the Danger was prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:52907:41"/>
Our Horſe was now uſeleſs,
and many dyed every Day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing but ſalt Water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Town. I was therefore
ſent over with the Horſe into
<hi>Lincoln-ſhire</hi> to join with the Earl
of <hi>Mancheſter</hi>'s Forces, which
were then Commanded by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us at our Landing with his
Troops.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Henderſon</hi> lay within
three or four Miles of this Place,
with 5000 Men, to prevent our
Conjunction, but durſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it. He marched three or
four Days near unto us, but for
want of good Intelligence, we
did not know ſo much. For I
altogether truſted to the Care of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52907:42"/>
our new Friends, being a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Horncaſtle</hi> one Morning
he fell upon our out Guards,<note place="margin">Winsby, <hi>or</hi> Horncaſtle.</note>
who being but newly raiſed in
that Country, fled towards <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi>
without giving any Allarm
to our Quarters, that lay diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and ſecure.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Henderſon</hi> marching
ſlowly with his Army, gave the
Allarm to ſome of our out Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which was ſoon taken in all
the reſt. Yet we were in ſome
diſorder before we could get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any conſiderable Body. My
Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> with his Horſe,
and my Dragoons, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Collonel <hi>Morgan,</hi> brought
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52907:42"/>
up the Reer, and after ſome
Skirmiſhes, we lodg'd that Night
in the Field.</p>
            <p>The next Day the Earl of
<hi>Mancheſter</hi> came to us with his
Foot, the Day following we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
toward the Enemy, and
chuſing a convenient Ground to
fight on, we drew up the Army
there. The Enemy did ſo on
the ſide of another Hill cloſe by,
having a little Plain betwixt us.
Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwel</hi> had
the Van, I the reſerve of Horſe,
my Lord <hi>Mancheſter</hi> all the
Foot.</p>
            <p>After we had faced one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a good while, the Forlorn
Hopes began the Fight, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Bodies met on the Plain,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52907:43"/>
where the Fight was hot for half
an Hour, but then they were
forced to a Rout, 200 kill'd,
and many taken Priſoners.</p>
            <p>This was the iſſue of <hi>Hornca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>
Fight, or as ſome call it,
<hi>Winsby</hi> Fight.</p>
            <p>At the ſame inſtant we heard
great ſhooting of Ordinance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Hull,</hi> which was a Sally
my <hi>Father</hi> made out of the Town
upon my Lord of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s
Trenches, who drew out moſt
part of his Army to relieve them:
But our Men charged ſo reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they poſſeſs'd themſelves
of the Canon, and purſuing
their Advantage, put the Enemy
to a total Rout, upon which he
raiſed the Siege, and returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52907:43"/>
Theſe two Defeats together,
the one falling heavy upon the
Horſe, the other upon the Foot,
kept the Enemy all that Winter
from attempting any thing; and
we, after the taking of <hi>Lincoln,</hi>
ſetled our ſelves in Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>In the coldeſt Seaſon of the
Year I was commanded by the
Parliament to go and raiſe the
Siege at <hi>Nantwich,</hi> which the Lord
<hi>Byron,</hi> with the <hi>Iriſh Army,</hi> had
reduced to great Extremity. I
was the moſt unfit of all their
Forces, being ever the worſt Paid,
my Men ſickly and almoſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
I deſir'd the Parliament
that they would be pleas'd to
ſupply theſe Wants, not excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52907:44"/>
my ſelf, as ſome did, who
had no will to ſtir, though well
enough accommodated.</p>
            <p>The Parliament's anſwer was
a poſitive direction to March, for
it would admit of no delay.
But foreſeeing I ſhould have ſuch
a return to my Deſires, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the neceſſity of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I had upon my own Credit
got ſo much Cloath as Cloathed
1500 Men, and all were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to March when theſe Orders
came to me.</p>
            <p>The twenty ninth of <hi>December</hi>
we ſet forward from <hi>Falkingham</hi>
in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> with 1800 Horſe,
and 500 Drag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oons, and power
to call the Regiments of Foot in
<hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> to make
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52907:44"/>
up the Body of the Army, which
I found was not a little trouble
when I came to <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> for
ſome were thirty, ſome forty
Miles diſtant, beſides the diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of ſome of their <hi>Collonels,</hi>
who went as their particular Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Intereſt ſway'd them.</p>
            <p>But finding more readineſs in
the inferior Officers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Soldiers, I got up in a few
Days near 3000 Foot.</p>
            <p>With this Army we marched
to <hi>Nantwich,</hi> which was at the
point of Surrendring. When
we came within a Days March,
I had Intelligence the Lord <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
had drawn off his Siege, and
intended to meet us in the Field.
I put my Men into the Order in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52907:45"/>
which I intended to Fight, and
continued my March till we
came within three Miles of the
Town.</p>
            <p>There was a Paſs kept with
about 250 Men: I ſent Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Morgan</hi> with his Dragoons,
who beat them off, in which his
Brother was ſlain. The <hi>Major,</hi>
who commanded the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with ſome others, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Priſoner.</p>
            <p>We marched on till we came
within Cannon ſhot of their
Works, where half of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was drawn up. And we
were inform'd, that the River
which runs through the Town,
being raiſed with the melting of
the Snow, hinder'd thoſe that lay
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52907:45"/>
on the other ſide of the Town
from joining with them.</p>
            <p>We call'd a Council of War,
wherein it was debated, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we ſhould attempt thoſe in
their Works, being divided from
the reſt of the Army, or march
into the Town and relieve them,
and by the increaſe of our Force
be better able the next day to
encounter them.</p>
            <p>This laſt was reſolv'd on,
and making way with Pioneers
through the Hedges, we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to the Town; but after
we had gone a little way, word
came that the Enemy was in the
Reer. We faced about with two
Regiments, and my own Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Horſe, commanded
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52907:46"/>
by Major <hi>Rokeby,</hi> and reliev'd
thoſe that were engaged, and ſo
the Fight began on all ſides.</p>
            <p>Theſe that fell on our Reer,
were that part of their Army
that lay on the other ſide of
the Town, who had paſt the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Thoſe who were drawn
up under their Works, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Van, which was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to the Town. Thus was
the Battel divided, there being a
quarter of a Mile betwixt us, in
the Diviſion that firſt engag'd.
Our Foot at the beginning gave
a little Ground, but our Horſe
recover'd this, by beating the
Enemies Horſe out of the Lanes
that flanked our Foot, which did
ſo encourage our Men, that they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52907:46"/>
regain'd their Ground on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and made them retreat
from Hedge to Hedge, 'till at
length they were forced to fly
to their Works.</p>
            <p>Their Horſe retreated in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Order, towards <hi>Cheſter,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much Loſs. Our other
Wing being aſſiſted from the
Town, who ſally'd out with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight hundred Musketeers,
beat the Enemy back into the
ſame Works. We preſently ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
them, and being in
great Diſorder and Confuſion,
they ſoon yielded themſelves
Priſoners, with all their chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
Arms, Colours and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:52907:47"/>
Thus, by the Mercy of God,
was this Victory obtain'd, being
the more ſignal, in that we were
not to deal with young Soldiers,
but with Men of great Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and an Army which had
ever been victorious.</p>
            <p>After this we took in ſeveral
<hi>Garriſons</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire; Latham</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> held out, which
was beſieg'd by the Forces of
that County, but afterward the
Siege was rais'd by Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſpent three or four
Months in this Expedition, my
<hi>Father</hi> commanded me back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>York-ſhire,</hi> that by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of our Forces, he might
be abler to take the Field. We
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52907:47"/>
met about <hi>Ferry-bridge,</hi> he being
come out of <hi>Hull</hi> thither, with
intent to fall upon the Enemies
Garriſon at <hi>Selby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I receiv'd at this time ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Command from the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
to march immediately
with my Horſe and Dragoons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> to join with
the <hi>Scots Army.</hi> The Earl of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi>
who was then at <hi>Durham</hi>
being much ſtronger in Horſe
than they, for want of which they
could not advance: But it being
reſolv'd within a Day or two to
ſtorm <hi>Selby,</hi> I ſtay'd 'till that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
was over, which proved as
effectual for the relief of the <hi>Scots
Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:52907:48"/>
The Governour of <hi>York,</hi> Coll.
<hi>Bellaſis,</hi> lay in <hi>Selby</hi> with 2000
Men. We drew our Horſe and
Foot cloſe to the Town, Sir <hi>John
Meldrum</hi> led on the Foot, which
had their ſeveral Poſts appointed
them, where they ſhould ſtorm.
I with the Horſe ready to ſecond
them. The Enemy within de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
themſelves ſtoutly a good
while. Our Men at length beat
them from the Line, but could
not advance further becauſe of the
Horſe within. I got a Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
open, which let us in betwixt
the Houſes and the River; here
we had an encounter with their
Horſe: After one Charge, they
fled over a Bridge of Boats to
<hi>York;</hi> their Horſe came up, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52907:48"/>
charged us again, where my
Horſe was overthrown, I being
ſingle a little before my Men,
who preſently reliev'd me, and
forced the Enemy back. They
retreated alſo to <hi>York.</hi> In this
Charge we took Coll. <hi>Bellaſis</hi>
Governour of <hi>York.</hi> By this
time the Foot had entred the
Town, and had taken many
Priſoners. This good Succeſs
of ours put them into great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
and Fear at <hi>York;</hi> ſo
that they ſpeedily ſent to the
Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to haſte back
thither, believing we would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
attempt them.</p>
            <p>This News ſuddenly call'd
him back, leaving the <hi>Scots,</hi> who
with Cold, and often Allarms,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52907:49"/>
were reduced to great Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but now they advance after
him.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> gets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>York;</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> join with my
Father at <hi>Wetherby,</hi> altogether
made 16000 Foot, and 4000
Horſe. They march on to
<hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Siege of <hi>York</hi> it was
thought neceſſary to have more
Men, the Town being large in
compaſs, and ſtrongly mann'd.
The Earl of <hi>Craford, Lindſey,</hi>
and my <hi>Self</hi> were ſent to the
Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> to deſire him
to join with us in the Siege, to
which he willingly conſented,
bringing an addition of 6000
Foot, and 3000 Horſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:52907:49"/>
Now the Army had three
Generals, <hi>Leſly, Mancheſter,</hi> and
<hi>Fairfax,</hi> who lay apart in three
ſeveral Quarters before the
Town, but the North ſide ſtill
remain'd open.</p>
            <p>Some time was ſpent here
without any conſiderable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till in my Lord of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>'s
Quarters, Approaches were
made to St. <hi>Marry</hi>'s Tower, and
they ſoon came to <hi>mine</hi> it. Coll.
<hi>Crayford,</hi> a Scotchman, who
commanded that Quarter, ſprung
the <hi>Mine,</hi> being ambitious to
have the Honour alone of it,
without acquainting the other
two Generals, for their Advice,
and Concurrence, which prov'd
very prejudicial, for having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
his Party againſt the whole
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52907:50"/>
Strength of the Town, without
more Forces to ſecond him, he
was repulſed with the loſs of
three hundred Men; for which
he had ſurely been call'd to an
Account, but eſcaped the better
by reaſon of this <hi>Triumviral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> came
to relieve the Town. We rais'd
the Siege. <hi>Heſſey Moore</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the Randezvous. The
whole Army drew thither. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Mile from thence lay the
<hi>Prince,</hi> the River <hi>Ouſe</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us, which he that night
paſt over at <hi>Popleton.</hi> The next
day he drew his Army into the
ſame <hi>Moore,</hi> which being now
joined with my Lord of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtles</hi>
Army, made about 23
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52907:50"/>
or 24000 Men, We ſomething
more.</p>
            <p>We were divided in our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
what to do. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>
were for <hi>Fighting;</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> for
<hi>Retreating,</hi> to gain (as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd)
both Time, and Place
of more Advantage.</p>
            <p>This being reſolv'd on, we
marched away to <hi>Tadcaſter,</hi>
which made the Enemy advance
the faſter.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwell,
Leſley,</hi> and my <hi>Self</hi> were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to bring up the Reer. We
ſent word to the Generals of the
neceſſity of making a ſtand, or
elſe the Enemy, having this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
might put us in ſome
diſorder. But by the advantage
of the Ground we were on, we
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52907:51"/>
hoped to make it good till they
came back to us, which they
did.</p>
            <p>The Place was <hi>Marſton</hi> Fields,
which afterwards gave the name
to this Battel.</p>
            <p>Here we drew up our Army.
The Enemy was drawn up in
Battalia on the <hi>Moore</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us.</p>
            <p>The day being moſt part
ſpent in Preparations, We now
began to deſcend towards them.
Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwell</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the left Wing of the
Horſe, and ſeconded by Major
General <hi>Leſley;</hi> I had the right
Wing, with ſome <hi>Scots</hi> Horſe,
and <hi>Lances</hi> for my Reſerves. The
three Generals were with the
Foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52907:51"/>
Our left Wing firſt charged
the Enemies right Wing, which
was perform'd for a while with
much Reſolution on both ſides,
but the Enemy at length was
put to the worſt.</p>
            <p>Our right Wing had not all
ſo good ſucceſs, by reaſon of
the Furzes and Ditches we were
to paſs over before we could get
to the Enemy, which put us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great diſorder.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding I drew up a
Body of 400 Horſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Intervals of Horſe in
this Wing only, were lined with
Musketteers, who did us much
hurt with their Shot, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to charge them. We
were a long time engag'd one
within another; but at laſt we rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52907:52"/>
that part of their Wing which
we charged, and purſued them
a good way towards <hi>York.</hi> My
ſelf only return'd preſently, to
get to the Men I left behind me.
But that part of the Enemy
which ſtood, perceiving the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
they were in, had charged
and routed them before I could
get to them: So that the good
Succeſs we had at the firſt was
eclipſed by this bad Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Our other Wing and moſt
of the Foot went on proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
'till they had cleared the
Field.</p>
            <p>I muſt ever remember with
Thankfulneſs the Goodneſs
of God to me this day; for
having charged through the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52907:52"/>
and my Men going after
the Purſuit, and returning back
to go to my other Troops, I
was got in among the Enemy,
who ſtood up and down the
Field in ſeveral Bodies of Horſe,
ſo taking the Signal out of my
Hat, I paſt through them for
one of their own Commanders,
and got to my Lord of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>'s
Horſe, in the other
Wing; only with a Cut in my
Cheek, which was given me
in the firſt Charge, and a ſhot
which my Horſe receiv'd.</p>
            <p>In this Charge many of my
Officers and Soldiers were hurt
and ſlain: The <hi>Captain</hi> of my
own Troop was ſhot in the
Arm, my <hi>Cornet</hi> had both his
Hands cut, ſo as render'd him
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52907:53"/>
ever after unſerviceable. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Micklethwait,</hi> an honeſt ſtout
Gentlemen, was ſlain: And
ſcarce any Officer who was in
this Charge but receiv'd a Hurt.
Coll. <hi>Lambert,</hi> who ſhould have
ſeconded me, but could not get

place. Major <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who was
Major to his Regiment, had at

dyed at <hi>York,</hi> after he had been
abroad again, and in good hopes
of recovery.</p>
            <p>But that which neareſt of all

In this Charge as many were
hurt and kill'd as in the whole
Army beſides.</p>
            <p>On the Enemy's part there
were above 4000 ſlain, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> returned into

            <head>SHORT
MEMORIALS
OF
Some things to be cleared
during my Command in
the Army.</head>
            <p>BY the Grace and Aſſiſtance
of God, I ſhall truly ſet
down the Grounds of my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
during this <hi>unhappy War,</hi> and
eſpecially of thoſe Actions which
ſeem'd to the World moſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52907:56"/>
My firſt engaging in the ſad
Calamities of the War, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Year 1641, when the
general Diſtemper of the three
Kingdoms, I mean the Difference
betwixt the King and Parliament
had kindled ſuch a Flame even
in the Heart of the State, that
before a Remedy could be found,
the whole Body was almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs ſay, my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was for the Parliament, as
the King and Kingdoms great
and ſafeſt Council: As others
were averſe to Parliaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they did not go high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for Prerogative.</p>
            <p>Upon this Diviſion, different
Powers were ſet up: The <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Array</hi> for the King, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52907:56"/>
the <hi>Militia</hi> for the Parliament.
But thoſe of the Array exceeded
their Commiſſion in oppreſſing
many honeſt People, whom, by
way of Reproach, they called
<hi>Roundheads,</hi> who for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Eſtates, and Intereſt, were
a very conſiderable part of the
Country; which occaſion'd them
to take up Arms in their own
defence, and it was afterward
confirm'd by Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>My Father, being yet at his
Houſe at <hi>Denton,</hi> where I then
waited on him, had notice from
his Friends, that it was intended
he ſhould be ſent for as a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to <hi>York:</hi> He reſolved not to
ſtir from his own Houſe, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52907:57"/>
conſcious to himſelf of any
thing to deſerve Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>The Country ſuffering daily
more and more, many came and
intreated him to join with them
in defence of themſelves and
Country, which was extremely
oppreſſed by thoſe of the Array
(who after had the Name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers)
and he being alſo much
importun'd by thoſe about him,
ſeeing his Neighbours in this
Diſtreſs, reſolv'd to run the ſame
Hazard with them.</p>
            <p>Then did the Parliament grant
a Commiſſion to him to be <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
of the Forces in the North;
my ſelf alſo having a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
under him to be General of
the Horſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:52907:57"/>
It is not my intention in this
place to relate the ſervices done
in this Cauſe of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For I am rather deſirous
to clear my Actions, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
them; and therefore I ſhall
ſay no more of this three years
War in the <hi>North<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> there being
nothing (I thank God) in all
that time to be objected againſt
me in particular: But I ſhall
ſay ſomething how I came to be
engaged in the <hi>South.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some years had been ſpent in
thoſe Parts, in a lingring War
betwixt the King and Parliament,
and ſeveral Battels ſo equally
fought, that it could ſcarce be
known on which ſide the buſineſs
in diſpute would be determin'd:
Though it muſt be confeſt that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52907:58"/>
the Parliaments Army was under
the Command of a very noble
and gallant Perſon, the <hi>Earl</hi> of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> yet they found that time
and delay gain'd more advantage
againſt them, and their Affairs,
than Force had done. They
therefore reſolv'd to make a
change in the Conſtitution of
their Armies, hoping by it to
find a change alſo in their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which was then ſomething
in a declining condition. In this
diſtemper of things, the Army
was new-modell'd, and a new
<hi>General</hi> propos'd to Command
it: And by Votes of the two
Houſes of Parliament I was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
though moſt unfit, and
ſo far from deſiring it, that had
not ſo great an Authority (which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52907:58"/>
was then unſeperated from the
Royal Intereſt) Commanded
my Obedience, and had I not
been urged by the Perſwaſion
of my neareſt Friends, I ſhould
have refus'd ſo great a Charge:
But whether it was from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
facility in me, that betrai'd
my Modeſty, or the powerful
hand of God, which all things
muſt obey, I was induced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Command.</p>
            <p>Then was I immediately vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Parliament to come
to <hi>London,</hi> and take my Charge,
though not fully recovered of a
dangerous Wound which I had
received a little before at <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſley,</hi>
and which I believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the miraculous hand of God,
had prov'd mortal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52907:59"/>
But here (alas) when I bring
to mind the ſad conſequences
that crafty and deſigning Men
have brought to paſs ſince thoſe
firſt innocent Undertakings, I am
ready to let go that confidence
I once had with God, when I
could ſay with <hi>Job, Till I die I
will not remove my integrity from
me,</hi> nor <hi>ſhall my Heart reproach
me ſo long as I live:</hi> But I am
now more fit to take up his
complaint, and ſay, <hi>Why did I
not die? why did I not give up
the Ghoſt when my Life was on
the confines of the Grave?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God having been pleas'd thus
to give me my Life for a Prey,
I took my Journey <hi>Southward,</hi>
hoping it might be ſome ways
ſerviceable to the Publick: But
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52907:59"/>
when I came thither, had it not
been in the ſimplicity of my
Heart, I could not have ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my ſelf under the frowns and
diſpleaſures of thoſe who were
diſguſted with theſe alterations,
in which many of them were
much concern'd: And therefore
they ſought by all means to
obſtruct my proceedings in this
new Charge; though they could
not prevent what the neceſſity
of Affairs preſt moſt to do,
which was to march ſpeedily
out with the Army; yet were we
by them made ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for want of fit and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
accommodations, as it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeem'd that we were ſent
to be deſtroy'd, than to do any
ſervice to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:52907:60"/>
Surely then if we had had no
other end but Self-intereſt, this
might have diſcouraged us: But
it wrought no ſuch Effect on me,
but rather gave me the more
hopes of future ſucceſs, as hapned
to the Parliament's great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
But if any ill Uſe hath
been made of ſuch Mercies, let
the Mercies be acknowledged
from God, but the abuſers of
them receive their due reward
of ſhame and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Being thus led on by good
Succeſs, and clear intention of
publick Good, ſome of us could
not diſcern the Serpent which was
hid under the leaves of ſo good
Fortune, nor believe the fruits
of our hopes would prove as
Cockatrice Eggs, from whence ſo
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52907:60"/>
miſchievous a Brood ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſpring.</p>
            <p>But how ill deſerving ſoever
we were, it pleas'd God ſtill
to give the Army ſuch ſucceſs
in the Years of 1645 and 1646,
that there remain'd in <hi>England</hi>
neither Army not Fortreſs to
oppoſe the Parliament in ſetling
the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This Mercy was ſoon clouded
with abominable Hypocriſy and
Deceit, even in thoſe Men who
had been inſtrumental in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this War to a concluſion.</p>
            <p>Here was the vertical Point on
which the Army's Honour and
Reputation turn'd into Reproach
and Scandal. Here the Power
of the Army I once had, was
uſurped by the <hi>Agitators,</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52907:61"/>
of Confuſion and Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
            <p>My Commiſſion as General
oblig'd me to act with Councel;
but the arbitrary and unlimited
Power of this Councel would
act without a General: And all
I could do was ineffectual to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them; eſpecially when the
Parliament it ſelf became divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>At this time the Pay was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
from the Army, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
their Diſtempers; then
followed Free Quarter, and that
wrought a general Diſcontent
through the whole Nation, which
gave theſe factious <hi>Agitators</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to carry on their Deſign of
raiſing their own Fortunes upon
the Publick ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:52907:61"/>
I was much troubled to ſee
things in this Condition, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſired to be a Sufferer than
a Commander: But before I laid
down my Commiſſion, I thought
fit to conſult ſome Friends, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than gratify my private
Reaſon and Deſires, eſpecially
having receiv'd it from a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority, which might
juſtly expect to have notice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I laid it down.</p>
            <p>This was the Cauſe of my
continuing in the Army longer
than I would have done, which
did indeed preſerve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for ſome time from thoſe
Violences that it afterwards ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
from theſe Diſturbers.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now deſcend to ſome
particulars of their Agitations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:52907:62"/>
The firſt time I took notice
of them, was at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> by
the Soldiers meeting to frame a
Petition to the Parliament about
their Arrears: The thing ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
juſt; but not liking the way,
I ſpake with ſome Officers, who
were principally engaged in it,
and got it ſuppreſs'd for that
time. But this was only as the
cutting off a <hi>Hydra</hi>'s Head; for
they began again, not ſo near
the Head-Quarters, but in more
remote Corners of the Army;
ſo that before I could prevent
it, they preſented it to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
At which they were
highly diſpleas'd.</p>
            <p>They now fell into Differences,
the conſequence of which did
not only prove fatal to the <hi>King,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:52907:62"/>
but deſtructive to themſelves:
The one ſtriving to uphold their
Authority; the other, who had
a Spirit of Unſettlement, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
themſelves from the Ruine
they fear'd.</p>
            <p>This, with a natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to change, I believe created
thoughts of new Government,
which in time attain'd the Name
of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> but never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to the Perfection of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſometimes <hi>Democratical,</hi> then
<hi>Oligarchical;</hi> laſtly, <hi>Anarchical:</hi>
And indeed all the ways of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to it, ſeem'd nothing
but Confuſion. For now the
Officers of the Army were plac'd
and diſplac'd at the will of the
new Agitators; and Violence ſo
prevail'd, that it was above my
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52907:63"/>
Power to reſtrain it. This made
me have recourſe to my Friends,
to get me a Diſcharge of my
Command; and ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament met and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
about it, but none would
undertake to move it to the
Houſe, as Affairs then ſtood,
believing ſuch a Motion would
be unpleaſing to them.</p>
            <p>This was the Anſwer I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from them, and that I
ſhould ſatisfy my ſelf, for it
would be the Parliament's care to
compoſe all things for the Good
and Settlement of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Theſe hopes did a little ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
my Spirit, but could not
Ballance the Grief and Trouble
I had, that I could not get my
Diſcharge: So that if you find
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52907:63"/>
me carried on with this Stream,
I can truly ſay, it was by the
Violence of it, rather than my
own Conſent.</p>
            <p>The Army got this Power and
Strength by Correſpondence with
ſome in Parliament, who found
it afterwards to their own Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The Army marcht nearer
<hi>London;</hi> and at <hi>Windſor,</hi> after
two days debate in a Council of
War, it was reſolv'd to remove
all out of the Houſe, whom
they conceiv'd did obſtruct (as
they call'd it) the Publick Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I was preſt to uſe all Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in this March; but here I
reſolv'd to uſe a reſtrictive Power,
where I had not a Perſuaſive:
And when the Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52907:64"/>
and others, did urge me
to ſign Orders for marching, I
ſtill delay'd it, as ever dreading
the Conſequences of breaking
Parliaments, and at a time when
the Kingdom was falling into a
new War, which was ſo near,
that my delaying three or four
days giving out Orders, divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Humour of the Army,
from being Stateſmen, to their
more proper Duty as Soldiers.</p>
            <p>Then did Collonel <hi>Poyer</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
in <hi>Wales;</hi> great Forces did
riſe with my Lord <hi>Goring</hi> in
<hi>Kent;</hi> and Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> came
into <hi>England,</hi> almoſt at the ſame
time with a Powerful Army of
<hi>Scots;</hi> all which ſet out work
enough that Summer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:52907:64"/>
This I write to ſhew how by
Providence a few days of delay
ſecur'd the Parliament above a
Year from the Violence which
ſoon after was offered them.</p>
            <p>I might here mention thoſe
great and difficult Actions the
Army perform'd that Year,<note place="margin">In <hi>Rent,</hi> &amp;c.</note> which
were deſign'd for the Good of
the Kingdom; but that Factious
Party growing more Inſolent, as
Succeſs made them more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
I ſhall forbear to relate
them, which otherwiſe would
have deſerv'd a better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
than in Modeſty were fit
for me to give.</p>
            <p>I ſhall rather puniſh my ſelf
with the continuance of this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Irregularities of the
Army. But I muſt not forget
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52907:65"/>
one thing of very great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
in the after Changes,
which ſhould have been inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the mentioning of this
Second War; The King's remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
from <hi>Holmby,</hi> the ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
whereof fill my Heart
with Grief in the remembrance
of them, as they did then with
Care how to prevent them.</p>
            <p>Being at <hi>Saffron-Walden</hi> in <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi>
I had notice that <hi>Cornet Joyce,</hi>
an <hi>Arch-Agitator,</hi> who Quarter'd
about <hi>Oxford,</hi> had ſeized on the
King's Perſon, removed his
Guards, and given ſuch a Check
to the Commiſſioners of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who were ordered there
to attend His Majeſty, that they
refuſed to act any further on their
Commiſſion, being ſo unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
interrupted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:52907:65"/>
So ſoon as I heard of it, I
immediately ſent away two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Horſe, Commanded
by Colonel <hi>Whaley</hi> to remove
this Force, and to ſet all things
again in their due Courſe and
Order. But before he came to
<hi>Holmby,</hi> the King was advanced
two or three Miles on his way
to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> attended by <hi>Joyce,</hi>
where Colonel <hi>Whaley</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King, he was ſent by the
General to let him know how
much he was troubled at thoſe
great Inſolencies that had been
committed ſo near his Perſon;
and as he had not the leaſt
knowledge of them before they
were done, ſo he had omitted
no time in ſeeking to remove
that Force, which he had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52907:66"/>
from me to ſee done: And
therefore he deſired His Majeſty
that he would be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again to <hi>Holmby,</hi> where all
things ſhould be ſettled again in
as much Order and Quietneſs
as they were before. And alſo he
deſired the Commiſſioners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume
their Charge, as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
had directed them, which
he was alſo to deſire them to
do from the General. But the
<hi>King refuſed to return,</hi> and the
Commiſſioners to Act; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Colonel <hi>Whaley</hi> urged them
to it, ſaying, He had an expreſs
Command to ſee all things well
ſettled again about His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
which could not be done,
but by His returning again to
<hi>Holmby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:52907:66"/>
The King ſaid poſitively, he
would not do it; ſo the Colonel
preſt him no more to it, having
indeed a ſpecial Direction from
me to uſe all Tenderneſs and
Reſpect, as was due to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
            <p>The King came that Night,
or the next, to Sir <hi>John Cutts</hi>'s
Houſe, near <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and the
next day I waited on His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
it being alſo my buſineſs to
perſuade his Return to <hi>Holmby,</hi>
but he was otherwiſe reſolv'd.</p>
            <p>I preſt the Commiſſioners al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to Act according to the Power
given them by the Parliament,
which they alſo refus'd to do:
So having ſpent the whole day
about this buſineſs, I return'd to
my Quarters; and as I took
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52907:67"/>
leave of the King, he ſaid to
me, <hi>Sir, I have as good Intereſt
in the Army as you;</hi> by which I
plainly ſaw the broken Reed he
lean'd on.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Agitators</hi> could change
into that Colour which ſerved
next to their ends; and had
brought the King into an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that the Army was for
him.</p>
            <p>That it might appear what
a real trouble this Act was to
me, though the Army was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
wholly infected with this
Humour of Agitation, I call'd
for a <hi>Council of War,</hi> to proceed
againſt <hi>Joyce</hi> for this high Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and breach of the Articles
of War, but the Officers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for fear of the diſtemper'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52907:67"/>
Soldiers, or rather (as I ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
a ſecret allowance of what
was done, made all my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
in this ineffectual. And
now no Puniſhment being able
to reach them; all Affairs were
ſteer'd after this Compaſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
King and his Party, in <hi>Hopes;</hi>
thoſe of the Parliament, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who kept to their <hi>Covenant
Intereſt,</hi> in <hi>Fears;</hi> ſo as for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Months all Publick Councils
were turn'd into private <hi>Junto</hi>'s,
which begot greater Emulations
and Jealouſies among them. So
that the Army would not truſt
the King any longer with the
Liberty he had, nor the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſuffer the Army to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
that which was more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their own Work, to Settle the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52907:68"/>
Kingdom in its juſt Rights and
Liberties; and the Army was as
Jealous that the Parliament would
not have care enough of their
Security.</p>
            <p>All things growing worſe and
worſe, made the King endeavour
to eſcape, which he did; but out
of a larger Confinement at
<hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> to a ſtraiter one
in the <hi>Iſle of Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Parliament treated
upon Propoſitions of Peace with
the King; but, alas, the envious
one ſowed Tares that could not
be rooted out, but by plucking
up the Corn alſo.</p>
            <p>The King was the Golden
Ball caſt before the two Parties,
the Parliament and the Army;
and the Conteſt grew ſo great,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52907:68"/>
that it muſt again have involv'd
the Kingdom in Blood; but the
Army having the greater Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
got the King again into their
Hands, notwithſtanding all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours
to hinder it.</p>
            <p>The Treaty was ſcarce ended
before the King was ſeized on by
the Hands of the ſame Perſons
that took him from <hi>Holmby;</hi>
ſoon after followed his Trial.</p>
            <p>To prepare a way to this
Work, this Agitating Council
did firſt intend to remove all out
of the Parliament who were like
to oppoſe them, and carried it
on with ſuch Secrecy, as I had
not the leaſt Intimation of it till
it was done, as ſome of the
Members of the Houſe can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
with whom I was at that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52907:69"/>
very time upon ſpecial Buſineſs,
when that Attempt was made by
Colonel <hi>Pride</hi> upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which I proteſt I never had
any knowledg of till it was done.
The Reaſon why it was ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
carried, that I ſhould have
no notice of it, was, becauſe I
always prevented thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
when I knew them.</p>
            <p>By this purging of the Houſe,
(as they call'd it) the Parliament
was brought into ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive
and languiſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that it could never again
recover that healthful Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which always kept the
Kingdom in its Strength, Life,
and Vigour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:52907:69"/>
This Way being made by the
Sword, the <hi>Trial of the King</hi> was
eaſier for them to accompliſh.</p>
            <p>My afflicted and troubled
Mind for it, and my earneſt
Endeavours to prevent it, will, I
hope, ſufficiently teſtify my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and abhorrence of the Fact:
And what will they not do to
the Shrubs, having cut down the
Cedar?</p>
            <p>After this, Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Capel,</hi> and others, were condemn'd
to Death.</p>
            <p>It is fit for me in this Place to
ſay ſomething for my own Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
about my Lord <hi>Capel,</hi>
Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George
Liſle,</hi> who were Priſoners at Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon the rendring of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:52907:70"/>
ſeeing ſome have queſtioned the
juſt Performance of thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>I laid Siege to the Town, and
made ſeveral Aſſaults: But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Forces within much
more numerous than thoſe I had
without, I was forced to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
courſe in blocking them up,
and, by cutting off all ſupplies,
to bring them to a Surrender;
which after four Months cloſe
Siege they were compelled to,
and that upon Mercy, being in
Number three or four thouſand
Men; and delivering upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
is to be underſtood that ſome
are to Suffer, the reſt to go Free.</p>
            <p>Immediately after our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Town, a Council
of War was called, and thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52907:70"/>
Perſons were Sentenced
to Die, the reſt to be Acquitted.</p>
            <p>This being ſo reſolved, I
thought fit notwithſtanding to
tranſmit the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Norwich,</hi> &amp;c. over to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
being the Civil Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Kingdom, conſiſting
then both of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and ſo moſt proper Judges
in their Caſe; who were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
for Eſtates and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
But Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and
Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> being mere Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of Fortune, and falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our hands by chance of War,
were Executed; and in this I did
nothing but according to my
Commiſſion, and the Truſt repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:52907:71"/>
But it may be objected I went
into the Court during the Trial;
to which I anſwer, it was at the
earneſt requeſt of my Lord <hi>Capel</hi>'s
Friends, who deſired me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
there what was meant by
ſurrendring to Mercy: Otherwiſe
I had not gone, being always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
with thoſe Courts.</p>
            <p>For this I need ſay no more,
ſeeing I may as well be queſtion'd
for the Articles of <hi>Briſtol, Oxford,
Exeter,</hi> or any other Action in
the War, as this.</p>
            <p>I have now related the moſt
remarkable Things that might be
alledged againſt me, during the
proſecution of the War.</p>
            <p>One thing more requires I
ſhould ſay ſomething to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conclude; that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52907:71"/>
               <hi>Papers</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi>
of the <hi>Army</hi> that came out in my
Name, and the Council of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
            <p>I ſay from the time they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their uſurped Authority at
<hi>Triplow</hi> Heath, I never gave my
free Conſent to any thing they
did: But being yet undiſcharged
of my Place, they ſet my Name
in way of courſe to all their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
whether I conſented or not:
And to ſuch failings are all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
ſubject. Under Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
Authority many injuries
have been done; ſo here hath a
General's Power been broken
and crumbled into a Levelling
Faction.</p>
            <p>Yet even this I hope all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Judges will interpret as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52907:72"/>
Force and Raviſhment of a good
Name, rather than a voluntary
Conſent, which might make me
equally Criminal with that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And if in a multitude
of Words, much more in a
multitude of Actions, there muſt
be ſome Tranſgreſſions; yet I
can truly ſay, they were never
deſignedly, or willfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by me.</p>
            <p>All the Power being got into
the Army, they cut up the root
of Kingly Government; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this were Engagements made
to aboliſh that Title. Then was
War declared againſt <hi>Scotland</hi> for
aſſiſting the King, and ſeveral
Leagues made with Foreign
Princes, to Confederate with
their new Government, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52907:72"/>
was now a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> againſt
the Kingly Power.</p>
            <p>All this I ſaw with grief and
ſorrow, and though I had as much
the Love of the Army as ever,
and was with great importunity
ſolicited by that remaining Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and Soldiers, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
my Command; and though
I might, ſo long as I acted their
Deſigns, have attained to what
height of Power, and other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
I pleas'd; yet by the
mercies and goodneſs of God, I
did, ſo long as I continued in
the Army, oppoſe all thoſe Ways
in their Councils, and when I
could do no more, I then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
their Actions: Though
I did not reſign my Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which I had from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52907:73"/>
till the remaining part
of it took it from me.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you the
Sum of the moſt conſiderable
Things, for which the World
may Cenſure me, during this
unhappy War; and I hope in all
my Weakneſs and Failings, there
ſhall not be found Crimes of that
Magnitude to make me be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with thoſe who have done
theſe Things through Ambition
and Diſſimulation.</p>
