         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>(Epiſcopal, Presbyterial,</hi> and <hi>Congregational,)</hi> that they

rendered it ſelf odious by its imperiouſneſſe and otherwiſe,
the conteſt remained betwixt the other two: whereof the
Presbyterian, being practiſed (in ſome things) in certain Reformed
States and Churches (who were partly conſtrained thereunto)
there being ſome hints of Scripture alſo that might be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
to look that way, Some other things withal concurring:
got place, either in the intereſts or affections, of a great part of the
Aſſembly, Parliament, City, and Miniſters in the Country.
Hereby alſo they were eyed the more by the Churches abroad
that were of that way, and had the opportunity to improve their
endeavours for their aſſiſtance. The <hi>Congregational way</hi> in the
mean time, though it wanted not Aſſertors very learned and
godly, and of great name in the Church, and had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58801:6"/>
of an amiable pattern of it in the new-Engliſh Plantations;
and withall, the daily acceſſe and addition of the moſt knowing
and conſcencious ſort of Profeſſors: Yet by reaſon of the former
diſadvantages, it was not rendered ſo conſiderable among the
Churches abroad, as to depart from <hi>received Principles,</hi> or neglect
to appear in the defence of the former, for conſideration of it.
Hereupon the <hi>Walachrian Claſſis</hi> in Holland (among others) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſollicited by the Presbyterian partie here for their aſſiſtance:
they appoint G. <hi>Apollonius,</hi> Paſtor of the Church at Middelburgh,
to take on him this province, and having according to his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
acquitted himſelf of that ſervice; in a Tractate intituled <hi>[A

Claſſis is added to the book, and publiſhed 1644. both in Latin

on the way of the Presbyterian Government was like to be
ſtrong; and fearing that the former baſis and foundations of it,
[viz. <hi>That the Government of the Church was to be by the Elders, and
they in equal povver. 2. That it is alvvaies convenient (if attainable)
and ſometimes neceſſarie, that Churches be aſſociated and act in combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

povver within their owne limits, ſo Churches under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of one Prince or State, have no abſolute or neceſſary dependance
on other Churches in point of Eccleſiaſtick Power and Government,</hi> &amp;c.]
Theſe grounds as was ſaid, being doubted whether defenſible:
the Author in the third Chapter of his diſcourſe which treates
<hi>[of the Viſible Inſtituted Church]</hi> betakes himſelf to a larger <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
and of all men (that I know) of the Presbyterian, and almoſt of

               </note>
that there is as it were a kind of Ambition who ſhould appear
firſt,<note place="margin">Miniſters of London,</note> in being the Authors or Owners of it: Though the truth is,
this conceit (for ſubſtance) hath been before all theſe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net

of in this: as firſt the Papiſts generally: alſo a few Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal

And it may be by ſome abſolute Royaliſts (for that ſpirit muſt needs

them being in conference about Church-government,<note place="margin">M. <hi>VV.</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of this Parliament.</note> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
indeed <hi>the Church of Rome to have abuſed its power that way:

on all occaſions, and which might have authority over, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

and might be maintained, as alſo Presbyterie, (if confined to a
particular Church, and not ſubjected to ſuperior Eccleſiaſtical
power, which was the moſt ancient way of it) without the
notion of one viſible Catholick Church; and might both conſiſt
together in a particular one. So that as neither <hi>Epiſcopacie</hi> nor

me to oppoſe either, if within the forementioned limits. My aim is
the plucking up of that root from whence ſprang the exorbitancy
of both, and what was worſe then either. And as I am not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

and Republique, when many ſingle ones are bound up
in one ſociall relation, as divers perſons into one family, ſeverall

when things are one in ſome <hi>hidden</hi> relation, that is not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

ſuch are all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> and of <hi>Abraham,</hi> all profeſſours of

outward, when the union of all parts is obvious and evident to
the eye and ſence, as the union of the members in the bodie of
man, or members of a ſociety when they are met, and act viſibly
together; as the City of London in Common Councell, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

            <p>4. There is a <hi>Collective</hi> or aggregative oneneſſe, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers

moreover a mutuall incorporation and inward dependance

though it be a ſingle thing, (either naturall or by way of relation)
is yet in regard of the wide ſpreading of its parts, called <hi>univerſall</hi>
catholicke and Generall: as we ſay the Kingdome of England in
generall or univerſall doth this or that, though it be but one ſingle
Kingdome, &amp;c. and in this ſence that which is called univerſall
may have an actual being and exiſtence.</p>

to that power that all men by vertue of the oneneſſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and oneneſſe of the Law of nature, have in order each to other.
As 1. to take care of, and do good to one another: to protect each
other from violence, &amp;c. 2. Properly Rective and <hi>Iuridical:</hi>
and this is either 1. <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> in ſome unuſuall caſes: as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man hath power of life and death, in caſe of his owne (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
unavoidable) peril of life. Or 2. <hi>Ordinary:</hi> which is that which
it is actually and conſtantly endued with, and which it is daily to
exerciſe as occaſion ſerves. And this againe is 1. <hi>Imperative,</hi> or
by way of command, and impoſition of truthes, or duties in the
name of Chriſt. 2. <hi>Coercive,</hi> and executive by cenſure: by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition

Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And thus far of the explication of the termes,<note place="margin">State of the queſt</note> now we come
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58801:8"/>
to the ſtating of the Queſtion. And 1. negatively, what is not
the queſtion. The doubt then is not 1. whether there be a
company of perſons in ſeveral, or in all parts of the World,
that <hi>diuiſim</hi> and in their ſeveral places do viſibly, outwardly,
and openly profeſſe (for ſubſtance) the ſame faith, ſeals, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Government, and ſo may be ſaid to be one company,
one ſociety, one congregation in Nature and Eſſence (i. e. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of the ſame Faith)</hi> as we ſay the <hi>Turke</hi> or <hi>Turkes</hi> are
one company of men, becauſe their profeſſion of <hi>Religion</hi> is
one: though thoſe of Conſtantinople and of Perſia have no
dependance one on another, either Civil or Religious in point
of Government. Nor 2. is it the Quaere whether the ſeveral
Companies or Churches of this Profeſſion as they are one in
Nature, ſo alſo in <hi>Spirit</hi> and affection, and thereupon in the
engagement of mutual care one of another, and to take notice
what doctines are diſperſed, what converſation uſed among the
Churches. Brethren of the ſame <hi>firſt</hi> Family are bound to do
this, though they be every one maſter in his owne houſe. Nor
3. Is it doubtful whether ſuch Churches may voluntarily as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſhall require, aſſociate together for mutual aſſiſtance, and
act (in many things) by common and joynt conſent, as it was at the
firſt in the Church of <hi>Geneva.</hi> This the <hi>Scripture</hi> and the light of
<hi>Nature</hi> dictates,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baynes</hi> Dioceſ. pag. 21.</note> even then when the ſame Scripture and light of
Nature reſerves entire and diſtinct liberties to the particulars, as

               <note place="margin">Declar. H. Com. about the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the Kings perſon.</note> And ſo in
the conjunction of the Apoſtles and Churches at Jeruſalem,
<hi>Acts 15.</hi> nothing was done there of particular Juriſdiction, as
the decreeing of Excommunication, or the like, to thoſe that
ſhould be refractory: this was left to the particular Churches.
Now to theſe two latter, and not to the point of Government
properly ſo called, belongs thoſe teſtimonies out of the Ancients,
alledged by <hi>Crakanthorp</hi> (to prove that all the Biſhops joyntly and
ſeverally are ſet over the whole Church in common,<note place="margin">Defenſio Eccleſ. Ang. cap. 28.</note> and not
the Pope onely): for theſe Teſtimonies expreſſe onely a <hi>generall</hi>
obligation of duty and charity: not of ſpecial <hi>office.</hi> 4. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it the ſcruple whether all or moſt of the Churches in the
world may not poſſibly become occaſionally one by their meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in a general Councel: though ſuch a thing never yet was,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58801:9"/>
nor perhaps ought to be, of which hereafter. Thus of the
firſt four termes: In regard of the laſt, viz. <hi>the Power of the Church;</hi>
the queſtion is not 1. whether an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> of Churches
leſſe or more, and eſpecially a general Counſel have not a power
more then barely conſultative, or by way of meer Counſel and
advice:<note place="margin">

Commiſſion reacheth, an <hi>Authoritative</hi> power, (at leaſt virtual)
from Chriſt to act.</p>
            <p>In all <hi>Facul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies</hi> there is a certain power given both by God and
man to the allowed Profeſſors of them, to give <hi>Authoritative,</hi>
not advice only, but directions and rules, to which the Conſcience
is bound to ſubmit, unleſſe ſpecial cauſe diſſwade us: and this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is the more <hi>Auguſt and ſolemn,</hi> though not <hi>greater,</hi> (or
more or leſſe vary not the kind) the greater the number is, and
the more publicke the manner of giving forth the precepts ſhall
bee. As for inſtance: an allowed <hi>Lawyer</hi> or <hi>Phyſician,</hi> have not
onely <hi>ability</hi> to give advice in point of eſtate or health, by vertue,
of their skill, (which others poſſibly may doe materially as well)
but have <hi>authoritie</hi> and legall power from God and man,<note place="margin">page 18.</note> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
direct, determine and preſcribe rules and waies to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in both; to which the perſon ought to be obedient that ſeeks
advice: and this the more; if it ſhall be done by an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of
Lawyers or Judges, or Colledge of Phyſitians by publick conſent
convened for that purpoſe: though neither the one, nor other have
power to compell the clyent or patient to follow their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor obtain they any new and ſuperiour power by being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered;
ſo in the affaires of the Church of God. In doubtfull caſes;

that is, the determinations of many of thoſe, who are appointed

is the acting of <hi>Officers,</hi> but not <hi>as</hi> Officers, (for ſuch they are only

Holy Ghoſt) <hi>Decree,</hi> and command; but did not impoſe any
ſuch <hi>penalty</hi> by authority of the Councel, upon the diſobedient

            <p>2. Neither is the queſtion properly, what power the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church may <hi>poſſibly</hi> have in unuſual and <hi>extraordinary</hi> caſe or
accident, and which in ordinary it cannot do, nor is the proper
ſubject of ſuch power, as we ſaw before in the inſtance of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

            <p>3. Yea further <hi>(ad hominem)</hi> in reſpect of the practiſe and

grant what is contended for) as what the <hi>parts</hi> of it have aſunder,

I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſhew the <hi>Novelty</hi> of it, and firſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

               <hi>They did ordain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Miniſters, admoniſh and excommunicate obſtinate offenders: held
Synods or meetings, wherein they determined the affairs of their own body:

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But in occaſions which concerned many Churches,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">they held that they ſhould be tranſacted in Synods and <hi>Councels:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>
and they did accordingly in ſuch meetings exerciſe ſuperior

            <p>Secondly, Their exerciſing the acts above mentioned in their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58801:10"/>
particular Churches, and their acting theſe things in Synods
were (it is certain) at ſome diſtance of time: and ſeeing the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
way of Government is mentioned <hi>first;</hi> it may well be, that
the latter came in as the diſcipline of Churches began to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and decline to WORLDLY POLICIE: which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this firſt age alſo, ſay the ſame<note n="*" place="margin">Cent Magd. ubi ſupra in principio cap. de Reg. Eccleſ.</note> Authors.</p>
            <p>3. It might be by <hi>Decree</hi> and judgement onely, not by actual
execution of ſuch things, as 1 Cor. 5. <hi>I haue determined that when
ye are gathered</hi> &amp;c. and John 4. 2. <hi>Chriſt baptized more Diſciples
then Iohn, though Chriſt himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Howſoever their practiſe in this (if it were at the ſame
time, and not after Diſcipline declined) muſt be expounded to
be conſiſtent with their other practiſe within themſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they owned entire, (and of right) Independent power from any
other Church or Churches. So that in ſuch united Synods or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
each Church might act its owne power, though in <hi>union</hi>
with other; and all act as ſo many ſeveral and diſtinct Churches
united; not as one <hi>entyre</hi> univerſal <hi>body,</hi> in the nature and notion
of it, different, diſtinct, and ſuperior to the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
So that being gathered, they had a larger power, but
not a greater nor another power as a general <hi>Councel,</hi> but as ſo
many particular Churches or Elders congregated. They acted
not as a Parliament, but as a Dyett of ſo many Free-States. Or
to take M. <hi>Hudſons</hi> owne ſimilitude. As a <hi>heap of ſtones,</hi> have no
more <hi>inward</hi> vertue becauſe they are an <hi>heap,</hi> then if they were
each one by themſelves; they have a larger, but not a more
excellent one, or of another kind; neither doth the power of
working, (what ever their vertue be) agree to them <hi>firſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe
they are an <hi>heap,</hi> but becauſe they are ſtones of ſuch and
ſuch a nature. So here; They might excommunicate then, but
it might be from their owne heap (as we may ſo ſpeak) or Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
onely: not as out of the <hi>Catholick Viſible Church</hi> alſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<hi>per accidens;</hi> in as much as he that is <hi>rightly</hi> excommunicated
out of one Church, is <hi>really</hi> excommunicated out of all (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are eſſentially and myſtically one, and to go by the
ſame rule) though formally he may not be ſo. As he that is juſtly
condemned for a Traytor in one of the Kings Dominions, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and vertually condemned in the reſt: becauſe theſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58801:11"/>
are politically one in their head; yet may they be Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
one from another in their proper Governments and Rights,
as was ſaid above concerning England and Scotland.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It was but a voluntary aſſociation, or by right of Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
only, and not of oneneſſe of Corporation: which appears
by aſtringing and confining, even in <hi>after times,</hi> in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
the power of Biſhops and Miniſters, to, and within their
owne Dioceſſes and Churches, ſo as to pronounce all the acts
they did elſewhere (unleſſe by call or permiſſion) void,<note place="margin">Conc. Gen. 2. c. 2.</note> and of

if they had apprehended the whole Church to be but <hi>One</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
or great <hi>Congregation:</hi> and all the Biſhops and Miniſters
to be over this one Church in common: why then (though in
regard that each man was aſſigned by the Church to his particular
place for the avoyding of confuſion) ſuch acts out of their owne
Churches might be diſorderly and irregular; yet could they not
be formally void: for that the whole Church, being committed
to each and to all; they had been within their charge, ſeeing
they had an habitual and fundamental right thereunto, as being
Officers <hi>per ſe,</hi> and properly of the whole Church, and not of
any particular Church, but by accident onely. And let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred;

            <p>2. It is <hi>more new</hi> Relatively. 1. In reference to the <hi>protestant</hi>

(as will appeare afterward) certaine it is, that <hi>Calvine</hi> whom they

againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58801:12"/>
Alſo <hi>Chamier</hi> ſpeaking the ſence of the French Churches as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
muſt be related: but we need not be ſollicitous to prove
this; ſeeing the Brethren of this opinion confeſſe this conceit to be
oppoſed by the greateſt part of the proteſtant writers: as wil appear
in the fourth Argument. If therefore Novelty and new light be a
prejudice againſt other opinions, it cannot but reflect ſuſpition
upon this.</p>
            <p>2. Another juſt prejudice againſt this opinion,<note place="margin">2. Preiudice, <hi>Dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> may be, that it
is of <hi>Dangerous Conſequence.</hi> For if the whole Church that is Viſible
and to be ſeen on earth, be one ſingle Corporation or Kingdom;
and the firſt ſubject to whom all Government in Church affairs
belongeth, and in whoſe right, and by power from which, all
particular Churches do act: then of neceſſitie. 1. There muſt
be Viniverſal and General officers, and ſome one above the reſt,
to whom the particular Churches may have continual recourſe.
For all Corporations have officers, that are officers of the whole
Corporation, and over all, and not particular onely: as not
onely the <hi>Conſtables</hi> of the ſeverall Pariſhes, or Aldermen of cath
Ward, but the <hi>Major</hi> alſo of the whole; who hath (though not a
divided, yet) a diſtinct and ſuperior power in order to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
above the reſt, though conjoyned.</p>
            <p>2. Seeing Chriſt hath provided a ſeaſonable and ſtanding
means, for the continual exerciſe of the Government of his
Church, that may be made uſe of as occaſion requires: therefore
theſe officers muſt have alwaies reſidence in ſome one place,
though they may alſo remove to another: they muſt have an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
being and reſidence, as being the officers for the exerciſe of the
<hi>power</hi> of the univerſal Church. For it is impertinent to ſay, that
<hi>it is ſufficient the univerſal Church meet by parties in ſeverall Countreys and
Ages:</hi> for the meeting of officers of Corporations muſt be in one
place and time; as the Parliament, Convocation, Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>And it were notably vaine to imagine that Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the government of his Church firſt &amp; chiefly to that body
that <hi>ſhould not meet ſix times in ſixteen hundred yeares:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">There are but four Generall C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

for there never was yet any univerſal meeting of the Catholick
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58801:13"/>
Church nor its officers: though ſome Councells have been called
<hi>Generall,</hi> becauſe of the number of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> unitie of places from
whence they have come, and the <hi>Emperours</hi> latitude of Dominion
that called them.</p>
            <p>3. From hence would follow that very many particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
would be in peril to be greatly damaged: ſeeing in appeals
they muſt be adjudged by thoſe that are many <hi>thouſand</hi> miles diſtant
from them, and could not have perfect<note n="*" place="margin">Preface to M. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> of the keys of the Kingdome of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Cyprian lib, 1. Epiſt. 3.</hi>
               </note> cognizance of the cauſe:
nor in caſe they wanted information for their guidance in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
could by reaſon of diſtance have it in time.</p>
            <p>4. Great would be the vexation, charges, travel, &amp;c. that would
ariſe from ſuch a Court, as whereunto Appeals were to come:
and yet ſuch there muſt be, if the whole Church be but one Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.</p>
            <p>3. A third and fourth prejudice and probable exception againſt
this opinion is, Tis Papal, and Anti-Proteſtant. 1. Papal, not
indeed in regard of the height of it (as it refers the root and head
of this univerſallity unto <hi>Rome</hi> onely) but in regard of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
it ſelf: An univerſal viſible Church: a mayne ground of the
former.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Hudſon</hi> (and ſo M. <hi>Noyes)</hi> indeed would avoid this preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
alſo,<note place="margin">Page 10. 11.</note> but with <hi>Labour in Vain:</hi> He ſaith he ſtateth not the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
as the Papiſts do: <q rend="inline margQuotes">becauſe they take <hi>Viſible</hi> for <hi>Glorious:</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Catholick, for Romane: and ſubject it to the Pope</hi> For 1. what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the Papiſts add to the queſtion, yet the ſubſtance and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratum
of it, is the ſame. In vain ſhould they fix the ſeat of it at
Rome, and ſubject it to the Pope, if it might not be in it ſelf one
Corporation and Republique. 2. Again they do not take viſible
for glorious: but for that which is obvious to the ſenſe: though
they make Glorious an adjunct thereunto. 3. They ſo fix the
ſeat of the Church at Rome, and ſubject it to the Pope (ſeverall
of the moſt eminent of them) as that it is onely in the abſence of
a general Councel, which they make above the Pope, as being
the Church Catholick Repreſentative, as is ſhewed elſe-where.
But to return.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the definition it is to be noted that hee makes all beleevers

were living, either by precept or practiſe, whatſoever
concerned the Churches in ſuch particulars. 4. That they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly

all Churches to the end of the World. <hi>I am with you,</hi> (viz.) <hi>in

            <p>3. The firſt execution of the greateſt act of entire power, was
by admonition and command of the Apoſtle himſelf, but not
by his power, exerciſed in a particular Church, without appeal to,
or conſulting of the univerſal Church, (which they might have
done, according to this opinion, the Apoſtles then being ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,)<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note>

or by authority of the reſt of the Apoſtles, Repreſentatives of
the univerſal Church, if the Catholick Church be the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

            <p>4. If entire power were firſt committed to particular men, then
not to the Catholique Church, and ſo it was not the firſt ſubject
of Church power, and ſo not one viſible governing Church; but
entire power was committed to the Apoſtles ſeverally, and to all

Kingdom, which is a Parliament (anſwerable to a general

there was ſuch a ſet company of Officers, and they had a

            <p>Object. 1. But it may be it will be ſaid, <hi>the throat of the cauſe
is yet ſafe,</hi> becauſe <hi>it ſeems ſufficient, that the major part of thoſe that are
of the ſame judgement ought to governe the leſſe.</hi> To which I reply,
that in all Corporations and Common-wealths, (as our Brethren

but the major part of the <hi>whole</hi> body, are to rule the reſt;
and that not divided in ſeverall places at a diſtance, but convened
together, at leaſt in ſome neerneſſe of place.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. If it be ſaid that by reaſon of diſtance of place, and
multitude of perſons this cannot be done, viz. the collection of the
Catholicke Viſible Church. I anſwer and ſay, 1. Therefore
ſuch an opinion is not to be aſſerted which unavoidably and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily

that becauſe the Church is <hi>ſomevvay</hi> one, therefore Integrally, and
by way of ſingle Corporation Viſible. Now the Apoſtle ſpeaks
of the Church as one in Myſterie and Nature, not Viſibly, and
in Number, appears from <hi>Verſe 13.</hi> Where he ſaith, <hi>Ye are all ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized
into one body, and been made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> Now
compare this with its parallel, Eph. 4. 4. 5. Where the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>There is but one baptiſme, one faith:</hi> and ſo makes the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the body to conſiſt in theſe, uniting the members to
one Chriſt, by one ſpirit, to one God. In which place two things
are obſervable: Firſt, That as he ſaith the <hi>Church</hi> is one, ſo he
ſaith <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is one, and <hi>Faith</hi> is one; Shall we therefore ſay
that there is but one ſingle Baptiſme, or one ſingle Faith, viſibly
and integrally one in the VVorld? Surely any man would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that the former are ſaid to be one myſtically, inviſibly, and
in reſpect of their kinde and Nature, becauſe all true faith is of
the ſame kinde, and ſo all true Baptiſme; but are as many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
faiths in Number, and Baptiſmes, as there are ſeveral belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and baptiſed perſons. Secondly, That the oneneſſe of the
Church eſſentially, conſiſts in the oneneſſe for kinde of Faith,
Hope, Baptiſme: as alſo, in the oneneſſe of its head, its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and its God: which doth indeed make it one myſtical body,
but it doth not conclude them to be one, Viſibly, Outwardly,
and Externally: becauſe ſome of theſe things wherein they are
one, are inviſible, others not on earth: as the faith, the hope,
ſpirit, are inviſible: God and Chriſt are not on earth viſibly; and
therefore the oneneſſe here mentioned, makes not one viſible
corporation on earth, and as one to be conſidered, and to act. VVe
willingly grant that this union Myſtical doth imply an union
Viſible alſo, as much as may ſtand with the Inſtitution of Chriſt,
and the edification of the Church: But neither Chriſts inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor the edification of the Church implies, but oppoſes
ſuch an Vniverſal, Viſible, Vnited Corporation, as we ſaw
before. But of this more in our Anſwer to his ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now to return.</p>
            <p>As we ſay of the body, and of Baptiſme, Faith, Hope, &amp;c.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58801:22"/>

and kinde in the ſubſtantialls of it, or that general platforme of
it Matth. 18. and what elſe is to be gathered from the precepts
and practiſe of the Apoſtles: but as the Church is not one viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
policie, or corporation in number, ſo neither in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Government of it. For this as other accidents follows
the nature of its ſubject. So then, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God
hath ſet in the Church ſome Apoſtles</hi> &amp;c. the Church muſt be taken
for one; not in regard of the outward or accidentall ſtate of it, but
indefinitely, and in regard of its inward nature and eſſence: that is,

about theſe gifts, which are beſtowed for the better uniting of it:
that all members cannot be in the ſame office, nor have the ſame
gifts, but yet may be of the ſame body, whereof the Church of
Corinth was a part. This is all the Apoſtle aimes at here: And
ſo alſo in that other parallel place,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3, 4, 5, 6. explained,</note> Eph. 4. 3, 4, 5. &amp;c. His ſcope

he muſt mean the whole, and not that on earth onely: for the

muſt be perfected by union of Jews and Gentiles; thoſe on earth

for the Viſible part onely. Now in this <hi>Body,</hi> or in this <hi>Church</hi>

            <p>4. Were it granted that the Apoſtle in theſe places meanes
by the Church, the Church viſible Catholicke: yet this opinion
gaines nothing thereby; for it doth not follow that becauſe it
was ſo then, and in reſpect of the Apoſtles, that therefore it was to
be ſo to the end of the world, and in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Chriſt who is the King of his Church hath the ſame liberty in
his Kingdome ſpeciall; that God hath over the world, which
is his Kingdome general: Now at one time the Lord would have
the whole world almoſt, one Kingdome or Monarchy under <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar,</hi>
Jer. 27. 8. and threatneth with heavy plagues that
nation that ſhould refuſe to ſerve him; giving this reaſon, that
<hi>himſelfe is King of all Nations,</hi> verſ. 5. which is alſo repeated again,
Dan. 4. 22. ſo that the whole world was one Kingdome upon
the matter; yet it was not the will of God it ſhould alwaies bee
ſo. In the like manner in <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Church and Common
wealth affaires were chiefly under the Magiſtrate; but afterward
they were diſtinct,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Trigland</hi> de po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtat. Eccleſ. &amp; civili cap. 12.</note> unleſſe under thoſe Kings that were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
alſo. So the <hi>twelve Tribes</hi> were under <hi>Saul, David</hi> and <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
one Kingdome: yet it was of the Lord, that afterwards they
were two: and afterward one againe, after the captivity. So
likewiſe Chriſt taketh the ſame power over his Church, when hee
ſaw it, for the advantage of it; hee ſet over it one Company of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58801:24"/>
Officers, who ruled it in common, viz. the Apoſtles, in relation
to whom, the Churches were one, though not in themſelves; but
that doth not argue that hee meant it ſhould alwaies ſo continue
after their deceaſe.</p>
            <p>It is a Generall rule in all proceedings, that things at their <hi>firſt</hi>
plantation and beginning need ſome things that afterward would
be inconvenient, as a Stick by a Twigge, a Bladder to him that
ſwimmeth, a Standing-ſtole to a childe. So at the firſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jewiſh Church, God made <hi>Moſes</hi> an extraordinary
Officer, ſo that hee had no Succeſſor ſo abſolute till Chriſts time.
So at the firſt erection of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi>
which now are generally apprehended to be ceaſed. Yea
alſo in <hi>Scotland,</hi>

                  </gap>uum in Scotia Edit. 1641.</note> (as we heard above) at the beginning of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
they had certaine Officers in the nature of Biſhops,
whom they called <hi>Viſitors,</hi> which the Authour informes us were
then neceſſary; but the Church being ſetled, not now any
longer needfull.</p>
            <p>2. Nor were the Churches one in themſelves, (as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
but one in the Apoſtles, and that by accident alſo) as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Scotland</hi> are one in the King, becauſe he governs both;
but they are not therefore one Kingdome in themſelves conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>But 3. Though wee grant this, that whiles the Apoſtles were
living, there was one body of Officers over the whole Church,
and ſo in reſpect of them the Church might bee ſaid to bee one
GOVERNED body, yet I ſay, it was never one GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNING
body; for whiles the Apoſtles lived, the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Governing power was committed to the Apoſtles onely,
and not with them to any other Officers, or Churches; no and
not to all the Churches together, but they with their officers were
all in ſubjection to them: and when the Apoſtles deceaſed, the
ſcripture ſpeaks nothing of inſtating any other collected and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
body to ſucceed them in that Vniverſall Government; no
nor can it be gathered by conſequence: but the contrary, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
that becauſe the uſe of that Vniverſall power ceaſed, therefore
the Office, Officers and ſubject of it.</p>

               </note> Act. 15. about the queſtion of

of <hi>Antioch,</hi> about his Doctrine, as conſonant to that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apoſtles. On the former principle, he profeſſeth (2 Cor. 10.
13. &amp;c.) he had <hi>not intruded into another mans line;</hi> alluding, as it
ſeems to the ſhareing out of inheritances by line, (as Pſal. 16. 6.)
for this reaſon, the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke,</hi>
becauſe written to the diſperſed Iewes throughout the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
nations, as is the expreſſion in the entrance of thoſe Epiſtles.
Hence alſo <hi>Paul</hi> is ſent from Ieruſalem as not his place, Act. 22. 18.
And though ſometimes he diſputed with the Jews, yet it was but
as making way to the Gentiles, neither did hee greatly prevaile
with them, as appears, Act. 13. 40. 41. chap. 28. 16.</p>
            <p>7. To conclude therefore, our reply to this Argument, If it
follow not, when we ſay, <hi>God hath ſet in the World ſome Emperours,
ſome Kings, ſome Princes, ſome inferiour officers</hi> and Magiſtrates: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>whole world is but one Governing Kingdome, and all particular
Kingdomes do but governe in the right of the Kingdome of the world, in
Common; the Officers whereof are the Kings of the ſeverall Kingdomes,
who being gathered together, or a part of them, have the povver of giving
Lavves to other Kingdomes, according to the Lavv of God and nature,</hi>
(which are the rules of all juſt Government) <hi>and this alſo to bee
done by the Kings and Princes themſelves, vvithout any authority from, or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58801:25"/>
any dependency on the people,</hi> (unleſſe for quietnes ſake, and as far as
they ſee cauſe:) If (as was ſaid) this follow not: neither doth it
follow, that becauſe the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church
Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore the Church throughout the world is but
one Congregation, to whoſe Officers firſt, as the generall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the whole Church, not by way of diſtribution, but as
a Notionally (at leaſt) collected body of Officers: the power of
Government is committed: by Authoritie whereof, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
upon which common officers and body,<note place="margin">Apollon. cap. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> the officers
of every particular Church do act:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect. 4. Aſſerimus. Ius divin.</hi> of the Presbytery, p. 43. and cap. 11. p. 163.</note> and thoſe without any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
upon the concurrence of the people, as co-operating and
acting with them, unleſſe for peace ſake. By which means
(let it be obſerved by all ſorts, The power being given, not to any
one Church, but to the whole Church, as one body; and not to the
members with the Officers, but to the Officers onely) there is
derived a very <hi>Tranſcendent power</hi> and Authoritie upon every
<hi>particular Miniſter;</hi> more then any Parliament-man hath, yea
more then a King, (who is limited to his dominion) It makes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Miniſter one of the ſtanding Officers of the Chriſtian world,
to whom with his Collegues (not ſeverally and by diſtribution,
but joyntly, and as one body) is committed the <q rend="inline margQuotes">Government of
the whole Chriſtian world, and managing of the Affaires of the
Son of God throughout the face of the earth.</q> And ſo hee is one
of Chriſts <hi>Vicars Generall,</hi> (and not particular onely, which I
acknowledge every Miniſter to be in his place) <hi>magnum</hi> ſurely, <hi>et
memorabile nomen.</hi> But if this bee ſo, great reaſon is it that the
Church of the whole world ſhould chooſe theſe Vniverſall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and ſo the Church of a nation the Nationall Officers, &amp;c.
by whom they are to be Governed in that which is of Deareſt and
higheſt moment, viz. the precious ſoule: or elſe their condition
is moſt ſad. If every one that can get a little learning and deſires to
live upon the Sweat and coſt of others; and to become a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
(though I profeſſe that calling to be <hi>moſt difficult on earth;</hi> and
alſo, that <hi>the Lord hath appointed that thoſe that preach the Goſpel ſhould
live of the Goſpel)</hi> and ſo being willing to ſubmit to ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as is required, ſhall have a friend, patron, or a purſe to make
one; and come into the miniſtery and a living (which is the
Kings Road, in ſome Churches, and is the way whereby many
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58801:25"/>
of thoſe who now are to be Presbyters came in) he ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Parliament man, and joynt Governour of the whole
Church on earth; by whoſe one vote, all the liberties and truth
of Religion in them may be deſtroyed: A glympe whereof we
have ſeen in the Convocations or Synods in our owne Nation.
This I ſay is ſad; yea more ſad then the condition of men in
their Civil Liberties In our owne Kingdom: where none attains
the honour of being an univerſal Officer, a Parliament man,
but by the conſent (formal or virtual) of all, or the major part
of them: there having been a precedent act by joynt conſent
of the whole Nation, that perſons choſen by the <hi>free Vote</hi> of the
major part of Corporations <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould (if <hi>loyal)</hi> be Officers
<hi>pro tempore,</hi> to their owne Corporations, and to the whole. But
ſuch agreement hath not been made, (no not <hi>tacitely)</hi> by the
Catholick Church; nor no ſuch inſtitution of Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
yet.</p>
            <p>And theſe anſwers alſo are applyable to what the ſame Author
hath elſe where from the word CHVRCH,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apollon.</hi> cap. 1. p. 8 <hi>Reijcimus.</hi>
               </note> as when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
a <hi>Particular Church to be the proper ſubject of the covenant of grace,
and priviledges of it; becauſe</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the</hi> CHVRCH <hi>to which
theſe promiſes are made, is perpetual.</hi> Jer. 31. 36. The ſtrength of
which reaſoning lies on this, that the word Church, and not
Churches, is uſed in theſe places; and ſo it is repreſented as one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As if it were not common to call that perpetual which
is ſo by ſucceſſion of thoſe of the like Nature and Kinde; becauſe
the Lord ſaith <hi>Day and Night ſhall not ceaſe to the Worlds end;</hi> doth
it therefore follow that all the eſſential properties of day or night
do not agree to this or that particular day? Is it not a rule in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Reaſon,<note place="margin">Ariſt.</note> that all the eſſential properties of general and
common beings, are really exiſtent in the individual and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
<hi>Man</hi> is to continue on earth to the end of the World, does
not therefore the eſſential properties of man agree to <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi>
becauſe <hi>they</hi> were not to continue.</p>
            <p>His ſecond and third Argument there, is; <q rend="inline margQuotes">That a particular
Church cannot be the ſubject of the covenant of Grace:</q> and
conſequently of Church power (for the reaſon is the ſame)
<q rend="inline margQuotes">becauſe the Church which hath theſe is ſanctified, is the ſpouſe
of Chriſt, hath the Law written in the heart of it: <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58801:26"/>
particular Church [as it is particular] cannot be ſaid to be
ſuch.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But 1. It was never ſaid that one particular Church is ſo
the ſubject of theſe, as that another is not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To ſpeak properly, The Church not as <hi>viſible,</hi> nor
as <hi>particular,</hi> nor as <hi>inviſible,</hi> nor as <hi>univerſal,</hi> is the ſubject of theſe
things, but as a <hi>Church;</hi> i. e. A <hi>ſociety of Beleevers:</hi> and under
that nation, <hi>a particular Church conſidered as a Church, hath right to
all, and is the ſubject of all theſe. All are yours,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to
the Corinthians, <hi>whether Paul or Christ.</hi> &amp;c. So that this Author
by adding this clauſe [as particular] hath praevaricated and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the ſtate of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>His laſt Argument in that place, is from the Teſtimony of the
Profeſſors of Leyden, and Ameſius.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,<note place="margin">Diſp. 40. Theſ. 29, 30, 31.</note> That the former ſay nothing; but, that
the <hi>covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antibell. Tom. 2. l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and promiſes, and priviledges, belong to true beleevers,
and the inviſible Church, whether in a</hi> [particular Church] or diſperſed
through the world. So that this Teſtimony ſeems rather to make
againſt him. The other is expreſly againſt him, and ſpeaks our very
ſenſe, yea and terms almoſt inſomuch that I wonder this Author is
brought in as a witneſſe: His words are, even as they are cited
by <hi>Apollonius</hi> himſelf: <q rend="inline margQuotes">Theſe things agree not to the whole
multitude that profeſſe Chriſt, but onely to thoſe that are truly
faithful: or they agree to the Church militant, in reſpect of its
ESSENTIAL Nature, which is proper to the truly faithful.</q>

(as the Miniſters ſpeak) but he neither expreſſeth nor
implyeth the viſibility of this body, or the outward oneneſſe
of it: if he mean the Catholick, and not the particular Church
of Corinth.</p>
            <p>5. Laſtly, The Reverend Aſſembly; who in the places above
mentioned, quote Eph. 4. 3. &amp;c. To which Anſwer hath
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58801:27"/>
been given above; and may again when we come particulary to
reply unto them.</p>
            <p>And thus much in anſwer to the firſt Argument of <hi>Apollonius</hi>
and others drawn from expreſſions that ſpeake of the Church as
one: one body, houſe, Kingdome, family, ſheepfold, which is
indeed the <hi>Achileum,</hi> or <hi>Fort Royall</hi> in this Gariſon; and which, if I
be not greatly overſeene, hath been, by the former weapons out of
Chriſts Armory abſolutely taken and demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument followes which is:<note place="margin">Arg. Gen. 2.</note> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">There is certaine
Societie and Eccleſiaſticall communion by divine inſtitution,
and therefore a certain univerſall body: for there is a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
fellowſhip and obligation to mutuall offices, Eph. 4. 3, 4,
5, 6. which doth require an externall and outward Society, and
Commuion Eccleſiaſticall, in exhorting, reproving, comforting,
edifying one another—and that fellowſhip which the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a particular Church retain among themſelves, in a due
proportion Churches Provinciall and Nationall ought to keep—by
which communion Eccleſiaſticall, all Nationall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
do grow up to one Vniverſall Eccleſiaſticall body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This reaſon no way concludes the intended propoſition:
I willingly grant there is a mutuall fellowſhip, and ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
which alſo requires an outward communion in many
reſpects, and particularly, in thoſe named by this Author, viz. <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
reproof,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed, this was all the combination that
was in the moſt Primitive Churches: and ſuch inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
communion there is to bee betwixt all good men, friends,
brethren, nations, &amp;c. But this argues not that therefore they muſt
be one body in point of Government. Neighbour Nations are to
retain this inward communion, and outward, ſo farre as may make
for mutuall good, and there may bee a ſociety or league betwixt
them, as betwixt <hi>Solomon</hi> and the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> betwixt <hi>Solomon</hi>
and <hi>Hiram,</hi> King of <hi>Tyre.</hi> So men of the ſame trade and profeſſion
in regard of the ſame art, have an internall communion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and this requires ſome outward communion alſo, as occaſion
ſerves; but it no way concludes, that therefore they muſt needs be
one body or Corporation; Suppoſe ſome dwell at London, ſome
at Yorke, ſome in England, and ſome in France. 2. It is alſo gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the ſame Vnion that the members of a Church have one
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58801:27"/>
with another, the ſame have the ſeverall Churches among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
IN A DVE PROPORTION, which are the
words of the Author; but this proportion is not IDENTITIE,
or ſameneſſe of Relation; that is, it is not ſo neer a relation, nor
gives that power that the former relation doth. As the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
that the members of a Family have one unto another; the
ſame in a due proportion have particular families one to another;
but no man will ſay that what the members of a family, eſpecially
ſome of them, may doe one to another; the ſame may a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
of Families do among themſelves, there is ſome neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but not altogether the ſame. And this alſo is ſufficient for
the ſecond Argument. I ſhall meet with it again anon in the firſt
Argument of the <hi>Reverend Aſſembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third.<note place="margin">Arg. Gen. 3.</note> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">There were certaine meetings in the New
Teſtament which did repreſent the whole Church, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the buſineſſe of the whole Church was tranſacted, to wit,
the calling of an Apoſtle; which was a part of Eccleſiaſticall
Diſcipline:</q> and there were the Paſtors of the univerſal Church,
for they were ſent unto all the world, Matth. 21. 19. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
the brethren out of Galilee and Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I deny (with the Proteſtant Divines againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts)
that there is any Repreſentative Church properly ſo called,
or that this was one; it was onely at preſent a Particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
whereof the Apoſtles were members, though principall
ones, but not yet <hi>actually inſtituted Officers,</hi> neither of this,
or the whole Church, which appears verſ 4. 8. <hi>Tarry ye</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>in Jeruſalem till you have received power from on high.</hi> But it was indeed
that <hi>firſt</hi> Church from whence all Churches were to be produced,
and the Apoſtles (eſpecially) and the reſt of theſe members were
thoſe, who were ſeverally or joyntly to plant thoſe Churches (for
ſome members of this Church did plant other Churches, and
not the Apoſtles onely, as is expreſſed chap 8.) as one man that is
father by generation of many Families; neither is an univerſal
man, nor doth ever repreſent them; neither is he the Governour
alwaies of them, but for a certain time onely.</p>
            <p>2. If it were the Repreſentative of the univerſal Church, becauſe
the Apoſtles, the univerſal Officers were there; yet it was their
priviledge, as was ſhewed above, to be the univerſal Officers, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58801:28"/>
that ſeverally; ſo that though the Churches were one body under
one number of Officers then; yet they having no ſucceſſors in
the latitude of their power, the Church now becomes many: elſe
you may as well conclude, that all the world muſt ſtill be one under
one ſort of Governours, becauſe it was ſo in the time of <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This act declares very ſmall power in the Apoſtles or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church; for they could not <hi>make</hi> an univerſal Officer;
whereas every particular Church can make its particular Officers:
and this ſhews there was then no Catholick government, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch, but that was reſerved to Chriſt alone.</p>
            <p>4. If it conclude; it argues, that the Catholick Church is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
to <hi>chuſe</hi> its Catholick Officers (for ſo they did) and to come
together for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>5. It puts the brethren into great <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>priviledge,</hi> for <hi>they</hi>
chooſe, and the Apoſtles onely put them upon the work, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over it. But to avoid this, elſe-where labour is uſed to prove that
here were onely the Apoſtles or Elders in this election: <hi>quid non
mortalia pectora cogis (Regni) ſacra fames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument there, is, that the buſineſſe of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Church was tranſacted, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the election of an Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Adam</hi> did repreſent all mankinde, and tranſacted the
affairs and buſineſſe of the univerſal Catholick world, both before
and after his fall: ſo likewiſe <hi>Noah</hi> and his family after the flood,
Gen. 8. doth it therefore follow that the whole world ſhould be
but one Kingdom or Corporation.</p>
            <p>It is uſual for Kingdoms to ſend out Colonies into forraigne
parts, and to give them power to become Common-wealths of
themſelves, without dependence, unleſſe voluntary, upon that
Kingdom from whence they had their Original, as New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
So fathers of Families yeild their ſons an entire governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their owne families, without neceſſarily engageing them
to the families of their brethren, further then mutuall love and
relations ſhall require. But before the Colonies be ſent out, the
Nation from whence they ariſe, doth repreſent and tranſact the
buſineſſe both of themſelves, and of all thoſe Colonies: and
the father of the Families both repreſents and tranſacts the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Families that ſpring from him: yet are both the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58801:28"/>
one and other afterward, without any abſolute and neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
either upon the one or other. So in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Chriſts Church. The Church of Jeruſalem was as it were
the mother to the reſt; The Apoſtles <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſpiritual fathers, who
repreſented and tranſacted the affairs of all Churches that ſhould
flow from that; but ſo, that when ſuch Churches came to be
planted, they ſhewed by their practiſe that the Apoſtles had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated
them in entyre power, without any neceſſary dependence
on other Churches, whether ſingle or combined, as is evident
out of the firſt and ſecond chapters of the Revelation, noted
before, and other places.</p>
            <p>3. The third particular is of little moment: for the brethren
that are called <hi>Galileans,</hi> verſ. 11. were ſo by countrey; but now
were by habitation and dwelling, in all probability of <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
And howſoever, the thing is not much material, ſeeing there was
then no other Church or ſocietie of Chriſtians viſible, but that at
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> Beſides, the former anſwers take off this alſo. And
thus the firſt ſcripture, viz. from Act. 1. is anſwered.</p>
            <p>The ſecond followes out of Act. 15. 22.<note place="margin">

            <p>Anſw. 1. The former anſwers touching the prerogative of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,

and therefore could not teach the Churches any ſuch duty of

Rome is ſaid to be) for there were meſſengers from few (if

But that the Church in reſpect of the ſeveral members and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

words evidently deſtroy this opinion. For firſt they make the
<hi>Eſſentialunion</hi> or forme of the Society and oneneſſe of the Church,
to conſiſt in the oneneſſe of Faith and Sacraments. Secondly,
They imply, That Government is one as it is in Chriſt, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
as it is in ſeverall Churches, and in the hands of ſeverall
Officers; for ſo <hi>Calvine</hi> (in Epheſ. 4. 11.) expounds that of
<hi>Cyprian:</hi> The Epiſcopacie he gives to Chriſt alone, in the
adminiſtring whereof, every one hath his part. Thirdly, And
(which chiefly aſſaulteth the heart of the cauſe for which it is
brought by this Author) They make the very difference betwixt
the univerſal Church and a particular Church to be this, That
they diſagree in the outward or viſible forme of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
therefore in the ſenſe of the <hi>Profeſſors of Leyden,</hi> the
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Vniverſal Church is not one Governing Body,</q> for then the
Government muſt be one, not only in <hi>Eſſence, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Kinde,</hi>
but one in <hi>Number, Exiſtence, ſingle and Indivual being.</hi> And
thus much for anſwer in particular to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> who indeed

that follow, having taken his grounds, and dilated them a little

the whole world ſhould be united in one and the ſame

Viſible Paſtor, or Aſſembly of Paſtors (or Presbyterie,
marke it:) but there are ſo many Churches as there are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregations. For although the Church myſtical, as
it is in its members is diſtinguiſhed into its ſubject and adjuncts,
as the Engliſh Church, the French, the Belgick: as we
uſe to call the ſea by the name of the coaſt it beats upon, as the
Brittiſh, the Belgick, the Baltick ſea, although it be one
and the ſame ſea: yet notwithſtanding inſtituted Churches
are ſeveral diſtinct ſpecies, or kindes, or ſingle bodies parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the ſame common Nature, as ſeverall ſprings, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſchools, ſeveral families; although perhaps many of them,
or all, may be called one Church in reſpect of ſome affection
which they all have in commune. Like as many Families of
one and the ſame noble and eminent Family, are called by one
name,</q> as the houſe of Naſſau, or the houſe of Auſtria, which
comprehends the Emperour and King of Spain, who yet have no
dependence in point of Government one on another. Now wee
know who taxes ſome-body for this fault,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> Edw. <hi>Gangr.</hi> part 1.</note> of citeing Authors for
them, who are known to be in the main, againſt them.</p>
            <p>6. His explication of his queſtion both confutes his opinion,
and alſo contradicteth plainly what he ſpeaks of it. For he ſaith,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">That the Church Catholicke viſible is one whole body,<note place="margin">pag. 20. 21.</note> all
whoſe parts or particular Churches are alike,<note place="margin">Totum Integrale ſimilare.</note> and of the ſame
Nature:</q> And avouches for this purpoſe the authority of <hi>Ames<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
who indeed ſaith ſo. Now in a body all whoſe parts are of like
nature and quality, as ſo many drops of water, or ſtones in a heap:
each part hath the ſame vertue and power that the whole, and all
the parts together, (the whole Sea, or whole heape of Stones)
have no other kinde of Vertue or power then one drop, or one
ſtone. Or to make it cleer by another ſimilitude, ſeverall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
in the world, and ſeverall Corporations in a Kingdom, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58801:32"/>
ſeverall families in Corporation, if they bee all but members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of the ſame Kingdome, and not of a higher body, whereof
when they are met, they may be members, (as Kingdomes of an
Empire, Corporations of a Parliament, Families of a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,)
They ſhould have no more nor greater power when met,
then when aſſunder? As a multitude of ſingle men, that are not
of a Corporation, though they bee met; yet have they not the
more power then each one ſimply, for their meeting; their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
addes no power, unleſſe they meet as members of a body ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
to them, when ſeverall.</p>
            <p>2. This explication contradicteth expreſly what he adds in the
ſame place, (pag. 21.) and which is his opinion, that hee would
eſtabliſh, viz. <q rend="inline margQuotes">That the Church, (Viſible Catholique) is an
Organicall, Miniſteriall Governing body;</q> that is; not ſuch a
body as is the element of water or ayre, every part whereof is of
the ſame nature, vertue and power in it ſelfe conſidered; but ſuch
a body as a man hath, which is diſtinguiſhed by ſeverall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
ſome principall, ſome leſſe principall, ſome governing, as
head eyes; ſome acting, as hands fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; ſome governed, as the body
by the head eyes, &amp;c. And ſuch a body as all Corporations are.
Now this contradicts plainly the former, both opinion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
for if the Church be a ſimilar body, and all Congregations
alike; and the whole nothing differing in nature or conſtitution,
or power from the parts; then the Catholick Vniverſall viſible
Church, is no more the Governing Church, then a particular.
As the whole ſea is no more Water then one drop, nor all men,
if they be taken as ſingle men, have no more or higher authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then one man: nor all families then one family: nor all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations

it is now miniſteriall and heterogeneall, which was before ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and homogeneall) but this is replyed to above, where was
ſhewed, 1. That the moſt primitive Churches did not ſo act.
2. That the whole Church did not meet in them. 3. That
they either acted as a ſimilar body acts in the name of thoſe, and
within the Churches that ſent them each for their owne, and all
for all thoſe, whoſe Deputies they were for ought we have learnt

before, namely, <hi>That the Church Catholick is a ſpecies, or lower
kinde, and the particular Churches the ſeveralls of it:</hi> for elſe confounds
Vniverſall and particular together: making an univerſall thing
reducible to a particular, and this extendible to an univerſal.</p>
            <p>2. How could it bee <hi>Vniverſall,</hi> but as containing the <hi>Eſſence;</hi>
ſeeing in reſpect of its viſible and preſent being it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
In which ſence, every Single man is a Catholique and
Vniverſal creature, becauſe he containes in him the ſame Eſſence
and nature that is in all men; and <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have been
ſo in a ſpecial manner, as being the firſt.</p>
            <p>3. A particular thing doth not therefore become an Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall

            <p>4. If the firſt in each kinde have all the priviledges of that kind
whileſt it remaines alone, it ſhall bee a looſer when it hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
if it then part with them; unleſſe it hath ſomewhat as
good in Lieu, which here appears not; but the contrary.</p>
            <p>5. It no way followes that becauſe from one, many of the
ſame kinde may ſpring, that therefore either this firſt (ſuppoſe a

               </gap>ivill or Politicke bodies. For in a Naturall body, all whoſe

that are, by the reaſon of man drawne from particulars, the caſe is

inviſible: <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are viſible, but manhood
or mans nature <hi>(animal rationale)</hi> which is the Vniverſall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

So alſo in Civil bodies or Corporations, though the ſeverall men
may be ſeene, yet the Corporation if great, (an Empire, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

               <note place="margin">Anſvv.</note> that the greateſt abilities
grow weak when they daſh againſt it. 'Tis ſenſible in this
Argument and Authors of it. For it doth not at all follow, that
every company of men that in ſome reſpect have an union toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in that reſpect may be conceived as one whole Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
or Fellowſhip, ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> herefore be one common-wealth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58801:35"/>
or corporation. For as was ſaid before: the brethren or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the ſame firſt Parent (ſuppoſe of the houſe of <hi>Eſſex,
Manchester,</hi> or <hi>Fairfax)</hi> have an union of blood together, and
in that reſpect are called the Houſe in the ſingular number (not
the Houſes) of ſuch a Family: from which union there ariſeth
to every one of that Houſe, ſuch a relation unto, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon the Houſe or Family in general, as parts have to the
whole, and are to do all ſuch brotherly duties, as parts conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the whole: yet doth it not hence follow that all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and their Families (which poſſibly may be many) are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one corporation. The ſame might more evidently be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by the whole race of mankinde, who are one in nature,
one in parent, one in office general (the government of the
world and worſhip of God) one in the common laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
one in the principal Governour: <hi>God is the King of all the
Earth</hi> &amp;c. And from this union, there ariſeth unto every man
ſuch a relation unto, and dependence upon the catholick world,
or mankinde in general, as parts have to the whole, and are to
do all humane duties, as parts conjoyned to the whole of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde:
Hence the Philoſopher, when rebuked for giving an

ſhould conclude; that all the men in the world are but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth

of the oneneſſe of the Viſible Church, hath made them <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
in the Church,</hi> and ſuch alſo as have ſworn to be ſo: In like

               <q rend="inline margQuotes">That the union of the Church is neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the relation cloſer, and obligation ſtrickter betwixt the
members of the Church, then betwixt the perſons of men,
becauſe it is ſpiritual and heavenly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which is anſwered 1. That the relation and union ſeems

one to another, <hi>Chriſtians, as Chriſtians;</hi> and <hi>Churches, as
Churches;</hi> though the relation of Chriſtians is more Noble and
excellent; and the motives ſtronger. As beaſts are as much one
in their kind as men, though the nature of man be more excellent.</p>
            <p>2. But be the relation of Chriſtians yet cloſer; yet that is in
<hi>Spirit, Faith, myſtical Vnion, &amp;c.</hi> not outward and viſible further
then to carry on the inviſible, according to the Inſtitution of
Chriſt: But neither this, nor the former, is by this notion coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced,
but the contrary, as hath been evidenced. There
may be a Society in Faith, as there was in many parts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
where there was no oneneſſe in Government: <hi>Job</hi> was not
alone in the World, ſome other Church God then had; and ſo
he was one in the faith, and profeſſion, and kinde of Church
Adminiſtration with them; but not united in one body of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

government.</p>
            <p>The place alledged for ſtrengthning this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> Eph.
4. 3, to 14, hath been anſvvered above; and implies no more but
an eſſential or myſtical union; which neceſſarily implyeth an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
one in all duties in reſpect of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> onely, not the
<hi>ſubject</hi> of them; but prudentially and occaſionally: Such an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
integrally <hi>(per modum ſuppoſiti, &amp; ſubjecti)</hi> and by way of
oneneſſe in a viſible way of joynt government; as ſhall be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for edification; which ordinarily is beſt promoted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſuch a ſociety as may (at leaſt upon occaſion) meet together
in one place; or howſoever live together in ſome neerneſſe at
leaſt. Which is the more evident; becauſe the largeſt Churches
mentioned in Scripture did ſo, as the Jewiſh Church: (all whoſe
Males met thrice a year at one place; and whoſe whole Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
or Land was but ſmall, ſcarce the fourth part of England:
and therefore might the better be one entire Congregation or
Church: but had they lived ſome at one end of the World, ſome
at the other, as Chriſtians do; there is no likelyhood they ſhould
have been one Church Integral) and as the Chriſtians in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
and in other cities; at the firſt plantation of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond Argument:</hi> All the Miniſters and officers of the Church
are given to the vvhole Church.</p>

in reſpect of the ſeveral corporations and Common-wealths.
The places alledged for proof, 1 Cor. 12. 28. Eph. 4.
11. are anſwered above, whither we refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>The third Argument is drawn from the third, fourth, and fifth
ſuppoſition (page 48) <q rend="inline margQuotes">When the Church was no more then
could meet in one place, the Officers governed them as one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
body reſpectively: But their number increaſing, ſo
as they could not meet altogether, they divided into ſeverall
Companies, which are in ſcripture called Churches: (to ſome
one of which every beleever is bound to joyne himſelfe) But
theſe ſeverall Churches ſhould not act or worke as if they were
<hi>Independent Corporations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Every one to be of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation in the judgement of the Reverend Aſſembly.</note> but onely as parts of Chriſts body, and
are all to regard the common good of the whole, Eph. 4. 1. &amp;c.
and for that end are as much bound (if it may be) to aſſociate (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Presbyteries, &amp;c. as particular men and families into Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
there being as much need of the one as of the other: and ſo
as many men or families make but one particular viſible Church;
ſo all particular Churches by this aſſociation make but one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
viſible Church Miniſterial, and Governing of <hi>right</hi> all
the reſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. God and Chriſt have diſpoſed and ordered the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and the Church according to the ſeverall
conditions whereinto the providence of the one and the other
hath determined to bring them. When wee are Children,
God hath appointed one kinde of government for us, <hi>viz.</hi> to
be <hi>under tutors and governours until the time of age,</hi> and then we are
not ſo: when afterward a man is diſpoſed in marriage, though he
have a relation to his Parent, yet not a neceſſary dependence
on him in point of government. So whilſt a Family is but one,
it is gouerned as one body, by one or more Parents of Officers
who in point of government are one ſingle body: but as was ſaid,
if this Family multiply beyond the bounds of that firſt houſe, they
are not now ſtill to be fancyed to be but one Catholick Family,
to be governed in common. Take for inſtance the Family of <hi>Adam</hi>
or <hi>Noah;</hi> The whole world was but then one Family, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by one man &amp;c. ſhall we need to repeat the abſurdity of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58801:37"/>
the conſequence, if therefore we ſhould conclude, that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Kingdoms and Nations are not therefore to act as Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Corporations; but as parts of the body Politick of the
World which is Gods kingdom general. And yet there is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt all ſocieties of men, as men, by vertue whereof
they are all to regard the common good of mankinde <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In
like manner doth Chriſt in his Church: when beleevers are
babes, he would have them the more abſolutely to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to their ſpiritual Parents: when growne up they have a
greater freedom, and are to be otherwiſe governed: the Apoſtle
bids <hi>Timothy not to rebuke an Elder, but to intreat them as Fathers,</hi> &amp;c.
So when the whole Church was but one company, they were
governed as ſuch, and by one company of Officers that had
charge over them all, and every one particularly, according to
their ſeveral offices: As the Paſtors to teach every one; the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to watch over every one; the Deacons to provide for every
one <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this Family of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſecond <hi>Noah</hi>
(as <hi>Peter</hi> implies him to be) ſpreading into many particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,<note place="margin">1 Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 20.</note>
and Nations: the Scripture <hi>never</hi> (I ſay <hi>never)</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
them as one viſible body in reſpect of their outward Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and Government, but ſtill ſpeaks of them as many: the
Churches of Judea, which yet under the Legal government
was but one (the Church Act. 7.) pray, why this difference of
ſpeech; but to confute this oneneſſe viſible of all Churches?
When they are called the Church, it reflects upon them as one in
Faith, Spirit, kind of worſhip and Government, as the place
alledged Eph. 4. 1. plainly expreſſes. And yet I denie not that
theſe particular Churches are to have a regard to the common
good of all Churches, and not to act as if they were in relation
to none but themſelves; and for this end alſo it is convenient and
ſometimes neceſſary, if it may be done, to aſſociate with other
Churches for mutual aſſiſtance, and to meet in Synods and
Councels together, as did the Church of Antioch and Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
and the Churches in the Primitive times. The kingdom
of England, and ſo other Nations are bound in ſome caſes, to
aſſociate with other Kingdoms, and are actually aſſociated with
them, as alſo was <hi>Solomon</hi> with the king of Aegypt, and <hi>Hiram</hi>
king of Tyre: but is England not to act as an Independent
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58801:37"/>
Kingdom; from France, Spain, Scotland, or the Kingdom of
Iſrael, or Independent (ſaving the Articles of Aſſociation) for
all<note n="*" place="margin">See the Houſe of Commons anſw. to the Scots pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, about the Kings perſon. Suppoſ. 7.</note> that.</p>
            <p>They add in the ſame place as a prevention of an objection:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">That as the mutual conſent of particular men and families
orderly into Churches gives them Power and Authority,
<hi>(Eccleſiasticall)</hi> one over another,<note place="margin">Object.</note> without deſtroying the
liberty of ſuch perſons and families, but helping of it: ſo alſo
in this aſſociation of Churches, their mutuall conſent orderly
regulated, gives them a ſufficient call for their Elders to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
their power of Elders, (over the Congregations in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
without impeaching the liberties, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But 1. This ſimilitude doth not truely repreſent theſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
opinion:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> who hold that the <hi>Catholicke viſible Church is
before any</hi> particular Church: and is the <hi>first ſubject</hi> of all
Church Power: and the mother out of which particular
Churches ſpring: whereas this ſimilitude makes the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Churches to exiſt. Firſt as mothers to the univerſall: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to their expreſſion, now nothing elſe but a collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or aggregation of them. Secondly, This ſeems <hi>inconſiſtent</hi>
with the former reaſoning; for if by <hi>Divine Right</hi> all particular
Churches are but one univerſall and generall Church or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and all particular men and families: by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are to aſſociate with ſome particular Church, then have the
Churches right to this common government, not from any
<hi>conſent,</hi> but from Gods <hi>inſtitution:</hi> whether the members or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<hi>conſent or conſent not:</hi> yea, and hence is it that <hi>Churches and
Presbyteries</hi> may, by our <hi>brethrens principles,</hi> bee <hi>excommunicated:</hi> for
we may ſuppoſe ſome Churches will not conſent to ſuch aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</p>

               <hi>Objection</hi> If it bee ſaid,<note place="margin">Object.</note> This conſent grounds the relation
to this or that particular Church with which they ſhall aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate.</p>
            <p>I reply,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that this removes not the objection; for in generall
they are ingaged unto ſubjection to the univerſall Church, and
the particular Church to which they joyne is but a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that they may the better bee under the univerſall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58801:38"/>
3. The caſe is not the ſame betwixt particular perſons, and
Families joyning into ſome particular Congregation; and the
aſſociation of ſeveral Churches into one body: much leſſe of
<hi>all</hi> into one generall Common-wealth: For the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
plainly confutes it. A man or family is ordinarily bound
to be of ſome Kingdom, Common-wealth, or State; but it
doth not therefore follow that all States or Kingdoms muſt needs
be aſſociated together into one general Common-wealth:
neither is the reaſon the ſame. For a whole Kingdom, State,
or Society is better able to defend it ſelf againſt injuries, and
to accomodate it ſelf with neceſſaries, than a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Familie; and what is wanting may be ſufficiently
ſupplyed by meer Voluntary, Arbitrary, and Temporary
Aſſociation in a Common-wealth; which in a Family or
Perſon is not ſo.</p>
            <p>4. It muſt not be ſaid by rational men, that 1. All men
are bound to aſſociate, and ſo all Churches. 2. They being
aſſociated are to be governed; by others which are more then
themſelves; and yet their liberty is not diminiſhed, but ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
if the Reverend <hi>Aſsembly</hi> ſhall ſay, that their ſecurity and
ſafety may poſſibly bee thereby ſtrengthened, it might in
ſome caſes be admitted. But ſurely, as the liberty of a
particular man or family, is not the ſame before he is bound
to others, and afterward, though his ſafety may be the more,
ſo here.</p>
            <p>5. How are we ſlidden from one Integral entire body, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from one Church at Jeruſalem &amp;c. to a body made up of
voluntary Aſſociations. The Kingdom of England is one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre
Common-wealth or body, corporate of it ſelfe intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
(politically:) the Vnited Provinces are one by aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and voluntary Aſſociation. But theſe two Reipublicks do
greatly differ: now the Church general is aſſerted by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Aſſembly,</hi> to be one Common-wealth, and Body cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate;
to whom as one, yea and as firſt, before all
particular Churches: The Officers, Ordinances, and
Governement of the Church is concredited and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Of like incompoſſibility is what is there added for illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58801:38"/>
ſake, <hi>viz.</hi> That this joyneing is ſuch as proceeds,
<hi>Ex charitate, ex debito mutuae ſocietatis colendae:</hi> as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Friends and Equalls: <hi>Non ex debito inferioris condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis
ad praeſtandum obſequium.</hi> As betwixt Maſters and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
For what is this? (but <hi>Verba dare, rem auferre.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Honourable Houſes of Parliament, and Aſſembly of
Divines, Kingdome and Churches of England: take their
liberty now to reforme the State and Church, as they judge
agreeable to Law, Reaſon, and Religion. This opinion by
conſequence makes this Kingdome but a <hi>Depending Member</hi> of
the Vniverſall Monarchy of the World; and doth expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the <hi>Church or Churches in this Nation to act but as ſuch in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Vniverſal Church.</hi> Whence it inevitably and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows; that they ought to be in actuall aſſociation with all
the reſt of the Nations, and Churches of the World: theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an hundred times more in number, have power at pleaſure
to over-vote them, and to governe them: and yet muſt the
Parliament, Aſſembly, the Nation, and Churches of this
Kingdome: even when actually ſo overborne, perhaps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their minde, and wills, fancie and coneit themſelves
as free, and enjoying as much liberty as now they do. May
wee not aſcend by a predicamentall Ladder <hi>(Claſſibus Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalium.</hi>
Kek.) muſt it bee by a Tranſcendent, even to
Reaſon it ſelf?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another confirmation of this third Argument,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Light of Nature.</note> 
               <hi>is taken from
the</hi> Light of Nature: <hi>which requires, ſay theſe Reverend Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi>
that the meanes <hi>for (the edification of)</hi> Particular
Chriſtians, ſhould be as applyable to whole companies of them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
Gods word hath ſome where forbidden it.</p>
            <p>To which I return, 1. That this <hi>Light of Nature</hi> ſhould not be
too much urged, for it will plead hard for Epiſcopacie and a Pope.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, will buſſle ſhrewdly here. 2. That the method of
the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> is to follow the Scriptures in matters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, and not to move in them where the Scriptures
ſtand ſtill, and are ſilent; hence I note in the ranging of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of the <hi>Miniſters of London</hi> in their divine right of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie:<note place="margin">Divine right of Presbyterie, in the Analyſ. of the book.</note>
that they place the <hi>light of Nature</hi> firſt, which though they
do as intending it for the loweſt ſtep, yet it is not juſtifiable to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58801:39"/>
make it any at all in the things of Chriſt; but where it hath ſome
precedent hint from Scripture. 3. The light of Nature I have
ſhown before, doth make a difference betwixt the neceſſity of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociating
of particular perſons, and of Common-wealths (ſuch
as the Church is ſaid to be,) and differenceth alſo the aſſociations
of the one and the other: making the former a neceſſary one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſingleneſſe of Corporation and Government; but the
other meerly an <hi>arbitrary and temporary friendſhip.</hi> 4. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
hath more to <hi>forbid</hi> all Churches to aſſociate into one body
Vniverſal Politick; then it hath that particular Churches ſhould
be entire body Politicks or Corporations of themſelves; ſeeing
there is often <hi>expreſſe</hi> mention of particular viſible governing
Churches, but none <hi>expreſly</hi> of an univerſal one. 5. I retort the
way of reaſoning; the <hi>light of Nature</hi> teaches there is not the
ſame reaſon betwixt <hi>particular perſons,</hi> and <hi>Common-wealths</hi> in this
particular, and therefore not to bee made all one, unleſſe the
Scripture had commanded it.</p>
            <p>The laſt particular which may ſeem to be (though not brought
here by them for that end) a confirmation of this Tenet, is (by
occaſion) alledged in page 61. from the parallel of the <hi>Church of
Christ</hi> with the <hi>Church of the Iews,</hi> to whom <hi>the whole Tribe of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi
was given as their Miniſtry. 1. As to one body together, when in the
Wilderneſſe. 2. To them as one body fixed, and diſperſed in Canaan.</hi>
This is replyed to before; I repeat now, That theſe being and
living together in one <hi>ſmall</hi> Territory; and meeting all the Males
<hi>three times a yeer</hi> in one place, <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> at one <hi>meeting houſe,</hi> the
<hi>Temple:</hi> doth not argue the Church ſcattered throughout the
World to be therefore one: no more then becauſe one Kingdom
may be one Common-wealth, and have Officers in common,
therefore, all Kingdoms muſt be one. 2. Beſides; this inſtance
engages all the Churches to meet at ſome one place: to have one
chief Governour beſides the Elders in common, with ſuch other
inconveniences as are uſually urged againſt this parallel.</p>
            <p>We have done with the Arguments; one paſſage or two I
ſhall animadvert upon, and (with due reſpect) take my leave.
Whileſt they endeavour to maintain: <q rend="inline margQuotes">That it is not left free,
but is a duty of every Congregation; to aſſociate with others:</q>
They ſay: <q rend="inline margQuotes">All are enjoyned to be of ſome Congregation; but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58801:39"/>
when they joyn to this rather then to that, the mutual conſent
between them and the Congregation with whom they joyn, is
that which immediately gives them that ſpecial relation one to
another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> From which I note: That here is implyed a
liberty in particular Chriſtians, to joyn to ſuch Churches as they
ſhall ſee cauſe. If this be ſo, how is it that the violation of <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
limits</hi> is ſo inſiſted on (though oft-times manifeſtly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to edification, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and thoſe who keep not unto their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
preſented and perſecuted; and thoſe miniſters that admit
Chriſtians of other Pariſhes, reſented as the deſtroyers of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Congregations, and ſuch who <hi>(novo &amp; inaudito exemplo)</hi>
gather <hi>Churches out of Churches?</hi> Now it will not ſalve to ſay,
1. That at the firſt conſtitution of Pariſhes there was ſuch volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
conſent: ſeeing 1. Which Pariſhes did ſo, doth not appear:
And ſecondly, In many, 'tis evident they were caſt into pariſhes
by thoſe who were lords of thoſe Mannors. 3. Neither is it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
probable, that the whole Nation to one man did volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
receive the Goſpel it ſelf: ſeeing fraud and force (neither
of which are voluntary motives) were the tooles of Popery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which the converſion National was made.</p>
            <p>4. And though at firſt the union of ſuch might be convenient:
yet afterward it may become an hinderance. Yet am not I for
the drawing of any Godly, Able, and faithful miniſters people
from him, who is for the ſubſtance of Reformation, though with
many defects in leſſer things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor 2. will it be ſufficient to ſay,
that when they chooſe to dwell in ſuch pariſhes, that then they
conſent to be of ſuch a Congregation: for we know men do that
on <hi>civil,</hi> and oft-times <hi>neceſſitated</hi> grounds, as moſt convenient for
lively-hood; when yet they are altogether unſatisfied either in
the <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Congregation.</hi>

as there was then no other viſible Church; except, as we ſaid
before, we follow thoſe who hold that <hi>Iethro, Iob, &amp;c.</hi> lived in

            <p>2. Whether the <hi>Covenant</hi> in the Primitive time ran in ſuch a
forme, doth not appear to me: but for the ſenſe of it, it may be
admitted, according to what hath been often ſaid; men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
and may promiſe to do the duties of their relations to
thoſe to whom they have any tye, and ſo in that reſpect are one

the government may be viſible in ſeveral parts; but not as one in

yet did they not depend one on another in point of Government;

            <p>3. By one Church we are let into all Churches in reſpect of

            </p>
            <p>His 10. and laſt Argument, <q rend="inline margQuotes">It is generally ſuppoſed that all
Churches have power to act together, and to expect power of
Juriſdiction in a general councel. <hi>Calvin</hi> is expreſſe <hi>(Inſt. l. 4.
c. 8.</hi> and 9.) therefore the Church is one viſible body, elſe it
could not ſo act.</q> 
               <hi>Operari ſequitur eſse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> It hath been granted that a company in ſome ſenſe
may be a <hi>viſible body</hi> or <hi>Corporation,</hi> in reſpect of ſome more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and leſſer acts; but not properly ſo, and in reſpect of the
parts of Government and Juriſdiction properly ſo called.</p>
            <p>2. The acting of a general Councel, yea though it were to
the higheſt points of Juriſdiction, as <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi>
may proceed on our grounds, and not on the viſible
and integral oneneſſe of all Churches into a Corporation; for it
may proceed on the ground of <hi>Voluntary aſſociation,</hi> and <hi>communion
of Churches,</hi> whereby all particular Churches are willing to unite
freely, and not of neceſſity, their power; and to act for the uſe
of their particular bodies, and in order to the whole; but not as
being one incorporated Reipublick; nor as having any new, or
properly larger power (being met) as ſuch a body, but onely
by <hi>accident,</hi> as being <hi>aggregated</hi> and collected together. After
which manner was <hi>the first Presbyterian Church erected,</hi>

the ſeveral congregations uniting voluntarily, as ſo many diſtinct
bodies into one aggregated body.</hi> And as the Kingdom of England
and Scotland, and ſome free Cities in Germany upper and lower
act together: which neither makes a new or greater power in the
aſſembled or general body, nor deſtroyes the entire power of the
particular ſocieties: in which ſenſe our opinion would admit of
the power of a general Councel: but I cannot owne it; becauſe
it is partly groundleſſe in Scripture; partly impoſſible, and partly
dangerous in the thing it ſelf, as hath been obſerved above.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58801:42"/>
3. Not all acting together, nor all acts that in ſome ſenſe may
be ſaid to be acts of power, doth imply an oneneſſe of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or juriſdiction properly ſo called. I have ſhewed before
that a Colledge of Phyſicians may meet to conſult and give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in point of health, which they have power by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and by the Lawes to do: and the patient is obliged
by the lawes of Nature, prudence and conſcience; unleſſe there
appear a ſufficient impediment: but this neither argueth that all
theſe Phyſicians are of one Colledge, yea or Kingdom; nor that
they have power to conſtrain the Patient to obey. <hi>Calvin</hi> in the
very chapters quoted by this Author, he laies down ground for
the overthrow of this opinion:<note place="margin">Cap. 8, Sect. 9.</note> as where he teacheth, <q rend="inline margQuotes">That
as the writings of men though godly, ſo neither the authority
either of particular Churches, or of the whole Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
is ſuch, as was the authority of the Apoſtles, for they
may not eſtabliſh any new Article of Faith,<note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note> &amp;c.</q> And alſo
anſwers divers of the Arguments of this Author, and the other:
by affirming <q rend="inline margQuotes">that the promiſes of not leaving the Church, of
guiding it in all truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> (and ſo we might add all the other
almoſt before mentioned) are made NO LESSE TO EACH
BELEEVER, THEN TO THE WHOLE CHVRCH:
which I deſire may be obſerved.<note place="margin">cap. 9. ſect. 2.</note> Again, He makes the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of a general Councel to depend on that promiſe:<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> 
               <hi>When two
or three are gathered in my name</hi> &amp;c. And then ſaith, <hi>That this as
well agreeth to any particular company of Chriſtians, as to a generall
Councel.</hi> 2. It doth not appear to me in thoſe chapters that hee
ownes general Councells on any ſuch grounds: nor do I ſee how
he can, by what he ſaith on Eph. 4. 11. above cited. 3. If theſe
Councells he there approves did excommunicate &amp;c. yet he doth
not mention his approbation of them in thoſe things, and wee
may apprehend he might count ſuch actions among thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of their failings which he there enumerates.</p>
            <p>2. After his Argument he makes the objection M. <hi>Hudſon</hi> had
done,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">The whole Church hath no viſible head, <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is
no one Viſible Corporation or body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He replies to this 1. <hi>Particular Churches are viſible Churches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
               <hi>though

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58801:43"/>
perſon, or one viſible Society of Officers? 2. They may all
meet as one viſible body: the univerſal Church then muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meet ſo, or elſe have ſome viſible officers univerſal over the

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly he ſaith,</hi> Christ is ſuppoſed the Viſible Head in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But that is not the queſtion, but what viſible exiſtent
head there is on earth, by whom it may appear one Viſible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
As we ſaw before out of <hi>Calvin</hi> on Epheſ. 4. 11. 2. How
can we contain Chriſt viſible properly.</p>
            <p>3. He ſaith, <q rend="inline margQuotes">The Church is one ſo as to act ordinarily, as
one, <hi>diviſim,</hi> dividedly, and yet by reaſon of the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in all Churches, one act of power done in one Church,
is by authority of the univerſal Church, and reaches to all
Churches as excommunication out of one, is excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But 1. There was never any Society or Corporation, that acted
as one dividedly and in parts unleſſe it did firſt act as one <hi>joyntly</hi>
together, and in a body, wherein power was given to ſuch divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
bodies to act ſo, unleſſe it were upon ſome ſudden and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
accident that required immediate action before the body
could convene.</p>
            <p>2. Every Society though it may act in parts, as a Kingdome in
ſeverall Corporations, and a Corporation in ſeverall Wards, or
Halls, and Companies, yet hath it withall one common, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and ſtanding officer or officers <hi>viſible to governe in chiefe,</hi> to whom
all maine cauſes are referred &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But 3. That the particular Church that acteth in the right of
the univerſall Church by reaſon of mutuall conſent in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
is not proved by that <hi>medium:</hi> for mutuall conſent, may be
voluntary and accidentall, and ſo a figure onely: whereas hee is
to prove that all Churches are neceſſarily eſſentially, by way of
inſtitution, and for ever to be one body, whether they conſent
or conſent not. But a particular Church acteth, firſt, In the right
of Chriſt, who is the firſt ſubject of Church power, (Matth. 28. 28.)
Secondly, it acteth in the right of a Church, that is of a Societie
that hath embraced the faith of Chriſt, which, as a Church inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
and eſſentially is the next ſubject of Church power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58801:43"/>

to have ſaid before me, whom at the writing of this above, I had
not ſeene in the particular.</p>
            <p>4. That <hi>he that is excommunicated out of one Church</hi> (if duely) <hi>is
excluded out of all:</hi> is not becauſe the whole Church is one viſible
body; but becauſe all the particular Churches agree in <hi>nature, and
eſſence of Doctrine, Worſhip and Government,</hi> ſo that he that is unfit to
be a member of one, is ſo of all: becauſe they all require the ſame
<hi>eſſentiall conditions,</hi> as he that is cut off by the hand of Juſtice, for
violation of the Lawes of nature, in one Common wealth, is cut
out of all, yet it doth not follow that all men are one Common
wealth. Or as hee that is out-lawed in one Corporation juſtly, is
outlawed in all Congregations virtually, and upon the matter,
though not directly and formally, till hee be ſo declared by them,
if thoſe Corporations go all by the ſame lawes (for ſubſtance) and
government; though it doth not follow that theſe ſeverall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
are therefore one, or under one generall body, (which as
I take it is the caſe betwixt England and Scotland,<note place="margin">See Dr <hi>Auſtin</hi> of Allegeance, in <hi>Calvins</hi> caſe.</note> where by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of union under one King, though the governments remaine
diſtinct, yet one that is borne in either Kingdome, is not an Alien,
but a Free-borne Denizon of both; and ſo by conſequence (as I
apprehend, for I may be miſtaken in a Law notion, and I bring it
but for illuſtration) hee that is out-lawed in one Kingdome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
remaine under the protection of the Lawes of the other: and
yet the bodies are diſtinct in power and government, though not
divided wholy, but in ſome reſpect. So in the Church.</p>
            <p>In the third and laſt place he comes to authorities: But here ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of the Presbyterians:</hi> viz. <hi>that there is one General viſible Church of Chriſt
on earth, whereof all particular Churches and ſingle Congregations are
but as ſimilar parts of the whole:</hi> There is not onely no one Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
could hitherto be ſhewed to be of that judgement, till the
ſitting of this Aſſembly, (in favour of whom <hi>Apolonius</hi> wrote) but
alſo divers above evidenced to be againſt it, and acknowledged ſo
by the Authors of this opinion: <hi>Plain dealing is the beſt policie:</hi> But
to their arguments, 1. They urge the forenamed place, <q rend="inline margQuotes">1 Cor.
12. and ſay, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of one Generall Church, becauſe
he ſaith [Church,] not Churches. 2. Becauſe he ſpeaks of it in ſuch
a latitude, as to comprehend all gifts of the ſpirit, all members,
all officers ordinary and extraordinary, which cannot agree to a
particular Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Wee have ſhewed that the Church taken eſſentially,
is one: though Integrally and in reſpect of its exiſtence and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
government, it is as manifold, as there are particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Now to the Church in the former ſence, are thoſe things
given, <hi>all men</hi> in eſſence and nature are one: to <hi>man</hi> in this reſpects <hi>is
given Governours and Government, arts and gifts,</hi> &amp;c. muſt all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be one Common wealth?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:58801:45"/>
2. Or elſe, which I rather adhered to; the Church is taken
in that place <hi>myſtically,</hi> for the whole ſociety or family in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth, as was then evidenced. 3. All theſe Officers
and gifts were given to the Church of Corinth immediately,
though not ſolely and onely. The light of the Sun is given
immediately to that particular place on which it ſhines, with all
the brightneſſe and influence of it, but not ſolely. 4. In this
<hi>ſuperintendency</hi> over the whole Church, whether ſeverally or
joyntly, the Scripture hath inſtituted no Succeſſors to the Apoſtles.
5. By Apoſtles might be meant the chief Officers of Corinth.</p>
            <p>A ſecond place (and wherein they handle this ſubject more
expreſly) is part 2. chap. 8. where their firſt Argument is drawne
onely from thoſe places that name the Church (indefinitely) as
<hi>on this Rock will I build my Church. He hath ſet ſome in the Church Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe have been replyed to above. 2. They do not
make the whole Viſible Catholick Church one <hi>[Organical]</hi> but
one <hi>[Similar]</hi> body in our Brethrens firſt aſſertion: But <hi>Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>

whom in this inconſiſtencie, opinion and expreſſion, they
have either followed, or he ſome of them. 3. Next they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to prove that the word <hi>Ministry, Ordinances,</hi> and particularly
<hi>Baptiſme,</hi> are given to the generall viſible Church: (the method
Mr <hi>Hudſon</hi> uſed, <hi>Moſes</hi> mother was his Nurſe alſo) whence it will
follow; that there is a Generall Viſible or Catholique Church.
Therefore I ſhall take this for a third head of Arguments, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to it.</p>
            <p>1. The word <hi>Ministery, Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. all of them are given
immediately to every particular Church, where they are, and
where there may be uſe of them; though not ſolely: and the
firſt two places quoted, ſpeak immediately of the Church of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15. Eph. 4. 11. 1 Cor. 12.</note>
