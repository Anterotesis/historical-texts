         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Settling to diſtract and divide you, for they ſee
no other means to deſtroy you, and thoſe with you,
whoſe welfare is bound up in yours. And in this you
are a reſemblance of the Kingdom of whom a great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician

niſi a ſeipſo:</hi> and according to this Axiom have the
Enemies of our Religion and State framed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.
The zeal of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> carried them on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
at firſt to furious attempts, as in 88. and Powder
Treaſon; but when they ſaw they were not able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
that way, they put on the Foxes skin, and have moſt
ſtudiouſly raiſed and fomented jealouſies and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
betwixt the King and Parliament, betwixt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb facs="tcp:116087:3"/>
and Kingdom: not to mention thoſe ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
lately ſtirred, which I would not be ſo far guiltie
of keeping alive as to name them. So hath it fated with
your renowned City, you have been to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Liberty of this Kingdom, what this Kingdom
hath been to the Proteſtant Religion in other parts, a
great ſupport. The oppoſing party as impatient of ſuch
an adverſary (you know) directed the firſt fruits of
their ſtrength aud malice againſt you they were indeed
interrupted in their way by the battell at Edge-hill, but
as ſoon as they were recruted and recovered, how eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they purſued their former purpoſe, <hi>Brainford</hi> can
witneſſe: but the next day when the City appeared ſo
unanimouſly, and heartily, for their own and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
defence, they ſaw it was neceſſary to take an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
courſe, and try if they could become your maſters
by deſigne and fraud, and bring you to a cheaper ruine
by making you deſtroy one another. To this purpoſe
ſeverall courſes have been taken, and not altogether
without effect. But ſo long as there was a Common
Enemy appeared, there was a diverſion of the humors,
which ſince our late ſemblance of Peace have broken
out into violent and ſtrange diſeaſes, which have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
diſtempered the health, and go on to endanger the
life of that famous City. The beſt expedient to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
this great evill, were doubtleſſe a reconciliation of
thoſe perſons and parties who are now diſtant, but were
in the beſt eſtate of the City affectionate and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.
This is not onely policy but piety, as by a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
peruſall of <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. from the 13. ver. to the end may
appear. Experience witneſſes the hard task and fate of
reconcilers, who lye betwixt the extremes as corn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Milſtones: But yet I muſt profeſſe my ſelf
one of them, and I had rather they grinde me then one
another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:116087:3"/>
To the accompliſhing this great work, a ſpeciall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wiſdom that is from above, which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>Jam. 3. ult.</hi> is very neceſſary, which let us beg
on the behalf of all Chriſtians, eſpecially thoſe whoſe
influence into publick affairs requires a greater meaſure.
A probable expedient hereunto may be this, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
on both hands be layd aſide, and perſons that
drive them on. For of each party there are ſome parts
ſo heterogeneous, that there is little hope they ſhould
ever mingle together, neither is it beneficiall that they
ſhould while they ſo remain, for they tend to diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is, to deſtruction. And give leave to him that
hath many faults to complain of one: That is, that thoſe
who have and might have agreed, have put ſo little
truſt in God, and ſo little mutuall confidence in each
other, that they have choſen rather to ſupport and
ſtrengthen their factions (for that it's come to) with
perſons leſſe deſiring their welfare then themſelves of
one another. And therefore whatſoever perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or practiſes tend to bring us under old revenges,
or new confuſions, ſhould carefully be avoided.</p>
            <p>There is hardly any man who is not in reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that the continuance of this diſtance and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
betwixt good men will certainly expoſe them
to the power and revenge of them who equally hate
both, and yet how few are there whom paſſion or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
will ſuffer to act accordingly. You will pardon
the mention of this odious word <hi>Faction,</hi> it is of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
conſequence, and deſerves to be branded, for
it will undoubtedly ruine both ſides, eſpecially when
there is a third to wait the advantage, and the iſſue.
And he that would be free from this evill, muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately
affect his own opinion or intereſt, which
<pb facs="tcp:116087:4"/>
will expoſe him to that inordinate courſe of making
parties to maintain it, but be content to have all his
Propoſitions fairly examined; neither muſt he look at
perſons more then things, as weak and angry men are
wont to do, having ſome mens perſons ſo in admiration,
as they moſt cry up, or at leaſt juſtifie or excuſe all their
wayes; and others in ſuch deteſtation, as to undervalue,
blaſt and blemiſh all they ſay or do. It's hard to finde

be declined: or ſo evill, that there may not be ſome uſe
of him: and if we could abſtract from perſons, and let
things and actions take their own demerits, much inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and miſery might be prevented. There have been
many viciſſitudes of late, and thoſe that have been

            <p>Firſt, a bleſſed diſcovery of the Doctrine of free grace and
ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, handled principally in the firſt
Chapter, additionally in the 2d. and 3d.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an earneſt and preſſing exhortation, to walk as
becomes that grace which is revealed in Chriſt Jeſus, with
particular directions thereunto, which is the ſcope and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the latter part of the Epiſtle. And herein hath he
left an imitable pattern to all thoſe who would approve
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116087:5"/>
themſelves able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, who muſt be
equally carefull to preach ſalvation by Chriſt, and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
through him.</p>
            <p>To preach grace without duty tends to Libertiniſme, to
preſſe duty without diſcovering the myſtery of the Goſpel,
which is juſtification and ſalvation, the righteouſneſſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<hi>ſcil.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt our ſuretie in the Covenant of grace,
leads to formality, and the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and
Phariſees which is ſhort of the kingdom of heaven. We muſt
declare the whole counſell of God, which is to live in Chriſt
by faith, and to Chriſt by obedience; and it is wiſdom to
unite them in the ſame diſcourſe as much as may be, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that men are ſo ſubject to disjoyne them. And we may
learn from this bleſſed Apoſtle, as our matter, ſo our method,
which is to lay the foundation of all holy obedience in the
doctrines of faith and juſtification,<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 33.</note> which tend to make the
tree good by tranſplanting it from the degenerate into the
true Vine, and that muſt be done before the fruit can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
good: the moulding of men by the force of outward
rules and precepts, into a kinde of Goſpel converſation, is not
acceptable or laſting, unleſſe the heart be inwardly changed,
and renewed by ſpirituall ingrafture, to which Evangelicall
diſpenſations are moſt ſerviceable, alwayes ſuppoſed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of convictions of ſin and miſery. The doctrines of free
grace without ſuperſtructures of holineſſe, are but a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without a building, which is ridiculous: the accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of duty and ſervice without the foundation of faith
and regeneration,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 10, 11</note> are a building without a foundation, which
is but ruinous. The Lord make us wiſe builders to lay the
right foundation, and build proportionably thereupon. <hi>Non

            </p>
            <p>Thus much I thought fit to premiſe, that I might not break
in upon my Text, which fals to be in the latter part of the
Epiſtle among the exhortations and directions unto holineſſe.
In which, becauſe the brevity of an Epiſtle would not ſuffer
an exact enumeration of particulars, the Apoſtle layes down
ſome generall and comprehenſive rules, and gives many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
in few words, as in the text, <hi>Walk circumſpectly,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116087:5"/>
the time,</hi> are not ſingle, but comprehenſive inſtructions;
which the Apoſtle urges from a double argument.</p>
            <p>The firſt precept concerning circumſpect or exact walking,
is enforced from the conſideration of the condition of the
perſons, as we find by retyring to <hi>ver. 8. Ye were ſometimes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but now are ye light in the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> walk as children of the light.</hi>
Time was when you were not onely in the da<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k, but abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
darkneſſe; and then your ſtumblings and uneven goings,
though they were not to be warranted, yet they were not to
be woundred at; but now you are in the light, and the light is
in you: therefore make uſe of your eyes, and walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly.</p>
            <p>The ſecond concerning redemption of time, is perſwaded
by conſideration of the conditions of the times, <hi>the dayes are
evill:</hi> opportunities of doing or receiving good are rare, and
tranſvolant, therefore watch them, and improve them. The
explication of the words ſhall be interlined in handling the
Propoſitions, to which I now proceed.</p>
            <p>And the firſt I ſhall mention is rather a ſuppoſition then a
propoſition, which yet will take up moſt of the time: and it's
this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are ſome dayes fitly termed evill dayes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prop. 1.</note> There need be no
doubt made of this expreſſion, or the ſufficient ground of it,
when it is uſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Maſter of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
or rather by the holy Ghoſt, the wiſdom of God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by him.</p>
            <p>The method I propound to my ſelf in improving this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
is this.</p>
            <p>1. To ſhew in what reſpect times <hi>are</hi> or are <hi>called</hi> evill.</p>
            <p>2. To make an inquiſition whether theſe preſent times are
not ſo.</p>
            <p>3. To adventure upon ſome eſſayes and overtures at leaſt,
of bettering theſe evill times.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, and that by way of remotion.</p>
            <p>1. Times are not naturally evill, nothing create, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
as time is ſaid to be, is ſo; God looked upon time for
diſtinguiſhing and meaſuring whereof he appointed the Sun
and Moon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. and ſaw it good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:116087:6"/>
2. It is not morally evill: nothing is capable of morall or
ſinfull evill, but the rationall creature indued with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and will, and ſubjected to ſome morall rule. God
hath made thoſe creatures obnoxious to this greateſt evill,
whom he made capable of the greateſt good, as men and
Angels.</p>
            <p>3. It is not Aſtrologically evil, as ſome men who would be
wiſe beyond ſobriety vainly pretend; influences of heavenly
bodies upon the earth, and the fruits of it muſt be granted, but
that is rather good and ill weather (to which if our Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack
men would keep themſelves, they would have enough
to do) then good or evill times; but that ſuch and ſuch poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and conjunctions in Planets, ſhould infer what the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
actions, events of rationall and free men ſhould be,
is eaſily ſaid and hardly proved by Scripture or reaſon, I mean
in words at length, and not in figures. What a quick and
croſſe revolution of the heavens was there when <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Eſau</hi> were born, that men ſo neer in birth ſhould be ſo diſtant
and different in manners and events? What ſecret or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
box is there, wherein thoſe ſtrong impreſſions at nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
are conſerved, notwithſtanding the mutations in heaven
and earth, the bodies and minds of men? The holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
mentions ſignes in the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, <hi>Luk.</hi>
21. 25. but thoſe are extraordinary, and ſuch, as theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
have little to do with. And indeed that trade had
failed long ſince, had it not been upheld by two rotten props,
ſuperſtitious credulity on the one hand, and fallacious ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
on the other. But I diſmiſſe them with this character,
that they may juſtly be accounted fools among wiſe men, as
they are accounted wiſe men among fools.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak poſitively. Times are evill, though not naturally
or inherently; yet adherently and concomitantly Times are
thoſe veſſels which contain all actions and accidents, and
are denominated according to what they are filled with;
ſometimes pleaſant, and ſometimes ſuch wherein there is no
pleaſure. They are <hi>good</hi> times in which good befals, <hi>evill</hi> in
which evil: &amp; this appears by Scripture expreſſions, where the
<hi>day of evill</hi> and an <hi>evill day</hi> are uſed indifferently;<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 17. 17. 18.</note> and <hi>good dayes</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:116087:6"/>
is all one <hi>with dayes to ſee or enjoy good:</hi> as appears by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 12. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. For the more full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of this expreſſion, it is beſt to conſult with Scripture,
and ſee how it is there uſed, and I ſhall mention three places
to that purpoſe.<note place="margin">Gen. 47 9.</note> Firſt, that of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who in the account that
he gives of himſelf to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaith, <hi>Few and evill have the dayes
of the yeers of my life been:</hi> that is, troubleſome, full of labour
and ſorrow; for the word rendred evill, though it ſignifie both
evill of ſin and puniſhment, yet muſt be taken rather for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
evill. And who ſo reflects upon <hi>Jacobs</hi> pilgrimage, and
conſiders his baniſhment from his fathers houſe for fear of
<hi>Eſau,</hi> before whoſe envy he could not ſtand, his hard enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
with his Uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> the vexations of his wives,
the ſtupration of his daughter, the ſlaughter of the Siche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
by <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> the defiling his concubine by <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi>
the ſelling of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the parting with the ſtaffe of his age
<hi>Benjamin:</hi> I ſay, he that conſiders theſe things, may well bear
with that expreſſion of <hi>Jacob, Evill dayes.</hi> And in this ſenſe is it
uſed alſo, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 1. where old age being a bundle of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which are reckoned up in the beginning of that Chapter,
is called, <hi>The evill day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is uſed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 13. where we finde mention
made of an evill day, which is the day of tentation, the time
wherein Satan taking advantage (it may be) of ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
evils, applyes himſelf with all his ſtrength and ſubtilty
to diſturbe and deſtroy a poore ſoul; and this is a worſe day
then the day of affliction: for afflictions many times drive
from ſin, but tentations have a tendency to it, and the neerer
ſin the greateſt evill, the worſe may any thing be juſtly
deemed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is another expreſſion concerning times,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the laſt dayes, ſaith,
there ſhall be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, perillous, difficult, or dangerous
times; and declares wherein the perill of them ſhould conſiſt,
<hi>ſe:</hi> in many corruptions there enumerated, which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
bring many ſnares and puniſhments along with them.
So that out of theſe places layd together, we may more then
gueſſe at the Apoſtles meaning in this mention of evill dayes,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116087:7"/>
which ſeems to be this: the dayes are evil, that is, made up of
a complication of ſins, ſnares, and miſeries, which the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> imports, which ſignifies not onely ungodly, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
and troubleſome; which by the way intimates the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe
that attends wickednes ſo c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſe, that one word holds
them, and one world muſt.</p>
            <p>Of that which hath been ſaid, I ſhall make no other appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
then to take notice of the difference betwixt the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
and Aſtrologicall diſtinction and judgement of times.
<hi>Diviners</hi> ſay, that unhappie <hi>conjunctions</hi> in the Stars produce
ill times, croſſe accidents and occurrents: but <hi>Divines, Quanto
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ctius,</hi> that not conjunctions, but corruptions in men are the
cauſes of evill times: and he that can take heed of <hi>ſins,</hi> need
not fear <hi>ſtars. Etſi fractus illabatur orbis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I proceed to the ſecond thing propounded in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that is a diſquiſition whether the
times we live in may not juſtly be called evill times. And this
is a work not unneceſſary, becauſe there are many duties that
depend upon a right underſtanding of times; men know not
how to order their prayers, praiſes, ſervices, to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
unleſſe they have ſome inſpection to the times. It is
not expected that every man ſhould have a politicall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the times, but a prudentiall and practicall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is very expedient: the former frequently produces but
a ſerving of the time; but the latter a ſaving and improving
time.<note place="margin">1 Chron 12. 32.</note> It was the commendation of the men of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> that
they were underſtanding in the times, and knew what Iſrael
ought to do.</p>
            <p>If therefore inquirie be made, whether theſe times are evil,
or not, the verdict may be returned without going from the
barre, the caſe is ſo evident that they are evill, whether evill
be taken with reſpect to ſin or puniſhment. But the queſtion is
of that moment, that a generall anſwer is not ſufficient; let it
therefore be conſidered wherein the evill of theſe times eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
conſiſts.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the determination of this queſtion is lyable
to much exception, in regard of the different thoughts of men,
who make the evil of the times to ſtand in things that croſſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116087:7"/>
their own opinions and intereſts: I ſhall take a ſafe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
courſe, and ſteer by the infallible compaſſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and have a more eſpeciall eye upon the 24. Chap. of <hi>Mat:</hi>
wherein our Saviour makes a deſcription of evill and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
times that were to fore-run the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
and the diſſolution of the world.</p>
            <p>1. Times abounding with errors and corruptions in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
may juſtly be called evill times; goodneſſe and truth are
neerly allyed, ſo alſo are evill and error, which renders this
poſition true, that erroneous times are evil times. And I chuſe
to begin with the mention of this kind of evil, becauſe it is
the foundation of divers other, many diſtractions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
ariſing hence. And this (how ſlightly ſoever ſome
may think of it) is the moſt remarkable evil our Saviour takes
notice of in that Chapter mentioned,<note place="margin">Matth 24.</note> where we finde it three
times taken notice of, <hi>viz: v. 5. Many ſhall come in my Name, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I am Chriſt: and ſhall deceive many.</hi> v. 11. <hi>And many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſhall riſe, and ſhall deceive many.</hi> v. 24. <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe
Chriſt, and falſe prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders:
inſomuch that if it were poſſible they ſhall deceive the very elect.</hi> And
if this be an evil, which no good man doubts, theſe times
muſt needs be evil, in which we have not onely many ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
miſtakes, and differences of leſſer conſequence ariſing from
diverſity of light, incident to the beſt Churches, but there are
alſo <hi>Cavendae tempeſtates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1, 19.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; flenda naufragia:</hi> many dangerous
departings from the faith, and ſhipwracks concerning it; we
meet not onely with ſtrong gales that ſcatter our ſhips, and
make them ſteer different courſes, though they meet in the
Haven at laſt, but black and violent ſtormes which bring
ſome to wreck and ruine, and this muſt needs be ill weather.
For beſides the Antichriſtian and ſuperſtitions dregs which
we have derived from the Apoſtaſie of the Weſtern Church
(from whence we are riſen, but as <hi>Lazarus</hi> with our grave-clothes
about us) from which we are not yet throughly drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the bold and dangerous errors and hereſies which long
ſince infeſted the Eaſtern Churches concerning the Trinity,
the natures of Chriſt are raked up out of the aſhes again, and
offer to outface the daylight of the Goſpel: Vain Philoſophy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116087:8"/>
perks up again, and affronts Divinity concerning the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Soul, as an handmaid that is heir to her Miſtreſſe.
Not to mention the Socinian, Arminian tenets, things not
long ſince zealouſly thruſt out at the foredoore, but now ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in again at the back-doore, and would be looked upon
as quite other things, becauſe brought in by other perſons.
And as if it were a ſmall thing for us to be the common ſewre
of other Countreys, in which the confluence of ſtrange opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
ſhould meet, unleſſe we adde ſomething of our own.
I beleeve we have added ſome which other places and ages
ſcarce ever dream'd of, though it be a dream, that all
Churches are diſſolved, Ordinances loſt, and not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or recovered till new Apoſtolical miſſions and commiſſions
drop down from heaven among us. Which opens a doore for
any man to be any thing, till at laſt he come to be nothing.
So that in this reſpect our times are undeniably evil.</p>
            <p>2. Enormities and corruptions in manners render times
very evil; this is alſo mentioned by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 12.
where it is ſaid, <hi>that iniquity ſhall abound, and the love of many
wax cold.</hi> Sin is certainly the greateſt evil, it hath no epithite
bad enough to be joyned with it, but one of its own make,
which is ſinfull: ſin <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is the foundation of
all miſeries and calamities which are but the ſpawn of it, and
hell it ſelf the fruit. Where ſin therefore with its retinue
(which alwayes follows it, ſometimes at the heels, ſometimes
at diſtance) abounds, the dayes muſt needs be evil. And if ſo
the dayes wherein our lot is fallen muſt ſubmit to the cenſure
of evil dayes, was there ever any time that iniquity more
abounded then now adayes? was there ever more prodigious
ſwearing, more profane Sabbath-breaking, more abominable
uncleanneſſe, more frequent murthers, and thefts, beſide that
filthineſſe of ſpirit, pride, malice, covetouſneſſe daily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
it ſelf, as much as ever, and that is more then ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have had more means to reclaim us; the vanity of
apparell deſerves to be taken notice of among the reſt, the
naked ſhoulders of women portend a ſcourge. We are fallen
into the dregs of times, &amp; the dregs of wars are fallen among
us. And all theſe evils are aggravated by this among other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116087:8"/>
circumſtances, that as wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> (whom the holy Ghoſt
points out as a man remarkably evil, and ſaies, this is that
King <hi>Ahaz</hi>) in the time of our diſtreſſe we ſin yet more againſt
the Lord, our old wounds are yet unhealed, deep ſcars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
upon us, new dangers threaten us, and yet how few are
there who anſwer the Lords expectation, who hearkens after
the fruit of all this, but hears not us reflecting upon our waies,
and the iſſues of them, ſaying, what have I done? Many Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Ordinances there are tending to Reformation,
which meet with ſo much corruption, and ſo inveterate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
that they produce little effect, but the irritation and
drawing forth the rage and miſchief that is bound up in the
hearts of men. And theſe kinde of evils are very hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained,
and therefore like to go on till the meaſure of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
be full, and that can produce nothing but deſolation.
In ſome caſes we want Laws, and Courts of tryall, as matters
of uncleanneſſe, and the ſhelter thereof. Clandeſtine Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
which are alſo divers other wayes pernicious: and, by
the way, it were worth the taking notice of by thoſe in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that <hi>no things in the roome of old and abuſed things, is not
Reformation, nor any friend to it, but makes the people, not altogether
unjuſtly, cry out for their rags again rather then go naked.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is <hi>fundi noſtri calamitas,</hi> where we have Laws, we
want Magiſtrates, or at leaſt Magiſtrates want wiſdom, will,
courage, fidelitie, or ſomething neceſſary to put them in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
We have many who in reſpect of calling are Gods,<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.</note> but
in their carriage are Idols; they have eyes and ſee not, eares
have they, and hear not; neither ſpeak they right things, but
rather hate him that reproveth in the gate, and abhor him
that ſpeaketh uprightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is an evil time, as you may
find, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 10. 13. Never had any poore Kingdom greater
occaſion to complain in the language of the Church, <hi>Micah</hi>
7. 1, 2. <hi>Wo is me, for I am as when they have gathered the ſummer
fruits, there is no cluſter to eat: the good man is periſhed out of the
earth: The beſt of them is as a brier.</hi> v. 4. and this is our perplexity.
And laſtly, that which makes the times evil in this reſpect, is,
that in ſome places where there are Laws and Magiſtrates,
the ſpirit that works in the children of diſobedience is broken
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116087:9"/>
ſo looſe among us, that open contempts and aff<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onts are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to them, of which you have had too late a teſtimony in
this famous City, which I am loath to keep in memory by
mentioning of it. And theſe things render the times exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evill.</p>
            <p>3. Dayes may be called evil, in reſpect of wrath and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
meaſured out in them, as in explaining the point ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
And our Saviour alſo takes in this, <hi>Matth. 24. 7. And
ye ſhall hear of wars, and rumors of wars, Nation ſhall riſe againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
there ſhall be famines, and peſtilences,</hi> &amp;c. Or as <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſes
it: <hi>Mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe
things that are coming on the earth:</hi> theſe are ill times, theſe are
our times. True, it is ſomething better with us, then when
our high wayes were unoccupied, our Cities beſieged, our
houſes layd waſte, and when God ſuffered evill and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
men to ride over our heads; but yet beſides the deep
impreſſions of former blows which will be long wearing out,
even in times of tranquillity, beſides the extraordinary bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
which preſent exigents bind upon our ſhoulders, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
upon our plenty and liberty, we lye under fears
and rumors of wars, and of ſuch as are like to be worſe then
the former, if it may be; for now are mens ſpirits more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated,
and their rage and diſcontents boyled up to a
greater height then formerly; and alſo it is Gods wonted
method to proceed from leſſer puniſhments to greater, from
whips to ſcorpions;<note place="margin">Levit. 26.</note> and if men will not be amended, to puniſh
them ſeven times more for their fins. We have reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that our preſervations not being ſeconded with Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
may prove but reſervations to greater evils. So that
in reſpect of evils felt and feared, our times may be called
evil,<note place="margin">Micah 2. 3.</note> as the Lord ſpeaks by <hi>Micah, Behold, againſt this family do
I deviſe an evil, from which ye ſhall not remove your necks, neither ſhall
ye go haughtily: for this time is evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I may adde one thing more which (as I may ſo ſpeak)
renders theſe times compleatly evil, and that is the diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and diviſions of them. Diſſention is a mixture of ſin and
puniſhment, and in every reſpect renders times evill: This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
(that I may be true to my intention) we finde mentioned
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116087:9"/>
by our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 24. 10. Many ſhall be offended, and ſhall
betray one another, and hate one another.</hi> Times full of offences and
ſcandals are wofull times, according to that ſpeech of Chriſt,
<hi>Matth. 18. 7. Wo unto the world becauſe of offences:</hi> theſe are daies
wherein many offences are given, but more taken; many caſt
ſtumbling blocks before others, few take care to remove them,
but rather aggravate them. We have alreadie had one great
diviſion betwixt the friends and enemies of Reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
men that loved their own liberty, and thoſe loved the
publick liberty; and we thought the times bad enough in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of that difference, and the fruits of it, warre, and the
miſeries attending on it. But that fire though it was hot, yet
it was naturall, it tended to ſeparate things heterogeneous,
and congregate things and perſons of the ſame nature and
intereſt. But the diviſions under which we now labour, are
a more unnaturall fire, that ſeparates things of the ſame kind,
a fire from hell, that hath much heat, but little light with it,
to direct what to do.<note place="margin">Pſal. 55. 14.</note> Men that faſted, prayed, that have took
ſweet counſell together, and walked to the Houſe of God in
company, that have lived, loved together, and been willing
to dye together, are become ſtrangers, nay enemies to each
other. And this addes much to the heap of our ſins and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments;

But to return to my intendment. What gained the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
by murmuring in the wilderneſſe upon every jealouſie
and diſcontent? ſurely nothing but diſpleaſure from God,
and the loſſe of a good Land, which we are haſtening to. And
more particularly the evill ſpeakings, ſwellings, tumults
againſt the Parliament and their proceedings, is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
thing in the world to better the times: for howſoever
it muſt not be denyed there are with them, even with them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
iniquities by us to be bewailed, by them amended; yet to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116087:10"/>
traduce, calumniate, and aſperſe them with evill language,
now grown as common as brown paper and packthreed in

it is unwiſe. It is unjuſt, for howſoever they have not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
all opportunities (which who is there that ſlips not)
of eſtabliſhing truth and peace among us, howſoever there
are many things wanting which ſhould, and it may be might
have been done; yet many good works have they done, and
for which of theſe ſhall we ſtone them? I know it will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
For a good work we ſtone thee not, &amp;c. But conſider
their diſtractions, their toſſings to and fro, the manifold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
upon them to divide and deſtroy them, beſide the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
infirmities and allowances of every man, it may allay
the ſpirits of them who ever had any good opinion of them,

what ſaith the Proverbe of the ancients, <hi>Wickedneſſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

think that Magiſtrates, becauſe they are called Gods, ſhould
be without infirmity, though themſelves lye in iniquity. They
are indeed called gods, but muſt dye like men, and they do
live and walk like men too. The beſt of them that we read of,

infirmities that cleave thereunto;<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 2.</note> but picks out integritie out

            <p>2. And where this evil ſpeaking is not untrue, yet it is very

ſtranger to this Nation, and the good of it, who knows not
how much it is concerned in the power and reputation of
Parliaments, what an high way were made to our ruine in
their diſhonour and deſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make them vile, is but to
pave a way to our own villanage, it were juſt ſuch a peice of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116087:11"/>
policy, as for a company of men who live upon the Sea coaſt,
and pull down thoſe banks which are their defence from the
waves of the Sea,<note place="margin">Pſal 65. 7.</note> and tumult of the people. It beaſts were not
beaſts, they would never bark or root up the tree that ſhelters
them; let not men be beaſts and do ſo: It is the temper of
people to love things paſt, to hate things preſent, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to expect changes, accordingly we are very unſatisfied
with our preſent condition. But ſuppoſe a man ſtand upon a
ragged rock where his feet are pained, will he not conſider
where he is like to light before he leaps down? Let us be ſo
wiſe and know, that upon our demoliſhing this preſent ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
howſoever ruinous enough, we can expect little better
then what the Lord threatens to a people, of whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
he would have no pitie. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 6. the place may be
peruſed, and conſidered at leiſure. But oh that while I plead
for Magiſtracie, Magiſtrates would plead for themſelves, not
by words and writings, but reall amendments, for nothing
elſe will do it; and leave off faction, partiality, private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
and thoſe things that tend to nothing but miſchief
and miſerie, that would much better the times.</p>
            <p>2. New commotions and warres are no way like to better
the times, this alſo is evident, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. he that would live ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes to ſee good, <hi>let him ſeek peace and inſue it;</hi> if ever
it need inſuing it is now when it is flying ſo faſt from us. We
have ſeen and felt what a big-bellyed evill War is, how fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the twins of ſin and miſery. What through the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Courts, and diſſoluteneſſe of camps, it makes ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
overflow like a common deluge. We ſee how dearly
that little good that is gotten by warre coſt us; we cannot
have Religion ſettled but there muſt firſt be no Religion, or
twenty religions as they are called: We cannot have Law, but
by breaking Laws; nor Liberty, but we muſt firſt be (as it
were) ſlaves. Who ſo thinks by new ſtirres to prevent errors
and oppreſſions, exceedingly miſtakes; for error is kept up by
confuſion, as mud by ſtirring the water which would ſettle to
the bottom after a little quiet. Who gains any thing by war,
but he that hath nothing to loſe. Beleeve it before you feel
it, the little finger of the next war is like to be heavyer then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116087:11"/>
the loins of this (though broken) Peace. Thoſe that now ſo
ſtudiouſly foment new broils, ſuppoſe they ſhould prevail, yet
doubtleſſe our fate abides them, which is mutuall animoſi ies
and diviſions: for if they have not as many ends to bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as other men. I am much miſtaken; but taking in the
certain hazard with the uncertain event, the people had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
learn to pray without book to be prepared for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before they receive it, to ſubmit to Church Diſcipline,
and Taxes alſo for a time, then further new commotions,
which will be bitterneſſe in the end, beſide the ruggedneſſe of
the way.</p>
            <p>3. The opening of a back doore for the receiving in again
of old Offices, Orders and Ceremonies in the Church is not ſo
hopefull a way to better times as many imagine: It is indeed
a queſtion whether the abolition of them might not have been
more graduall, that the hearts of people might have been
prepared to the Lord; but the diſpenſations of providence,
and the Authority of Reformers having ſo ordered things,
that they are abrogated; to reſume them ſtands neither with
prudence nor piety: as for the matter of piety, ſure there was
little in them, neither is there ſo much in any externall thing
as may be ſuppoſed before it's tryed. Their nature muſt be
very much abſtracted from their practiſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 15 13.</note> or they muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
go in the number of plants which our heavenly Father
never planted. Neither in prudence is it hopefull, for if not
more, yet more conſiderable perſons to the true welfare of the
Kingdom will be diſengaged by the retaining thoſe forms
and formalities, then by rejecting them: and my reaſon is
this; Thoſe that aſſert them do it ordinarily more out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
then conſcience, for I perceive many ready to fight for
a Common Prayer book, who never made any conſcience of
hearing it, but would leave the Prieſt and Clerk almoſt deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
and faction or humor, though very buſie and earneſt for
a time, yet is eaſilier ſatisfied then conſcience; and the fruit
of readmitting ſuch things would be in probability this, a fire
would break out of thoſe brambles to conſume the Cedars
of Lebanon.</p>
            <p>4. As not the opening a back doore to <hi>old Superſtitions,</hi> ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116087:12"/>
neither the ſetting wide a paire of broad gates to a <hi>new To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi>
would contribute hereunto; if it ſhould produce ſome
preſent peace, yet that peace would be both miſerable and
ſhort; it would be miſerable, becauſe of the loſſe of Truth,
which is the foundation and beauty of peace in all Chriſtian
Kingdomes; at the beſt it would but render our Kingdome, as
the French ſpeaks of a beautifull harlot, <hi>a Paradice for the eye,
but a Purgatory for the ſoule.</hi> And were it ſweet, yet it could be
but ſhort, for where Religion is ſo much taken to heart as it
is in this Kingdom, and not ſo much ſwallowed up in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intereſts as in ſome other, it would be very hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
peace in the middſt of ſo many differences. I ſpeak not,
as if there might not, or ought not to be a mutuall forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
among Chriſtians who hold the head, and walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Goſpel, and diſturb not the publick peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Church, ſeconded with an endeavour of reſtoring
one another to unity, in a ſpirit of meekneſſe; for that men
ſhould in all points agree, is rather to be wiſhed then hoped,
it is reſerved for the happineſſe of heaven, and not allowed
for the lot of this pilgrimage; and if differences were wiſely
diſtinguiſhed, we ſhould have more peace, and never the leſſe
Truth among us. But that way ſhould be given to a licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
lawleſſe, boundleſſe, <hi>Vorſtian, libertas Prophetandi,</hi> as its cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that every one whoſe brain is big of ſome new conceit, or
the tranſmigration of an old error, ſhould have the Midwife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a Toleration to produce and propagate it, how ſoone
would it turn both Church and Kingdome into a Babel of
confuſion. The fruits of this practiſe have been found in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi> And whereas it is uſually objected, that
ſome place neerer hand flouriſhes, notwithſtanding this: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
or rather aske in what they flouriſh, is it in the life and
power of Religion, or in other things onely? And let it alſo
be conſidered, whether this indifferency &amp; connivence there,
hath not given advantage to a ſecret and ſubtill enemy, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
the very foundations of their liberty; the iſſues
whereof may too ſoon appear. Where all Religions, or all
things called religion are exerciſed, the product is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no religion, or a prevalency of the worſt. Therfore never let
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116087:12"/>
us think to eſtabliſh our ſelves with thoſe things, for which
other Churches have been threatned, and probably waſted,
as of <hi>Thyatira</hi> and <hi>Pergamus,</hi> Rev. 2. 14. 20.</p>
            <p>5. To theſe I may adde a fifth conſideration, and its this.
No violent or ſudden change of Civill Government accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Idea's and chimeraes in the minds of more witty
then wiſe men is likely to better theſe times. If things could
be acted as eaſily as imagined, and compaſſed as ſoon as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
it were another matter. But revolutions of times and
States are the fancies of men, but the works of God. It is ſaid
indeed of ſome, that they ſhall think to change times and
Laws, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. but it's the power and priviledge of the moſt
high to change times and ſeaſons, to remove Kings, and ſet
up Kings, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 21. The weight of Kingdoms is too great to
be turned by the weak engine of humane invention; God uſes
to ſuit providences and ſpirits of men to great works when
he intends them; and it's he that makes agreements of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and not a few of the many. And thoſe dreams of parity
in Civill affairs is unequall and impoſſible. Philoſophers ſay
of naturall bodies, <hi>Non datur temperamentum ad pondus:</hi> becauſe
that body could conſiſt no where were there not a predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
element to determine it. It's as true of civill and politick
bodies. Thoſe that now are for equality while they are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
would be for ſuperiority when things were equall; if
the Vine and the Olive were taken away, the Bramble would
rule over the trees: for ſome body will. Thus we ſee what will
not do the buſineſſe ſo much deſired: let us briefly conſider
what will. And to this purpoſe know in one word, Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would do the work: and that,</p>
            <p>1. In Religion, the ſettling the affairs of which would
have a very great influence into an alteration of times for the
better. For not onely men that have the power, but even all
that have the form of it will be ill at eaſe till it be eſtabliſhed.
And more eſpecially it being acknowledged that the God of
heaven hath the ſoveraignty of times and ſeaſons in his hand;
this muſt neceſſarily be granted, that to procure better times,
muſt be to comply with that which the Lord looks upon as
his main intereſt (if I may call it ſo) which is the ordering
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116087:13"/>
the affairs of his Church, and that in Doctrine and Worſhip.
Truth is a glorious beam of the Sun of righteouſneſſe, I mean
Goſpel truth, the Word of truth, the Goſpel of ſalvation,
which God is very choice of,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> how ſlightly ſoever men may
eſteeme it, and toſſe it at their pleaſure; the foundation of
that ſtately ſtructure was layd in the blood of his Son, and
hath been raiſed by the blood of his Saints: and who ſo would
have the eye and heart of God to be toward them, muſt have
theirs to his truth. To the bettering therefore of theſe dayes,
how uſefull and acceptable would it be, how pleaſing to God,
and profitable to men, if the more groſſe injuries and affronts
offered to the truth of God were more diſcountenanced, and
puniſhed; eſpecially if pertinacy and contumacy be added
thereunto. And ſo to make a graduall progreſſe to a more
full vindication of it by a mixture of power and means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
There are ſome damnable hereſies, that bring ſwift
deſtruction to perſons and places, and there muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
in them, there are opinions and practiſes againſt the light
of nature, and evident light of Scripture, that have been
broached in theſe licentious times, which can hardly pretend
to conſcience, which ſhould be carefully repreſſed. Let not
men be afraid of endangering peace by aſſerting truth. If it
were ſo,<note place="margin">Prov. 23 23.</note> yet it were no juſt plea, becauſe we are bid to buy the
truth, but not to ſell it, no not for peace; though that be a
pearl, it's not the pearl of price: but it will not be ſo, beſide
the meraphiſicall relation of <hi>verum</hi> and <hi>bonum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech 8. 16. 19. Iſa. 39. 8.</note> you will find
a frequent connexion of them in Scripture, <hi>Truth and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So for Worſhip, much hath been done by Authority that
way, for the draining of it from the muddy mixtures of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ceremony and invention. Onely the coldneſſe of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116087:13"/>
that God may be pleaſed in worſhip, you muſt look not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to avoid ſuperſtition, but formality alſo, the uſuall bane of
Religion in places where it is much profeſſed. Remember
that God is a Spirit, bare words and externals hold no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him, he will be worſhipped ſutably, that is, <hi>in
ſpirit and in truth.</hi> I doubt the quarrell mentioned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13.
is executed upon us, and upon the ſame ground; we have in
our ordinary and extraordinary duties too frequently ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
God with our lips, when our hearts have been far from
him; and therefore <hi>is the wiſedome of the wiſe men periſhed, and
the underſtanding of the prudent hidden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as a fence to both theſe, how neceſſary alſo were it
that Government were ſettled, according as the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
part of Godly men have adviſed. Let it not be looked
upon as too rigorous, it is not found ſo in other places where
it is exerciſed, remember whoſe language it is, <hi>Let us break
their bands in ſunder:</hi> but leſt this Scripture ſhould be miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
let men take heed of putting of their own rules under
the notion of divine precepts, and in ſome circumſtantials
rather be content with the undoubted title of Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
then the queſtionable tenure of divine right. It may be
ſaid we want matter for this new building; it's too true, but
better an hedge with ſome unſound ſtakes in it, then none at
all. But to prevent this great miſchief, how neceſſarie were it
that more then ordinary care ſhould be taken for removing
ſcandalous and inſufficient Miniſters, and enemies of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
for as things now ſtand in many places, ſome Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries
would be looked upon as knots of good fellows, and
others as conſpiracies of diſaffected perſons. It was once a
ground of commendation layd by the Jews on the behalf of
the Centurion, <hi>He loved our Nation, and built us a Synagogue:</hi>
but how much more commendable would it be in any that
give us reaſon to ſay, He loved our Countrey, and ſent us a
faithfull Miniſter? Let us walk by this principle, which is
certainly that the ſaving of Kingdoms, as well as ſouls, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon a good Miniſtery. And let me adde one thing
more,<note place="margin">2 Chron 11. 17.</note> that is, a tender regard to ſuch as are indeed Saints
of God, who are very dear to him: If they be really ſo,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116087:14"/>
they will not put us to much expence of charity or patience,<note place="margin">Matth. 25 45.</note>
let them have what is fit and neceſſary. The Lord will take it
very kindly at our hands, and he is able to requite us, for the
King of Saints is alſo King of Nations. Let no man think that
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lacking Reformation, and gratifying the back-friends of it
i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> retarding it, can be a ſafe way to ſettle us. That one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Jews returning from Captivity, may be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
caveat for men to give up a begun Reformation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all oppoſition. They took their interruptions
for ſufficient excuſes for not going on with the Temple work,

by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>The judgement of truth and peace,</hi> becauſe of

miſchief to preſent Authority, then the unequall diſtribution

hath given us. But yet let men take heed of ſeeking juſtice by
violence, leſt we give occaſion to the old ſad complaint, <hi>Proh

            </p>
            <p>3. To this muſt be added perſonall reformation; let men

bettering the times, till men and manners be better it will
not be; times are alwayes alike in themſelves, they have no
evil but by concomitancy, and reflexion caſt upon them from
the evill of men. Therefore let not us wander in untrodden
paths and wayes not caſt up; but ask for the old way, and the
ancient paths that we may find reſt; and what are they but
the preſcriptions of the Lord? 2 <hi>Chron. 7. 14. If my people ſhall
humble themſelves, and pray, and turn from their evill wayes; I will
hear in heaven, forgive their ſin, and heal their land.</hi> Walk by this
rule; <hi>

my profaneneſſe, covetouſneſſe, uncleanneſſe do good to the
Nation? Yes, it may. God doth not powre out his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon a people till the meaſure of iniquity be full: it is
not indeed for one man, or a few, to empty the veſſell of ſin in
this Nation, but yet they may keep it from being full. But
howſoever, if thou canſt not ſave a Kingdom, yet it is a good
way toward the ſaving of a ſoul to repent and reform, if

but plyes his work the harder, and redoubles his ſtrokes: ſo
muſt thoſe in Authority not ſuffer themſelves to be carried
down by the floods of ungodlineſſe riſen up among us, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116087:15"/>
redouble prayers and pains, and uſe more vigilance and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
then ever, leſt they be carried down to the waves of the
ſea, and madneſſe of the people. And oh that <hi>London</hi> would
look to Reformation, and do it's firſt works, take heed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning
the Lords day, and oppoſing the vindication of it; that
they would avoid and abhor that frequent drinking healths,
not ſo much of good fellowſhip, as of faction, which were
wont to be confined to Taverns, but are now got into private
houſes,<note place="margin">Ier. 13. 13, 14.</note> and publick ſtreets, and are ready to fill us with drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,
and daſh us one againſt another. The reckoning of
theſe drinkings is like to be very ſharp, unleſſe we be more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and vigilant.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, all this muſt be accompained with humble, and
hearty, frequent and fervent prayer; it is evident enough,
that as nothing hath been done, ſo nothing can be done to
the happineſſe of this Church and Nation, and the bettering
of theſe evill daies, but by the hand of God, which he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to lift up on every occaſion, though many will not ſee it;
and therefore if we would ingage the Lord, who worketh all
our works for us, we muſt take the courſe that deales moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and effectually with him, which is prayer; and
how happie news were it to heare that the ſpirit of prayer
and ſupplication, which in ſo eminent a manner reſted upon
this City 7 yeers, ſince were powred out afreſh upon it, the
hand of the Lord is not ſhortned, let not our hearts be
ſtreightned: his eare is not heavie, let not us be ſilent: If we
would have him ſtretch out his hand for us, let us ſtretch out
our hands toward him. Do not think the Lord will forſake
his wonted method, of which we read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. and
<hi>Jerem.</hi> 29. 11. 12. and let this great duty be performed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and to that purpoſe it is a uſeful caution, that men look
to the matter of their prayers, that they be according to the
will of God, and not the imaginations of our own hearts; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
croſſe Petitions are put up to heaven, becauſe men make
their opinions and wiſhes the rule of their prayers, inſtead of
the holy and unchangeable will of God; it were ſometimes
good that men were more generall in their prayers, and not
limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as they do, its poſſible to be too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116087:15"/>
in prayer, as well as too generall in preaching. And
alſo remember that as prayer is a Chariot, in which the ſoul
mounts up to heaven; ſo it muſt be a fiery Chariot, a fervent
prayer,<note place="margin">2 Sam 24 24.</note> it is not a lazy, <hi>God ſend Peace:</hi> or a cold, <hi>God ſave his
Church,</hi> that will availe; God will not be ſerved with that
which coſts us nought, it muſt be the fervent effectuall prayer
of the righteous that muſt availe; and if we would have our
prayers ſpeed, we muſt look they be well ſpirited, to that end
let me intimate to you 4 wheeles of this fiery Chariot.</p>
            <p>1. A ſpirit of faith; it is the ſtrict injunction of the Apoſtle,
that we <hi>aske in faith, nothing wavering:</hi> which we are very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.</note> eſpecially in theſe diſtracted times. The Sea by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of its unquietneſſe is hardly ever ſtill but working, but
much more in a ſtorme; ſo is it with us, we carry an evill heart
of unbeleife within us alwayes unſteady, but eſpecially in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
times when the winds raiſe waves. Unbeleif unſettles as
the ſpirits of men, ſo their eſtates alſo. <hi>Iſa</hi> 7. 9. It was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleif
that kept <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Land of Promiſe, and made
them wander in a wilderneſſe fourty yeers;<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 17. 18.</note> and as our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
is like theirs, we ſpend our dayes in vanity, that is,
in a fruitleſſe toſſing to and fro, and our yeers in trouble: ſo
our ſin is like theirs alſo, we beleeve not for all the wondrous
works of God.<note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 32. 33.</note> As God gives promiſes to ground faith, ſo he
adds providences to build it up; we have had many of theſe,
and yet are very lowe: take heed of diſtruſts &amp; deſpondencies,
they diſadvantage us both in heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>2. A ſpirit of humility: and this is no way inconſiſtent with
the other: a heart may be raiſed in faith, and yet abaſed in
humiliation; theſe two graces mutually cheriſh one another.
The Lord expects at our hands that our own ſins and his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements
upon us ſhould lay us low, that we ſhould ſay with
the Church, <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe
I have ſinned againſt him.</hi> He hearkens what we ſay in theſe
evill dayes, and its to be doubted few ſpeake aright, or ſay
what have I done. <hi>Cognitio reflexiva, eſt facilè deflexiva:</hi> We
are ready enough to ſay, what hath the Parliament done?
What hath the Army done? But who ſaith, what have I done?

<hi>Deſcendendo coelum aſcenditur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. A ſpirit of love is neceſſary, as in generall with regard
to the times, ſo particularly with reſpect to prayer: for the
Apoſtles bids, that <hi>pure bands without wrath, as well as doubting,
be lifts up to God; 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 8. envy and uncharitableneſſe, ſtrife
and diviſion force the ſpirits of men, and render their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
unſavory unto God; it is not quarrelling and queſtioning

the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> Jam. 1. 20. Wiſdom and meckneſſe go

To further this ſo wanting, and ſo neceſſary diſpoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>1. That envying, ſtrife, hatred, variance, and ſuch like,
are fruits of the fleſh, as well as adultery, fornication, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe:
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20. And you that would think it an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

found guilty of the latter: take heed of the former, which is
part of that filthineſſe of ſpirit we are bid to cleanſe our ſelves
from, as well as filthineſſe of the fleſh. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
            <p>2. That moſt of the things contended about, will hardly

upon his own people, by fair means or foule to bring them

            <p>4. To theſe three muſt be added a ſpirit of thankfulneſſe,
which is very great advantage to prayer, and to the times, as
the Apoſtle intimates in his direction to the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4 6.</note>

the catalogue of ſins, that renders the laſt dayes peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
we ſhall find unthankfulneſſe among them. <hi>Ingratitudo
eſt ventus urens &amp; exiccans:</hi> it is a dry and parching winde from
the wilderneſſe that blaſts and waſtes all our mercies. It's true
the dayes are evill, but yet they are not ſo bad but they afford
matter of praiſe, if we did not want hearts more then mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
Theſe times are like thoſe mentioned. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 6. neither
clear nor dark, night nor day. If we would have it light in
the evening, ſet not unwholſome and unthankfull vapours
aſcend from us. Our times are checker'd with white and
black, let not us by unthankfulneſſe blot our the white, and
make them worſe. There are mercies in our Parliament, in our
Armies, in our Liberties, in our degree of Reformation, if ill
humors were not fallen into our eyes ſo as not to ſee them;
when the miſeries which theſe mercies yet in ſome meaſure
prevent,<note place="margin">2 Chron 15. 3</note> we ſhall find and confeſſe them ſo. Bleſſed be God, we
are not in ſo ill a condition as Iſrael in the firſt dayes of <hi>Aſa,</hi>
when they were without the true God, without a teaching
Prieſt, and without Law: We have the knowledge of the true
God diſperſed among us more then ever, more preaching
Miniſters, more good Laws then formerly, though it is true
that E<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

in diſcontents, the degrees of mercie that are vouchſafed us
let them not be ſwallowed up with murmuring, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
let us not ſo requite the Lord, like a fooliſh people and
unwiſe, leſt he withdraw his hand from our protection, and
leave us to eat the frut of our own wayes, which is a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116087:17"/>
of favour by our follies. If our prayers could be carried
on with theſe wheels, there might be good hope they ſhould
be as the ſword of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the bowe of <hi>Jonathan</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

            <p>And thus have I detained you with theſe plain though not
impertinent truths; and leſt I ſhould ſhut up without any
thing of the main Propoſition in the text, give me leave at
leaſt to explain it, and let your wiſdom and goodneſſe apply
it. The Truth is this.</p>
            <p>That it becomes and behoves a Chriſtian to walk circumſpectly,<note place="margin">Prop. 2.</note> and
redeem the time in evill dayes.</p>
            <p>It would here be enquired, what it is to walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
the word in the originall is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which Etymologiſts
ſay may be derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to go to the utmoſt or
height, to be accurate or exact: and I think it may contain
three things.</p>
            <p>1. To walk to the utmoſt of the rule, to the very corners
and extents of the word of God, without making any willing
diſpenſations in ſin to commit, or duty to omit. This <hi>David</hi>
ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Pſal. 119. 108. I eſteem all thy precepts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things to be right: and I hate every falſe way.</hi> And herein was
<hi>Jehu</hi> defective, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 31. he was exact in deſtroying <hi>Ahab</hi>
and <hi>Baal,</hi> but he departed not from the ſin of <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it's ſaid, he took no heed, he was not circumſpect to walk
in the way of the Lord. Not to walk exactly in this, gives the
Lord occaſion to complain as of the Church of <hi>Sardis, I have
not found thy works</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>perfect,</hi> or filled up before God;
there are gaps or ſpaces in thy obedience.</p>
            <p>2. It is to walk <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the utmoſt in reſpect of ſtrength,
that is, in doing that which is commanded to lay out the
ut moſt of thoſe parts, gifts, graces that God hath given us.
A Miniſter walks exactly in his Miniſtery, when he obeys the
precepts of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Ep. 4. 13. in meditating on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things, and giving himſelf wholly to them. A Chriſtian
then walks exactly, when he doth not onely pray, &amp; read, but
do it diligently, watchfully. A man cannot live at the height
of his eſtate, nor walk at the top of his naturall ſtrength, it
will waſte him ſoon, becauſe thoſe things have defectible
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116087:17"/>
principles, but it is otherwiſe in ſpirituall things, which we
derive from an abounding and abiding life hid with Chriſt
in God: a Chriſtian may run and not be weary, becauſe in
the Lord he hath righteouſneſſe and ſtrength. Let us therefore
do our beſt, and we ſhall do better. <hi>Be not ſlothfull in buſineſſe:
but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord:</hi> Rom. 12. 11.</p>
            <p>3. To walk circumſpectly, or accurately, ſeems to imply
ſomething more, and that is walking wiſely; the two things
already mentioned make up honeſt walking, as when we
walk to the utmoſt of the rule for the matter, and the utmoſt
of our ſpirituall ſtrength for the manner of our obedience:
but wiſe walking is <hi>aliquid amplius,</hi> that is, there are divers
circumſtances attending actions, as time, place, company,
perſon, and ſuch like, which have a ſtrong influence into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſometimes to alter the very nature of them. Now he that
would walk circumſpectly, or accurately, muſt look ſo to the
circumſtances of his actions, as to ſet them off with the beſt
advantage as may be: and therefore that which is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>walking circumſpectly,</hi> is called, <hi>Walking wiſely toward them
that are without.</hi> Col. 4. 5. It is the part of wiſdom to reduce
knowledge to profitable and ſeaſonable action. And happie
is he that can walk thus circumſpectly: for howſoever the
vain world brands exact walkers with the title of preciſe
fools, yet the holy Ghoſt paſſes a contrary cenſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
circumſpect walking, wiſe walking: and indeed the
looſe walker will be found the greateſt fool, <hi>a fool at his latter
end.</hi> Jer. 17. 11.</p>
            <p>Know therefore that it becomes us all to walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
it is our credit, and the credit of the Goſpel that we do ſo.
<hi>Then ſhall we not be aſhamed when we have reſpect to all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
when we do <hi>the great things of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and leave not the
leſſer undone.</hi> Matth. 23. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>And alſo it behoves us, it's for our profit as well as our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
it tends exceedingly to our peace, which is moſt worth
looking after in times of trouble: it will be a great ſupport
in the evill day to ſay with <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 1. 12. This is my rejoycing,
the teſtimony of my conſcience, that in all ſimplicity and godly ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t according to fleſhly wiſdom, but the grace of God, I have had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116087:18"/>
my converſation:</hi> As young luſtie men laugh at others who have
payd dear for their intemperance, when they ſee them cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
in their diet, and hit them in the teeth with the Proverb,
<hi>Qui vivit medicè, vivit miſerè:</hi> but when gouts and rheumes
come upon them they blame their own folly. So will it be
with carnall and careleſſe Chriſtians, who laugh at them that
are ſcrupulous, and make conſcience of things which they ſo
eaſily ſwallow, they will find them bitterneſſe in the end. Let
us therefore walk circumſpectly.</p>
            <p>A word alſo of the laſt redeeming the time or opportunity,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which imports three things likewiſe.</p>
            <p>1 A price, for it muſt be bought. 2. A loſſe, for it muſt not
be barely bought, but redeemed. 3. An uſe, for what we buy,
or redeem, it is to be ſuppoſed we buy it for ſome uſe. The
practick hereof is this. That whereas every man is guilty of
loſſe of time, and hath morgaged a great part of this precious
treaſure to ſin, Satan, and the world; let him be carefull to
redeem it, to buy it out of their hands, though with the loſſe
of eaſe, pleaſure, profit, plenty, or any other thing: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo redeemed it, to employ and improve it to the honour
of God, with whom we are ſo infinitely behind in point of
ſervice, and the working out our own ſalvation with fear and
trembling.</p>
            <p>Let not therefore men talk idlely of driving away Time,
which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of redeeming: when did you ever
meet with any man ſo wretchedly unthifty as to ſay, What
ſhall I do with my land, with my money, it burns in my purſe?
Yet ſuch, and worſe is the madneſſe and folly of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts,
who talk of driving away time, which is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then gold and ſilver, which paſſes ſo ſwiftly, ſlily, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably,
eſpecially in ſuch dangerous and tickle times as
theſe are, when our times, liberties, and opportunities hang
continually in doubt before us. Whatſoever vain men ſay
now of paſſing away time, if God awake their hearts, it will
be one of their greateſt troubles that they have ſo ſpent it, and
