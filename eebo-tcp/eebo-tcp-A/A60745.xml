            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The EXPLANATION.</head>
               <p>YOu muſt firſt know the occaſion of this <hi>Mock-Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to have been, that the Pope, Fryars, and their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betters here in <hi>England,</hi> contrived the Lamentable Burning of <hi>London</hi>; ſome Proteſtant Gentlemen, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a thankful Commemoration of their Deliverance, and partly to raiſe a juſt Abhorrency of ſuch Popiſh practices, do now bring theſe Incendiaries in Effigie to the Fire they have better deſerved; and that rather on Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Day, for that in her Reign, the Proteſtant Religion, and the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, were more conſpicuouſly and candidly minded, with admixture of crooked Ends, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Policies.</p>
               <p>But not to prolong your expectation, this Popiſh Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade or Proceſſion, did march out of <hi>George</hi>'s Yard without <hi>White-Chappel</hi> Bars, and ſo gravely came on thorough <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, Leaden-Hall</hi> Street, and ſtraight along to <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> Gate. 1. Was a Leader on Horſeback; after him marched Whiſflers, clad like Pioneers, to clear the way. 2. A Bell-man ringing, and with a doleſome voice ſaying, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Juſtice</hi> Godfrey. 3. A Dead Body, repreſenting Sir <hi>Edm. B. Godfrey</hi> Strangled and Bloody, and one of his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers holding him up on Horſeback, after the manner he was carried from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> to <hi>Green-Berry Hill.</hi> 4. A large Banner is born by four, where on the painted Cloth are expreſt the <hi>Wild-Houſe</hi> Conſulters, <hi>viz.</hi> the Popiſh Clergy Plotters, all hanging on a Gallows; among 'em are ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretended Proteſtants, Betrayers of the Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; on the Reverſe is painted Dame <hi>Celliers,</hi> and other Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Popiſh Ingeneers under the Mask of Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt Pageant.</hi> On the foremoſt Angle of it is one in Black, playing on a Fiddle, with Pen, Ink, and Papers under his Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; on the oppoſite ſide is the Popiſh Midwife, leaning on a <hi>Meal-Tub</hi>; on the hinder part ſtand ſome Proteſtants in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade, in pye-bald Habits: Then comes one born on an Aſs, with his Face to the Tail, and in a black ghaſtful Hue, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting an <hi>Abhorrer</hi> of Petitions and Parliaments: After him one bears a Banner with this Motto, <hi>We Proteſtants in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade Uſher in Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Pag.</hi> Here are born four Grey Fryars, ſome <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called; others <hi>Minimes,</hi> a diminutive ſort of that Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third Pag.</hi> This carries two <hi>Benedictines,</hi> or other black Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, and two <hi>Dominicans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth Pag.</hi> Bears forty Jeſuits, a ſore burden to the whole World, Corrupters of all Morality, Chriſtianity, and Government, <hi>Opulent as Civitates, ubi ſunt commoditates ſemper quarunt iſti Patres, Clar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth Pag.</hi> Do ſtand two Popiſh Biſhops, and two Arch biſhops, who have not a Rag, but what they are beholding to the Pope for in their Pomp and Courts of Judicature, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth Pag.</hi> Here ride two Patriarchs, and two Cardinals; for as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Gods Throne, ſo about the Popes, and the Devils; theſe are the four Animals, or Beaſts, with Eyes all before and behind; the Eyes of Pride and Covetouſneſs. After this <hi>Pageant</hi> comes an Officer of the Popes, diſtributing of Pardons, and ſaying, <hi>Loe here you may have Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh Pag.</hi> Here is the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> himſelf on a Throne, with his Counſeller the <hi>Devil</hi> inſpiring of him, what new Artifice of cruelty muſt come next: He holds two Keys, and two Swords, repreſenting the Civil and Spiritual Dominion over all, and a Page on one ſide holds this Inſcription, <hi>This is the King of Kings</hi>; and one on the other hath a Streamer, and this Motto, <hi>Thou art our God the Pope</hi>: Abundance of Crowns and Scepters are ſtrowed before his feet, to be diſtributed to thoſe poor ſlaviſh Princes that will hold their Kingdoms in Villenage from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighth Pag.</hi> Carries <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> and poor deluded Nuns, as Whores by Diſpenſation or neceſſity, following the Popes Camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninth Pag.</hi> In the foregoing ones you have ſeen the Charming Voice, Fineries of the Popiſh <hi>Circe</hi> and her <hi>Syrenes,</hi> now you have her Cruelties in this <hi>Pageant,</hi> repreſenting the Fathers of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> condemning a Martyr to the Stake for reading the Scripture, or judging by that Word of their new Forgeries.</p>
               <p>Thus the whole <hi>Proceſſion</hi> went along, and was attended by hundreds of <hi>Flamboes</hi> and Torches. Never were the Streets, Windows, and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conies more throng'd with Spectators, who with Acclamations expreſt their abhorrence of Popery; and that they would with their Lives and Fortunes ſtrive to keep out that cruel fooliſh Religion. When it came to <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> the Statue of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> in reſpect to the day was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with a Crown of Lawrel, and a Shield, on which was inſcrib'd the Proteſtant Religion, and <hi>Magna Charta</hi>; before which the Pope and his Crew having received the Sentence to be burned by the like Flames they have kindled in the City, and the Temple, they were all tumbled down from their Grandeur into the impartial Element; abundance of Fuzes, like falling Stars, and Artificial Fires, in the mean time recreated the Spectators; a great ſtore of Wine, and other Liquors, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely poured out to the Multitude, who unanimouſly of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord cryed, <hi>No Popery; God bleſs the King, Proteſtant Religion, the Church, and Diſſenting Proteſtants, both whom God Unite.</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>The Pope, &amp;c. being burnt, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (by them call'd <hi>Heretick</hi>) is diſcharged from the <hi>Inquiſition</hi>; and then immediately repeats theſe Verſes, looking up to the Statue of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> which was adorned with a Shield, with this Inſcription, <hi>Magna Charta, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio Proteſtantium</hi>; with ſeveral Flambo's about it.</p>
