            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>When the Sheepheard was to bee ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> the ſheepe had occaſion to runne together into an holy Concord, either to preuent, or to adiourne the ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſsipation to come. <hi>When the Bridegrome was readie to be taken away,</hi> teares and lamentations would haue ſuted well with the Children of the

marriage chamber. To haue no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſorrow at his death, by whoſe life they had receiued the ſweetnes of Comfort; no concuſsion of feare, when their Maſter ſhould be taken from their heads: but euen then to deuiſe of their owne affaires, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and to meditate of their future power, was certainely an vntimely fruite of ambition; which is like the Bitch (if I may ſpeake it with your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence) that for haſt throwes out her puppies blinde.</p>
                  <p>Is this the kindneſſe that they ſhew to their Maſter?

Where then is their zeale? where is their retaliation? where is the deſire of <hi>Peters</hi> deuoted affection? <hi>Lord to whom ſhall wee goe, thou haſt the words of eternall life?</hi> Forſooth a ſtrong imagination of a kingdome hath ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them all. Graunt all that they expected, that CHRIST would leaue them an earthly kingdome; Yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders ſhould ſtay till things were readie, and not burie their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors aliue. But their hopes of ſuch a kingdome were verie fantaſies, and <hi>great thoughts of heart.</hi> How ſhould he leaue that to them which hee had not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21196:9"/>
himſelfe? The confeſsion he made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> is an indefeſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, <hi>That his kingdome is not of this World:</hi> therefore hee could not leaue them an earthly kingdome. They had promiſe of an eternall kingdome, and there can bee no eternitie but in that which is ſpirituall.

                  <p>The Prophets deſcribe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt with wordes of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Maieſtie; but then they adde the doctrine of his Paſsion, and imply an other kind of Maieſtie then the world affordeth.

To be ſhort, Chriſt left not his glorification, and kingdome vnmentioned; &amp; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth plainely enough, by waſhing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21196:10"/>
his Diſciples feete, that his kingdome conſiſteth in a Miniſterie, not in any outward Soueraignetie &amp; command; <hi>The Sonne of man came not to bee mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto, but to miniſter.</hi>

                  <p>As to the former, <hi>Paul</hi> in his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, tould the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that <hi>The holy Ghoſt had made them ouerſeers,</hi>
