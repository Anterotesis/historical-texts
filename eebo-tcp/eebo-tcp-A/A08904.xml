            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Wherefore when as I (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Theophrastus Paracelsus</hi> and other excellent men) vnderstoode the errours of manie Phisitions of our time, I beganne to deuise with my selfe by what meanes I might attaine to the knowledge of true phisicke, which is deriued out of the light of nature, not out of the darke writings of the heathen. And I iudged it to be necessarie to trauell, and to go vnto far places, to seek out learning and knowledge, and not to hope or looke for it, sitting at home idlelie. I prepared my selfe therefore to my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and with long trauell and labour haue searched out and learned those things, which for christian loue sake I can no longer keepe silent, that I might call backe the wandering children into the path of true doctrine, and hauing declared my iournie and labours, they also being excused and defended, which are laid open vnto al maner of slaunders, by those which so greatly commend the heathenish phisicke, whose deceits in som part I wil indeuor to disclose; I wil afterward declare what those that are desirous of true and naturall phisicke, are to looke for at my hands, and what Bookes of true phisicke I haue gathered together in sundrie places, being mooued with compassion towards those that go astraie, I wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and set forth for their publike profit and commoditie. But first the matter so requireth, that to auoide the hatred of the common sort, as well from my selfe, as from al other fauourers of the Arte of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I should dulie answer vnto the aduersaries, whose frowardnesse and malice is such, that they wil with proude wordes annihilate, reiect, and condemne others inuentions, which they themselues see and perceiue they may vse with great successe and profite. And yet they in the meane season arrogate vnto themselues the commendations due vnto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and with a lying kinde of st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:21435:3"/>
of the olde serpent. For when as reports are spread of the straunge cures of sundrie grieuous diseases, which are wrought by the benefite of tinctures and vegetall and minerall spirites, by the cunning and labour of those whom the common sort at this day cal Chymists or Alchimists: by and by on the contrarie part they crie out that those colliar phisitions can do no good but kil al men that put themselues into their hands with their venemous medicines, so that they ought to bee driuen out of the commonwealth, and that they are deceiuers, and that their extractions and preparations, their subtile and thinne spirit wil profit nothing, and that the spirit of Vitriol is poison, the essence of Antimonie and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is nothing, the extraction of Sulphur is nothing worth, neither the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of gold: and to be briefe, that al things are contrarie to the nature of man, and more to be auoided then the eies of a basiliske. And yet they in the meane time like cunning and crastie theeues priuily, and with fair promises picke out from the poore Chymists the secrets of Phisicke, and secretly learne those things that they forbid the common people as poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, afterwardes challenging them for their owne practises. And by this wicked iniury they deriue vnto themselues the fauour, friendship, praise, gifts and rewardes of men, which by good right are altogether due vnto those that by their labour, sweat, watching, and diligent search in natural things by Vulcans arte haue found out such things, and published them for the common commoditie of man. And yet not contented therewith, they also publish great volumes filled with toyes, lies, &amp; sophistications; going about as much as in them is, to suppresse, ouerthrowe, and vtterly to extinguish the light with darkenesse, and the trueth with lies, &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise (the most plaine and manifest workemistresse established euen by trueth it selfe) with a vaine fained theoricke, deuised by their owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile braine. I say to thee (thou notable Doctor, that so backebitest <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus)</hi> how canst thou by any meanes with thy trifling wordes deface the worke it selfe, or with thy theoricke refell the practise? Art thou so great a doctour and knowest not, that thou hast profited so much, as by thy worke thou canst bring aught to effect? <hi>Paracelsus</hi> teacheth that the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sickenesse is to be cured with the spirit of Vitrioll, and performed it, and the worke it selfe declares it daily: prooue thou the contrarie, and cure the same disease with thy pilles, sirropes, and electuaries, then shalt thou haue the victorie. It is not sufficient for thee by bringing thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to proue that metalline medicines are not agreeing for mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither that metals may be so prepared that they may heale. Why? Thou deniest that which indeede is performed, and openly seene with eies. It is a foule thing to be ignorant in that that euery man knoweth. For out of all doubt you haue all heard, that most daungerous diseases haue bin cured with metaline tinctures, yea, with such as haue not been rightly prepared by counterfeit Paracelsians, as with <hi>Vitrum Antimonij,</hi> which doth plucke vp sodainely at once by the rootes the impurities of the feuer, although not without great weakening of the powers, yet it healeth: And yet we alow not such perillous cures.

As vpon a time certaine knaues by craft gote from mee certaine written bookes, and solde them for a great summe of money. Common wealths and the Chymicall art should be very well prouided for, if that such knaues might bee punished and restrained by the magistrate, so should the studious of the Arte be lesse deceiued, and in short space the true and pure Arte would appeare from those shadowes and sophistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Who in these daies would not maruel to see men vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void of al maner of learning to bee preferred before learned men and such as are most skilfull in the Latine and Greek tongues, and those are to be embraced of kings and princes, and revvarded with most liberall gifts, &amp; most famous and learned men expert in all the tongues to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and contemned? You which excell in iudgement and learning wil ansvver that euery perfect gift commeth dovvne from the Father of light. Therefore God doeth in these latter daies stirre vp these Ideots and Empericks, to stirre vp euery phisition that he should rightly prepare his ovvne medicines with his ovvne handes, and being so prepared, with sharp iudgement applie them to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diseases, that the seede of the disease may be pulled vp by the rootes, and not to commit it to an vnskilful cooke.

Al things notvvithstanding are so created that they shall come vnto our hands, and beginne to bee in our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21435:21"/>
povver, but so, as things not perfect, but to be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: as things not finished, but to be finished. The matter in them truely is perfect, but the middle and last matters remaine to be made perfect. As for example, God created iron, earth, and clay, but not such as they should bee, for the clay groweth, yet not like a pot or other earthen ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: so he created iron lying in a rude masse, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it so rude vnto vs: therefore we with our labour must make thereof shooes for horses, sithes, and speares. Euen so is it in Physicke, for that is also created of God, but not so that it should be vtterly perfect, but as yet hidden vnder the earth, not purged from his vncleane matter, but that which remaineth to be made perfect in it, is committed to the Chimist, that is, to the physition to be purged and cleansed. For herbes, trees, stones, and yron, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is seene with the eies, is not true medicine, but is rude and impure, wherein as yet the pure part lieth hid. And therefore Alchimie teacheth to purge the medicine to dissolue it, and to separate things of contrarie kinde from things of the same kinde, otherwise rotten things woulde be mingled with rotten, and the corrupt with the corrupt, and so conspire to one effect, so that of one disease manie other should spring or arise. Briefly, euery man loueth not that wherof he hath no vnderstanding or knowledge, but flieth from it, contemneth it, and thinketh it not meete to be learned. The body onely careth for that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but the minde worshippeth his God. By how much more the knowledge or vnderstanding of any thing doth encrease or growe, so much the more is the loue of the fame augmented. For all things consist in the true knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, and out of that springs all the good fruites that redound to knowledge. Knowledge also brings faith, for he that knoweth God, beginneth straitway to put his trust in him. For such as euery mans faith is, such is also his knowledge.</p>
               <p>And contrariwise he that doth otherwise worke about nature, worketh like a Painter that painteth an image, in the which is neither life nor strength: wherefore those
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21435:22"/>
which you call Emperickes shall rise euen before your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and take in hand and help grieuous diseases, the cures whereof are vnpossible vnto you: and you togither with your consolations and reasonings shall be made laughing stockes. As lately B. in Germanie it happened of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain noble and famous woman which was vexed with the paine of the matrix. Some physitions saide it was the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and the stone; but an Empericke passing by affirmed that it was neither the grauel nor the stone, wherefore he commanded a remedy to be prepared for the matrix, the which being done, she was straitwayes healed. Oh what a rumour was raised by and by of him! stirring vp others also to rumours and tales, saying, that her husband doeth contemne vs that wil rather vse the aduise and counsel of an Empericke, then ours. Yea and others that seemed wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser did finally regard him that would euery houre vse the help of an Empericke man most vnlearned. Marke I pray you (my friend <hi>Aquilla)</hi> how the enemies inflamed with enuy go about to oppresse the trueth: but at the last, will they, nill they, they shal be inforced to confesse that that cannot be denied. But you may obiect vnto me; He that speaketh all, excludeth nothing.

               <p>AMongest all things that were created of God, water was the first, whereunto God ioined his proper earth, and of earth, whatsoeuer hath essence or life hath his originall. Therefore there are two manifest elements, that is, water and earth; in which the two other lie hidde, the fire in the earth, and the aire in the water: and they are so knit together, that they cannot be seperated. Two of them are fixed, as the earth and fire. two are flying, as water and aire. Therefore euery element doth participate within other elements. Moreouer, in euery element are two other elements, one decaying, putrifying and combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible, the other eternall and incorruptible as the heauen: besides iu these natures lieth hid an other nature which is called by the name of stinking Pheces, which hinder and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21435:23"/>
take away the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the rest, so as they haue very litle force or none, and thereby make the other elements stinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and subiect to putrifaction. There is also two kindes of waters, the one elementall, the other of raine and riuer waters; as there is also two kindes of earths, one elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, cleare, shining, and white, the other blacke, stincking, and combustible. Like as also there be two fires, one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and naturall, the other stinking and combustible: the like is also to be saide of the aire. The base things are so mingled with the rest, that by and by they corrupt al things, so that nothing can continue long, for they bring death and weaken all nature be it neuer so noble. This is to be vnderstoode of all things both vegetall, animall, and minerall. Therefore it is necessary by Art to seperate the elementall nature from the corruptible, that the matter may be brought to a medicinall qualitie. There bee three most subtill spirites in all things, that is, colour, taste, and smell, these fly away inuisibly, the Philosophers call them wilde spirits, because they are not fixible, yet the industrie of the artificer may fixe them. They alwaies growe in the bodily substance vntill they come to perfection and end. The herb therfore is to be taken when it is fully growen, and take heed that you loose none of those three spirits, as the ignorant vse to do, with their putrifactions and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of elements. For none of those spirites consisteth of the three elementall elements: but God hath adorned elements with those three spirits, and of them the fire is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall, the water aire elementall, and no man but God can seperate them asunder. But the water of the cloudes may be seperated from them. Also all the pheces may be separated from them which are mingled with them, which are the stinking and corruptible elements, and the foure elementall elements may be brought to a christalline shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but these three elements, fire, aire, and earth are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seperable. My sonne, knowe this, that Mercurie is the first of all things, for before time there was water, and the spirit of the Lord rested vpon the water, but what vvas that water, the water of the cloudes, or a moisture which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21435:24"/>
might be powred out? No: but it was a drie dusty water, &amp; God had ioyned his earth vnto it which is his sulphur, and so the earth congealeth the water, and thereof sprung the foure elements included in these two by the will of God. Therefore Mercurie congealeth sulphure, and sulphure Mercurie; neither can one of these be without the other, as also they cannot be without their salt, which is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est meane by whose help nature ingendreth and bringeth forth all vegetals, minerals, and animals. Wherefore these three, mercurie, salt, and sulphur can not be one without another, for where the one is found, there the other are found also, neither is there any thing in nature wherein these three are not found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of these three whatsoeuer is in nature hath his originall, and are so mingled with the foure elements, that they make one body, and the salt is drowned in the bottome of the elements, for it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that the salt should keepe them vnited by his sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

These three spirites whereof we haue spoken, are said first to be sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the mixture of the elements which is the soul of all things, or their quintaessence, which holdeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole mixture of the elements, for when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites are gone cut, then the mixture is dissolued by it selfe and diuided, neither is there neede of fire to expel the salt from the earth, when the elements are separated from the pheces, then is the salt also separated with it. This salt is vnknowne to the ignoraunt. Therefore salt is the meane betweene the grosse earthly partes, and the three flying spirites resting in the naturall heat, that is, the taste, moist smell, and colour: which three are the life, soule, and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taessence of euery thing, neither can these three spirits be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21435:24"/>
one without the other, as the Father, the Sonne, and the Holie-ghost are one, yet three persons, and one is not without the other. The ignorant laugh, neither vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand they these three spirits, when as they are tied to the grosse earthly fixed partes, and are made subtill, and their salt is ioyned and mingled with them, it must transforme them all together, and fixe them into a cristalline bodie Diaphanes and red of colour, whereof we wil speak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; he that knoweth not this salt, shall neuer bring anie to passe in Art. The philosophers call this salt a drie wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a liuely salt, but the ignorant thought they meant mercurie, but the Philosophers called the three spirites Mercurie, and the earth Sulphur, which the ignorant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not. Either of them can not be without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither is there any thing in nature, in which these three are not, and they are so mixed with the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they make one body and mixture. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God hath created is in these three stones, wherfore all may be reduced into a cristalline cleernesse by Art, giuen by God vnto the Philosophers, for in the latter days God wil seperate all the vncleane pheces and corruption that is in the elements, and bring them to a cristalline cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and rednesse of a carbuncle. Afterward there shall be no more corruption, but they shall endure for euer. Do you thinke that all thinges which God hath created in these lower partes, should vtterly perish in the latter day? No, not the least haire of those things which God hath created no more then the incorruptible heauen, but God by his will wil change all things, and make them christal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and the foure elements shall be perfect, simple, and fixed in themselues, and they shall be all a quintaessence. Demonstration of these things may be made here on earth by Arte, for whatsoeuer God hath created may be broght to a cristalline cleerenesse, and the elements gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a simple fixed substance, which being doone, no man can alter them, neither the fire it selfe burne or change them, but they shal continue perpetually as those things which haue attained eternitie.</p>

Neither is there any thing wanting, but that the inward qualitie may be brought, that his red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may appeere outwardly, and that his pheses be sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, then is it prepared, and shall not neede to be fixed, for it is fixed alreadie, and doth retaine with it selfe al out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward spirits, and whatsoeuer is volatill, it doth retaine.

               <p>NOw wil I open vnto you a great secret in the vegetall worke of honie, to wit, a maruellous nature, for it is drawen out of the most noble &amp; pure part of the floures. The nature of Bees is such, that they draw out the best of euery thing, as in the Animall worke is more at large des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, wherein there is taught how to extract the nature of al beasts, and specially in the 84.

Wherefore (my sonne) know this, that al that God hath created good in the vpper part of the world, are perfect and vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, as the heauen: but whatsoeuer in these lower partes, whether it be in beasts, fishes, and all manner of sensible creatures, hearbs, or plants, it is indued with a double na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is to say, perfect, and vnperfect: the perfect na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called the Quintaessence, the vnperfect the Pheces or dregges, or the vene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you shall seperate the dregges and combustible oyle, and then that which remaineth is perfect, and is called the Quintaessence, which will endure continually euen as the heauen, neyther can it bee dissolued with fire or anie other thing. For when God had created all things, and looked vpon them, they were all perfect good, there was nothing lacking to any, and therefore for loues sake, I say vnto thee, that God hath put a secret nature or influence in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature, and that to euery nature of one sort or kind he hath giuen one common influence, and to euery one of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall kindes their seuerall influence, and vertue, whether it be on Physicke, or other secret workes, which partly are found out by natural work manship. And yet more things
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21435:27"/>
are vnknowen then are apparant to our senses: what, doe you not thinke that an herb that is appointed for one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease which it will cure, doth not containe in it many more vertues then are knowen vnto vs? Yes truely many more. This also Iadde, that if the pheces and combustible oile be taken away from this thing or herb, which in all things is the poyson, that should be taken away that brings death vnto vs, and the elements should be purified, and so burned together by Art, that they shall passe together by a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becke, and be ioyned together, as it were coupled in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that it may roote out al manner of disease from eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, be it herb or liuing thing, or be drawen from his venome, as in the 14. chapter of the Prologue of this book is declared, and also in the Prologue of the Animall work, whereas the manner of drawing the Quintaessence out of all venemous beasts, birds, wormes, and flies, is plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that it may help all the griefes of man, but that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is drawen out of the blood of man, and there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise declared, that there is no neede of things without man or beast to help such as are infected. For euerie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture containes in himselfe the remedy of his disease, which remedy may be drawne without the hurt of man or beast, that the disease may bee miraculously cured, as is there most excellently taught in the the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore I would write this, that thou soone migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test vnderstand what maruellous force is in honie, which is taken out of all floures, and gathered into one masse, which truely is indued with sundry vertues. For if GOD hath giuen vnto other things the gift of healing, what then is there not in honnie, which is gathered out of so many floures, and euery herb indued with his owne proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Truely if it be brought to his height and excellencie, it will worke maruellously. Now consider what lieth hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in this Quintaessence, and esteeme it not lightly, but keepe it secret as the most excellent thing of al the animal worke, the which being obtained, you shall neede no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther medicines to put away al the accidents of the bodie.</p>

Take then your quintaessence and put it in a Pellican in ashes, but better in salt prepared and dried, and make your fire like vnto the extreme heate in Sommer, and the quintaessence wil rise lyke vnto a red oyle, and fal downe againe by the armes of the Pellican: and by often ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the quintaessence wil waxe thicke that it wil tarie in the bottome and rise no more, then fortifie the fire that it may ascend and descend againe. Then keepe the fire in that heate vntill it ascend no more, but rest in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Then make your fire stronger that it may ascend &amp; descend againe, and keepe the heate in the same degree vntill it rise no more. Obserue this manner in augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21435:30"/>
your fire vntill the water be fixed, and the glasse be red hotte foure and twentie houres together: if the quintaessence doe not then ascend, it is fixed and brought vnto his highest vertue, &amp; take it out of the glasse being yet hotte, for if it be cold it will waxe hard that you must breake the glasse. For at the fire it doth waxe liquide, and being set open in the ayre, it doth congeale and pearceth euerie hard thing, as oyle doth any drie leather, and in colour is like vnto a rubine, and through shining lyke a christal, it giueth light in the darke sufficient to reade by. What doest thou thinke of this my sonne? are there not many strange bodies created of God? Truely hee hath endued the Philosophers with no lesse giftes: For they that can looke into the secrets of nature, shall see it to be of an incredible operation, for this is gathered by the Bees of the subtilest part of all plantes, trees, flowers, and fruites, and at that time when flowers breake out and trees budde. It is worthily called the Philosophers stone. for it is fixed and lyquable as waxe, and as the minerall stone transmuteth the impure mettall, so doth this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diseases. Heereby it doth appeare that this doth beare the bell amongst all vegetals. Whereas it being yet in his grosenesse and vnpure, it is but of smal value for any vse in Physick by what meane soeuer it be boyled or scummed, but doeth alwayes retaine his nature. For it consisteth of all the fruites of the earth, plantes and trees. Whereof one herbe is hotte, another cold, another drie, another moist, one astringent, another laxatiue, some corrosiue, others venemous: and so diuers herbes haue their diuers qualities. Thirdly it commeth to passe if it helpe one disease, by and by it hindreth an other. For euerie thing worketh according to his propertie when as there is separation made in the body. And of this separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ingendreth bloud and other humors. And they are lykened vnto gunnepouder, which so long as it lyeth stil there commeth no hurt of it, but if it be brought vnto the fire, it straight vttereth his secret nature, and is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a venemous fire which cannot be quenched with

water. For the colde and drie, hote and moist, do striue amongst themselues, a wind is stirred vp that breaketh al things that is neere vnto it. The like happeneth vnto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that when it commeth to the region of the liuer that it should be there seperated, then it sheweth his nature to passe vp and swell with winde, that it is no maruel if that through contention the veines of the liuer be broken, as oftetimes it happeneth, whereupon Apostomes are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in diuers places, and bringeth foorth such inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the veines are easily broken. Although manie do greatly commend hony: but they are not the children of philosophie, neither do they vnderstand the nature of it. But when it is brought to a simple fixed as wine, then is it the chiefest medicine amongst al the vegetables, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the like vnto this found in al the world. Giue God thankes, and be liberall vnto the poore. The dose of this is one graine, and it must be taken euery morning with an empty stomacke, likewise in the euening, vntil the ende of the disease.

Also if any man bee bewitched either in bodie or in his art, that is, in Cookerie, Bruing, or Baking, or by any other meanes, this herb caried about him makes him free from the witchcraft. If it bee also tyed vppon the bellie of a woman with childe, she shall straightwayes be deliuered although the childe were dead and rotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as it hath beene oftentimes prooued by experience. This herbe caryed about one or a little thereof euerie day eaten as long as it is vsed, preserueth man from the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sicknesse.

They that are wearied with trauell, if they drinke the iuice thereof in wine, they are by and by so refreshed, as if they had not laboured or gone no iourney, it doth comfort the synowes, muscles, tendons, and all the whole nature. Woundes are also cured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, if it bee dronke tenne daies together in wine or ale, if the wound be washed with the same drinke, and bound vp with a cloth wette in the same. The paine of the teeth is by and by apeased if that herbe bee laid vnto it. All these things haue beene often prooued and found true. If it will doe such things whilest it is yet hindered with his grosse matter, what will it worke when it is brought to his perfection?

Nowe there remaineth that wee must teach howe to bring this hearbe to his highest degree, and to his quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taessence. First it is to be gathered the same hauing his course in his owne house, that is, in the lion, and the moone behold him with a sinister quadrate aspect. It is to be gathered whole with rootes, leaues and flowers, so that there be neither earth, dirt, nor other hearbes mingled withall. Neither must it by any meane touch any water or be made moyst. Therefore you must take heede that you gather it not in rainie wether, or moyst wether: but rather when the sunne doth shine hottest vpon it, gather great store of it, and stampe it well in a mortar of Marble, and put it in a <hi>Cucurbite</hi> of stone with a head and receauer luted, and set it in balneo, and distill away al the water vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be so drie like pouder, and there will rise together with the water of the color of most fine gold, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happeneth in this herbe, and in none other: and when there remaineth no more liquor, yet leaue the cucurbite for three or foure dayes in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and boyle it night and day that all the moysture may be perfectly seperated and drawne away, then let it coole and take away the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and stoppe it diligently, then take off the head and take out the matter and beate it in a Marble morter into most fine pouder that it may passe through a thicke siue, put this pouder againe into an earthen cucurbite, and poure on your water and aire, and stirre it with a wodden ladle, and couer the mouth of the cucurbite close with a tyle, and set it in a warme bath by the space of nine dayes to putrifie, euerie day stirring it with a wooden ladle foure or fiue times, and couer the cucurbite againe with a tyle, setting a weight of lead vpon it; at the nine dayes ende take your vessell out of the <hi>Balneo,</hi> and that which is

in it straine it into an earthen vessell glased, and straine it hard vntill the matter drie. Then take this drie pouder and put into his cucurbite and couer it with a tyle, and keepe it in a warme place vntil I teach you what you shal do with it. The moist liquor which is drawen from it wil be red, for the element of fire is there present with the aire &amp; the water, put that liquor into a cucurbite of stone and put on a head and lute it wel, and set it in <hi>Balneo</hi> with a receauer well luted, and distill away all the water with the aire seuerally from the fire in a boyling bath, vntill there will no more distill, and the fire will passe away in the bottome, then take away the vessell out of the bath &amp; stop it well vntill I teach thee what is further to be done.

Poure on againe more common water vpon them, and stirre it, set it in <hi>balueo</hi> ten or twelue houres, take it out, let it settle, &amp; poure the cleere vnto the first water, and cast away the Pheces, they are nothing worth. Repeate this worke so often vntill there remaine no pheces after it hath set ed. Then shal you haue your earth rectified from all his phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which you shall congele and drie, that it may be like pouder or dust. Then ioyne that with your other ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the glasse, and it wil straight resolue into his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the element of water is there present. Set them all together in a furnace vpon ashes, put on a head with a receauer well luted, the head must haue a hole in the top, that with a funnel the liquor may be poured in &amp; alwaies stopped safely. Make your fire in your furnas, first gentle, afterward greater, vntil that that is fermented doe passe. But all is not to be drawen out, but about halfe a sextary of the liquor with the water, that the matter may remain moist. For if you should driue out all, it would congele into an hard masse and breake the glasse in the furnace. Then open the hole which is in the top of the head, and with a funnell poure in that which is in the receauer. But first it must be made warme, lest by pouring in the colde liquor the glasse do breake, but if you suffer the glasse to coole, you may poure it in without any danger. Repeate this inbibition ten or twenue times, afterward distil out whatsoeuer wil be distilled so long as any thing wil passe by the necke of the Limbecke. For after this tenth distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the earth wil be no more congeled but will rest in the bottome like a red golden oyle. Inbibe it againe, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on the liquor, and distilling it vntil al the elements passe together by the Limbecke, and that nothing at all doe remaine in the bottome of the vessell.

And vpon that do all the Philosophers agree, that a man may continue in the same state as long as in an earthly paradise.
