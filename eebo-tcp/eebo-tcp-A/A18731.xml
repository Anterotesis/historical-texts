            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Madame as my boldnes may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked for this wilfull presumption, (in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth Verses of so vertuous a Knight whose value my knowledge cannot vtter) So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forwardnes of my goodwill (if any offence happen) may be pardonable &amp; make a free passage to the wofull Epitaph of your Ladishippes worthie Husband. But so excellent a Personage, (beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with such noblenesse and learning) ought not to bee described and handled with the ignorant pen of so simple a writer. For who should speake of <hi>Achilles</hi> praise but <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi> yet good Ladie, in the bare &amp; plaine phrase, of a meane writer, true things may be couched, and from weake and base words, some stately and hie matter may be gathered. For as out of Chaffe good Corne is sifted, and fine golde is drawne from the grosest Drosse: so out of little Flint stones men strike out great sparkes of Fire, and from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a small trifle great wealth &amp; treasure doth arise. What needeth this Florish to bring in good liking and credite my sillie knowledge? or to what end serues these drie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses in so flowing a world? where the sweete Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and moysture of the Muses in this most fruitfull tyme, findes Tydes and seasons so replenished with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter springs, that no soyle nor peece of ground in our land, but hath taisted &amp; felt the gracious dewe of the Heauens:
<pb facs="tcp:5235:3"/>
I meane the bountie of this age (touching the quicknesse of sharpe sperites) is so beneficiall to thousands who haue reaped the chiefest Corne, that there is left no Seede nor Graine to no such an infortunate Gleaner as my selfe: Their workes, their Bookes, &amp; their learned arguments in sondrie maners, doth shewe they haue happely gotten and gathered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first crop of knowledge into their Barne: so that they which shall come after must either lose their labour, or bee driuen to walke peaking about the feelde to picke vp such forgotten eares of Corne, as the Reapers haue unwillingly left, or the ouersight of the world did carelesly looke vnto. The consait of these causes hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most astonyed my muse. For the matter I treate on hath bene before both learnedly and sententiously spoken of. What course then can I holde, or compasse can I keepe? for both our speeches attends but to one purpose: which is but to shewe the life and death of one onely Parragon and renowmed Knight of England. When the substance of a true tale is at the first throughly conceiued, I can find no inuention to perswade a beleef of a second trueth to bee vnderstood. And when an other man hath tolde as much as I can imagine, my silence were as seemely as my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dispute of the matter. But yet by the way (vnder fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour be it spoken) though at one present instant, two seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Mothers haue brought into the world two sondrie Children yet neither in nature, shape nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition the one proueth like the other: it may so fall out of these two Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphes (written on Sir <hi>Phillip Sidney</hi>) whose varietie, and inuentions, by strangenes of style may moue many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to consider the better of the matter penned. This my worke presented to your good Ladiship craueth that
<pb facs="tcp:5235:3"/>
credit, that as it may bee looked on, So it may passe as a memoriall, of such a worthie man, as it maketh mention of. I write not to renue any sorrowe (where there is to much sadnes alreadie) but to reuiue the heart with hope and gladnes, when it shall call to remembraunce, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall loue and affection of the people towardes this rare Gentleman: whose noble inclination and forme of life, is as well seene &amp; heard by the common report of the world, as though we sawe him aliue againe amongst vs. What greater ioye can a good wife haue then the hearing of the honorable report of so worthie an Husband? What Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Image can set forth any such presentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (to please either the mynd or eye) as true penned Uerses both voyde of flattry or any vaine respect? Or what can touch so nere the worthinesse of man, as the Pen that searcheth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes of nature, gropes the inward motions of the mind, and sets forth the hidden giftes of grace. If <hi>Appelles</hi> were aliue, he could but with his Pensell paint out the fauour and proportion of your Ladiships most well beloued: but an honest true Writer with his Pen, explayneth and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth open al the vertues belonging to a noble Personage. So as farre as my poore knowledge and cunning may reach, I haue stretched my iudgement and opinion, of one in deede of the worthiest that euer I knewe borne in our tyme. Trusting that your Ladiship will giue good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to my labor, and doubting no whit but the world enbraseth my trauaile. For the generall consent of many multitudes procured my Pen to set forth this work, as knoweth God, who possesse your Ladishipp with peace rest and blessednesse.</p>

               <l>In wretched earth and Tombe God wot ‖ his worthie bodie lyes:</l>
               <l>Who left behinde by heauie lot ‖ a world of weeping eyes.</l>
               <l>But chiefly Prince and publick weale ‖ who waies his worth a right,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5235:5"/>
A secret sigh or two they steale ‖ in thinking on this Knight.</l>
               <l>He feard no death, when one did craue ‖ if he would dye or no,</l>
               <l>Yet wisht some longer life to haue ‖ if God were pleased so.</l>
               <l>First to amend his life he sought ‖ a respite for a space,</l>
               <l>To purge his Soule that Christ had bought ‖ and therby purchase grace.</l>
               <l>Next only for Religions sake ‖ he crau'd a yere or two,</l>
               <l>Before from world he leaue did take ‖ that he some good might do.</l>
               <l>And last of all for Common weale ‖ he wisht a while to liue,</l>
               <l>That to the honor of our state ‖ he might some councell giue.</l>
               <l>Oh what desire was this of his ‖ from whence came that great minde:</l>
               <l>Was euer heauenlier thing then this ‖ brought forth of humaine kinde:</l>
               <l>No no, the Pearle of precious price ‖ is lost or stolne away,</l>
               <l>The head where dwelt each deepe deuice ‖ will here no longer stay,</l>
               <l>His trends and kindred wring their hands ‖ and heauie hearted goe:</l>
               <l>His wayling wife like Image stands ‖ and cannot speake for woe.</l>
               <l>His Seruants shake their heads and say ‖ (as men orecome with rage)</l>
               <l>Where is our Maister and our stay ‖ in this hard haples age.</l>
               <l>His Sisters life consumes away ‖ like Snow against the Sunne,</l>
               <l>His Brethren ban that dismoll day ‖ when his short race was runne.</l>
               <l>His Soldoiurs dolefull Dromme doth sound ‖ &amp; march in mourning sort,</l>
               <l>And trayles the Ensigne on the ground ‖ in signe of sad <hi>La mort.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But with exchaunge all chaunges goe ‖ for life comes death in place:</l>
               <l>For ioy comes payn, for wealth comes woe ‖ for woe &amp; grief comes grace.</l>
               <l>So leaue his Soule, where saeftie is ‖ embraest in <hi>Abrahams</hi> brest,</l>
               <l>There let him sléepe with endles blis ‖ that here could take no rest.</l>
