            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For ſure in this ſhoppe of ſecrets, are ſondrye ſorts of farre fetched marchandiſe, the goodnes whereof maye as well content the inwarde iudgement, as the gayeſt riches of the worlde doth pleaſe the gazinge eyes, but if wyth han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlinge alone and careleſſe lokinge of the ſame you laye it a ſyde (refuſing that is offered) I ſkarce thincke you worthye of ſo worthye a benefite, and miſdoubt ye wante a ſtorehouſe for ſo ſtately a treaſure.

            <head>Of Comforte the fyrst Booke</head>
            <p>AMonge ſuche and ſo manye auncient monuments as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Barbarian</hi> warres: would God (that at leaſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Tullius</hi> bokes of comforte, written at the deathe of his daughter, had beene tyll this day preſerued. For as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters hee declared him ſelfe more then a man, ſo may it be thought that herein he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten moſt excellently: the matter being neyther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, fayned or touchinge others, but procedinge from his own naturall affection and extreme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of mynde. And ſuche is the condicion and qualitie of comfortinge, as al be it no perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or eloquence were there in vſed, yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it not reaſon and ſufficiente proofe to trye it ſelfe: wherein ſo excellente, wiſe, and eloquente a man as <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> hauing trauailed: it muſte be preſumed he framed a worke not only worthy prayſe, but alſo aboue all expectacion.</p>
            <p>And albeit theſe auncient warres haue among many other noble workes depriued vs of ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a boke, yet haue we thought mete to entreate thereof (not becauſe it is ſo praiſeable as amiſſe it cannot be prayſed) but alſo ſo neceſſary (as in all thinges whiche of neceſſitie muſt be had) better it is to haue the worſt, then none at all. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emple we ſee, that houſes are nedefull, ſuch as can
<pb facs="tcp:5037:8"/> not poſſeſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtately pallaces of ſtone, do perſuade themſelues to dwell in houſes of timber and clay, and wanting theim, are contented to inhabite the ſimple cotage, yea rather then not to be houſed at all refuſe not the pore cabbon, and moſt beggerly caue. So neceſſarie is this gifte of conſolacion, as there liueth no man, but that hathe cauſe to embrace it. For in theſe things better it is to haue any then none at al. And wel we ſee ther is none aliue that in euery reſpect may be accompted hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, yea though mortall men were free from all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, yet the torments &amp; feare of death ſhould ſtil offend them. But beſides them, behold, what, and how manye euilles there bee, that vnleſſe the cloude of error bee remoued, impoſſible it is to ſee the truth, or receiue allay of our earthly woes.</p>
            <p>And aboue the greues that all other neceſſities do bring with them, this hath ſomwhat more gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veous, and intollerable: for they ſatiſfied withe that they deſire, forthwith they ceaſe to offend: as honger is eaſed with meate, thirſte is appeaſed to drinke, labour contented with reſte. But the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, of euils is ſo ſetled and manifolde, as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting good perſuaſion doth neuer ceaſe to torment the minde, but from one diſcontented imaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to an other, from one calamitie or miſerie to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually leadeth on our diſpleaſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g thoughts And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cauſe we haue framed this boke, which although it profiteth nothinge to driue awaye the cares and anxietie of minde in others, yet ſhall I therein not a litle content my ſelf, for which reſpect thiefly I toke the matter in hand. And as menne
<pb facs="tcp:5037:8"/> ſaye, that <hi>Aſclepiodorus</hi> without colours did right cunningly paint: ſo ſhall we voyd of all craft and ſkil, with true reaſon declare how much each man erreth in life, iudgement, opinion, and will. Yea, ſomethinges there are that ſo wel do proue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as beſides nature nede no profe at all.</p>
            <p>Of which kinde in this our incertaine lyfe, vain glory, and in nature of thinges, great plenty was euermore to be found, and in al ſuch the more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge and eloquence is vſed, the leſſe wee ſee ofte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times they receiue credite and beliefe. Who is ſo much miſaduiſed as wold paint the pillers of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite marble or Porfery? or who dothe coloure the veſſels of Allabaſter? When the naturall gloſſe doth geue chiefeſt grace and reputation to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work we plaiſter and painte the ragged walles of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and claye, to the ende that arte ſhould ſupplye, that nature hathe lefte vnſemelye. Neither do I think our worke here in ſo great as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge we thought to bee. For albeit we knowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nomber of miſeries and cares to be many, yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them be of ſuche kinde as being wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered do nede no medicine at all. As thoſe why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che men willingly and vnconſtrained do force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to beare: for who would take in hande to comfort <hi>Marcus Regulus,</hi> amids his miſeries? who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neyther the pitie of his children, nor the prayers of his kinſfolkes, could perſwade to remain in Rome and not to retourne to the handes of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.</hi> Of the ſame greatnes of minde were the holy martirs, <hi>Paule, George, Laurence,</hi> with almoſte innumerable others. Some other ſortes of payns
<pb facs="tcp:5037:9"/> and trauaile there are which the fainteſt harts do not refuſe to abyde, either in reſpecte of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> glory or gaine that groweth thereof. As ſome we ſee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled do ſerue princes, others do labour to ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſe their louers, ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume their time in ſtudies ſome follow trafficke, and ſome ſeeke aucthoritie and rule. So litle trouble they fynde in theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes as being remoued from them, they are gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately greued. Some led on with onely hope, doe voluntarily take vpon them a life with patience &amp; trauaile to bee endured: as thoſe that paſſe their daies in ſolitary places, as they that liue in citties continually, as they that obſerue religion ſtraight lye, praying &amp; faſting, who being aſked for what ende they ſo do: anſwere, for hope that after death they ſhall receiue eternall felicitie. Some there are that take greate paines and willinglye ſuffer in reſpect of ſwetenes and delight (as they think) that is ioyned there vnto. As harueſt labourers, who after longe toyle and ſweat in ſommers ſon, do not withſtandinge daunce when the pype doth ſound. Others with colde feete doe leaue the fyer to caſt the dyce: for though the cold do pinche, yet the pleaſure of the play is more. But far greater incoueniences doe <hi>Cupides</hi> knightes with aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of life abide and yet, withe all their hartes they hazarde all, that in the ende all their deſyres may be obteined. Some there are that although they ſeme euell eyther in reſpect of natures neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſytie, as old age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of compariſon, as breaking of priſon, yet are they more paciently borne: becauſe before they came they were deſyred, and beinge
<pb facs="tcp:5037:9"/> com may not therfore be vnwelcome. Wherfore if in perticuler I ſhould entreat of euery of theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no fruit ſhould grow therof, I might alſo ſeme comberſome &amp; tedious. I do therfore thinke beſt to ſpeake of thoſe which men do condempne &amp; flee as euyll. Among which nomber ſomewhat I wyl ſay of the euils aboueſaide, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one thinge is not to euery man alyke pleaſant or diſconting, but of them old age ſemeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> chiefe, whiche though no calamity, but a gift of nature (&amp; yet in ſome reſpect may be ſo called) becauſe we ſe it vnwillingly born of many, &amp; therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> hath thereof curiouſlye written, &amp; though it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be iuſtly nombred amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> euils of mans life, yet of vs ſhall not be omitted.</p>
            <p>We ſay therefore that among thinges wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte euyll, there be three ſortes. That is to ſaye, Comon calamityes, priuat calamities ſimple, and priuat calamities manifold: comon calamities we cal thoſe that happen to al men, or the greateſt no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our acquaintance: as honger, peſtilence, ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſion of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, and ſuch lyke. Priuat calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſimple, be of two ſortes, the one diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as if a thief lamenteth that hee loſeth the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie for murder: or diſhoneſt as the weping of <hi>Vrſus</hi> in <hi>Papinius.</hi> The other honeſt and in no wiſe worthy greate diſcommendacion: as the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of houſes, the loſſe of children, &amp; death of fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Priuat calamities manifold we acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt thoſe when a man by many miſhaps at one inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſted: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcripture telleth of <hi>Iob,</hi> who depry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued of his houſe, children, cattel, &amp; ſubſtaunce, was alſo tormented with moſt pitiful diſeaſes &amp; ſores.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5037:10"/> Some men do hold for true opinion that albeit, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſuſtaine one kind of calamity, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance of ſo ſondrye myſeries is not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in any. Wherfore of priuate &amp; ſimple euils in general we wyl firſt take in hand to wryte, next we ſhall entreate of ſorrow and death eyther of our ſelues or nere frendes: In the ſeconde booke, and in the laſt, we wyl not omit to ſpeake of tormente, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, impriſonment, exile, iniury of old age, pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, &amp; in general of many miſeries aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But fyrſt let vs begin at priuate euils, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claringe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the good or euill fortune, importeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to bleſſed life, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the fruit of al felicity (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth) reſteth in vertue, or as the Poet ſayth.</p>
            <p>VVhoſe conſcience giltles is, doth not grovve pale for feare.</p>
            <p>And yet (as at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beginning I ſaid) who ſo would conſider how many diſcontentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do happen &amp; diligently marke euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould finde to what ſmal purpoſe in aduerſitye a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tormenteth himſelfe, conſidering how ſhort, frayle, incertain, &amp; myſerable the life of man is. So as if at any time for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> miſery it is to be lamented, then after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Heraclites,</hi> is continually to be bewailed, &amp; as <hi>Palladas</hi> ſayth. <hi>Al vveeping vvas I borne, all vveeping muſt I dye: my vvhole life in vveeping haue bene conſumed. O lamentable life of man remayninge on earth in ſicknes, ſorrovv, and continuall miſerye.</hi> Therefore if at any time we muſt take leaue of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame either euer or neuer to be done, for life is eyther euer to bee lamented or neuer.</p>
            <p>Among other myſeries what I pray you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be greater then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man riſeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bed in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to be incertaine of his returne to reſt againe?
<pb facs="tcp:5037:10"/> or being in bed, whether his life ſhall continue tyll he ryſe? beſydes that, what labour, what hazard &amp; care, are men conſtrained to abyde with theſe our brittle bodies, our feeble force, and incertayne lyfe: ſo as of no nacion I thinke a man better or more fytlye named then of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage do terme a man, ſhadow. And ſure ther is nothing to be found of leſſe aſſurance or ſoner paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then the lyfe of man, no, nor y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> may more right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye be reſembled to a ſhadow. Somtime I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with my ſelfe, and thinke (yf the chryſtian lawe were therunto conſentyng) that the ſoules of ſom wicked deuils were entred into the bodies of men as torments for ſynnes, and ſo after death none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hell or punyſhment to folow. So greate is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſſe of worldly miſeries, as this lyfe is eyther for wicked folke, or by ſome wicked god appoynted. But when I duly conſyder al, I leaue this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opynion as altogether vntrue: &amp; perceiue that in this lyfe ther is nothing found y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> may iuſtly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led good or euyll, &amp; do allow of thoſe phyloſophers as wyſe, who thought that al thinges conſyſted in opynion. For what cuſtome, what law, or what iudgement, is ſo certein, as is not encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred with contrary opinions? and ſurely beleue me, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers wold not ſo long haue contended amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themſelues, if the matters of theyr contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had not reſted only in opynyon: what man is ſo mad as wyl ſay the ſwan is blacke? or that the rauen is in colour whyte, when the matter is otherwiſe to be iudged by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſence. But what is good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl (O lord) how much ſpeach, how great diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:5037:11"/> and howe longe contencion hath beene. The blynd man ſekes a mote. How can it be other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcention, when the thing dyffreth from it ſelfe, &amp; the philoſophers do diſagre among themſelues as of that, that no wher is to be found. And here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to my memory a certayn fable written by an au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient poet, whych doth lyuely in my iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement ſet forth mans lyfe. It is told that when myghty <hi>Iupiter</hi> had made the heauens, the earthe the ſeas, the beaſtes, and men, he ſoberly conſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that vnleſſe he allotted both puniſhment &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for mens deſertes, it ſhould ſo come to paſſe as they would not only approue al kynd of dyſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but alſo dyſdayne the gods theym ſelues, for whych conſyderation the greate <hi>Ioue</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded <hi>Vulcan</hi> to frame two braſen tunnes, the one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue all that was good, the other to conteyn the euyl, and made both good &amp; euyl thinges wynged, to thende they myght more fytlye be ſent amonge mortall men, accordinge to the quality of theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertes. But <hi>Pandora</hi> being a buſy goddes and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to loke into the veſſels, dyd open them, &amp; ſode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly both the good &amp; the euyl brake forth &amp; flewe theyr wayes, the good houered vp to heauen, the euyll made ſpeee to the hel, and in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> barel of euyl remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only hope: &amp; in the veſſell of good was founde ſuſpycion as that wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were maynteyned, which newes when <hi>Iupiter</hi> hard (as he is an angry god) toke the empty veſſells, and in a rage threwe them down, whych mortal men ſeing, deſyrous of newes drew nere &amp; embraced the emptye barrels, ſome of the good and ſome of the euyll But they
<pb facs="tcp:5037:11"/> that layd hold of the empty tonnes dyd neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to haue gotten both good and euyl, and yet in dede neyther good nor euyl fel to any mortal man, ſauing that they y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hapned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the better barrel found in themſelues opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good with ſuſpicion, &amp; the other opinion of euill w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome hope. And ſo it came to paſſe, not vnlyke as when men in darke nyghts walkyng in <hi>Arabia</hi> do happelye treade vppon ſome piece of yron or other cold thing, are ſodenly affrighted with feare leaſte they haue hapned vpon a venemous ſerpent, &amp; yet haue not: euen ſo the only ſuſpicion of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyll is that, that perplexeth al mortal creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe al that is good is aſcended to heauen, and al that is euyl, gone down to the infernall ſprytes.</p>
            <p>And therfore euer ſynce the great <hi>Iupiter</hi> haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dained to take acompt of mortal mens deſeruings Truly although this be a fayned fable, yet doth yt aſwel declare the originall both of good and euyll as yf it had bene ſet forth in the learned ſcholes. But as theſe earthly ioyes are vayne and inſtable, ſo in the world to come al thyngs are certain, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; euerlaſting, whether throughe ſufferance of theſe afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s whych we call euyls, the godly loue doth cal vs: according to the ſayinge of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prophet, becauſe thou were accepted by god, it was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> temptacion ſhould try the: for the almighty God not vnlyke a father that entierly loueth hys chyldren doth bring them vp in all contynencye &amp; ſober lyfe, reſtrayning their pleaſures, not ſuffring them without chaſtiſement to exerciſe any euyl or vngodly lyfe. And contrary wyſe ſuch as hee eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb facs="tcp:5037:12"/> not, and that lyue lyke chyldren deſtened to perdicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wythout regard he doth ſuffer to purſue their dronken and diſolute maner of lyuing. Shal we therfore ſay the life of ſuch ſeruauntes is more happy, or more to be wiſhed for then thoſe ſonnes. For none are admitted to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ioyes, but thoſe that in all good lyfe and perfection do deſerue the ſame: for as gold is fyned in the fornace ſo the life of a iuſt man, by aduerſity in this world is tryed. And yet if al eyther good or euyl ſhould be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> heauenly hope, yt were no more then one grayn to a hole heape. S. <hi>Paule</hi> therfore ſayd that al we ſuffer in this worlde was not meritorious enough to gayn the glory of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world to come, who ſo euer then that fyrmely embraceth thys faythe, ſhould he not in aduerſyty reioyſe &amp; in proſperitye lament? and amids his miſeries perſuade himſelfe that god doth make tryal of hys fayth, after tryall to cal him among the number of his choſen? If in getting worldly glory thou doeſt ſo much reioyſe, the reward therof being ſmal, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance ſhort and mortal: what ſhould we do for this heauenly glory, which is euerlaſting, great, &amp; aſſured? So great is this comfort, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> if ther were not manye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſwerued in fayth, the holy office of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting were al ready finiſhed, who wold not chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge this ſhort life, with that life euerlaſting? this frayl with that fyrme? this vnhappy, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that moſt happy this trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bleſome, withe that moſte quiet? but in wante of beleefe is ſynne, and in ſynne is wante of beliefe: where by the condicion of man is berefte bothe of hope &amp; faith, For what can be vnto man either more profytable after deathe, or more to be wiſhed
<pb facs="tcp:5037:12"/> in this life, then the hope of the life to come? And though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame were not, yet ought a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no whit to be diſcouraged, becauſe there is almoſt no my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery ſo great but may be conuerted to better hap. Neyther is there among mortal men any opinion ſo aſſured, as that nothing is ſure. For as aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye and miſfortune hath bene to ſome men a way to good chaunce: ſo hath proſperity bene to others the occaſion of miſerye. But it is not our determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to diſcourſe hereof, though by often profe it is to be tryed. Our care onely is to entreate of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamityes: for if I ſhould write of all ſuch as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune hath aduaunced, this booke could ſcantly containe them. Neither do I beleue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture to meane other by the hiſtory of <hi>Iob,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in one example to ſhew the varietye of fortune which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Gentiles</hi> by dyuers examples were taught to beleue. For <hi>Iob</hi> being firſt happy, hauing health, children, abundance, land, poſſeſſion, &amp; cattel, was bereft of all hys worldly goodes, &amp; ſuch as in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity were his greateſt frends, became in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitye his moſt cruell foes, yet afterwardes in more aboundance then before, he receyued the goodnes and liberalitye of fortune. Such and ſo many be the occaſions both of good and euil fortune, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more incertaine.</p>
            <p>The ſeruitude of <hi>Ventidius</hi> was cauſe that after he became Conſul and gayned great glorye, which he without decaye of the Romaine fortune could neuer haue loked for. But by his bondage hee had occaſion to ſhew his vertue which was the waye to felicity. The profe thereof is dayly ſeene among
<pb facs="tcp:5037:13"/> the barbarouſe nacions, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
               <hi>Turkes,</hi> &amp; thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which were called <hi>Mamaluchi,</hi> Among mortal creatures what can be more intollerable then ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? yet did the ſame greatly profyte the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure <hi>Auguſtus</hi> being in armes againſt <hi>Brutus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For hee, warned by his phiſicion to remoue from his pauilion by ſleape he recouered health, whyche yf for other reſpect he had done, the ſame had beene to his great diſhonour, or if he had abydden he had bene ſlayne or forced to flee. <hi>Plotinus</hi> a philoſopher of <hi>Platoes</hi> ſect, had amonge others a ſcholer named <hi>Ornucius Marcellus</hi> who was greatly diſeaſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gout &amp; palſey, through diligent hearing his maſter (who diſputed &amp; red with great ſwetenes &amp; facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye) he forgot ofte times to eate: and ſo withe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue hearing became a ſinguler philoſopher, and with muche abſtinence recouered his healthe. So throughe ſickenes hee gayned bothe learninge and good recouery.</p>
            <p>The euill diſpoſition of the bodye doth ofte tymes profyte the vertue of mynde, for ſicknes make the the ſurfyter to become of good dyet, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proud more couetous, the wicked religious, yea other whiles it profiteth the body alſo, for more men of ſickly body then healthe doe attayne to old age. Suche is the chaunge of worldlye thinges. For as wyth in the tayle of a Stagge lyethe mooſte preſente poyſon, and all the reſte of his bodye is holſome Fleſhe: So the Serpent <hi>Tyrus</hi> whoſe venom is vncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hathe fleſhe ſo holſome, as it is medicinable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all other poyſons.</p>

And amonge theſe thinges that laboure
<pb facs="tcp:5037:18"/> whych huſbandmen do vſe, ſeemeth to our eares moſt intollerable.

            <p>What can for trauaile and peryll bee compared to the warres? where men do labour, dygginge, &amp; deluinge, ſleaping in the wynters ſnow, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge in the ſommers ſonne, watching, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, day and night, clyming the mountaines and ſayling the ſeas: ſomtimes afflicted with hunger, ſomtymes with thyrſt: yea and in the end, eyther to kyl or to be kylled.

For who ſo knoweth not how to do in proſperitye, forgetteth hee is mortall: there is no greater argumente of wiſedome, then when a man doth that preſentlye which others by benefyte of time haue learned.</p>
            <p>Be not therfore burdenouſe to thy ſelfe &amp; though
<pb facs="tcp:5037:20"/> thou art chaunced into this ſhadow of calamitye yet caſt not thy ſelfe downe into very miſfortune.</p>
            <p>Thinke aſſuredlye that ſome bee free frome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye euyl, and that tyme bringethe wyth all the moſte certayne and ſure conſolacion.</p>
            <p>Not that we haue all ready ſpoken of, but that which <hi>Auerroes</hi> &amp; other philoſophers haue written.</p>
            <p>When ſoberlye thou conſyder that the lyfe of manne compared to the eternall worlde, is not a moment, and in that ſhort tyme al to be vayne, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and by aſſured lawe of nature ſhorte, ſo as it makethe no matter at all, what a one thou haſte beene or ſhalte bee. And when wythe my ſelfe I ymagine of this matter, I remember that whiche in bookes of common fables wee reade, where ſome are fayned riche men, ſome mightye kinges, and ſome ſo ſtronge, as for ſtrengthe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed <hi>Hercules,</hi> what difference there ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte theſe fayned men and <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Pompey,</hi> tyll this daye I coulde neuer learne, vnleſſe that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for oure learninge an hiſtorye is made diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente from a fable. or that we haue conſideration of ſoules that lyue for euer.</p>
            <p>For otherwiſe when thou ſhalte no more bee, it ſkillethe not at all what thou haſte beene. Onlye Follie of man hathe founde oute this inuention that we ſhould perſwade oure ſelues to be happy or vnhappye, not onelye in this worlde, but alſo after in the opinion of others.</p>
            <p>Some I ſee mooſte carefull that after deathe they maye leaue behynde theim riches or fame.</p>
            <p>And entyſed withe ſuche deſire <hi>Heroſtratus</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:5037:20"/> the Temple of <hi>Diana<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>,</hi> that thereby (thoughe for wicked doinge) hee might gaine eternal fame.</p>
            <p>But who was this <hi>Heroſtratus?</hi> by what father begotten? or of what mother was hee borne? In what countrye dyd hee dwell? what was hys parſon, or whiche waies did hee lyue? what doe we knowe hereby, other, then either to knowe nothinge or a fayned man? And admitte thou gayne this deſired glorie? what ſhall it auaile thee after three hundrethe yeares whether thou were happie or vnhappie?</p>
            <p>And if no glorie bee, within fiftie yeares after deathe what difference ſhalbee betwixte a kinge and a Carle. Betwixte <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Irus</hi> betwixte <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Cleon,</hi> betwixte flaues and fremen, betwixte happie and vnhappie. But leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes thou lyue in doubte that time doth ſtyll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde, and the courſe of heauens be ſtaide, or that the lyfe of man dothe not of neceſſitie and ſpeede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye decaie, beholde that one ſtone where in was graued three Faces, a Childes, a Mans and an Olde mans. So ſodeine are the chaunges and ſo nere as the Poet doth not vnfytlie call our age, <hi>Fleinge.</hi> Conſider what nomber of yeares ſince the beginninge of the worlde, and thyne age haue paſſed, ſo ſhalte thou learne, that no ſhaddowe more ſwiftelye fadethe awaie.</p>
            <p>Imagine aſſuredlye that all tyme were paſſed, and ſo ſhall perceiue that all wyll retourne to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge. Not vnlike to theym that wythe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Hope of deliuerye remayne in Priſon, whoe thoughe in miſfortune, yet doe but lyttle
<pb facs="tcp:5037:21"/> lament, chieflye if they be of valiant mynde. So men that in this troubleſome lyfe, ſyth they looke for and abyde one equality in reſpect of death, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not conceiue why happy folke ſhould not bee more ſorowful then thoſe that be vnhappye.</p>
            <p>For if euen now it were proclaymed as it was in the time of <hi>Licurgus</hi> that al lands &amp; goods ſhould equalye amonge al ſortes of men be deuided, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeſt thou thinke that beggers or riche men, would be moſte ſory? Surelye I thinke no man thinketh the rich men would reioyce; and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort be ſorye. If therfore law of lyfe is ſo equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye made as there is none that can auoyde, I ſee no cauſe but that euery man here lyuing in miſery, ought willyngly to embrace the benefite of ſo iuſt a decree. What care I praye thee ſhalt thou haue two hundred yeares hence, whether thou dyed ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uinge children or childeleſſe? olde or younge, rich or pore, &amp; bounde man or free, in thy bed or on the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, or whether in aucthority, or without honor thou lyued or dyed? But follye hath broughte in theſe opinions, by which we onely become happye or vnhappy. Becauſe follye enduſeth forgetfulnes of reaſon: it maketh <hi>Pigmeans</hi> to ſeeme Gyantes: ſomtimes oure euyls, ſomtimes oure good it clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, it multiplyeth it maketh them obſcure, it clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, encreaſeth, darkneth, hideth, euen as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of vs determineth. But if in this lyfe ther be any thing good or euill: or any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te of pleaſure or ſadneſſe, the ſame reſteth only in conſcience and vertue of the mynde.

<pb facs="tcp:5037:24"/> mourning. Notwithſtanding the very mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could not be vnfolded vnles I had alſo put to the iudgement of Poetes, for that is the common peoples opinion, not onelye becauſe the Poets be carefull to ſpeake thoſe thinges which be populer and liked of the common ſorte, but alſo for that if otherwyſe they would ſpeake they could not, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be ſo farre wyde from all ſtudye of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phye. For which cauſe alſo they be ſhut out of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> his common weale. And herein we muſt either condempne <hi>Plato</hi> if he baniſh them vniuſtly: or the Poets if he do it iuſtlye. Therefore ſurely the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion is that they be baniſhed worthilye: for agreing wyth the people, they ſpake thoſe thinges which be in the opinion of the ignoraunte. For no man denyes that wyſe men be few: and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people contayneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part of men: tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions therefore of the Poets and the common people, in which they diſagree wyth the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers be all falſe, and vnprofitable. Certes it is of neceſſitye, that the opynion of the common ſort is falſe: it the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be true: but who doubteth whether wyſe mens ſayings be true? o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe trulye they ſhould be no wyſe men. But if in any thinge at al the Poets deſerue ſmall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, no wher leſſe then in thoſe thinges which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerne maners and vertues.</p>
            <p>Neyther is it any maruayle though <hi>Archilochus</hi> a paſſing good Poet (but ſo much worſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher) was compelled of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> the very ſame houre that hee came into towne, to be pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge awaye agayne, for wrytinge this ſentence.

               <hi>Better it is to want armes, then ſuffer death.</hi> Verilye manye tymes lewde talke corrupteth honeſt maners.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſeinge wee wyll ſpeake of ſorrowe and death, it ſeemeth neceſſarye firſte to examine whether in our owne death, or in the death of our frendes there be any euil: and if there be, whether the euil maye bee ouercome by good, or rather the loſſe by gaine. That ſhalbe eaſye to diſcerne if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irſt we diſtinguiſhe and diligentlye vnderſtande this: whether after wee be deade, there remaine anye thinge of vs beſyde the bodye. Or all the whole dye awaye together wyth the bodye. In whiche cauſe althoughe wee haue alreadye ſpoken many thinges in the booke <hi>De Areanis aeternitis,</hi> &amp; minds to ſpeake in the bookes of Deathe, yet is not this queſtion, in this place meete to be ſhadowed who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye wyth ſylence. But as in this Booke chiefelye we followe the truth, and euery where briefenes, ſo one onelye reaſon of the reaſonable ſoule ſhall ſuffyce vs for the knowing of his nature. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge man hath vnderſtanding, hee is endued with many habites of knowledge. That is to ſay Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as Geometrye, Philoſophye, and Logicke. Artes, as Saylinge, Huſbandrye, Phiſicke. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence which is of principles, as that the whole is greater then any part thereof alone, and equal to all his partes together. Prudence, whereby hee conſydereth and diſpoſeth all thinges that he hath to doe. And Sapience wyth theſe, by which hee knoweth GOD and embraceth Religion. And ſome menne do more excel in ſome one or other of theſe or in manye of them, whereby it comes to
<pb facs="tcp:5037:25"/> paſſe that man doth ſo vſe his vnderſtanding and reaſon in his owne arte, as though in other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he may ſeeme rude, yet in that one thing he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth right notable men. Some though they haue neyther learninge nor arte, yet by reaſon of exerciſe proue very wyſe. That it may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that mans vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is in all men alike, and differeth onelye in exerciſe, we perceiue in the barbarous &amp; vplandiſhe men: Wherefore I wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the doltiſhnes of ſome which profeſſe wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who thincke that onely learned men be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, &amp; others differ little from beaſtes. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelye therefore it commeth (as they ſay common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye) that the cleane contrary falleth out, that is to ſaye, that theſe learned men beſyde their Booke, knowe nothing at all, and may eaſely be beguiled of any vnlearned ſoule.</p>
            <p>For if they would waye wyth themſelues, that all men (vnleſſe they bee hindered with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe) haue the vſe of reaſon and vnderſtandinge, and that ſo muche the more in one kinde of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſe, howe muche further they bee from another, they ſhoulde well perceyue themſelues to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them. What a nomber leauing theyr vile occupations, haue proued famous Philoſophers? <hi>Simon Coriarius</hi> when <hi>Socrates</hi> came often vnto his ſhoppe, hauing talke wyth his prentices became a perfit Philoſopher, and left vnto his poſteritye no ſmall nomber of monumentes. So he that was a curryer, onely by exerciſe is ſtertt vp to be a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher. The cunning therefore of artiſanes and others that want learning is not to be deſpiſed as
<pb facs="tcp:5037:25"/> boyde of vnderſtanding. But as it is wont to be ſayde, Howe farre <hi>Megara</hi> is from <hi>Athens:</hi> ſo farre is <hi>Athens</hi> from <hi>Megara.</hi> So, howe farre a learned man paſſeth an artyſan in ſpeakinge, ſo farre doth an artiſan paſſe a learned man in his facultye. Of both then the reaſon is alike, the vnderſtandinge a like, and nature all one, differinge onely in endes and vſe. But ſeing there is in other lyuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures an excellencye aboue that is in man, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morye in horſes: ſtrength and life as in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, power of ſight, as in the Eagle: hearing as in the boare, touchinge as in the ſpider, ſwiftnes as in the hare: and yet of thoſe habites of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no other lyuing creature is any whit parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, much leſſe able to go beyonde man in anye of them. It is then moſt apparant that mans minde is ſeuered from all corporal or bodelye matter. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilye whereas man in all thoſe thinges, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende of the bodye maye be ouercome of ſome ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge creature, and in theſe vertues of the minde no lyuinge creature is partener, no not of the leſt part, it is not poſſible at all that the vertue of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge ſhoulde not be both ſeperable, and vnmixt and euerlaſting. Neyther yet remayneth it naked and bare.</p>
            <p>For whereas of all other lyuinge thinges, the Dogge, the Marmyſet, and the Elephant be with out controuerſye endued wyth moſt wit, though a man would ſpende his whole life, he ſhal neuer teach them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt rule of any Arte or wyſedome, beſydes that which of nature is bred in them. And ſurelye to ſpeake of the eaſyeſt thinge, if you tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
<pb facs="tcp:5037:26"/> to learne them to vndoe a knot, they keepe in memorye how they maye drawe and ſlake, and ſo fynallye looſe the knot: but if you chaunge the knot neuer ſo little, they ſhal neuer know how to vndoe it, vnleſſe it be mere chaunce, ſo as you may well perceyue they be vtterlye deuoyde of reaſon. Likewiſe foules learne to ſpeake, and (as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſayth) ſo well, that the Pye wyth him braggeth ſaying: <hi>If thou ſhouldeſt not ſee mee, thou wouldeſt denye that I am a fowle.</hi> Neuer yet ſhal you plainly teach her what ſhe ſhould ſaye, or any coupled ſentence, to make a ſhowe of any printe of reaſon. And the nerer they ſeeme to attayne vnto man in ſpeakinge, ſo much ſurelye is it well knowen that they be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no vnderſtanding. In like maner alſo dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges know theyr owne names, &amp; are by teachinge learned to hunt fowles: but all theſe things they keepe by memorye, and trulye cannot tell how to put or chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge any thing more then they be taught, what occaſion ſoeuer they haue. Neyther is it to be ſuppoſed they knowe moe thinges whiche for want of ſpeache they cannot vtter: ſeinge the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt foules to learne (among which is the Popin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geye) althoughe they can learne well to ſpeake as men, be neuer more fit to any vſe of reaſon. Brute beaſtes therefore be able for one onelye arte by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and for all thinges vniuerſallye onlye by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morye, not conceyuinge reaſon at anye time, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by continuall teachinge theyr race, neyther by proceſſe of tyme, neyther by endeuoure and dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Therefore as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath taughte, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is no part of reaſon: but in deede wyth <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5037:26"/> remembring is the ſame that vnderſtanding is wyth <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Trulye theſe two differre onlye in this, becauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> beleeueth the conceyued for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of thinges come newly into the minde, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them the name of vnderſtandinge: but <hi>Plato</hi> thinketh they be borne in our minde, wherfore he termeth it memorye Of neither of theſe two, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeing they be the powers of reaſon, alone can anye brute beaſte be partaker, but onelye of that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth memorye, <hi>Plato</hi> opinion. But becauſe <hi>Plato</hi> in euerye place vſeth names of thinges confuſely, he attributeth vnto men, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or euerlaſting memorye, being part of reaſon: vnto other lyuinge creatures opinion and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, latelye conceyued of the fences. And it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth plainlye that that arte proper vnto beaſtes is ſimple of nature, not of any ſkill, in that it is moſt excellent in Swallowes and piſmiers, and other vile and baſe creatures far wyde of al perceyuing. For if it were wroughte by diſcretion as artes be in men, it ſhoulde be ſo muche more fine, by howe much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing beaſt were more excellent in ſence &amp; memorye. But it happeneth otherwiſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, horſes, &amp; Elephants know not how to do any ſuch thing as either the ſwallow, the pyſmyer, or the worme. Ther ſhould be alſo in them as in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, imperfections and diuerſityes aboute the ſame Arte, yea and paſſing ouer into the like works as ther is in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of which foraſmuch as there is none, it cannot be doubted that this is wholy the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of nature. And to ſpeake generallye, if any
<pb facs="tcp:5037:27"/> brute thinge could haue euen the ſhadowe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it were ſimplye neceſſarye that a reaſon fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of two particuler propoſitions ſhould inferre a concluſion, which no waye can be. Therefore be brute creatures gouerned onlye by nature, not by reaſon. But certainly ſeing nature it ſelfe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres and teacher of the lyuing creature, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les immortall, though the lyuing creature be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Howe muche more neceſſarye is it, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnderſtandinge, which knoweth all the Artes of all lyuing thinges, and more and more excellente, beſydes alſo the diſciplines and principles, God &amp; all the furniture of Heauen and the Elementes, beſides theſe to bee immortall and vncorruptible? For as nature it ſelfe is not the lyuing thinge, but that whiche doth teache the lyuinge thinge, and therefore remayneth when the lyuinge thinge dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: So contrariwyſe whereas vnderſtandinge is the whole man, and it ſelfe knoweth the ſame, as longe as the vnderſtandinge remayneth, the whole man is alſo vncorruptible, thoughe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye vaniſhe awaye. Wherefore mee thincke <hi>Crito</hi> was rightlye reproued of <hi>Socrates.</hi> For when <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> for good wyll aſked of him where he woulde be buryed (for nowe had <hi>Socrates</hi> in priſonne dronken his poyſon readye to dye) Hee aunſweared, alas what laboure haue I loſte, that coulde not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>Crito,</hi> that I ſhall flye awaye from hence all whole. For the ſoule thoughe it be moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet comprehendeth it al vertue in manne, not receyuinge manye vertues becauſe it hath diuers partes, but accordinge to the nature and qualitye
<pb facs="tcp:5037:27"/> of thoſe things which be handled of it, it is called Intelligence and Iudgement, and witte, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, and will, and prudence, and ſapience, &amp; Arte. Alſo brute beaſtes muſt needes clearelye wante all theſe thinges. For neyther doth anye of them vſe eyther iudgement, or deliberation, or wil (properly called) or intelligence, or counſell, but are all equallye and vniuerſallye voyde of all theſe, like as on the contrary part all men are furniſhed wyth theſe. Forſothe becauſe theyr nature, which is vnderſtanding or ſoule, or reaſonable minde, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth and is by poſſibilitye all theſe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is tranſformed into euerye one of theim, euen as it lyſteth. Wherefore I wonder not a little at theyr vanitye, who eſteeme men onely of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Regions for reaſonable: and imagine the inhabitauntes of the furtheſt Elementes of the earth like wilde beaſtes, and to haue the monſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſhapes that <hi>Solinus</hi> the Coſmographer deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth. But ſure they be much deceyued in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente. A fewe yeares ſince <hi>Leonarde Apiſan</hi> when he trauayled into <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> broughte oute of <hi>India</hi> Arithmeticke, and oute of <hi>Ethiopia, Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bras</hi> Arte of reckeninge: Argumentes of moſte fine wittes. No man almoſt denyeth the <hi>Aegip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> to be inuenters of all Artes, but chiefely of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy. Latelye <hi>Iohn Mounteregio</hi> of Germany, and <hi>Gulihelmus</hi> a Zelander a manne of excellente witte, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> of Roterdame an Hollander, and nowe all the Northe Countryes floweth in good learninge. What an impudent matter is it, that they will compare theyr wittes wyth beaſtes, and
<pb facs="tcp:5037:28"/> preferre ours more dull to them: from whom out of <hi>Affricke</hi> and <hi>Sarmatia</hi> be brought artes of greate ſubtiltye, as we Italians are no way able to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the ſame. The temperate countrye hath ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better wittes nor quicker mindes, but onelye more gentle maners, and more moderate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein the plentye of all thinges holpen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the clemencye of the ayre, laboureth to challeng to it ſelfe the chiefe partes. But if the armyes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Romaynes had not beene, Italye for fine wittes had lyen ſtill, and geuen place to a great manye of prouinces. So Greece paſſed the Barbarians, in ſtudye, not in witte. What makes it matter that the Barbarians are more enclyned vnto ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the minde, that therefore they ſhoulde be ſayde to haue leſſe reaſon? wheras wee maye ſee for the moſt parte famous menne to haue ben naturallye prone vnto anger, by reaſon of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till humour ſo plentifullye feedinge thoſe partes of the ſence which ſerue vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reaſonable minde. Neyther for all that, oughte angrye perſonnes to be called vnreaſonable, vnleſſe it be in this ſence, that they ſuffer the reaſonable power of the ſoule to muche, to be ouercome of the affections of the bodye. In which ſence if it like them to call the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitauntes of the furtheſt clymates vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I agree that they be more ready to yelde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vices. Not for that they want anye thinge at all of the reaſonable power of the mynde, when commonlye they exceede vs in witte, and counſel, and ſubtiltye of artes. For I aſke this queſtion, if two men be equallye riche, and the one vſeth
<pb facs="tcp:5037:28"/> his riches, the other will not, ſhall wee therefore call him the poorer who vſeth them not. All the noble Philoſophers therefore ſeinge this, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge enforced to define the ſoule immortall, and neuer fading, were fayne to flye wyth lye and all to the vnitye of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeinge in deede our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to be vnfadeable, but neuertheleſſe to be all one in all menne. Marye this they affirme, ſome one waye and ſome another. For ſome (as <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es)</hi> make both the paſſiue and agent all one, eche one of theym ſeperable, but the one the forme of a man, the other a certaine accidentall thinge, and vtterlye ſeperate from the man. Some other more reaſonable of theſe opinions, holde that the agent onely commeth from without yet not ſo to be coupled vnto man that it maye be ſimplye hys forme and part of him: But as for that that <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> affyrmeth of the double vnderſtanding, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer founde it wyth <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Forſothe it is all one whiche commeth from withoute, and is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable, all the reſte proceede of the matter and vertue of the ſeede. But to make in manne two vnderſtandinges, and both euerlaſting is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous abſurditye. But this at this time is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge to vs, let vs nowe ſhowe that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge whiche is not mixte, and commeth from withoute, that it cannot poſſiblye be all one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. For if it were ſuche a one, and alſo the forme of manne, howe could it afore it were exerciſed in vs, bee compared to a bare ſhauen table, beinge already imprinted wyth all manner of diſcipline in
<pb facs="tcp:5037:29"/> others. All men ſhoulde alſo a like continue, yea than (that is more) all men ſhould be one man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theyr forme ſhoulde bee one in nomber, and one thinge that vnderſtandeth. And if it be not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme, what is more fonde then to ſaye man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth, when vnderſtandinge it ſelfe is no parte of man. Althoughe theſe thinges be verye trifles, yet let vs beſtow them on theſe good fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, and fetche vppe againe the foundation from the bottome. Eyther this onelye and euerlaſting vnderſtandinge is onlye in men: or els as it were a Sonne beinge ſeperate in ſubſtance, it aſſiſteth all men wyth the light. If it be in men onely, how is it ſeuered? howe commeth it from withoute? howe doth it not flowe from the power of the ſeedes? yea what more excellency hath man then other lyuinge thinges? ſeinge they haue both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtinge matter, and nature of whom they be gouerned vnfadable: for ſoe to continue, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe to remayne the ſame thing, then in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, not in nomber. For the ſame power ſhoulde be nature in an other lyuing creature, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge in manne. But herefore is the lyuing creature gouerned of an other thinge, becauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be the ſame that the lyuinge creature is, becauſe that, of which it is gouerned, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth ſtil when the lyuinge creature is deade. If therefore man be ruled of himſelfe and that be immortal which ruleth it cannot be one in diuers, for nature which ruleth is ſeuered from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyuinge thinges, that it beinge one mighte ſerue manye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:5037:29"/> but the power of vnderſtandynge is coupled in man. Wherefore one power of vnderſtandinge, cannot ſerue many men, but euerye man hath his owne vnderſtandyng aſſigned him by himſelfe. But it doth not as it were a ſonne, ſhyne vnto vs wythout vs, firſt for that we perceiue our ſelues to vnderſtand, none otherwyſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue ſenſe. But ſenſe is proper vnto vs, and all the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof is part of vs, <hi>ergo</hi> our vnderſtandinge alſo. Then moreuer and if it ſhould ſhine without, wee ſhould be gouerned of an other thing, as the brute beaſtes be, which for no other cauſe are gouerned of an other thinge, then that ſame of whiche they are gouerned without them. But this is a thing moſt proper vnto vs men, that wee ſhoulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde oure ſelues. For the vertue within vs, moueth oure lymmes, becauſe it commeth from vnderſtandinge (is ruled wyth a ſtraunge and forraine rule, doth alwayes obaye after one ſorte, and is not oure owne ſimplye, nor knowen vnto vs, but we vſe it not knowinge, howe we vſe it. And ſo of thoſe thinges whiche come from other where, we be not full mayſters of them. So bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes becauſe they be gouerned by the motion of the natural power, and ſence, which hath an outward or foraine cauſe, in like ſort be quite voyde of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, and vtterly ſubiecte to an others gouernment, nothing differing in theyr affections from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſence and ſeruice which the members in man are wont to do vnto the wil. For if thoſe members be hurt, of theyr owne accorde, &amp; without the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of wyll, they ſhrinke backe, although they
<pb facs="tcp:5037:30"/> know not wherfore they ſo doe. Moreouer and if vnderſtandinge were without vs, we ſhoulde no more differ from other lyuing creatures, then they do one from an other, and nedes it muſte folow, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bruite beaſtes ſhould not want vnderſtandinge. Foraſmuch as in the ſame maner the nature both of bruite beaſtes and men ſhould be illumined in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſort, &amp; of the ſame eternal cauſes. And nowe is it ſhewed how brutiſhe lyuing creatures are for euer, by no kinde of meanes able to attain vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leaſt ſhadow of that part which is reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but by memory, or els nature ſomtime to haue geuen a certain ſhow of ſome conceiued reaſon. Wherfore it is manifeſt the mynd of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenlye and deuided according to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of men neither fading nor waxeing olde at any time. But like as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beames of the ſon, if they fal vpon a thick ſhadowed place or cloude do not ſhine bright, but if they light vpon glaſſe, or water, or chriſtall, ſhine ſo much the brighter, how much clearer the matter is: and yet theſe beames be no purer nor more laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge then the other, but be a lyke perpetuall: So the mindes of men when the partes in which thei chiefly ſhine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be decayd either by age or by ſicknes, do ceaſſe to vſe their proper gliſtring, and faculties ſo that vnto ſom men they ſeme to fade, when for al that in no parte they are made eyther faulty, or faynt, or ſickly, but continue, ſound &amp; vntouched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to death: &amp; flitting from thence geue vnto vs a probable opinion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for otherwiſe how could any man iudge the myndes of goode men for euer bleſſed and happye, the mindes of euyll men wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="tcp:5037:30"/> and vnhappy. Hereupon groweth the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Plato,</hi> that after the worldes ende mens ſoules ſhould returne to their bodies. Other thinke they dye not tyl the worlde be conſumed with fyre, why<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che after long tyme they loke for, and of that mind be the <hi>Stoikes.</hi> By eyther of which Phyloſophers, ſeing nothing we haue aſſuredly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed I mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned not to ſay much, ſuppoſinge it ſhould ſuffice to haue ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the ſoules of al men do remayn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with thoſe faculties which bee moſte properlye theirs, As wil, vnderſtandinge, wiſdome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, deliberacion, reaſon, the knowledge of artes and ſuch like vertues. But now let vs returne to our determined purpoſe. It was agreed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> deathe could be neither euill, nor worthye to be lamented, for profe wherof, the diſputacion of the immortality of the ſoule was no more neceſſarye, then as men ſay to light a candle at mydnoneday, for death did neuer ſeme leſſe greuous to any, then to thoſe that afterdeathe belieued no lyfe at all. Neuertheleſſe ſyth we haue fallen into this talke, and nowe doe aſſuredly know, it is alſo our determinacion to in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtruct others. Let vs therefore ſhow that death is neither euil nor to be bewailed, and moſt diſhoneſt of al it is, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either to lament or feare his own departing, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life, which no pitie nor mercy can pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uent. But feare, imperfection of nature, &amp; to much deſyre of life muſte nedelye be the cauſe, yet hereof whye is thy care ſo greate, or what happines haſte thou, that mighteſt make thy lyfe ſo deſyred? doeſt thou alone poſſeſſe anye delight that we haue not taſted of, whyche mighte make thee wyſhe for
<pb facs="tcp:5037:31"/> longer life? For euery of vs haue ſeene y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtarres, the Heauen, mountaynes, ſeas, ryuers, lakes, fiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des gardeines, Cittyes and townes, we haue alſo had ſport, dalliau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, muſicke, ſonges, banquets, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerye, loue, maſkerye, &amp; finally euery ſort of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye folly, neyther haue we wanted commendable exerciſe and indifferent ſkill of ſcience, and beſydes that, we know the manner of contentions, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions, publicke Orations. Yea for our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we haue borne dignitye and office, we haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfyed the honeſt deſyres of our children, frends &amp; kinſefolkes, and together wyth them liued in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, moneye, apparell, and other neceſſaryes of life, we haue enioyed: and in euery of them find grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offence then pleaſure, ſo as we maye ſay with the Prophete <hi>Vanitas vanitatem &amp; omnia vanitas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet if any man hath founde a more noble felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, or can teache a waye more ſtraight to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or newe delight, I know not, but for my part in euerye thinge haue felte more griefe then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But I thincke it happeneth to theſe men y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> luſte ſo muche after life, as it doth to thoſe that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth alteration of mettals, who fynde euerye thinge ſoner then that they ſeeke, for beſydes that they make neyther goulde nor ſiluer, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> little which they haue is alſo conſumed. Euenſo, ſuch as with greateſt care do ſeeke for felicitye, not findinge it, do wyth loſſe of theyr laboure, alſo departe wyth quietnes of minde, and become moſt vnhappye. Wherefore ſith this exceding deſire of lyfe helpeth nothinge, yea though life were good, yet were it better without trouble to laye by his maſſe of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
<pb facs="tcp:5037:31"/> and lyke a faithfull man reſtore that thou had<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deſt borowed. But if perhapps thou in vayne tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thy ſelfe, what, doeſt thou win thereby, other then to conſume in dyinge that lytle lyfe which is remayning: ſeinge what ſoeuer time is ſpente in thinking of death, may iuſtlye be ſo called. Howe much were it better to follow the counſel of. <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> who right wel comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded death ſaying, that it did not onlye remoue ſicknes &amp; al other grieues but alſo when al other diſcommodities of lyfe did happen to man often, it neuer woulde come more then once. Neither can death bee accompted anye extreme euil conſidering it commeth of moſt light occaſions and is on euery ſide at hand. Such thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges as we take for hurtful be alſo rare &amp; not light<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye founde, but ther is nothing more commonnor more quickly had then death. For death is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ayre, wynd, thonder, water, fire, earthquakes, wild beaſtes, fiſhes, foules, duſt, ſmoke, ſerpents, meate, drinke, bed, trees, ſleape, ſorowe, ioy, laughter, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany, anger, diſcorde, and fynallye of innumerable other occaſions death doth procede. <hi>Philomenes</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Aſſe eating rayſons ſaid vnto his boy, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou haſt lefte the Aſſe rayſons to eate, geeue him alſo wine to drinke, fell into a great laughter and not being able to ſtay him ſelfe, coughing hee dyed. <hi>Coma</hi> the brother of <hi>Diogines</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> notable thief, beinge by <hi>Rutilius</hi> the Conſul taken and examined touching outlawes fled, he required time to think of his anſwere, &amp; putting down his head betwixt his knees he ſtopped his owne breathe, and in the handes of his keeper dyed ſo quietlye, as none of
<pb facs="tcp:5037:32"/> them perceiued when he toke the laſt leaue of lyfe.</p>
            <p>Seing therfore with ſuch eaſe men dye, what ſhould we accompt of death to be reſembled to any thyng better than ſleape, for as in ſleape and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng be we neuer ſo hedeful, yet fele we not when yt cometh: euen ſo when fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyfe we paſſe towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des death, our ſences declyning w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out all ſence, at laſt we dye. When <hi>Socrates</hi> had drunk poyſon &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered hys garment to hys ſeruant ready to dye dyd notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding ieſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Crito:</hi> ſaying. I pray the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to ſacrifyce a cocke to <hi>Aſculapius,</hi> for that was the auncient cuſtome when anye man hadde drunke a holſome potion. Doeſt thou then think he felte any extreame gryefe? ſurelye no, for in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame pangues ieaſtynge is neuer ſeene nor the mynd knoweth not it ſelfe. Thys is alſo greatly to be meruayled at, that though euery man ſemeth to feare and flye death: yet ſeke they to eſchewe nothing leſſe, but rather follow euery thyng that bryngeth death withall. Neither ſeme they leſſe carefull to ſeke death then to ſhun yt. The leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſe man wythout regarde of lyfe preferreth hys pleaſure, the irefull reuenge, the eater hys glotony the ambycious honour, the couetous ryches: the ſouldier ſpoyle: the mother chyldren, the marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t traffycke: the ſtudient learninge, and in ſomme: there is nothyng that doth not occaſion forgetful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of death. So we plainly ſee that we both ſho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſeeke for death, but not wythout good cauſe, for that there is nothynge that hathe in yt leſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll, and they are therfore worthy prayſe that do diſdayne to dye, yf thoſe thynges for whych they
<pb facs="tcp:5037:32"/> neglect lyfe be eyther honeſt or neceſſarye, and yet, for lyght cauſes to ſeeke death is no token of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but rather a ſure ſygne of an abiecte mynd.</p>
            <p>Therefore the contempte of lyfe ys not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendable, as intemperancye is reprochfull, and yet as the feare of death is not to be prayſed, ſo not to dye chyeflye at neceſſarye occaſyons and tymes, is mooſt reprochefull cowerdly and exceadeth all other vylety of mynde. But ſome percaſe do allow the ſayinge of <hi>Epicari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Dye I would not, but to be dead I care not. As though that which followeth death is neither pleaſaunt, or not greatlye euyll. Alas what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll can it be to want honger, thyrſt, gryefe, labor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſadneſſe, feare, and fynallye the whoole heape of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uylles, whych the ſoule beynge parted from the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye we muſt of neceſſitye want, and ſeinge it dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, but in ſtede of theſe troubles, enio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to ſay, that death might be reſembled eyther to ſound ſleape, a longe iorney, or deſtruccion, as is the death of bruit bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes: If the ſoule doth lyue and after death feeleth nothinge, then is it lyke vnto a ſound ſleape, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therein we reſt without eyther felinge or vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtanding, and after a whyle return to the ſame exercyſes. Mooſte aſſured it is that ſuch ſleapes are moſte ſweete as be moſt ſound. For thoſe are the beſt where in lyke vnto dead men we dreame nothinge. The broken ſleapes, the ſlomber, and dreames ful of viſions, are commonly in them
<pb facs="tcp:5037:33"/> that haue weake and ſickly bodies. Whereupon <hi>Horacius</hi> ſayth.</p>
            <q>Vayne are the dreames, of ſickly folkes.</q>
            <p>But quiet and ſound ſlepes and ſuch as weary men commonly haue, are accompted ſweeteſt.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Homer</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>doth cal thoſe ſleepes the beſte, that be moſte lyke to deathe. And <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>The ſvvete and ſoundly ſlepe, vvhich death reſembleth moſt.</q>
            <p>I remember my father <hi>Faucius Cardanus</hi> while he lyued was wont to ſay that he euer deſired death, becauſe whyle he ſoundly ſlepte hee taſted the plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſanteſt part of life, (meaning as I thinke) that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery pleaſure, that we take by our ſences hathe in it more diſpleaſure, then ſweetenes. And therefore there could be nothing better, then to lack y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of theym. But common opinion hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared death to ſlepe, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trauayle or deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (therfore <hi>Homer</hi> doth call it braſen ſlepe. <hi>Virgil</hi> yron ſlepe, either of which importeth forgetfulnes of al thinges, the allay of cares, dulnes of ſences, &amp; careles mynde of hap to come. Betwixt ſlepe and death this only difference there is, that in death, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time of quiet is longer. <hi>Diogenes</hi> beinge ſicke, &amp; ſlea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping, was aſked of his phiſicion how hee fared, to whom he anſwered wel, for (quod he) one brother enuieth an other, Such was the ſecuritye of hys mynde: as euen at point of death he feared not to ieſt. In like maner did <hi>Coſmas Medices,</hi> a wiſe man
<pb facs="tcp:5037:33"/> in our age who being nerse death, cloſed hys eyes, whiche his wife ſeinge, aſked whye hee ſo dyd, hee anſwered that hee did it to bringe his eyes in cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome. For in dede the eyes of dead men, are neither broade open, nor cloſe ſhutte. And ſo I thinke the Poet did wel knowe ſayinge.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Is not our ſleape (O foole) of death, an Image playne?</l>
               <l>For fatall courſe shal bring a reſt, that euer vvill remayne.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But if thou compare death to long trauayl and that the ſoule beinge let loſe from priſon of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye ſeeth al thinges and walketh euerye where.</p>
            <p>Than what can be conſydered more happye. For the ſoule being burdened with the body, is neither free, nor rightly knoweth any thinge, but beyng ouerladen with cares, doth beholde, only the fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of thinges, and as it were throughe a webbe or clothe, geſſeth a ſyghte, and certainlye knoweth nothing, but beinge free, doth not only caſt of all hyndraunce, but alſo beholdeth all thinges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, whiche beinge true, who is hee that willingly woulde eſchewe deathe? yea who is hee that woulde not rather doe as <hi>Theombrotus Ambrociota</hi> did? who hauinge red <hi>Platoes</hi> booke of the immortalitye of ſoules, caſt himſelfe headlong downe from a wall not feelinge any offence or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturall ſickenes, but onely for deſyre of ſuch heauenlye happyneſſe as ſpirites were partakers of. Therfore men ſaye that <hi>Socrates</hi> being by <hi>Crito</hi> perſwaded to flye frome priſon, aſwel for ſauinge hymſelfe, as his frendes and kinſfolkes refuſed to doe it, anſwerynge wiſelye. <hi>O Crito</hi> my chyldren
<pb facs="tcp:5037:34"/> ſhalbe left in charge to God, which gaue them. As for friendes I am going into thoſe partes where I am aſſured to fynd as good or haply better then they be. And at length I doubt not but you wil al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo offer me your company meaninge thereby, that the lyfe of man was of ſmall continuance.</p>
            <p>Such were the wordes of <hi>Socrates</hi> thynking that death neceſſarilye myght be compared to one of theſe three, and moſt lyke of al to trauayle, whych may alſo be coniectured by dreames.</p>
            <p>For there is nothing that doth better or moore truely prophecy the ende of lyfe, then when a man dreameth, that he doth trauayle and wander into farre countries, and chiefly, if he imagineth hym ſelfe to ryde vppon a whyte horſe, that is ſwyfte, and that he trauayleth in countries vnknowen wythout hope of retourne, in ſuch ſort naturallye de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yninge of that ſhortlye wyll come to paſſe in dede. But if death be reſembled to deſtruction, which as is all ready proued is mooſt impoſſible, yet can it no wayes bee accompted euyll: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what ſo euer is not, can not be euyll, els we ſhould lament for them that neuer were born, nor neuer were at all, and they that are not can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge ſuffer.</p>
            <p>But if thou bewayleſt thy chaunge, ſure it is that Death dooth take away more euylles, then it bringeth, and thoſe more certayn. And although Death were euyll, and brought wyth it but one onely commodity whyche <hi>Epicharinus</hi> ſpake of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the partinge from Lyfe was painfull: yet by death art therof delyuered, for in all euilles, to
<pb facs="tcp:5037:34"/> haue eſcaped is a greate comforte. If then death be euyll, to be dead is to eſcape, but if it bee good, thou haſte no cauſe to lament. And that, the one, or the other is, who doubteth?</p>
            <p>I remember nowe that, longe ſynce hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to my ſelfe (neither do I thinke to digreſſe from the purpoſe) that albeit the twentye and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth yeare of myne age, I became ſore ſicke of a ſyngle Tercian, after Seuen fyttes I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ounded, and lay for dead. In whych tyme althoughe eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry member was almoſte depriued of his vertue, yet felt I neither griefe nor payn, other then a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn ticklinge throughout my whole bodye, euen ſuch as we feele in vſing venery.</p>
            <p>Therfore as I ſayde beynge in ſuche eſtate I feeled nothinge worſe then that this tickelinge where in was not ſo greate pleaſure as in Venus Sporte. And there with all a certayne Feare, leaſte in deede I ſhoulde dye, and truely as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge Sence or Strength I founde ſmall dyffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thoughe the peryll were greate.</p>
            <p>Afterwardes aſkinge of manye that hadde beene neare Death, whether therein they felte any gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate euill or not, who aunſweared that in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adeache, and in euerye other ſickneſſe of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye was greater Griefe.</p>
            <p>I founde that in myne opinion of Death concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I dyd not erre at all.</p>
            <p>That proofe maye alſo bee had, that althoughe Children and women be moſte fearfull to receiue all ſortes of Medecines, and yelde to Cuttinge
<pb facs="tcp:5037:35"/> of vaynes, yet being ready to dye do neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playn nor lamente, but rather are offended if wee ſeeke to preſerue their liues. Who cannot therfore coniecture, that in death there is either none euyll at al, or very litle, ſeynge thoſe paynes whiche we feare moſt are in dyinge not regarded. Thys is alſo worthy to bee noted that they that hope of no lyfe to come, do no leſſe valiantly dye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they that beleue the ſoule immortal. As <hi>Caſſius</hi> who hauing killed <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with the ſame dagger that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſlayne, aſpecting no meſſenger of death ſlewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo dyd <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> king of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> did caſt into the fyre not only hym ſelfe but alſo, his bed and his concubines, but that he belieued no lyfe after death is knowen by theſe verſes.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Therfore albeit it were that with the body y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſoule did periſhe: yet death could not be eyther euyl gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous, or any wayes to be feared, yea ſuch as ſo be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue are in greateſt ſecurity for not beinge ſubiect, to iudgement and free from all ſuſpicion of mynde either of puniſhment or reward, which thing doth moſt torment men that are ready to take leaue of lyfe. But thou ſhalt beleue al rather then this, that the ſoule peryſheth with the body. For as it is not altogether certaine what dothe preſentlye folowe death: ſo is it moſte aſſured that the ſoule of man, doth neuer dye wherof althoughe none other profe
<pb facs="tcp:5037:35"/> were then the conſideracion of lyfe, and death, yet death is paciently to bee ſuffered: becauſe there is nothing more hard or miſerable then this life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by warning of god we are therof aſſured. Alſo al wiſe men haue ſo thought, and in thinges ineuitable the beſt is euer to be choſen. To return therfore to the beginninge, what is our lyfe? other then a continual toyle, euermore bound to abyde y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diſcommoditie of ſo many neceſſities, ſo muche la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſo many ſuſpicions and peril. There is no de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>light in man, that repentance foloweth not. I am reuenged, then beware: I haue eaten my fyll: ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth offend me.

            <p>But <hi>Plato</hi> chiefe of the <hi>Academian</hi> Sect, ſaythe that a man ought not to yelde to Death, becauſe we are ignoraunt whether it be good or euil, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge that in reſpecte of puniſhment or Ioye, that folowed it was euill or good, becauſe deathe was the end both of good and euill.</p>
            <p>Therfore euen in the whole ſcripture death is not accompted other then ſleape, and to dye is ſaide to ſleape.

And I pray you, to what purpoſe ſhould fortitude ſerue, if to feare death were either goode or neceſſarye? As therfore temporaunce and Wyſedome are proffytable for Man: So

            <p>Were it not more naturall to man (and the rather ſeing that bruit beaſtes with ignorance eſcheweth the feare of death) that he wiſelye in place of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhuld vſe fortitude, geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him by God againſt the neceſſitie of death.

This booke would not receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of enſamples of ſuch, as for feare loue, griefe, anger &amp; other occaſions of no waight haue ſought theyr owne deathes: Beſides whom we reade of hole legions that haue offered themſelues to apparant deſtruction.

            </p>
            <p>What woulde theſe people haue aduentured for great cauſe, or if death were a great euyl, that vpon ſo light occaſion did not refuſe to dye. From whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che determinacion no reſpect of age, ſexe, or honor, could feare them: But I ſe what thou wilt ſay?
<pb facs="tcp:5037:38"/> death I doe not feare, for as it is not euill, ſo is it neceſſarye, and to feare that is of neceſſitye, were vaine, cowerdlye and hurtefull. Yet woulde I dye eaſelye, and olde, ſuche a death as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> deſired and did obtaine. For by lyuinge olde I ſhall not onelye gaine a longer life, but alſo a more eaſyer death. <hi>Ariſtoteles</hi> in his Booke <hi>De Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi> thincketh that verye olde men dyed not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye withoute payne, but alſo withoute anye fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge of deathe, becauſe the heate of their bodyes was quenched, whiche maye appeare by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: If thou goe aboute to drawe a tothe, that is not looſe, thou feeleſt great paine, but if of it ſelfe it were looſe before, withoute anye griefe at all it commeth awaye. Euen ſo greene youthe wyth extreeme paine do yelde to death: but olde folke in dying feele no griefe almoſt at al: As the tragicall Poet ſayth.</p>
            <q>In ſlomber ſvveete, the aged ſprite departeth.</q>
            <p>How can it be other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that death is greuous to yonge men, when as ſleepe againſt nature is offenſiue. Oft times it happeneth that ſuch as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon cuſtome ſeeke ſleepe at vntimelye houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby drye, pyned, and ſlouthfull, ſo as in ſteede of delight they get diſeaſe. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge readye to dye (thoughe he were an olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) complayned of Nature: becauſe ſhe had ordayned ſo longe life in Staggs &amp; Rauens (al moſt vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable beaſtes) and to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being the moſt noble &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:5037:39"/> wyſeſt creature allowed ſo ſhorte a terme to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in. What may they ſay then that dye in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> flower of theyr youth, haue they not iuſt cauſe to lament? Surely no. But here the reaſon why nature hath not: among other creatures made man of longeſt lyfe, and then that he that dyeth in youth doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing more greuous then they that lyue old. For fyrſt it is doubted of manye, (and chiefelye of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whether anye creature (the Elephant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte) doth liue more longe then man. Becauſe he maketh no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either of the Phenixe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crow, the Rauen or the Stagge: nor affirmeth them to be of longeſt life. But let vs confeſſe that whiche is imputed in <hi>Virgill,</hi> though it doth little importe to the matter, where he ſpeaking of men ſayth.</p>
            <q>A life more longe nyne times, the cacklinge Crovve doth lyue.</q>
            <p>But confeſſing with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Elephante doth liue more longe then man: why neede we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende whether man be of one or more creatures in longe lyuinge excelled? Omittinge alſo that the holye Scripture affyrmeth lyfe more long to man then other lyuinge creatures: let vs now diſpute that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alreadye is taken in hande, that is to ſay, for what cauſe ſome beaſts be of longer life then ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? The reaſon is this: ſeinge all creatures are made eyther for the vſe or honour of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med accordinge to the deſcretion of Nature: at which time ſhe made theyr minds, as wel for their bodyes, as theyr bodyes for their mindes: &amp; were therefore made ſimple with fewe inſtruments, as
<pb facs="tcp:5037:39"/> plaine thinges to enduer longe. But the bodye of man being made onely for his minde, neded many more inſtrumentes, to thende that the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding might the more fitlye do his office. Therfore although Nature hath made for man the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of bodye, yet could ſhe not geue therevnto the longeſt lyfe, by reaſon of exceeding concaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſubtilnes of the members: which if they were great (beſides that we ſhould be al Giants) they woulde bee troubleſome eche one to other. Which is wel proued in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> no creature hath ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite members or part of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, which were of neceſſity made ſmal &amp; ſlender, to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> end they might the rather be fit to yeld: &amp; ſo the breath (an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſoule) became y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more ſubtil. Wherfore nature hath not in this behalfe omitted any parte of her duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch dilligence helped our life, as for the length thereof wee haue no cauſe to complaine, which is nowe wel proued in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people of <hi>India</hi> lateſt founde, where men liue commonlye a hundreth and thirty yeres, becauſe there the ayre is good, and the people without cares. But wee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing incares, riot, &amp; vntimely labour, choſing ayre for profit &amp; not health, yea altogether forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the length of life, wee caſt oure ſelues into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſickenes, diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of body and preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t death, without cauſe accuſing nature, for the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of oure liues: Howe muche better were it to know which way to vſe the benefit of nature? if ſo deare &amp; pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a thing thou doeſt accompt this life? what is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cauſe that Philoſophers and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits haue liued ſo verye long? &amp; yet theyr to great
<pb facs="tcp:5037:40"/> ſtinens and earneſt contemplacion hindered their health? vnleſſe it were becauſe they liued voide of care and temperatly. How much were this rule of lyuinge to attaine long life more delicate, then to feede vppon fleſhe and honye? But in this age me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> continue carefully in labours and care, watching the halfe night baſkinge in Venus bathe, abyding in cloudye Regions, and not in good ayre, &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge boyled wynes: do notwithſtandinge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of ſhort life. And howſoeuer in deede oure liues be ſhort, it is opinion that doth make it ſo to appeare. The people called <hi>Garamantes</hi> do not liue aboue fortye yeares. I omit to ſpeake of the <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meians</hi> as people rather fayned then in deede, but wee if we dye before fyftye or threſcore, do thincke that iuſtlye we lament: and yet who ſo dwelleth in thoſe countryes do highly thanke God if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth fortye yeares, and thou lyuinge muche el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der do neuertheleſſe complayne. Surelye euerye lyfe is long that is continued till death ſith at the beginning the terme is deſtined, and as ſayth the Poet.</p>
            <q>In birth vvee breede our death, our ende, on firſt beginning hangeth.</q>
            <p>Reade we not in holye Scripture, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of dayes and monthes is appointed by God? he hath ſet the terme which cannot be paſſed. The lyfe of man therefore is ended wyth olde age: for old age is the laſt part of life. Olde age is alſo the neceſſitye of death: whereſoeuer therefore death is neceſſary, old age draweth neare Whoſo dyeth
<pb facs="tcp:5037:40"/> in youth in this onelye is the more happye, that he eſcapeth the diſcommoditye of old age, will thou make life to ſeme long or ſhort by compariſon? A kinde of beaſtes ther be called, <hi>Ephemera</hi> which are made in the morning, and before ſonne ſettinge do dye. If happelye they dye at noone, theyr lyfe is called ſhorte: but if they continue till nighte, they accompte it longe, and yet it exceedeth not twelue houres. Wee maruaile at flees for theyr long life, if they liue two Sommers, and at flees that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue three monethes. Yet whiche of theſe is thoughte any thinge towardes mans life? we call dogges olde that paſſe a leuen yeares of age: but a man paſſeth all theſe in longe lyuinge thoughe hee dyeth in youth. But the life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted longe or ſhorte: in reſpecte of his yeares. The life of all mortall men is but ſhorte: becauſe wyth death it ſhalbe moſt certainlye ended: It is vertue &amp; worthy actes that maketh the life longe, and idlenes that ſhortneth thy dayes. <hi>Alexander,</hi> thoughe hee liued not aboue thirtye three yeares, dyed an old man, through the greatnes and nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his noble exploytes. <hi>Argantonius</hi> hauinge lyued a hundreth and twentye yeares, maye bee ſayde to haue dyed in youth, becauſe (beſydes the rarenes of his age) in all his life he neuer did anye thing that deſerued memorye. It ought alſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelye to be noted that for the moſt parte, all nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men haue dyed in theyr youth. Amonge the kinges none almoſte continued to olde age, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, Athilles, Caſtor, Pollux, Aiax, Iaſon.</hi> Amonge the Poetes <hi>Lucanus, Catullus, Tibullus,</hi> neyther
<pb facs="tcp:5037:41"/> was <hi>Vigill</hi> long liued, neyther <hi>Demoſtenes</hi> nor <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero:</hi> howe true, yea to true is the ſayinge of the Poet.</p>
            <q>Their liues are ſhort, and age is rare: vvhere life doth lacke good rule.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>IVLIVS CAESAR Seuerus, Alexander, Probus, Aurelianus, Claudius</hi> the ſeconde of that name dyed in youth: which men a I thincke liued the leſſe, the more honeſt they were, becauſe being deare to the Gods were the ſouer called vnto them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon grew that ſaying from the Poetes, whom <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> do loue, do neuer attaine to old age. This is alſo to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> choiſe is to be loked for, wher wil may anye wayes auayle: but in thy power it is not to make thy life, eyther more long or more ſhorte. Yet if thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do it, there is none offence at al, but if thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, thou lamenteſt thy ſhortnes of life for no greater reaſon, then thou may thy mortality. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> care of thinges impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is vayne, &amp; onelye proper to fooles. But admit thou maye continue thy life and become olde, arte thou not therby the more vnhappye? becauſe thou loſeſt that ſinguler commodity which by God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightye is gauen to men for the allaye of ſorrow: which is ignorance of time. While wee continue yonge, wee liue meerelye, becauſe wee imagine death is not at hande: But how can olde menne thincke that death is farre awaye? when alreadye they are entred the laſte ende of life. Howe true and worthye memorye is that ſayinge of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, A yonge manne maye ſoone dye, but an olde manne cannot liue longe. And yet no couſe there
<pb facs="tcp:5037:41"/> is why thou ſhould not be ſorrye, ſeing a yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maye alſo dye ſone. Syth thende of life is vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a yong man neuer ought to diſpayre whether he laboureth of deadly diſeaſes, or be caſt into cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tormentes and priſon. The chaunces of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal creatures, do ſhew that men are ſubiect to law of nature and fortune: ſo as withoute cauſe they loue certainties for moſt incerte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ties of al. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thou doeſt attaine to old age it ſelfe? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye euils commeth therby? labour, griefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſadnes, loſſe of ſences, diſdaine: &amp; (y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is almoſt worſt of all) as <hi>Caecilius</hi> doth well diſcribe, therby thou ſhalte ſee they companye of all men eſchewed: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome are olde menne to their children, vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to frendes, diſdayned of yonge men, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to their owne familiars. Theyr ſences ſerue not theyr bodyes, theyr bodyes obeye not theyr mindes, they paſſe the nighte withoute ſleepe, and eate without all taſt. They lothe themſelues, how ſhoulde they be pleaſant to others? We reade that when <hi>Zeno Citieus</hi> could not dye with age, he ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled himſelfe. What dilligence and trauayle did <hi>Cicero</hi> take to perſwade olde age to be pacientlye borne? but if of it ſelfe it had beene good, or as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, frends, children, and learning had apparance of good: there ſhoulde haue beene not cauſe for him to haue taken ſuch trauayle. A mockerye it were to perſwade that health or honour were pacient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to be ſuffered: and wee agree that olde age is ſufferable, but not to be wiſhed for. Howe manye olde men haue beene, for whom it had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to haue died in youth? <hi>Priamus</hi> for example, not
<pb facs="tcp:5037:42"/> for myracle in hiſtorye is reſited. Not longe ſince <hi>Baccus Valor</hi> being olde and readye to take leaue of life, before his eyes behelde his owne ſonne behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a yonge man of ſinguler hope. The next yeare before, two other olde men I ſawe that behelde the like fortune in theyr owne children. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wonder muche at the greate wyſedome of <hi>Theramenes,</hi> woo onelye eſcapinge when his houſe fell downe, ſayde before his frendes that reioyſed for his life: O fortune to what ende haſt thou me preſerued? neyther did he aſke in vaine, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fewe dayes after by the malyce of tyrantes, he was taken and put to death. Therfore ſuch is the condition of men, as althoughe beinge olde thou mighte returne to youth againe &amp; as the fable tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of <hi>Aeſon</hi> ſayinge.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And as tvviſe tvventye yeares bypaſt, ſo novve my force I finde</l>
               <l>Myne aged yeares are vvorne avvay, I feele my youthful minde.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Yet who art thou ſo madde or greedye of lyfe, as would take vpon thee ſuch a condition? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is nothinge but ſicknes, cares, contempte, peril, lothſomnes and ſorrow. So as I ſee not for what reaſon thou ſeekeſt to liue. And if in luſtye youth when ſtrengthe, ſences, beautye, wit, &amp; auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritye, were all in thee, thou were notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding oftentimes wearye of life, what ſhalt thou doe at this age when thou heareſt thy ſelfe called olde wretche, and dootinge olde foole? death doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come ſo muche to ſone to a yonge man, as to late to them that be olde. But if feare of deadlye paines do offende thee, ſicknes reſembleth death,
<pb facs="tcp:5037:42"/> and in ſicknes by little and little the life is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. Or art thou loth to dye alone? Be of good cheare, thou ſhalt finde more deade then are left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue: and thoſe alſo ſhall or longe followe. As the Poet ſayth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>For eyther ſoone or late, in order as men ſaye,</l>
               <l>The vvretched flocke of vvordly folke, to death do take their vvay.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Neyther doth GOD ſuffer any to deferre his deſtined tune. The deſtines do driue all men, and remayne as lawe for euer: they are y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> happyer ſort that are ſoneſt diſpatched of paynes. And as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge condempned folke the Lawe executeth thoſe firſt that haue leaſt offended, to thende that the greate offenders ſhoulde beholde the terror of death: Euen ſo, God doth firſt take thoſe away, whom hee loueth, becauſe they ſhall not be lokers on, but meſſengers ſente before: (vnleſſe in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of profitte eyther to theyr frendes, or the worlde) hee ſuffereth ſuch menne to tarrye more longe. To conclude then ſeing in thinges that be euil, there is nothinge more greuous then dailye and certaine expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, old age when it commeth, hauinge in it both the one and the other, doth force a manne to wyſhe that in his youth hee had dyed. I my ſelfe beinge a childe, doe remember mine owne mother <hi>Clara Michera</hi> then a yonge woman was notwithſtanding wonte to wiſhe that in her infancye ſhe dyed: beinge growen to greater age (for euer more ſhe continued y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſpeach) I aſked the cauſe whye ſhee ſoe ſayde? where vnto this
<pb facs="tcp:5037:43"/> ſhe aunſweared: Loe, now I know I ſhall dye and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with greater perill, beſydes that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time (who ſo doth marke it well) ſhall ſee there is nothing that doth not bring with it greater griefe then pleaſure: becauſe pleaſure beinge paſſed, doe chaunge to ſorrowe. And that deſeruingly. What is it in this life that can delighte? dailye trouble to apparell and vnapparell thy ſelfe, hunger, thyrſte, ſleepe not ſo plentiful nor quiet as dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue, heate in Sommer, colde in Winter, diſorder of time, terrour of warres, controlemente of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, cares of wedlocke, ſtudye for children, ſlouthe of ſeruaunts, contention of ſutes, and that (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is moſte of all) the condition of time, wherein honeſtye is diſdayned as follye, and crafte is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as Wyſedome. <hi>Artiſans</hi> for theyr cunning not accompted of: but for apparau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and opinion of people preferred. So as it is neceſſarye eyther to diſpleaſe God, or els to liue amonge men in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerye oppreſſed and diſdayned. I omitte all euils, onely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to dead men is not euil, all other thinges which wee do not accompte euil are worſe then thoſe which deade men ſuffer. It is nowe requiſite that ſomewhat be ſayde of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſityes of death, hytherto it hath beene deferred becauſe they are many, &amp; of diuers men, thoughte worthy conſideration. For death doth ſeeme gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to yong men, both for that it is painful for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> minde to leaue the body, diſhonourable, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, al which in common iudgement are ioyned to gethers. And ſome cowardlye yonge men haue beene compelled to dye a knowen death, but ſyth
<pb facs="tcp:5037:43"/> I ſee diuers of the common people pacientlye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough do take their deaths. I know no cauſe why other ſhould be greatly comforted, conſidering that not the maner of death, but the qualitye of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence maketh death diſhonorable. For if thou reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect only the maner of death, thou ſhalt find that the greateſt nomber of men put to vile death, were thoſe that antiquity prayſeth, and our age doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, notwithſtanding they fel into the handes of Tirantes in whoſe power it was to appointe the time and maner of death, though innocencye be in them that ſuffer. Neither can a publike death bee diſhonorable: if his life ſo dyinge be voide of foule vice becauſe publike death without offence, is not onely a ſigne but alſo a triall of vertue. We fynde in the new law how Chriſt did firſt gayne the glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye of innocent death, and after him followed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable martirs and prophets, and the moore good and holy they were, the more cruelly forced to dye. <hi>Eſayas</hi> cut with yron by commaundement of king <hi>Manaſſes, Hieremias</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people ſtoned to death Iohn Baptiſt beheaded, and fynally manie other cruelly murdered, neither was the fortune of other Good menne muche better at the handes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Kinges and in their Citties: for <hi>Zeno Eleates,</hi> when quietly he might haue liued in his houſe, he conſpired againſt the Tirant <hi>Nearcluis,</hi> but his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was diſcouered and he hanged, yet at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athe he perſwaded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people to ſtone the Tyraunt to death. When <hi>Lyſymachus,</hi> the kinge threatned <hi>Theodorus Cyreneus</hi> to hang him, he anſwered thus what matter is it, whether on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth or hanging
<pb facs="tcp:5037:44"/> high, my carkcas do ſtinke. When <hi>Socrates</hi> myghte with ſylence haue eſcaped death, being conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pned only in a pecuniall paine, did prouoke them y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> dyd condempne him to procure his death. And when his wife <hi>Zantippe</hi> complained that vniuſtly he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, he aunſwered, <hi>An mallet iuſte ſenciens non eſſe malum preter culpam.</hi> The diſhonour therfore is not in dyinge, but in the cauſe of death: which proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of thine own euill doinge. But as for paines: youth and certaine knowledge, of dying, they add none encreaſe of grief, to death, nor make it moore greuous, becauſe the knowledge of that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, cannot be euil after, and onely death after tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments is moſt pleaſant. And torments either they can not be great, or not long. Chriſte for enſample to al men died, that for enſample it might remaine Beſides this ſeldome ſhalt thou finde any innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to dye of great torment, no, ſcantly once, vnleſſe it be at chaunge of lawes, when innocentes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuffer the inſolency of nocentes: as in hyſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries it appeareth moſt rarely is alſo founde exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of violency in giltleſſe men, yf wilfulnes be not the cauſe for ſuch as ſo murder good men, do ſeme to do it of very will. But how eaſy a thinge death is eyther publike, or by ſword, examples do beare witnes.

               </gap>e quod hee)
<pb facs="tcp:5037:46"/> becauſe it beareth ſo many calamities. The ſecond cauſe is, that goodmen without enuy might be ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noured, and euil Men without feare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempned, and that riches and aucthority (for whiche menne commit greate wickedneſſe) might not be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Yf thoſe thinges whiche mortall men haue were iuſtly wayed, they ſhoulde as Cares and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles be reputed. Yet if death were not, Menne would muſe onlye vppon Thefte, and Violence, while in this ſhort ſpace that now they lyue, they thinke ſo much thereof. The third reaſon is for that men might receiue rewarde of good and euil, according to the quality of their deſerts. For after death, ſuch as haue paſſed a godly life, ſhall liue not only with their brethren &amp; kinſfolke, but alſo acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>al honeſt and learned men, and aboue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtarres receiue ioy and euerlaſting felicitye. So contrary wiſe the wicked in darkeneſſe and ſolita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye places ſhalbe tormented. Therfore for wicked folke only death can bee thought euill, and yet is not, but Good men not vnlike the Swanne who only at his death do ſynge may boldly reioyſe and be gladde. Some there are ſo ambicious that the care of their funeralles doth trouble them muche, who are not to bee comforted, but for their follye to be reprehended, what is the body of man, when the Spirite is paſſed awaye? It is no moore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted as parte or member of him, but rather a Carckcaſſe vnprofytable, ſtinckinge and horry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Seneca</hi> therfore didde well deuiſe that the ſame ſhould be buried, not in reſpect of the Dead, but the liuinge, leaſt they by ſauour and ſight therof,
<pb facs="tcp:5037:46"/> might be offended. Where vppon in ſundrye na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions hath growne ſundrie cuſtomes of buryinge the Deade. The Grecians were wonte to wrye them in the earthe. The Romaines dyd burne them in fyre. The <hi>Nathabeians</hi> did burye them in their dungehilles. Yea their Kinges had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sepulchre. The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> do caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ryuers to be deuoured of Fiſhes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Magi</hi> did geeue them to wilde Beaſtes <hi>Herca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ni</hi> to Doggs. But the <hi>Maſſageti</hi> moſt meruailouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye do eate them. The <hi>Egiptians</hi> with their owne Nayles doe burie them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> doe wrappe theym in Waxe. So incertayne is the reaſon, where is no reaſon at all. Alas good Foole doeſt thou not heare the Poete ſayinge.</p>

Then <hi>Diogenes</hi> not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſelye reproued them ſaying: what harme can I haue when I ſhalbe ſenceles and feele nothinge? it maketh alſo to purpoſe to knowe that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine what doth become of mens carcaſes caſt awaye: ſometimes it was thoughte they gayned an opinion of deuinitye as it came to paſſe of <hi>Cleo</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <hi>Solon</hi> did clearly take away all Solempnities of Sorrowe, as wepinge, Cryinge, and Tearinge.

            <p>For thus it muſt needes come to paſſe, that the Children doe dye before the Parentes, or the Parentes before the Chyldren, or els altogethers: as though they were all deſtroyed by ſubuerſyon of one Houſe. But to perriſhe all together is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for mooſte Calamitye and greateſte Myſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.

What is that thou mourneſt for in theym? becauſe they are deliuered of Old age? Or doeſte thou lament that in others, which in thy ſelfe thou thinckeſt ought paciently to be ſuffered?</p>
            <p>Or wilt thou weepe not vnlyke the Old woman that complayued her barren Lyfe. Vpon a time there happened a certayne Olde Woman to come beggine to the Gate aſkinge almoſe and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall alledged ſhe was without Father, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with which tale at the firſt ſomewhat ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one good felow ſtandinge by, aſked what age ſhe was of.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore haue good regard leſt while thou wepe thou moue not others to laugh, what wouldſt thou do if according to an old cuſtome vſed by the citizens of <hi>India</hi> in the yſland of <hi>Coius,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> old men being paſt Threeſcoore yeares of age ſhoulde of the Citty bee caried in Triumphe, and ſo in ſight be ſlayne?

<pb facs="tcp:5037:51"/> conſumption he dyed, and fulfilled that ſayinge of <hi>Moyſes: Honour, thy father and thy mother that thou mayeſt liue long vppon the earth:</hi> which I ſee the Gentiles alſo do. For <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Eliades</hi> doth affirme thoſe to liue ſhort liues that do not render their parentes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of education. Such is the counſell of true dealing: and ſurelye theſe vnnatural mindes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes from ſome deuill, otherwyſe they coulde not be giltye of ſo greate a miſchiefe. The nature of man is diueliſhe: and ſo wicked, as it woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye all parentes, neyther can it gouerne it ſelfe, neyther doth it contayne in it ſelfe any curteſye, by meane whereof neceſſarilye in ſhorte ſpace it muſt be conſumed. But as it is the part of an vngraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſonne to hate the lyfe of his parentes, ſo it is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> part of a wiſe ſonne pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to take theyr deathes, and to turne the ſame to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditye, according to then ſample of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good Phiſitions, who hauinge medecins wil not vſe poyſon: yet hauing venome at hande after longe tryall of other thinges, will rather then faile by venome cure diſeaſes: So the wyſe man by well and diſcrete vſing of euill, doth make the ſame good. As firſt commeth to memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye the gouernment of houſehold, the enſample of wyſedome, and the deſyre of glorye: in all which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuerence and reſpecte towardes the father doth chiefely hinder thee, or altogether let thee. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye of fathers contayneth in it ſomewhat more then ſeruice, and hindereth the execution of great thinges, be it in warres, learning or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the common wealth: for all thinges ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge euil ſucceſſe, are imputed to the ſonne, and al
<pb facs="tcp:5037:52"/> good to the father, whom if hee loueth he cannot diſſemble it, though he deſerued it not, or if he loue him not, it ſhalbe called his default or want of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> examples of them that willingly haue geuen place to their ſonnes, in glorye are ſo fewe, as the honour that <hi>Antiocus</hi> did to his ſonne <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> maye be taken as a myracle. The euente of worldly procedings haue alſo made proofe of this opynion: becauſe al ſuch as haue become excellent, eyther in armes, learninge, or ciuil gouernmente, were of thoſe whoſe fathers in youth were taken awaye, as <hi>Iulius Caeſar, Octauius, Auguſtus, Alcibiades, Cicero, Galenus, Ariſtoteles,</hi> yea what had <hi>Alexander</hi> beene if <hi>Phillippus</hi> had liued but one foure yeares longer? for had <hi>Phillippus</hi> ended the warres wyth <hi>Darius:</hi> being victorious he had gayned the whole glorye, or if he had been victoryed, hee coulde not haue left to <hi>Alexander</hi> meane and power of happye procedinge. As therefore to cowards and men of no vertue, the timelye death of the father hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer brought hinderaunce. So to noble minds: it is occaſion whereby to ſhewe themſelues as they be. This muſte alſo be ſet before oure eyes, that both life and death be the giftes of God, and do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore depende vppon his prouidence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoeuer reproueth lyfe or death, doth in ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence diſalowe &amp; complayne of the deuine Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe both the one and the other is meete and profitable. And chiefelye if thou offende or did not loue them, thou ought not to lamente for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge loſt them thou hated: Or if thou lamente, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it muſt be becauſe towardes them thou
<pb facs="tcp:5037:52"/> were vnnatural. But nowe thou arte ſafe ſo as thou can neyther be appeached of impiety (if thou haſt not before procured their harmes) nor after be thought vnfrendly, ſith againſt thy wil or by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap thou cannot offend. How much better had it beene for <hi>Priamus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Politus</hi> had dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? who founde himſelfe ſo greuouſlye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr miſerable chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces as he diſdayned his owne lyfe.

               <hi>Priamus?</hi> becauſe to auoyde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of <hi>Priamꝰ</hi> miſery, he ſought his owne death, and ſo by dying left hym miſerable. All theſe were the actes of good parentes: but of thother, howe many haue bene? whom though to hate were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlye, yet to loue them is not neceſſarye. Some haue taken away the common parent, as did <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſtra,</hi> who hauing killed <hi>Agamemnon</hi> was her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe betrayed by <hi>Oreſtes</hi> her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſonne. So <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi> murdered his mother <hi>Eryphiles</hi> for hauinge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death of his father <hi>Amphiarus.</hi> Theſe examples are common, neither is it neceſſarye to loue ſuch parents: for notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding by them wee haue our being, yet againſt their willes (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) we kepe it: becauſe they ſought the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee came. Therfore <hi>Licophron</hi> killed <hi>Periandrus</hi> his father, for beinge chiefe auctor of his mothers death, &amp; would neither take regard of his fame, neither ſpeake vnto him nor ſuffer him ſelfe to be ſpoken vnto. But how much more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked be they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeeke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of theyr owne ſonnes? of whom the enſamples are not ſo few as happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye thou thinkeſt. <hi>Mithridates</hi> murthered ſome of his
<pb facs="tcp:5037:53"/> owne ſonnes, and had hee not wanted power, hee woulde not haue lefte one of his children on liue. <hi>Theſeus</hi> was alſo cauſeleſſe the cauſe of <hi>Hippolitus</hi> death, and as they ſaye <hi>Medea</hi> cut her owne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in peeces. Of more certentye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is tolde of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telina,</hi> who to thende he might be maryed a new, with poyſon killed his owne ſonne, almoſt a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Matheus</hi> Duke of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Yet how muche more vile was the acte of <hi>Laodices</hi> wyfe of <hi>Axioratus</hi> kinge of <hi>Capoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia?</hi> who hauing by that huſband ſixe ſonnes with poyſon murthered fiue, intendinge alſo to kill the ſixt yongeſt of all, had it not by the pollicy of kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke bene preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. What beaſt doth liue ſo hard harted, as can beare the crueltye of ſuch a mother? Cattes and Connyes by reaſon of theyr excedyng great luſt, do deuoure theyr yong newly brought forth, but other mothers among al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brutiſh kinde to deſtroye theyr owne yonge, I neuer redde, nor thoughe written it were, hardlye I durſt beleue. Wyth like beſtialitye of minde did <hi>Euergetes Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus</hi> murther the two children he gotte vpon hys ſiſter <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the one of good yeares, thother ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye yonge. Of theſe and ſuch lyke parentes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle the death, how great a folly were it? I my ſelfe haue ſeene, and ſo haue manye others, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, that to enioye vnlawfull loue wythin
<pb facs="tcp:5037:53"/> xv. dayes wyth a ſword ſlewe her owne huſband, poyſoned her owne ſonne, and before theyr buriall was maryed to her newe loue. But nowe I ſee what thou wouldeſt ſaye. I mourne not for the death of ſuchan auncetor, but for one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was iuſte, good, godlye, and that dearelye did loue mee: but howe doeſt thou know whether hereafter he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ſuch a one ſtil? for all ſuch as killed theyr wyues or children, were at the firſt alſo good: yet grewe to this madneſſe after many yeares, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that theyr wickednes eyther came with time, or els thoccaſion grewe by time. Therefore there is nothinge ſo vniuerſallye incertaine, as the loue towardes children, brethren, wyues, kinſefolke, frendes &amp; maiſters. Craft couereth many things, ſo doth baſe fortune, occaſion and wyſedome: all which when age groweth on like vnto ſtares in the tree, are encreaſed and detected. So olde age beinge come, ſometimes in reſpecte of power, but more often in regarde of follye and vtilitye, olde men do for neceſſitye vſe the helpe &amp; counſel of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they loue not, and onlye becauſe of theyr owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitye, which ſaueth the giltles children from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſaduentures at theyr hands, for whom they liue continuallye a moſt miſerable lyfe: Others do diſherit theyr children, others conſume theyr patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monye, and ſome ſeeke newe wyues, breeding the ſorrowe that ſtepmothers moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlye make. The iniurye of euerye of whiche ioyned wyth the comberſomnes and ſeueritye of age, is encreaſed.

There is no thruſte for <hi>Falernus</hi> more greate, then the deſyre of wicked folke to committe crueltye in their owne kinſefolke. Yea ſometimes this wicked violence is put in proofe amonge kinſefolke of one name. But amonge this ſinnefull ſorte, thy brother is none. Admitte hee be good, of honeſt conditions, modeſt, and vertuous: yet what canſt thou loke for more at him, then others? for if thou ſeeke good will? a frende can doe it: if neceſſitye? thy ſonne muſt be preferred: if pittye? thy parentes are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: if dutye? thy fellowes are morefitte: if flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye? thy ſeruauntes do it beſt. Of all which nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeinge thou paciently ſuffereſt death, the loſſe of thy brethren oughte not more impaciently to be borne. And hereof a moſt euidente token maye be the greate conſtancye of the parentes, at the death of theyr children: the like loue of whom is neuer ſeene, neyther amonge brethren, nor amonge chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren towardes theyr parentes. But thus thou doeſt ſaye, I loued my brother dearelye, &amp; honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him trulye: but did he likewyſe loue thee? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexius</hi> was brother to <hi>Iſaac</hi> king of Germanye, and by him receyued as a companion in gouernment: taken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turkes: he redeemed him wyth great ſummes of money, notwythſtanding al which at his returne hee depoſed <hi>Iſaac</hi> from his kingdome, put out his eyes, and kepte him in continuall pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Thou mayſt boldlye ſweare by GOD that
<pb facs="tcp:5037:56"/> thou loued, and not be deceyued, but how thou art beloued is harde to knowe. <hi>Titus</hi> honoured <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitianus,</hi> yet howe manye iniuryes did <hi>Domitianus</hi> do, vnto <hi>Titus?</hi> and (as it is thought) in the ende, wyth poyſon hee killed him. What can be more perillous (chiefelye where is greate inheritaunce) thenne to commit the children to thy brothers tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a thing almoſt impoſſible, it is to loue trulye both the brother and his children, or woulde thou haue thy brothers ſhoulde loue ſoe, as they ſhould forgette theyr children? Who knoweth whether euill fortune ſhall rather take thy children, or thy good brother from thee? For hee lyuinge, eyther wythoute perill thy children mighte not bee lefte voyde of angouerour, or not without iniurye com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted to others.</p>
            <p>Call to memorye the example of <hi>Childebertus</hi> the Frenche kinge, who by practiſe gotte from theyr mother <hi>Clothilda,</hi> the two ſonnes of hys brother and ſlewe them, becauſe (the lawfull heyres of his brother lyuinge) hee thoughte that quietlye hee could not poſſeſſe the whole kingdome.</p>
            <p>Many there haue beene ſeene, to commit more crueltye vppon theyr nephewes then this: and common it is to take theyr patrimonyes from them, but the occaſions both of perill and iniurye are all at once remoued. Laſtlye this is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that nature as it deuideth inheritance, ſo doth it departe conditions, amonge brethren, If one be honeſt, an other diſhoneſt, If one be noble of mind an other of baſe courage, if one be induſtrious, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is ſlouthfull. If thou hate thy brother,
<pb facs="tcp:5037:57"/> why lokeſt thou to be loued? if thou loue him, loue bindeth thy iudgemente. And verye like it is, that as in thee there is ſinguler honeſtye, ſo in thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is no leſſe diſhoneſtye, but thou ſeeſt it not, occaſion wanteth. Thy brothers inheritaunce was well gotten, howe well gotten? naye rather wonne by deceit: But admitte it be (as be it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) that thou knowe thy brother doth trulye loue thee, thou arte childleſſe, hee hath children lefte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, accompte of them, and let them bee in place of a brother, in educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them ſhalbe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter charity, and in keeping greater reuerence. But if neyther thou nor he haue children, and hee that dyed is thy onelye brother, if thou adopt children, they ſhall better ſerue then thy brothers. Siluer is loſt and gould is found.

But this perhappes thou wilt ſaye: My ſonne was now become lyke vnto me, I had ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t much mony care, and payn vpon him, and ſo was likely to haue ben noble, but theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints were more meete for mothers: becauſe if thou lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thy loſſe of mony, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hadſt thou more nede to be cured of thy couetiſe, then comforted for loſſe of thy ſonne: And hereof be moſt aſſured that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do not take three maners and condicions of their Parentes, and they will follow the condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of none leſſe then of theym: which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the children of pore men are more lyke to their parents, then the children of the rich, becauſe pore men are both fathers &amp; maiſters of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens lyfe: but rich men not ſo. Whye ſhouldeſte not thou then make an other mans childe thine?</p>
            <p>For hee is moſte lyke the in condicions that is of thine owne bringinge vp: <hi>Quintilianus</hi> telleth how <hi>Alexander</hi> had certain imperfections of <hi>Lionida</hi> his Tutor, which he kept ſtyll beinge come to mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. For though we eſchewe the immitation of vices, yet in vertues we ſeeke to folow them.</p>
            <p>Therfore if he that is dead was loued for vertue, we commend thy meaninge, but yet (O Lorde)
<pb facs="tcp:5037:62"/> how pleaſant, how happy is that life where vnto from this obſcure darckeneſſe thy ſonne is gone, yea how ſwete was that trauayle? Neither do I thinke it nedeful to declare thoſe ioyes &amp; pleaſures which our ſoules hauing forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſures do poſſeſſe: for while the ſoule is loden with that heauy burden it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendeth immortall thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges with the mortall. Scantly it can be expreſſed how much force, dignitie, and glorye the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge at libertie hath. For the conceiuyng (and not the teachinge wherof) all be it a man in this lyfe, be neuer ſo excellent, he is notwithſtanding imper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect, becauſe he is onely a man complete that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth which the ſoule beinge cloſed within the bodye cannot doe. Therefore what meruaile is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſoule, ſo ſlowly and painfullye departeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodye? Lykewiſe with greate labour and much difficulty a man is from his mother brought forth to thys vale of miſery. In conſyderacion of all theſe the bitternes of ſorowe for thy ſonnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athe ſhould be the leſſe, wayinge the glory whych he now hath and the reputacion of his youth toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther with the weary abode hee made in hys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe. Nature hath ordained, that al gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate encreaſe of felicitye is attayned through harde labour. With the ſame reaſon ſhalt thou be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yf thy ſonne be an infant and thyne only ſonn (I omytte to tel what hee maye hereafter be) but now he hath hit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marke for which he was borne. For is there any other end whereto we were born then death? as the body for the ſoule, and as ſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for watching, ſo was lyfe geuen vnto vs for
<pb facs="tcp:5037:62"/> death, wherefore as ſleape is neceſary for all men, ſome more and ſome leſſe, ſo is life for the Soules wherfore if thou want meane to get an other ſon, then chooſe thou ſome other one of thine affinitie, and bringe him vp in learning, &amp; honeſt diſciplyne &amp; hardly ſhalt thou fynd ſuch a ſonne made by hys parents. If ſuch a one by education thou makeſt, thou gaineſt thanks of God, whoſe children we al be &amp; of thy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try which is mother to al men. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in dutye ſhalt thou fynde him inferior to other children. It is not my meaning to wiſh the death of children, but that paciently men ſhould beare it, neyther will I that the childe of an other ſhoulde be preferred before our owne: but rather that thy ſonne be ſo brought vp as he may deſerue to be pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferred before others, yet if we conſider ſucceſſion, we ſhall fynde that excellent Maiſters haue hadd notable ſcholers, noble fathers, vyle children.

But if this were a gift of Nature, it ſhold by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of pitye, and neceſſity, rather be in children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their parents, then in parentes towardes their children, which example Nature as it ſemeth did not forget in brute beaſtes: for among birdes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Stork.

Therfore let vs come to longer ſpeache, &amp; arguments more playne, leſt I ſeme not ſo muche to proue, as to deceiue, thy ſon therfore being dead: conſider fyrſte, whether hee was well reported or accompted wicked? For manye times the ſon of a good father, is ſeene to proue an euil man, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the homely vices are hardlier diſcouered then y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: beſydes that, loue byndeth iudgemente.

Eche man in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination alloweth himſelfe longe tyme of life, diſdayning death as a thing not knowen in this, but an other worlde.

For the chiefeſt care ſuche men do take, is that of al other moſt wyſe and happye: neyther of which (in iudgement of thoſe that diſdayne them) can be allowed. Then when theſe wealthy men perceiue that the others are not greatly greeued, forthwith they fal to hate and perſecution. So as although men could willinglye ſuffer theyr bace e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: yet beinge driuen into any kinde of neceſſity or calamity, ſtraight wayes they lament and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine: ſo as by confeſſion of them, for great deſyre

But ſeinge the eſtate of tyme and worldly procedinges are not euer alike, wee meane not to ſpeake muche of that calamitye which theſe ambicious men do thincke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greateſt, but of that miſerye whych may ſo trulye be called: for ſuche kinde of men do labour to continue after death, and glorye in theyr owne happines.

            <p>O merye man, howe aptlye hath hee nothinge ſayde, for this preſumption to continue felicitye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, is a thinge altogether vaine, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the very authors thereof. For well we ſee that after death, the glorye of ryches doth in ſhort ſpace decay. Not onely becauſe great nombers do daylye aſpyre to this prayſe: but alſo riches it ſelfe deſerueth no glorye at all. And amonge ſo manye thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thouſands as in theyr time was famouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye rich, yet few of them haue come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>Gilias, Creſſus, Mydas, Pythius, Meander, Ericto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Syſiphus Tantalus.</hi> Of the Romaynes that had beene bonde men, <hi>Amphion, Menecrates, Heron, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius, Pallas, Caliſtus, Narciſus.</hi> Of Frenchmen, <hi>Druſus, Caecilius, Sylla, Lucullus, Liuius, M, Craſſus.</hi> Of Kinges, <hi>Salamon</hi> and <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> were all reported
<pb facs="tcp:5037:70"/> for notable ryche.

To what vſe that after death riches ſhould ſerue no manne knoweth, nor can imagine. And although that after death they did yelde glorye to thee, and vſe to others, yet the ſame is to thee nothing at all. Rather ought thou remember to paſſe in to thoſe partyes, whether thou can carrye nothinge beſydes thy vertue and vyces of mynde, When ſoeuer therefore thou ſhal dye, wyll come to memory not thy ryches, but thy ſinnefull offences, not thine honour or auctoritye, but thy hope and fayth of Saluation. For at that inſtant (I omit thy former myſeryes) all thinges ſhalbe ſubuerted, and to thy ſighte the hole worlde ſhalbe turned to the firſt <hi>Chaos.</hi> And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land doth ſeeme to moue in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſight of ſuch as ſayle in the ſhip (&amp; yet in deede doth not) but it is the ſhippe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land: ſo in the houre of death ſhal the whole world ſeeme to be ſubuerted, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou ſhalte for euer take leaue of earthlye life, neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to ſee thy worldlye frendes, nor thy riches

Therefore if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death thou hopeſt of anye lyfe, why doeſt thou not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume thy tyme in vertue? or if none? yet why ſeekeſt thou not thyne owne quyet? ſyth for other lyfe thou lokeſt not, nor hopeſt to returne againe to this. But happilye it maye be ſayde that this ſorrow is ſweete (as it is to rubbe a ſoore) A plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it is to be riche, to gouerne, to be prayſed and to oppreſſe others, &amp; this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vttermoſt marke of mans felicitye.

We reade y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſome men to auoyde extreame ſickenes, haue volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ended their liues: of which nomber was <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius Atticus,</hi> a famous man extremelye torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted wyth a greuous diſeaſe, &amp; at length fynding ſome reſt, pyned himſelfe for not falling into his former paynes.

But oure Lawes do not permit any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to procure his owne death: and for good reaſon: For that nothing ſhoulde be intollerable to a Chriſtian man (onelye extreame tormente) which the Lawe doth not allowe, yet by law is permitted.

So as I may thincke with <hi>Socrates,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if all mens cares and euilles were by one aſſente layde togethers on one heape, and equallye deuided to euerye man alike, after wee had ſeene the greatnes of others greeues, we would chooſe to take vppon vs our owne, rather then to abyde the chaunce in deuiſion: becauſe eche man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his owne euils, and is ignorant how great the

            <p>In witnes whereof we fynd that when the king of <hi>Perſia</hi> did ſend certain ambaſſadors to <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> they were there through fury of the people robbed and ſlayne. There was in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> a temple of <hi>Talthibius, Agamemnons</hi> cryer, a ſanctuary for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, which vpon a tyme not yelding to the ſacrifycers any lucky propheſies (for that was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a religeon) it moued the penitente <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> that in ſtede of the ambaſſadors ſlayne, as many (that is to ſay too) ſhould offer themſelues, to death.

            <p>Then aunſweared they, Thou knoweſte not <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes</hi> howe ioyful a thinge the pleaſure of liberty is, where of thou euer ſeruinge a kinge hadde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer proofe, but if once thou mighteſt taſte thereof, thou wouldſt preferre it before all the kingedomes of <hi>Percia.</hi> Such felicitye hadd theſe men in their Common weales, eyther of pouerty, or at the leſt wiſe with pouerty.

            <p>But omyttinge to ſpeake of Common weales let vs inquyre of priuate Lyfe, where in is greater Pleaſure, greater Quiet, then in kingdomes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can a Kinge bee aſſured of freendes, neyther can he feele the chiefeſt ſweete of <hi>Venus</hi> ioyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge in dout of deſembled loue.

               </gap>rfore that ſo many doe declare themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanckfull to princes, for they cannot be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as frendes, that eyther for hope, feare, or day<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye rewarde, bee entertayned. Therefore <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi> reproued his ſonne <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe wyth
<pb facs="tcp:5037:78"/> geuing he thought to gayne the good will of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Albeit the lyfe of princes is moſt noble, yet wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting loue and friendſhip, by no meanes can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted happy, becauſe they are to ſeke of ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyts as do neareſt approch the happines of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men. But let vs now conſyder that although in theſe thinges they were equal to pore men, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther then the lyfe of Princes, or common perſons, were more pleaſant. The pore man ryſing earlye, after his handes be waſhed, reſorteth to his labor, where hauing a while exerciſed him ſelfe (beſydes the helpe of his hongry ſupper the night before) w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his felow in labour, where, with hongrye Sauce they ſauour all ſortes of meate, what ſoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to hand ſemeth pleaſant, delicate, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In dyning time, they common of pleaſaunt matters, and tell what hope hee hathe of tyme to come. This company breedeth no diſcention, this dyet cauſeth no ſacietye, no diſdayn, no ſuſpicion. The diner ended, after pawſinge a while, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to accuſtomed labor, wherein they get good appetite to ſupper. There being met, they want no mirth, gentill ieaſtes, and pleaſante tales accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quality of the gueſts, Then to bed thei goe, whereunto preparing themſelues, the ſhining ſtarres doe ſtirre them vp to looke to heauen, and remember that at length they ſhal come into that moſt bleſſed country, promiſing in mynde (if anye thinge were ſinfully done) thamendment of theyr offences. Thus wearied with long labor by daye ſo ſone as he commeth in bed, ſodenly he falleth in to ſound ſleape. In ſuch a ſorte lyuinge, the ſimple
<pb facs="tcp:5037:78"/> man gayneth healthy and long lyfe, neither trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with repentaunce of paſſed time, nor feare of that wil after follow. When holy dayes do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen he reſteth his weary bones. Then wandreth he at will, and if ought therebe in towne pleaſant or worthy ſight, he may without offence ſee it.</p>
            <p>He veweth the ſuburbes, the greene fieldes &amp; men dowes, he meeteth his companions &amp; taketh each where his diſport. He mindeth no diſpleaſing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginacions, he ioyeth in lyfe, and liueth prepared for death. And if happely he be learned, maye bee ſom what the more accompted happy.</p>
            <p>But the Princes life is cleare contrary. He hauing ſhaken of his yeſterdayes ſurfyte ryſeth vppe, hys mouth not well in taſte, but on the one ſyde offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with vnſweete ſauour of his owne ſtomack, on the other diſtempered with euyll relleſſe, Then aſſemble on euery hand his Garde, ſouldiers, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, paraſytes flatterers, and ſuters, hys men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>And if the prince be of good diſpoſicion ſecretly he examineth his affayres, which fynding to be infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in nomber, he lotheth his owne lyfe. For ſome thinges he diſpayreth to bringe to paſſe: and ſome thinges he hath great care of. Now he blameth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> infidelity of ſome perſons. Now hee accuſeth the ſlouth of others, now he fyndeth fault with ſome mens couetiſe.. Now he forecaſteth ſome neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye matters. Now he heareth prayers. Now hee

The complexion of their faces doothe often tymes alſo ſhew what lyfe they leade. A poore man other whyles hathe moore beautifull Chlydren then hath the rich man, &amp; in hauing them as fortunate.

<pb facs="tcp:5037:81"/> and flouth of his ſeruantes, to beare with their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. In ſommer notwithſtanding all prouiſion he is annoyed with duſte.

The richman carefully defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his own Lands, but the pore man beholdeth all, and the ſeldomer he hath liberty to ſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſure he hath in ſeinge. Neyther do thou y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin I ſaye otherwiſe then I thincke: my ſelfe haue neuer wiſhed any thing leſſe then to haue gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dens in the ſuburbes, for the reaſon aboueſayde, that other mens for their rarenes do more delight and to haue them myne owne were nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable, All men do ſtudy to lyue, whiche lyuinge the pore man by labour doth gette, his Nature is ſtronge, hys bodye vncorrupt.

For more ſpeedye ende of this Booke let vs conſider what is the occaſion of glorye, ſeinge poore menne in diſcipline of warre, learninge, and inuention of artes, do gaine reputation: whether rich men are admitted to glorye in the artes them ſelues? when in deede they neuer knewe theim. But admit that riches are more precious then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertye? Alas what myſerye can come from the gods greater then the deſyre to haue them: which the more we gette, the more it increaſeth.

In like maner are riches to be deſired, not in abundance, but ſo much as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyceth to liue: whatſoeuer is requyred more, is not onely not good, but alſo contrarye to nature. And how can y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be good which is contrary to nature? This exceding deſyre of riches doth not therefore procede of imperfection of nature. Al men natural<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly do deſyre riches, as meate or drinke, not becauſe exceſſe of them is naturall, but becauſe in them ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>what is natural, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſaye, ſo muche as ſuffiſeth wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to liue.

For to haue nothing, nor know which way to get, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to nature. And yet as ſaciety &amp; dronkennes be not onely euil, but alſo vnpleaſant, ſo is alſo riches and auctority. But notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding it may be obiected that thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modityes which poore men are partakers of, as labor, exerciſe, induſtry, pacience &amp; abſtinence, may
<pb facs="tcp:5037:89"/> be enioyed by them that be rich: and the choyſe of both being in the riche man, he ſhoulld be the more happye. For if willinglye wee wante pleaſures, in wanting them is eyther none euill, or iuſtly cannot ſo be called. Yet whoſoeuer thus thincketh doth greatlye erre. Becauſe a man being brought vppe in delicacye, his minde becommeth effeminate, his bodye tender, and vnfit to ſuffer trauaile. Nature accuſtomed to ſondry meates, do make dilicate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. And if any man ſo brought vp do chaunge his diet to poore mens fare, he ſhortly becommeth diſeaſed, full of obſtructions, and ſubiecte to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.

If any of theſe fine eaters do applye themſelues to earneſt ſtudye, they commonly dye in youth: as did <hi>Ioannes Picus Mirandola.</hi> A thinge impoſſible it is, that a man borne to great riches ſhould become in learninge excellent: vnleſſe at the firſt he liued a poore life, or in his youth fell into ſome frenſye.

<pb facs="tcp:5037:89"/> in worldly glory, do make poore men ſeeme to haue more neede of the rich, thenne the riche of them. Yet if wee reſpected onelye neceſſitye, then ſhoulde the riche haue more occaſion to ſeeke oute the poore, then they to ſeeke for theim. Neyther can anye man doubte, but that riche men do dailye for neceſſitye vſe the induſtrye of the poore: And if the riche mans goodes be needeful for the poore mans vſe, it is ſcarcelye once in they care. Alſo the riche onelye for riches do gaine reputacion, and in that reſpect onelye thought meete for honour and auctoritye. But farre otherwyſe it is in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale of Venis, and was in Rome while it remayned in glorye: farre otherwyſe it was in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,</hi> where pouertye was accompted a praiſe.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. And haue not al excellent men beene driuen to exile? <hi>Demoſthenes, Cicero, Ariſtides, Thuſidides, The miſtocles, Alcibiades Codrus, Theſeus, Eumolpus, Trax, Ariſtoteles, Camillus, Corialanus, Marius, Datanus, Trisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus, Dion, Anniball, Demetrius Phalerius.</hi> And ſome other that willingly baniſhed themſelues as <hi>Cono<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:5037:94"/> as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaide that the whoole worlde, is a wiſe mans country, and a wiſe man while he is in the worlde is neuer from his country, and not to bee in the worlde cannot bee. It is the part of euery wiſe man to eſchewe death, impriſonment, &amp; exile and yet of theſe three, is not exile the leaſt?</p>
            <p>And yf death be not euyll, what euyl can it bee to lacke our country? When it was tolde <hi>Diogenes</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the <hi>Synopenſes</hi> had condempned him to exile, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſayinge, euen ſo do I condempne them to dwel for euer in <hi>Pontus,</hi> &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the confines of <hi>Eux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inus.</hi> Did not <hi>Camillus</hi> of ſuch hard fortune receiue the occaſyon of his noble victorye.</p>
            <p>And where were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bokes of wiſe men made more often then in baniſhmente? <hi>Ouidius Naſo</hi> beinge in exile wrote his bookes <hi>De triſtibus, De ponto, in Ibin Triumphus Caeſaris</hi> and <hi>De piſcibus.</hi> So as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that in eight yeares exile, he performed more then in thoſe fyftye and foure, which before he had liued in Rome. <hi>Plato</hi> wrote the greateſt parte of his bookes, whyle he lyued from his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye: For when <hi>Socrates</hi> dyed, hee was aboute the age of twenty and ſeuen yeares. Truly whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lyueth in his owne naturall countrye an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious lyfe, doth gayne greate enuye, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more if he be baſely borne. Where was Chryſte worſe entreated then in <hi>Nazereth</hi> beinge there borne, yet hated, diſdayned, afflicted, and at length in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſlayn. So it ſeemeth true and that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be a Prophete in his owne countrye.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that exile is not onely good, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo glorious, chieflie to a wiſe and learned manne.
<pb facs="tcp:5037:94"/> Neyther ought any to miſlyke of that which hath forthered many. Would God all men knew how profytable a thinge it is to trauayle, and chieflye for ſuch as dwell in thoſe countries where riches do rule as Lawe, power take place of Order, or Tyrannye in any ſort is put in practyſe.</p>
            <p>Wherfore I ſaye that exile is neyther euyll nor to be nombred amonge thoſe thinges which haue of euyll any reſemblance. But exile doth not ſo much offend theſe, as iniuryes do torment others, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge withe the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that who ſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth one iniury doth occaſion an other, But who euer thincketh iniuries ought to be reuenged doth greatlye erre.

Who ſo offereth the fyrſt muſt he not reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the ſeconde? Hee therefore doth mooſte well, that offereth the fyrſte iniury, and nexte to hym, he that ſeketh reuenge, deſerueth blame, becauſe the third iniurye, of neceſſity muſt folowe.</p>
            <p>And how can he paciently ſuffer wronge, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouoked willingly offered the fyrſt iniury. What can therfore be bette, then to refrayne from doing iniuries, and call to memorye the ſayinges of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> that a wiſe man, dyfferethe as far from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, as a common perſon from a chylde.</p>
            <p>For children do reuenge euery iniury yea thoughe againſt the iniuryous wyll it be offered, moſt lyke vnto Beaſtes, vppon whoſe tayles yf (thoughe vnwares thou treade) ſodenly they byte without conſydering whether wyllingly thou did it or not. But farre otherwyſe oughte Menne to reuenge
<pb facs="tcp:5037:95"/> thoſe iniuries which willingly are offred. If then a wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do not reuenge thoſe wrongs which by miſhap do happen vnto him: is he not therin more worthy then the common perſon voyde of all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? how muche were it better to obſerue that deuine precept. <hi>Michi vindictam et ego retribuam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That wiſe men haue ſo done, no man doubteth. Amongs whom we reade that <hi>Socrates</hi> beinge ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vppon the Shynnes and aduiſed by his fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to ſeeke reuenge aunſwered.

               <hi>Diogenes</hi> receyuinge a blowe ſayde. <hi>Neſciebam qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do michi cum galea è domo sit pro deundum. Crates</hi> alſo beinge ſtriken on the face by <hi>Nicodromo Citaredo,</hi> made none other reuenge, but wrote <hi>Nicodromo</hi> his name vpon the place he was ſtricken, and in that ſorte ſhewed to the hole cittye the iniury offred vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to him: becauſe to offer iniury without cauſe is a greater reproche, then to receiue it. The one by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe wronge ſheweth himſelfe plainly wicked, &amp; an euylle man, the other is giltye of nothinge myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. When it was tolde to <hi>Antiſtines</hi> that <hi>Plato</hi> had ſpoken euyll of him he made this anſwere.</p>
            <p>It is the parte of a prince to heare euyll when hee doth beſt. But <hi>Plato</hi> beinge tolde that <hi>Zenocrates,</hi> did ſlaunder him, ſaid fyrſt, he could not beleue it: and after better proofe aunſwered ſayinge. I can
<pb facs="tcp:5037:95"/> not thinke he would haue thus ſpoken withoute cauſe. What could haue beene ſayde more wiſelye or more ſafelye. A chriſtian kinge ſtricken on the right cheke, ought to turn the left. And S. Paule ſayth, that if thou do good, to thoſe that ſpeake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll of the: thou heapeſt burning coales vpon their heades. There is nothinge more wicked then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, nor more cruel then to oppreſſe innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: either of which faults he committeth that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth iniury to his benefactors. Let vs now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the law of Nature, and conſider when anye iniury is offered, whether ſafely, or withe perill the came may be doone.</p>
            <p>For what can bee moore fooliſhe then to ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, when ſafelye it can not bee perfourmed.</p>
            <p>So did <hi>Pauſanias</hi> reuenge himſelfe vpon <hi>Philippus,</hi> but for his laboure was hanged. So did <hi>Andreas Lampugnanus</hi> wreake his ire vpon <hi>Galeazeus Sforſa:</hi> but thereby he wrought the diſtruction of himſelf his ſon, &amp; his brother, beſydes many diſcomodities of his country. But how many haue bene puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; put to death, before they, had performed their intent to reuenge? as were thoſe that conſpyred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murder of <hi>Phaleris,</hi> &amp; that wrought treaſon againſt <hi>Nero.</hi> The multitude of enſamples doe make mee leaue them vntouched. Who doth therfore beinge neuer ſo ſymple co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peryl that reuenge brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth? which though performed doth more hynder thee. then him to whom it is offered, and ſomtime before performance doth vndoe both the and thine Is then reuenge good when ſafely it maye bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted? Surely at no time.
<pb facs="tcp:5037:96"/> Becauſe the pleaſure of reuenge is when there in a man may declare courage and magnanimity of mynde. And as the Poet ſayth.
<q>Shevve not thy force on yeldinge foes, let proud men be oppreſt.</q> Me thinckes therfore that <hi>Ariſtides</hi> deſerued praiſe For when <hi>Cleomines</hi> had ſayd a man muſt do good to frendes, and euyll to Foes: <hi>Ariſtides</hi> turned the wordes, ſayinge. A man muſt do good to his fren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des and ſeeke the reconſiliacion of his foes. The glory gotten by forgeuing of foes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou may oppreſſe is greater, then the pleaſure of reuenge. The man y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doth good for euyll is lyke vnto God. For he that defendeth and doth well to all menne doth moſt nearelye folowe God. And howe great a ſygne of noble mynde it is to forbeare reuenge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> auncient examples doe beare witnes, wherein <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar</hi> gayned ſo great prayſe, as no man more.

            <p>He ſpared <hi>M, Mercellus</hi> his mortall enemy. He ſett at lyberty <hi>Petreius</hi> the chieftaine of his foes. <hi>Afra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Vero, Korfinius, L.

            <p>He pardoned <hi>Ligarius</hi> at the ſuite of hys Freendes and Bretheren, thoughe hee were an apparaunte offender, and many waies gyltie. He ſpared <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5037:96"/> and freely pardoned al other Princes that were in the battayle <hi>Pharſalica.</hi> He ſette vppe the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Pompeius</hi> and fynallye gaue ſo manye ſyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Monumentes of mercy as <hi>Cicero</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the victorye, and after his deathe affirmed his Quarell the better: ſayinge that <hi>Pompeius</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doure of his country might more iuſtlye be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned for his crueltye to Enemies, then <hi>Caeſar</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the greate Mercie he vſed. In lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner didde <hi>Octauius</hi> his ſucceſſor procede.</p>
            <p>For when <hi>Liuius</hi> the Hiſtoriographer had percy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally written againſt him, hee vſed none other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge but called him a Pompeian, Lykewiſe when <hi>Asinius Pollio,</hi> had in his Booke prayſed <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Brutus, Affranius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> he ſought no reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge againſte him.

            </p>
            <p>But beholde howe nobly <hi>Andrianus Caeſar</hi> did my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate his ire? Hee beinge made Emperoure and meetinge his Enemy ſayde. Thou haſt eſcaped. Declaringe that as befoore hee wanted power to be Reuenged, ſo nowe in aucthoritye he woulde wante will, and therefore did acquite him of feare It is alſo to bee conſydered that there is nothinge that encreaſeth aucthoritye more then to forgeue.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>PELECRVS</hi> the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> Complayninge to hys Brother that hee was not ſo Beloued amonge the Cyttyzens as hee was: hee aunſweared <hi>Pelecrus,</hi> ſayinge the cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:5037:97"/> thereof is that thou can not ſuffer iniuries. It is lykewiſe greatly to be noted that who ſo euer hath aſpired to authority or greatnes, they haue born w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many iniuries, becauſe they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuenge might be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſembled to the fable of <hi>Praxitelis.</hi> Who beinge (as men ſaye) of Nature angry, and beholdinge hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a glaſſe, eſpied there a viſage euyl fauoured and deformed: and therewithall more moued, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his collerick &amp; angry countenaunce which plainly appeared w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the glaſſe, but in the end hee brake the glaſſe, in euery piece where of he found a face much deformed. Wherby <hi>Praxitelis</hi> had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that in ſeeking to reuenge himſelfe of one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentacion, he occaſioned many: Euen ſo if thou murder one man, thou makeſt his frendes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milye all thine enemies. Thus in ſeeking to acquit thy ſelfe of one foe thou getteſt manye, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes for ſo doinge thy name groweth odious, and thou condempned for an euyll man. Fynallye who ſo is accuſtomed to reuenge, mindeth none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinge, which reaſon and experience doth wel declare. <hi>Alexander</hi> the greate (in whoſe chamber whyle he lyued, good fortune ſlepte) knowing the vnfriendly hartes of the <hi>Athenienſes</hi> and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Grecia,</hi> who vnder the enſigne of <hi>Darius</hi> made warre againſte him, did notwithſtandinge ſeeke any reuenge: which greatnes of mynde, <hi>Darius,</hi> &amp; other vnderſtanding, of enemies they became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes and faythfull freendes. But if contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hee had vſed reuenge, the whoole number of the <hi>Grecian</hi> youth yea all <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Peloponeſſo</hi> had reuolted and bene deſtroyed: ſo as of <hi>Alexander</hi> he
<pb facs="tcp:5037:97"/> had in ſhorte ſpace become a poore obſcure Prince. Farre vnlyke to hym dydde kinge <hi>Pirrus</hi> proceede, who beinge a famous Capitayne, yet folowinge Reuenge, lefte his doinges imperfyte and dyed in myſecye. <hi>IVLIVS CAESAR</hi> in priuate lyfe and towardes reconciliacion to hys Ennemyes, beinge greatlye ſlaundered by <hi>Caius Caluus</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> dyd, notwithſtandinge wryte fyrſt vnto <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus</hi> and pardonned <hi>Catullus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What greater Ennemy hadde he then <hi>Clodius</hi> that defyled the honoure of wedlocke? Beinge appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended he woulde not onely not condempne him, but alſo ſaue him from periury. But <hi>Marius</hi> dydde far otherwiſe, hee thyrſtinge for the bloud of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and followinge Reuenge hadde euyll ende, and was the diſtruction of himſelfe and all hys.</p>
            <p>What hath bene ſeene more worthely done then that acte of <hi>Fabius?</hi> who contrary to al right, was forced by the people to receiue <hi>Minutius</hi> mayſter of his horſe, as his companion in the empyre, whoe doinge dyuers thinges contrary to <hi>Fabius</hi> deſygne, dyd (notwithſtandinge forgetting the iniury) ioyn with <hi>Minutius</hi> agaynſt <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and to ſaue hym from peril vſed al care &amp; cunning, which afterwar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des wrought ſuch effect as the people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed how vnworthelye they had abled <hi>Minutius</hi> to bee his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, which <hi>Minutius</hi> alſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his knees confirmed prayinge <hi>Fabius</hi> to take into his handes y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Empire. Such be the rewards of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble myndes, that can forget al iniuryes. So dydd not <hi>Cicero</hi> when with ſtaunderous ſpeach he perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>Clodius,</hi> but for ſo doinge was himſelfe ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed.
<pb facs="tcp:5037:98"/> And in ſeekinge to baniſhe <hi>Antonius</hi> oute of the common wealth, he there by hindred himſelf his friendes, his countrye, and all good men.</p>
            <p>But is it not a thing worthy to be noted, that we diſdayne the iniuries of brute beaſtes, and reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the wronges offered by men? Alſo we pacientlye ſuffer the diſpleaſure of tyme, and can not beate, the offences of men? But in the one Ambicion wanteth: in the other is meane to Reuenge whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I graunte: and yet in the Iniuryes of men, it is to be conſydered, that man is, wyll thou, Nyll thou, thy Companion in lyfe: And manye times (thoughe thou marcke it not) by the prouoked.</p>
            <p>What doth it then moue thee to ſuffer iniurye? Is it Harme or Loſſe, by reuenge it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. If Harme, thou ſeemeſt to Sorrowe that thou arte honeſte, or that thou would be ſo thought. Seing it is the propertie of an euyl man to do iniury: &amp; the property of a good man to dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne it. Alſo when any man doth ſclander thee, diſdayne thee, ſtryke thee, or hurte thee, conſyder whether the ſame be wyllinglie done or not? Be: cauſe an vnwyllinge offence may hurt, and yet be none Iniurie at all. <hi>Creſus</hi> was commended for pardoning <hi>Adraſtus</hi> when he had killed his ſonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe <hi>Adraſtus</hi> meaninge was to haue ſhotte at the Bore, and not to haue ſlaine the Chylde. But if wyllinglye the offence bee offered, examine thy ſelfe if thou haue geeuen cauſe, for then is it none iniurye, but deſerued puniſhmente.</p>
            <p>And if thyne ennemye hathe hurte thee, thincke withe thy ſelfe whether thou woulde haue doone
<pb facs="tcp:5037:98"/> the lyke to him if thou might, for then it was none Iniurye but contencion.</p>
            <p>The ende of all ſtryfe is when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one yeldeth. And therfore a boye of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> beinge deadly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and Comforted by his Freendes, ſaying that or long they would reuenge the iniury done vnto him, aunſwearede, that in no wyſe they ſhould ſo doe, becauſe the hurte he receiued. he entended to his Enemye, if his entent hadde taken place.</p>
            <p>But let thy mynde be voyde of euyll, free from hate and diſpleaſure, then conſyder the qualitye of the offence and the ſtate of the offender, whether it be ſo ſmall as is not to be regarded, or the man ſo mad or vyle as is to be diſdayned: becauſe to be reuenged vpon anye ſuche Iniurious occaſyons, or men, is both diſhonourable and wicked. But admitte the offence be not ſuch, doeſt thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is the propertye of a good man pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to ſuffer iniuries, not for feare, but through Fortitude. So <hi>Phocion</hi> beinge by the <hi>Athenienſes,</hi> condempned to death, his Friendes aſkinge what he woulde haue ſayde to his ſonne? aunſwered, tell him that in any wiſe he forget this iniury here offered vnto me. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> alſo vniuſtly remayning in exile, prayd the Gods that the <hi>Athenienſes</hi> might bee ſo happye as neuer after to thinke vppon him. Alſo calle to thy conſyderacion that againſt all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries three Remedyes there are, that is to ſaye, Reuenge, Oblyuion, and diſdayne.</p>
            <p>Of whiche three who doubteth but Dyſdayne, is bothe the beſte, and mooſte aſſured? Becauſe diſdayne through the courage of mynd wherwith
<pb facs="tcp:5037:99"/> it is accompanied, is not lyke vnto obliuio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ioyned with reproche, neither perilous in reſpect of new iniuries, as is a reuenge, which bringeth therwith boothe peryll and repentaunce, and in the meane tyme, the deſyre of offending doth not moleſt thee but arte there in moſte lyke vnto God. For ſuche as contempne iniuryes are mooſte happye and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſte to God, and ſuche men they are, or muſt bee that would become happye. For ſeeinge no man lyueth free from iniuries, and the greater in aucto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritye he be, the more followed with ſlaunder euyll report, &amp; iniury, it is expedient that euery man doe determyne himſelfe to beare them.</p>
            <p>Neyther is it lawfull for anye mortall man to vſe reuenge. Who hath bene more ſlaundred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and emperours, whoſe power is greateſt?</p>
            <p>Whoe, or what is of greater force then God and Nature? and yet they delighte not in Reuenge. Shall man then be lyke vnto Beares, purſuynge the Bees, ſeeke for reuenge? God forbydde. For although we might in lyfe reuenge all Iniuryes: what good were that after Deathe, or what care ſhould wee then haue of iniuryes? It is all one whether with ſufferance of Iniurye, or not after Death wee be remembred. Who ſo therfore liuing ſeemed to contempne iniuryes, by death he is free from the peryll whych Reuenge might caſt hym in to. Wherfore there is nothynge better then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſyble mynde, whyche lyke vnto a man placed on the toppe of an highe Tower, in dyſdayne caſtynge downe ſtones vpon the heades of hys Ennemyes, doth make lyght of all Iniuryes (and as yt were)
<pb facs="tcp:5037:99"/> dyſdayne them. For as women, for lacke of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity can not beare offences: ſo men (as they are men) may take what Reuenge they thinke beſt Then make thy choyſe whych of them thou wilte bee lyke, But happely thou wilt ſaye ſome worthy men haue bene reuenged. For <hi>Caeſar</hi> commaunded <hi>Fauſtus Silla</hi> and <hi>Affranius,</hi> to be ſlaine.</p>
            <p>Lykewiſe <hi>Antonius</hi> reuenged him ſelfe vpon <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Caliſtines,</hi> carying him abrode when his Eyes were putte oute, and in the end ſhutte him vppe into a caue with a Dogge. But alas (good manne) thys was no Reuenge, though ſome ſaye that <hi>Antonius</hi> beinge of Mynde moore abiecte then a Woman didde lyke vnto his other doinges committe this acte, and therefore had an ende aunſwerable to his deſeruinge. But as for the other they mynded nothinge leſſe then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, for the reſpecte of their doinges was ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye, whiche in lyke caſe by oure Lawes is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. For if <hi>Afframus</hi> had gotten libertye, hee woulde neyther haue kepte Promiſe nor lyued in quiet, Alſo <hi>Fauſtus Silla,</hi> was by Lawe giltie. <hi>Pompeius</hi> freende and for his fathers Tyrannye odious to the people of Rome.</p>
            <p>So as beinge a neceſſary Friende for <hi>Pompeius,</hi> he could not haue lyued in quiet. But if he had, for the Mallice borne to his Father beene ſlayne, the ſame ſhoulde rather haue beene doone vppon <hi>Cato,</hi> who (as was well knowen) after that <hi>Caeſar</hi> conquered the Germaines, did perſwade y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Senate to haue him deliuered into the Enemies Handes, becauſe hee had foughte contrarye to the
<pb facs="tcp:5037:100"/> truce taken. But <hi>Sylla</hi> when eaſly he mighte haue ſlayne him, he woulde not.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Alexander</hi> beinge ſetled in his Empyre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the barbarous People, did not condempne <hi>Caliſtines,</hi> for Mallyce, but Securitye becauſe throughe hys woordes hee coulde hardelye keepe the <hi>Perſians.</hi> And the <hi>Macedonians</hi> beganne to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne hym.</p>
            <p>Full well knewe <hi>Antonius</hi> that if <hi>Cicero</hi> hadde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped, hee woulde neuer haue lyued in quyet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe beinge all readye once Pardoned, hee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge didde followe hym wyth Hate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconſiliable, and if the Death of <hi>CICERO</hi> had beene ſoughte for Reuenge, eyther a lyue he might haue beene tormented and kepte, or elles executed wyth more crueltye. It commeth alſo to mynd, that Iniuries haue not a little proffyted Some menne and therfore <hi>Ouidius</hi> ſaythe.</p>
            <q>A vvronge ſomvvhiles vve ſee: doth helpe the vvronged vvight.</q>
            <p>It happeneth ofte tymes that wee take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of theym wee loue not: eyther for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice wee beare theym that offered the Iniurye, or throughe beliefe that the Iniured is condempned, rather by power of hys Enemye then his own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And by ſuche meanes it is well knowen that many haue eſcaped great peryll.</p>
            <p>Amonge whiche nomber <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethe howe <hi>Gabinius</hi> throughe the Sclaunder of <hi>Siſenna,</hi> and <hi>Flauius,</hi> for the Iniurie of <hi>Valerius</hi> were delyuered, and <hi>Cotta</hi> onelye for ſuſpicion of wronge founde the ſame fauoure. In which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb facs="tcp:5037:100"/> if none iniurye had beene, no hope had remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It is alſo to be conſydered, that the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sclaunders are ſo common, as nothynge more. The People doe backebyte the learned, the Learned dyſdayne the vnlearned, the Iuſte doe condempne the wicked, the Wycked do laugh to Scorne thoſe that bee good, the Mightye doe Enuye the Mightye, agaynſte whome they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke Seruaunts and Subiects by ſclaunderous Speache, Robberye, Practiſe, and vntrewe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge. Were it not better with noble mynde to diſdayne all Iniuries, then thus continuallye to liue tormented in minde. <hi>Lucius Murena</hi> was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe he tooke <hi>Cato</hi> vnder his Gowne and ſaued him from Deathe, that not longe before had accuſed him.</p>

               <hi>Publius Pulcher</hi> beinge by the three <hi>Lentuli</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of inceſte did notwithſtandinge afterwardes ſaue one of them from perrill. <hi>Marcellus</hi> being hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly accuſed by the <hi>Siculi</hi> did not only forgeue them, but alſo receiued theim into his owne tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So <hi>Menedemus</hi> beſtowed manye Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytes vppon <hi>Alexinus</hi> of whome he had bene great lye iniured. How wiſely ſayd S. Gregorius, that who ſo can not beare iniurye, dothe ſhewe by hys impacience that he is not good. The kinge <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>laus,</hi> when vpon a time one caſte water vpon him, beinge perſwaded by his frendes to reuenge: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſaying, I know he would not haue caſt yt vpon me, but ſome other. By which anſwer he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> offender fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurt, &amp; him ſelf from the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his friendes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5037:101"/> A notable example remayneth in memorye of the ſeruaunte of <hi>Antius Reſtio,</hi> who beinge longe time kepte in priſon, and by his maiſters commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente ofte times burned with hot yrons, yet after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards folowing him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe triumuiral did notwithſtanding all their iniuries ſaue himſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peryl, when comodiouſly he might haue bene reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged &amp; alſo rewarded. Such wiſdome hath not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly bene performed by priuate men, but alſo by hole Citties. For <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the yonger bothe at the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Corinthus</hi> and alſo before hee was ſente into exile might haue beene by them of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> ſlayne, whome befoore tyme hee hadde mooſte Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſlye vſed. But they with diſdayne didde lette him paſſe. Likewiſe didde the Romaines, when <hi>Silla</hi> hadde reſigned the Offyce of Dictator, and liued in priuate ſtate: notwithſtandinge hee had greuouſly offended the people, yet did they ſuffer him to paſſe without hurt, thinking that reuenge is to be vſed vpon mighty men, &amp; thoſe that beare rule, &amp; vpon thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were by law or aſſent diſmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from authority courteouſly &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſionately to entreate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was a ſigne of a good man.</p>
            <p>Therfore there is no greater argument of felicity, no redier waye to glorie, nor better meane to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, then to diſdayne iniuries.</p>
            <p>Beholde the dogs which be of many other beaſts the moſt improfytable, yet are much more made of then eyther Oxen or Horſe, onlie becauſe they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all iniuries their mayſters do offer vnto them.</p>
            <p>If thou Stryke theym, they fawne. If thou dryue theym awaye frome thee, they retourne
<pb facs="tcp:5037:101"/> vnto thee: if thou chide them they flatter. Finallye he is much worſe then any beaſt, that cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne iniuryes. No brutiſhe beaſt is mindefull of offence done vnto him. Therefore that man that ſeeketh reueng is not wyſe, loued of God, nor lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge happye. If thou ſuffer a whyle thou ſhalt ſee thy wronges reuenged by nature, by chaunce, or by ſome other meane. And him whom wyth extreme care, trauayle, and hazard of thy ſelfe thou ſought to offende, ſhalbe wythout thyne euill or myſerye deſtroyed. The liues of all euill men that do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe the quiet of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good, are ſhort: or at leaſt wiſe that happines of ſmall continuance. If therefore forbearing iniurye no man is myſerable, then is it better for all men whether they can or not, not to be reuenged: becauſe it is manifeſt that before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of iniurye no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in myſery. The offence that men in theſe dayes do thincke the greateſt, is the infidelity of wyues.

For arte thou more wyſe then <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtoteles?

Howe much better had it beene for theſe learned men to haue liued by ſome craft or induſtrye? what man haue thou knowen both learned and fortunate, yea whom hath not learninge hindered? <hi>Socrates</hi> was ſlayne, <hi>Anaxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> kept in pryſon. <hi>Plato</hi> ſoulde, and put in perill of hys heade, <hi>Ariſtotiles</hi> ſente into exile, where eyther willingly or not greatlye againſt his wyl he dyed. <hi>Demetrius Phalerius</hi> baniſhed and condempned. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſtenes</hi> poiſoned himſelfe, <hi>Eaſimes</hi> ſent to exile, and ſo was <hi>Solon.

How ſoeuer it be, or what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoeuer griefe we feele, eyther it is not great, or not long, and ſeldome it happeneth to honeſt men: but if it doe, muſt of neceſſitye be endured. Whoſoeuer falleth into ſicknes either willingly or agaynſt his will, would he not be aſhamed that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould excell hym in pacience and ſufferaunce of griefe? for women in bearing of children do endure moſt extreeme paynes, yet notwithſtanding do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayne the company of men, &amp; ſuche as be barren, do not deſyre any thinge ſo muche as to haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The griefe which women ſuffer in childing, is of all other the greateſt, and neareſt to death: yea many of ſuch griefe do dye in deede.

But this vertue procedeth of oure Chriſtianitye. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb facs="tcp:5037:108"/> to naturall reaſons. Ther is no reſt ſo wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as that which followeth great trauayle, nor death ſoe muche deſyred, as where ſickenes hath beene moſte extreame. The ende therefore of all griefe, eyther by recouerye, or death is pleaſaunte. It is alſo to be conſydered, that all ſuche as ſuffer great tormentes, being perſwaded of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitye of ſoules, oughte thereby (thoughe none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon were) to be comforted. And ſuche as beleeue of none other lyfe, are ſure that death is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ende of all myſeryes. Therefore if thy griefe gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vppon deſerte, deſeruinglye thou oughte to beare it, for thereby thou doeſt decreaſe thy griefe, and ſaue thy minde from due tormente, neyther oughteſt thou to puniſh thy body and minde both at one time, ſeinge thy ſoule is afterwardes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue his chaſtiſemente.</p>
            <p>The ſame or more profytable reaſon maye bee made for ſickenes, then ſorrowe: for what can be intollerable in ſickenes, if ſorrowe be awaye? yea hardlye it can be thought howe manye commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes it bringeth. In ſicknes wee learne howe we bee, howe frayle the condition of life is: howe incertayne, and ſubiecte to the power of others. Thereby wee are taughte to be mindefull of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lyfe, and that we oughte not to doe that to an other, which we wold not haue don to our ſelues. Therefore wee become more temperate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinente, yea to ſome ſicknes haue beene cauſe of longe lyfe, amendemente of fame, and encreaſe of vertue. If ſickenes were not, a man ſhoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more harde harted then the Tiger, and more
<pb facs="tcp:5037:109"/> cruell then the Lioneſſe. <hi>Macrobius</hi> thincketh that ſickenes doth more often happen to thoſe whom God loueth, then thoſe whom hee hateth. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſuppoſed that hee is moſt vnhappy that neuer fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth aduerſity, and that hee is moſt myſerable that is moſt happye. Saint Paule ſayth, whom God loueth him hee chaſteneth. The nature of man is vnbridled, and were it not like wheate well ſifted, woulde become as ſauage as the wilde beaſtes. When the ſoule loueth the bodye then is it more noble and perfite, becauſe then it commeth to hys owne nature beinge vnbourdened of the bodye, which hindered the ſight and perfite knowledge. It is therfore the leſſe maruaile that thoſe that be moſt weake of body and of ſhorteſt lyfe, be of beſt indgemente, and moſte apte to knowe. No man hath all giftes, if thou haue ſtoore of vertues of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mynde, thou arte of neceſſity the more ſicke of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. Then whether wouldeſt thou rather haue a ſtronge bodye and a witte lyke vnto beaſtes, or a weake bodye wyth an excellente ſprighte? Some brutiſhe beaſtes there are alſo as muche or more ſubiecte to ſickenes as menne, as the Lyon and Goate: for whiche cauſe thoſe that doe vſe to ſell Goates, do not warrant them for ſound, as they doe other cattell, but as <hi>Varro</hi> ſayth, this daye hee is well and drincketh, and lyke enoughe hee maye ſo continue. And albeit theſe beaſtes be neuer but ſicke, yet wantinge reaſon, doe playe and take diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte: But man to hys owne ſorrowe is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of reaſon, whereby hee calleth to conſyderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his myſeryes. Yet is it worthely to be noted,
<pb facs="tcp:5037:109"/> that ſeeldome times we ſee honeſt men troubled with outward greeues, and thoſe that be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are not often offended with inward miſeries But ſome men do thincke deafnes and blyndnes more intollerable then Sicknes, though the ſame ſeemeth lyttle to hinder the felicitye of man.</p>

            <p>But amonge other commodities blyndenes doth make death the moore tollerable.

            <p>Wherfore ſyth in all theſe Calamities aforeſaid nothinge is euyll, let vs conſyder whether in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon miſeries we ought to lament? as in plagues famine, and deſtruction of countries, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are common, doe ſeeme the moore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlye to bee ſuffered. But if they were euyll, woulde be of all other moſte intollerable, becauſe they are moſt hardlye amended. Wee ſee therfore that the diſcontentacion of men, growethe rather vppon opinion then cauſe. And ſeeinge it is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, let vs followe the golden age, in whyche tyme was more fidelitye, more frendly conuerſaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more eaſy lyfe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> men better mynded, and their maners the leſſe corrupte; that their fortune was

In that age they lyued only vpon frute, if they had gotten bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they accompted themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues happy: but thou that wanteſt neither bread, wyne, bedde nor other prouiſion, doeſte notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge complayne. It is enuy therefore no plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure, ſuperfluity, no neceſſity that doth torment vs For if our deſires were reaſonable, wee ſhould at all tymes haue lyke wiſhes. And knowinge with howe fewe bace thinges nature is contented, we ſhoulde not fynde ſo infortunate ende of our doin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But ſeinge in that miſerable tyme men lyued ſo contented, this can not be ſayde any myſerye at all. For he is onely in miſery, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is enforced to hate his own lyfe, yet in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon calamities no man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his owne lyfe but moſte paciently beareth all aduerſityes. For nothinge ſeemeth diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that is common. Euerye euylle of mannes lyfe dothe conſyſte in reproche, death except: And euery thing that is good, in glorye. The reaſon thereof is, that (as at the beginninge I ſayd) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye good or euyl was not to be found among mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men. But to return to the purpoſe, our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye periſheth, and there in our frendes, kinred, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putacion and ſubſtance. I graunt, but doſt thou accompt thoſe only thy neighboures that inhabite thy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try? Surely we are al diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of one line, and if we loke backe to our grandfathers &amp; great great grandfathers oure affinitye is muche.

In pouertye thou haſte manye Companions, ſo as for thyne
<pb facs="tcp:5037:111"/> error thou nede not be aſhamed, for want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany thou cannot bee weary. And in pouertye as erſt I ſayde, there are many wayes to reliefe: as hoſpitalles, kinſfolke, charitable perſons, &amp; all good men. Alſo the vniuerſalitye of the miſery taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way al reproch. And though many through ſlouth and lothenes to labour, do fall into beggery, yet a mynde induſtrious and armed with vertue, is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſubiecte thereunto. Albe it the hole cittye of <hi>Siracuſa</hi> was taken, ſpoyled and ſacked, yet <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> preſerued <hi>Archimedes.</hi> Alſo when <hi>Megara</hi> was taken by <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> &amp; after by <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſon of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> yet <hi>Stilpho</hi> the Philoſopher was ſaued, and at the kinges handes receiued both honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde, for the one deſyred his company, the other became his ſcholer. When <hi>Rhodus</hi> was beſieged by <hi>Demetrius, Protogenes</hi> the painter, being found in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuburbes, was by him honored, though the other cittezens remained ſcant in ſurety. Vertue is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanied with <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> who ſufferethe none to beg, ſauing men from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon calamities. <hi>Socrates</hi> remayned in <hi>Athens</hi> healthy, when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> plage was there at the greateſt. <hi>Crates</hi> eſcaped harme at the ſaccage of <hi>Thebes.</hi> A man of greate vertue ought not to hazarde himſelf in common calamy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
