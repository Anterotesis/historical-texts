            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>That the Tartars are the Ten Tribes,

            <p>WHAT is become of
thoſe Ten Tribes,
who were ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and carried
Captives by the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they live and hold together
as a People apart, or by themſelves,
or are confuſed with other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and where they are, is often
queſtioned by Divines, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54691:5"/>
ſolved, for ought I know, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reaſonable probability. That
they have loſt their name, and the
diſtinction of their Tribes, is more
then probable; for that no Nation
of the World are called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and
ſo divided by their Tribes at this
day, as anciently they were called.
Neither was there cauſe why the
diſtinction of their Tribes ſhould
be continued, ſeeing that the end
for which this people are diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God himſelf, is fully paſſed,
and accompliſhed long a goe.</p>
            <p>For that men might know where
to look for that bleſſed Seed, it
pleaſed God to Elect one Nation
of all the World, and out of that
Nation one tribe or kindred, and
out of that Tribe, one houſe or
family, whereof the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould
be born, teaching in the Fleſh;
who being now come, there is no
cauſe why the diſtinction of their
Tribes ſhould ſtill continue. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Jews</hi> or Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their name, but are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
with that of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> as
that they are, and long have been
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54691:5"/>
ed by one name; ſo that neither
the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> nor the <hi>Jews</hi> can tell of
whether Tribe they came.<note place="margin">The 10 Tribes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by God uncon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſed with other Nati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons.</note> But that
theſe <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> ten Tribes are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
extant, and by Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as a People kept intirely and
inconfuſed with other Nations, is
plain by this.</p>
            <p>For that they were not quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
no, nor diſpeopled, but onely
captived and tranſplanted by the
<hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and becauſe all <hi>Iſrael</hi>
(whereby is meant the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
ſhall be called <hi>to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſo long expected, and yet
refuſed by that People when he
came.</p>
            <p>Which General Calling cannot
be true, except thoſe Tribes be ſtill
continuing and ſomewhere extant
in the World, to be conjoyned and
re-united into one Nation, as once
they were.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe other 2 Tribes, to
wit, of <hi>Judah</hi> and the other of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi>
which for their notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
and contempt of Gods Son,
are made a ſpectacle to the World,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54691:6"/>
and plagued by God with this ſo
horrible a deſolation and diſperſion
through the World, It is well
known both where they are, and
how they live, not diſtinguiſht by
their Tribes, nor yet united into
one Polity or Community amongſt
themſelves, but diffuſed (though
not confuſed) and diſperſed in
ſmall numbers here and there, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of all, ſave their name, which
they retain, and that rather for a
reproach, than for an honor, and
eſtimation in thoſe places where
they live, that they may be known
by other Nations to be that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whom God hath puniſht and
rejected for that ſin, in ſo reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Son of God, but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and call again, for his own
mercy and promiſe ſake. A thing
exemplary to the World, as well
of the rigour and ſeverity of Gods
Juſtice,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 22.</note> which he would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
and marked by all, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54691:6"/>

it is likely that they are to be found,
and truly the likelieſt place to find
them in, is it not in, or near thoſe
Colonies, where they were planted
at the firſt?</p>
            <p>And what I pray you, if we ſhould
ſeek them among the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54691:7"/>
are eſteemed to be the moſt vile
and barbarous Nation of all the
World? you will ſay, perhaps, a
thing unworthy and unbeſeeming
that great mercy of God, which
he vouchſafed to that People, when
they were yet his own peculiar;
an holy Nation elected by God,
out of all the Nations in the World;
as if it could not ſtand with that
moſt holy and perfect Juſtice, ſo
to abaſe a wicked People, and ſo
rebellious againſt their God, as
were theſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> though he
caſt them down from the higheſt
Heaven, to the loweſt Center of
diſhonour, even <hi>ad Tartaros,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

            <p>As for the conjecture of ſome

            <p>For we may not think, neither

People have had their dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for thoſe other 2 Colonies of the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which were placed in
<hi>Harak</hi> and <hi>Habore,</hi> they bordered
both upon the <hi>Medians.</hi> So that
all theſe Tribes might eaſily meet
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54691:9"/>
and joyn together, when oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

And, that theſe Tribes did (not long

by their own deſires, as diſdaining

            <p>A Second Reaſon is,<note place="margin">From the Appellation of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> Cities.</note> From the

<hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Tartar</hi> Cities which yet
are extant, have many of them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54691:10"/>
the ſame names, as had thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Towns and Cities, which were
inhabited by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> while
they enjoyed their own Country.
Their Metropolis or chief City
(though now deformed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ruins) is <hi>Samarchian,</hi> which
hath many Monuments of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as they report who have been
there) where the great <hi>Tamerlain,</hi>
who led about in a Golden Chain
the Turkiſh Emperor called <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet,</hi>
had his Seat and place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence.
And how little differing
is <hi>Samarchian</hi> from <hi>Samaria,</hi> the
chief City of theſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and
their Seat, and Chamber of their
Kings? onely differing in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
a thing uſual in proper
names of Men or Citys, when
they are pronounced in divers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.
For what differs the name
of <hi>Londres,</hi> as it is termined by the
<hi>French,</hi> from this of <hi>London;</hi> or
the Town of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> from that
of <hi>Anverſe;</hi> or <hi>Edenborough,</hi> from

may be obſerved in the proper
names of men and women, both
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54691:10"/>
in the front and firſt ſylable, and
termination of the name, For what
conſonance hath <hi>Maria,</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamne</hi>
with that <hi>Miriam</hi> of the

with the <hi>Scottiſh Jamy,</hi> with the
<hi>French Jaimes,</hi> or the <hi>Latine Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob?</hi>
and yet theſe names are all
one. They have beſides, the Mount
<hi>Tabor,</hi> a great Town and well
fenced with a ſtrong Fort, ſcituate
upon a high Hill, nothing differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſorm or name from the Mount
<hi>Tabor</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo often
mentioned in the Scriptures. They

They have <hi>Corazen</hi> the great

of <hi>Tartar</hi> Cities with

ſometime tranſplanted by the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians,

ſyrians,</hi> doth plainly ſhew, that
the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> People have been
there, and given the names unto
theſe Cities, as the manner is in all
places, for the remembrance of
their Countrys and dwelling places
from whence they came, or of the
Planters, or firſt Founders of the
Colonies; as of <hi>Galatia</hi> by the

            <p>1. Becauſe the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi>

who are to paſs over <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi>

therefore is literally underſtood of

we affirm to be the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Becauſe theſe 10 Tribes or
Hoords of <hi>Tartars,</hi> from the Iſle of
<hi>Patmos,</hi> where <hi>John</hi> wrote, are an
Oriental, or Eaſtern people on the
Eaſt and North-Eaſt of the <hi>Caſpian,</hi>

South and South-Weſt towards <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. From the ſcituation of the

can no way paſs out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54691:16"/>

who have many Kings, to wit, as

(beſide their Emperor the great
<hi>Cham,</hi> whom they eſteem above the
dignity of a King) being a Prince
or Sovereign Lord over all his
Tribes. To which purpoſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Eſdras</hi> (whom I alledge not
as authentick to confirm matters
of faith and doctrine, but to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
as a ſtory, this holy prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which is here more obſcurely
ſet down by the Apoſtle) inferreth
the Angel thus expounding his
Night-viſion of things to come in
the latter time. <q>That which thou
ſaweſt,, to wit the man (who is
there called the Son of God) to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gather
to him another multitude
of more peaceable and quiet peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
are the ten Tribes who were
carried Captives out of their Land
in the time of <hi>Oſeas</hi> King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
whom <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> King of
<hi>Aſſur</hi> carried beyond the River
<hi>Euphrates,</hi> ſo were they brought
to another Land; But they took
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54691:17"/>
this counſel among themſelves,
that they would leave the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Heathen, and go
into a farther Country, where
never man had dwelt before;
(whereby it ſeems that he means the
Country which lyes betwixt the
<hi>Bacualensky,</hi> and Northern Seas,
which is poſſeſſed by the <hi>Tartars.</hi>)
And a little after, (<hi>v.</hi> 26.) Then
dwelt they there till the latter
time, but when they ſhall come
forth again, the moſt High ſhall
hold faſt the ſprings of the River,
(to wit, <hi>Euphrates</hi>) that they may
paſs through, therefore ſaweſt thou
the multitude peaceably.</q> Where
he tells that this return of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
people over <hi>Euphrates</hi> towards
their Country, in the latter times
is meant of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> 10 Tribes,
who were carried Captive by the
<hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who, after the manner
of that people, would live alone,
not commixed with other Nations,
and therefore brake out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
where they were placed
by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and went from
thence to a remote and inward
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54691:17"/>
try, (as is <hi>Tartaria</hi>) from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of other men; which cannot
be ſaid of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tribes, who
notwithſtanding by the example of
thoſe other Tribes ſhall be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to joyn together, and to
march likewiſe out of the places
where now they are, towards the
Country of <hi>Judea,</hi> without any
impeachment, or reſiſtance of other
Nations. As for the manner of
their paſſing over the ſaid River,
whether it ſhall be actual drying
of the River, or a removing of all
impediments, which may ſtop or
hinder their ſpeedy paſſage in this
their expedition towards their
Country, I will not argue it at
this time. That it ſhall be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
exiccation of the River, with
no leſs miracle, then the drying
up of the Red Sea, or River <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
when they paſſed towards the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that ſo this work
of God, which ſhall be famous in
all the World, even the reſtoring
of this people, may be obſerved by
other Nations, with great reaſon and
probability is affirmed by <hi>Th.

OF

               <hi>By</hi> S. L.</byline>
            <p>THIS Diſcourſe may be
divided into 4 partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
1. Whether the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the ancient
and true proprietors of the Land
of <hi>Canaan</hi> (by Gods immediate
promiſe, donation, and their own
actual poſſeſſion) were driv'n.
2. Where probably they reſide at
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54691:19"/>
this day,. 3. Whether they ſhall
return to their ancient propriety
in that Land, which is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
part of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
4. When ſhall be the time
of their reſtitution.</p>
            <p>As to this diſquiſition I ſhall
firſt conſider the ſtate of the ten
Tribes, and then glance upon the
two Tribes, remaining in the Land
for a while after the diſperſion of
the former.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Ten Tribes.</head>
               <p>Here I ſhall not be anxious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the numbring of the 10 Tribes.
Whither after their firſt ſeceſſion
from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> part of
them did remain with <hi>Judah,</hi> that
is, whether <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Dan</hi> (whoſe
Lands were parcelled out of the
great territory of <hi>Judah,</hi> and lay
Weſt of that Tribe towards the
midland Sea) did continue within
the bounds of the Kingdom of
<hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to that, we muſt herein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce,
that holy Scripture tells
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54691:19"/>
us that 10 Tribes did revolt from
<hi>Rehoboam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 K. 11. 31, 35.</note> the Son of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
though its certain, that ſeveral out
of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 11. 16.</note> came up
after the Prieſts to ſacrifice to the
Lord God of their Fathers at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
and 'tis very probable
from their religious inclination to
pure worſhip,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 9.</note> and the hazard of
returning, that many might ſit
down and live under the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Judah.</hi> We ſhall then take
in the whole Kingdom of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
or as commonly called, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under the name
and title of the 10 Tribes in this
diſquiſition; becauſe made up of far
the greater part of both the Tribes
and people, and alſo the quantity
of Land and poſſeſſions. This
Kingdom firſt raiſed to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ſtate and dignity by <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> was ſcituate in
the North of <hi>Judah,</hi> and had at

Then <hi>Tirzah,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place let's enquire,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54691:20"/>
whither theſe 10 Tribes were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Captive.</p>
               <p>For anſwer to this query, we
find in ſacred Page that the Land
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was thrice aſſaulted by
the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Emperors.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt. impreſs made upon that
Country, was by <hi>Pul,</hi> poſſibly
<hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> as might be ſpoken
to in reference to <hi>Nineve,</hi> and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Chronology. This was acted
in the Reign of <hi>Menahem,</hi> who
payd to him a 1000 Talents of
Silver, and diverted him from any
further attempts, only that the
rod of Gods anger was ſhaken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Land.</p>
               <p>The Second inrode was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by <hi>Tiglath-Peleſer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Digloth <hi>Tigris.</hi>
                  </note> who ſeems
to be the ſame with <hi>Beleſis</hi> the

and all the Land of</hi> Napthali,<note place="margin">2 K. 15. 29.</note>
                  <hi>and carried the People Captive to</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria.
He tranſported the <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,

of</hi> Manaſſes,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 5. 26.</note> on the Eaſt of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54691:20"/>
unto</hi> Halak, <hi>and</hi> Habor, <hi>and</hi>
Hara, <hi>and to the River</hi> Gozan. So
that in the Book of Kings we find
the Country mentioned at large,
and in <hi>Chronicles</hi> the particular
places to which they were convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The 3d. and laſt aggreſs was

by <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Greek Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
p. 46.<note place="margin">2 K. 17. 6. 18. 11.</note> who in the 9th of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhea</hi>
ſweeped the Land of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,

<hi>and into the Cities of the</hi>

               <p>Hence we may obſerve in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,

               </p>
               <p>To which it may be anſwered,<note place="margin">A.</note>
that the text about the <hi>Ark</hi> muſt
be conſidered with analogy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that all the Veſſels of the

So that though the <hi>Ark</hi>

its removal among the other coſtly

them there, without any notice of

them to be carried thither, and

               <p>But not to tranſcribe any more,

Wherefore whatever parcels of
thoſe Tribes might come up out of
<hi>Media</hi> at the return of <hi>Judah,</hi>
from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, doth
no ways ariſe to the dignity and
luſtre of thoſe prohecies, which

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> Theſe Tribes are to return

<hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhall be gathered together

of the intermiſſion of government,

where that godly Prince was ſlain.
That we may be further aſſured of
the right application of theſe and
the like Prophecies, the Spirit of
God is a moſt clear witneſs by the
Mouth of Holy <hi>Paul,</hi> applying
two Texts of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to this purpoſe.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 26, 27. Iſ. 27. 9. and 59. 20.</note>
One, That Gods great deſign by all
the afflictions of his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is to
purge iniquity, and take away their
ſin. Then <hi>In that day</hi> he will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> One, by
One,<note place="margin">v. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> Every one to a man out
of their Captivity from <hi>Aſſyria, and
they ſhall worſhip the Lord in the
Holy Mountain at</hi> Jeruſalem. The
other more eſpecially, that <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
ſhall come to</hi> Zion, <hi>and to them
that turn from tranſgreſſion in</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob:
Now ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> this is the
Myſtery, both as to the matter and
time, that though blindne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſs or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of heart is happened in part to
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet that ſhall endure no
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54691:38"/>
longer then till the Fulneſs of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall come in, that is till
their full time be accompliſhed ſo
long to continue as the utter deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
ſhall laſt: Then all <hi>Iſrael</hi>
ſhall be ſaved:<note place="margin">Iſ. 6. 10. 2 Cor. 3. 16. <hi>Paraeus p.</hi> 221. in Rom.</note> Then this Veil ſhall
be taken away, and their hearts tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Lord. The Firſt Fruits
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were reaped in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
days, but the full Harveſt, the
Joyful Day of their full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Converſion ſhall not be till
the days of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be come to
a period:<note place="margin">John 11. 52.</note> then the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> will <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into one the Children of God that
were ſcattered abroad.</hi> Let us then
re-aſſume the Argument, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude:
That ſince the Return of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
is to be attended with a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Converſion to the Goſpel;
And ſince it hath never yet been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
from the time of their
Diſperſion, or the ſetting out of
thoſe Splendid Prophecies; that it
ſtill remains to be fulfilled to the joy
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the comfort of all the
Church, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to
be united in one Flock, under one
Shepherd, and to the honour of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54691:39"/>
Mercy, which in the latter
days will ſhine out from the ſecond
Mount <hi>Paran,</hi> when God will ride
upon his Horſes and Chariots of
Salvation. For ſo I underſtand both
that verſe,<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 8. See <hi>Rivet</hi> on Hoſ. 8. 8. &amp;c.</note> and the whole third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in the future tenſe,
as a Prophecy of the glorious times
of the latter day, as yet remaining
to be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>3. The Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are to
return into their own Land,<note place="margin">3. Arg. Ezek. 38. and 39.</note> at, or
about the time of the Deſtruction
of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> But
the Ruine and Extirpation of thoſe
Nations, ſignified by <hi>Gog, &amp;c.</hi> as
yet reſts under the conduct of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to be fulfilled, and therefore
thoſe Tribes were never yet reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their glorious State, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
ſtill to be effected in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
day. Who theſe People are
that ſhall come like Stormes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Mountains of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I ſhall
not here ſtand to diſcuſs, but reſt
with the general apprehenſion of
many learned, that they denote the
<hi>Turks,</hi> who came Originally from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54691:39"/>

do I ſee how any rational man can
make any proper and genuine ſenſe
of the Prophets, nor deduce any
conſequencies from them, but ſuch
as tend to confirm what we have
treated on in ſeveral arguments, to
prove and demonſtrate that there
is a great glory coming on, for the
Church to enjoy <hi>in the latter day.</hi>
I ſhall for a <hi>Coronis</hi> to the foreſaid
deductions, preſent ſome Srciptures
of the Old and New Teſtament in
their orderly ſeries, reflecting
ſtrongly upon this Truth, which
would require ſome Interpretation,
and then might lye fair for applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to this point of the Reſtitution
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the wonderful ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor

how far further the Church ſhall
bear ſway among the Heathen from
Pole to Pole, is not for us diſtinctly
to amplifie, till holy Scripture doth
enable us by future manifeſtations

               <p>But as to the different Regiſters,

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54691:51"/>
the Texts treat of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies
of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> yet
as an Hiſtorian, ſo might the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
relate what he found in this or
that Regiſter. If the Rowles were
mutilous or careleſly kept, and the
orders of names inverted and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
yet the Sacred Hiſtorian (<hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
fidem</hi>) wrongs not the truth,
when he faithfully relates what he
ſound, though the Regiſter might
be faulty: and thus the Evangeliſt
<hi>Luke</hi> giving in a Catalogue of our

what he ſet down was, <gap reason="foreign">

diſſent from the Body of the Church

more probable, that the Spirit of

               <p>I might therefore refer to the

Subject, and intreat them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the 8 arguments which I have
urged from Scripture. But I ſhall
add a few reflections more upon
this point, and draw toward an
end.</p>
               <p>1. Theſe promiſes about <hi>Iſraels</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Reſtoration, cannot be genuinely
interpreted of a ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Nations; ſince there is
a manifeſt diſtinction between <hi>Iſrael</hi>
and the Nations in many of thoſe
promiſes,<note place="margin">Act. 26. 7 Rom. 11. 25.</note> which are before cited
and applied ſo by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe the Spirit of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
ſeems to ſpeak of, and aſſign ſome
ſpecial comfort and joy to natural
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> under their devaſtations and
diſperſions, as to a diſtinct and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Nation; which in due time
is to be recalled out of thoſe plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and miſeries. Now what ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
comfort can ariſe as to <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:54691:55"/>
diſtinct from other Nations, if ſuch
Promiſes are to be underſtood of a
ſpiritual and myſtical <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſ. 19. 25. Deut. 32. 43.</note> as that
in <hi>Iſaiah; Bleſſed be Egypt and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
and Aſſyria my People. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Rejoyce O Nations with my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Becauſe the glory of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is expreſly declared to be
ſuper-eminent and tranſcendent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other Nations, both for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and temporal felicity; and
that all Nations ſhall come up,
that is, by Embaſſadors and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
bringing Preſents to them. The
Kings of the Nations ſhall bring in
their glory thither, and ſhall walk
in the ſame ſpiritual light, as the
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Zechary</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
diſtinctly mention it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Thoſe ſweet and ample Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are ſometimes mentioned, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
applicable to that Nation
which pierced him.<note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas 'tis ſaid that under
Goſpel days, there is no priviledge
aſſerted to the <hi>Jews</hi> more than to the
<hi>Gentiles:</hi> We muſt underſtand as
to the Doctrine of Faith and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54691:55"/>
Salvation, they are all one in
Chriſt Jeſus: Nor ought any to
deem, that any of their old Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sacrifices and Services ſhall be
introduced into Gods Worſhip at
their Reſtitution; for they are all
finally abrogated, and the Veil of
the Temple rent in twain: So that
thoſe laſt ſplendid Chapters in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi>
do only ſet forth Goſpel and
Evangelical Ordinances under the
ancient Figures.</p>
               <p>5. Theſe great Promiſes are in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
places ſet down with a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction
to their releaſe from their
firſt Captivity:<note place="margin">Pſ. 68. 22.</note> as when the Lord
ſays, <hi>I will bring my People again
from Baſhan, and again from the
depths of the Sea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſ. 11. 11.</note> and that he <hi>will
ſet his hand again the ſecond time to
deliver his People,</hi> &amp;c. Now if the
firſt Captivity were literal, and the
firſt releaſe from <hi>Babylon</hi> was lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
then there is a ſecond releaſe to
be fulfilled in the like tenor.</p>
               <p>6. It may be argued alſo from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
the diſtinctneſs of the times of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi>
Redemption, beſides the time
of the reſtoration of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:54691:56"/>
from their ſpiritual Captivity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Antichriſt, and under the <hi>Turk,</hi>
which may appear more clearly
from what I hope to ſpeak as to the
diſtinct time of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Deliverance
before the cloſe of this Tract.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. We may infer this National
Reſtitution of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from thoſe
Texts which mention many diſtinct
places of their ſcatterings,<note place="margin">I. 11. 11.</note> as in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi>
or <hi>Perſia,</hi> in <hi>Aſſyria, Javan</hi> and
the Iſlands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whence as
from all Quarters of the Earth they
ſhall be reduced to their own Land.
Now it ſeems very incongruous to
aſſign a myſtical denomination to
thoſe Countries and Cities of their
various diſperſions. Such ſtrange
and wonderful ſcatterings, as they,
verify the ancient Prophecies; ſo
have they happened to no other
Nation under the whole Heaven
that we can evidence: wherefore
from all theſe conſiderations it ſeems
very proper that there is ſome great
and ſpecial glory, both in ſpiritual
and temporal concernments, which
ſhall accrue to National <hi>Iſrael, in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54691:56"/>
the latter days, beyond the glory of
their Anceſtors.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 11.</note> Wherefore ſome
have made this as unto the <hi>Jews</hi>
a notable mark,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 34.</note> ſince they are by
divine Providence kept diſtinct from
all other Nations in the midſt of
their diſperſions. This Nation ſhall
not paſs away,<note place="margin">Terry p. 130.</note> but is preſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſome notable deſign of God
for their good and welfare <hi>in the
latter day:</hi> for though their ſtrange
and admirable diſjoyntings and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrings
ly incumbent as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
curſe npon them;<note place="margin">Jer. 24. 9.</note> yet ſhall it
in the end be turned into a glorious
bleſſing. At which time when the
Lord ſhall have formed his work
upon <hi>Zion,</hi> and delivered the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>
Churches into their glorious
liberty, and reſtored <hi>Iſrael</hi> to their
own Land, to worſhip our bleſſed
Lord according to his Goſpel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
in <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s Land, then
will the times of bleſſedneſs ſhine
forth in their radiant luſtre, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
of by holy <hi>Doniel</hi> the man
of deſires,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.</note> and thoſe 1000 years fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
to the Church treated of by
the beloved Diſciple.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54691:57"/>
Of theſe bleſſed times the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church had great and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
knowledge, as being near to the
Apoſtolical times and information.
Let me give in ſome evidences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

ſignally to be remembred, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo very expreſs in this point of
the glorious liberty of the Church
for a 1000 years <hi>in the latter days;</hi>
that he reckons them among the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts</hi>
and wicked Hereticks of his
time, who denied it: For, although
<hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Text be corruptly read in

<hi>Chriſtians in all

                  <hi>ſo ſhall be the days of my People,</hi> as
he reads the 22 verſe, and thus
gloſſes upon it: <hi>We underſtand that

and ſobriety: both in reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Judicious in preceding Ages,
as likewiſe to the obſcurity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical

carnal Mockers, that cry out like

who ſeems not likely to paſs

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54691:61"/>
drawing on toward their conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that theſe bleſſed times are
not far off. Let it ſuffice to give
in ſome general notes and reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on what Scripture hath hinted,
for exerciſe of induſtry and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt more general note
of the time, may be gathered from
the deſtruction of the <hi>Turk;</hi> who
by ſome learned Expoſitors is
thought to be ſignified by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Wo-Trumpet. But this 2d
Trumpet expires as to its Warlike
Alarums by and by,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 14</note> upon the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Witneſſes. Now the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire is one great remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
or ſtop to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi>
inhabitation in their ancient
Territorys, and ſeems upon good
and probable grounds to be the <hi>Gog</hi>
and <hi>Magog</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who is to be
deſtroyed upon the Mountains of
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> If then, we can but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
ſtate the finiſhing of the 2d
Trumpet, we may in ſome latitude
attain the times of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Return,
whereof in the third Note.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:54691:61"/>
2. The ſecond general note, may
be taken from the time of the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out of the 6th Vial upon <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,
i. e.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 16. 12</note> upon the <hi>Turkiſh Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
whoſe frontire Cities ly upon
that River; <hi>that the way of the Kings
of the Eaſt may be prepared, i. e.</hi> the
ten <hi>Tartarian</hi> Princes who are the
race of the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> near
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, as the learned <hi>Dr.
Fletcher</hi> in his preceding Treatiſe
hath endeavoured to clear. Now
could we evidently ſtate the time
of the commencement of the Vials, &amp;
the duration of each as to the time
of their pouring out, we might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to ſome evidence in this point.
Thus far I humbly conceive that
none of the Vials are yet poured
out, nor will be till the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Witneſſes is paſt, and
ſeem to be contained under the 3d
Wo-Trumpet:<note place="margin">v. 1.</note> For the 7 Angels
with the 7 laſt Plagues, come not
out of the Temple till it be opened,
and the Ark of the Teſtimony, ſeen
in the manifeſtation of pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 19.</note> But the Temple is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54691:62"/>
not opened till after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Witneſſes, and the third
Wo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſounding in the World, when
the Witneſſes ſhall be riſen, and the
Kingdoms of the World begin more
viſibly to become the Kingdoms of
Chriſt, and the Nations begin to
fume with anger at he approach of
the Wrath of God, then may we
expect the effuſion of the Vials in
their diſtinct order.</p>
               <p>The third note, is more preciſe
and expreſs, and may be collected
from the time of the duration of
the second Wo in its greateſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and ſplendor:<note place="margin">Rev. 9. 15.</note> For the 200000
<hi>Euphratean</hi> Horſe men are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for an hour,<note place="margin">1 y.—360 1. m. 030 1d. 1 1 h. 0 391.</note> a day, a month and
a year; which if it be calculated
from the grandeur of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Family, forcing their inroads upon
the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, <hi>Anno</hi> 1300
and ſo forwards; this computation
hands us to the year 1691, or there
abouts: Or if we ſhould calculate
the 2300 years of the <hi>Palmoni,</hi> from
the taking away the daily Sacrifice
by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> at the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54691:62"/>
of the firſt Temple, unto the
renovation of pure Worſhip in the
latter days; this conſideration will
lead us to the year of our Lord
1712, or thereabouts, as I have
mentioned in a little Tract of the
Viſion of the Myrtle Grove in <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4.<note place="margin">4.</note> But the moſt appoſite and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
time which concerns <hi>Iſrael</hi> more
eſpecially when <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhall ſtand in
his lot at the end of the days is that
computation of the beloved Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
who lays the <hi>radix,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 11.</note> the root
or Epocha of the numeration of his
1290 years, from the taking away
the daily Sacrifice,<note place="margin">v. 1</note> and that at the
end of thoſe times <hi>his</hi> People ſhall
be delivered. But if you take it
from <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s or <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
or <hi>Titus,</hi> or <hi>Julian:</hi> the times
as to all thoſe roots will be expired,
and no deliverance accompliſhed,
and therefore we muſt take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more auſpicious and genuine
foundation for the decurrency of
this number, and moreover ſince
the ſame Prophet mentions <hi>the
time, times, and the half,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54691:63"/>
verſe, which is frequently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
both by <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> for
the duration of the laſt head of the
fourth Monarchy. I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that his 1290 years, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointly
initiate with <hi>John</hi>'s 1260,
inſomuch that they ſeem to point at
this, that 30 years after the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the power of the Papal
Empire, (for he may prolong his

                  </gap>
to do any great Exploits,
ſhall be finiſht) I ſay, 30 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we may expect the dry bones
in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to begin to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 7</note>
and by degrees, through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

their promiſed glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs:
for at firſt they may come
up from the ſeveral Corners of the
Earth, toward their own Land <hi>cum
animo ſacrificandi,</hi> with thoughts of
building the Temple, and reſtoring
their Old Worſhip; which never
will be, for God hath aboliſhed all
that pedagogy, in the ſuffering of
Chriſt, but they may come with
great expectation of a temporal
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54691:63"/>
glory under the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zech. 14. 2.</note> and when
they are at the height of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
they ſhall be moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
torn; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> taken, the
Houſes rifled, the Women raviſht,
and half carried out for a new Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity:<note place="margin">4.</note>
then will the Lord ſet his
feet upon the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> for
their deliverance:<note place="margin">Obad. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Then a Saviour
ſhall come upon Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>to judge
the Mount of</hi> Eſau, <hi>i. e.</hi> the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite

be the Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to repair to the connexed <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocha</hi>
of 1290 to initiate and begin
1260:<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 11.</note> we muſt infer, that ſince
all the forenamed roots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
are paſt, without deliverance
either to <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
or to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that we are to
ſpring another riſe, and that is
from the taking away of the Goſpel-Sacrifice
of pure Worſhip, by a
new <hi>Babilonian</hi> Monarch, by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Antiochus,</hi> by the grand An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
who ſetting in the Temple
of God, as God, hath introduced
moſt horrible pollutions and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54691:64"/>
in the Evangelical Worſhip.
Now this Prince of Sin, aroſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
together with the ten Kings,<note place="margin">Rev. 17. 12</note>
from the year 410, when <hi>Rome</hi> was
taken by <hi>Alaricus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 7, 8.</note> and continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
and waxing in his grandeur
and power till that was taken away,
which hindred his revelation in the
World, which was the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
But the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire drew
its laſt gaſp, and was finally and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
extirpated in the year 476,
Thus divine Providence doth uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perform its mighty works gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
by diſtinct intervals of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs:
which leads us to a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or compaſs of
years contained within the latitude
of 66, from the year 410 to 476
in which year <hi>Auguſtulus</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
So then, if ye add the 1260
years; we ariſe to 1736. About
which I am verily perſuaded that
the great Myſtery of the ruine of
Antichriſt will be amply manifeſt,
and viſible upon the face of the
earth: and foraſmuch as the ten
laſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> were rather <hi>Caeſarculi;</hi>
ſome appointed from the Eaſt, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54691:64"/>
ſome riſing out of their mutual
combuſtions, and that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Territory was exceedingly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht,
&amp; cut ſhort in <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Goths.</hi>
We may indeed look upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire as good as ruined at the
death of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, in
the year 455, which by connection
of the 1260 brings us to 1715: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which times the pre-conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire conducts to the expectation
of great devaſtations and confuſions
in the Papal. The fuller indagation
of theſe periods belonging to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
paper; I return to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and
<hi>Daniel</hi>'s computation of their times,
by adding 30 years more to theſe
1260 there with making up his 1290.
So that if the 1260 do finiſh about
1700 or 1715, or at utmoſt in
1736, then 30 years after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration,
and the great conflicts
with the Papal powers in the Weſt
will begin the ſtirs and commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
the <hi>Jews</hi> aud <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the
Eaſt; if then to 1736 we add 30
more, they reach to 1766, the
times of <hi>Iſraels</hi> gatherings from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54691:65"/>
their diſperſions and conflicts for
their Country with the Nations
and powers that may detain and
obſtruct them; which times of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
and perplexity are determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to laſt 45 years longer: which
anſwers in ſome meaſure to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical
remembrance of the time
from their ancient coming out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> till they were almoſt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
ſettled in moſt parts of the
Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> If then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne
theſe 45 years more to 1766
it produces 1811, for thoſe times
of happineſs to <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dar. 12. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>for bleſſed is

               <p>But how far further the finiſhing

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54691:65"/>
after the 1260 days of his

the three parts only ſhall remain

their laſt and principal enemy to
be 1260 years, and that we may

that theſe years are well nigh expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

But however they deal with Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
