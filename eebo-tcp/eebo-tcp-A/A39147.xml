            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>To praiſe the worthieſt of men,</l>
               <l>With whom, your ancient Heroes put</l>
               <l>In ballance, weigh not shell of Nut.</l>
               <l>As for great <hi>Hanlan</hi>'s reputation,</l>
               <l>We shall evince by demonſtration.</l>
               <l>Of them, let <hi>Jaſon</hi> firſt be nam'd,</l>
               <l>For clean conveyance ſo much fam'd.</l>
               <l>For whoſe each lock of Golden wooll,</l>
               <l>Bold <hi>Redmon</hi> has a thouſand ſtole.</l>
               <l>Nor did their owners ſcape ſo cheap,</l>
               <l>He often took both Fleece, and Sheep.</l>
               <l>Nay <hi>Mercury</hi> himſelf, though made</l>
               <l>A God, for his great skill i'th trade;</l>
               <l>Compar'd, would look like <hi>Picaroon</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To Firſt-Rate Ship, or Star to Moon.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Next <hi>Hercules,</hi> about whoſe Club</l>
               <l>Strange tales you tell, like thoſe of Tub:</l>
               <l>Would the unequal combat shun,</l>
               <l>O're-match'd by his dead doing Gun.</l>
               <l>For if with Blunderbuſs compar'd,</l>
               <l>Like all that met it, 'twoud have fear'd.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>The force of this <hi>Achilles</hi> hide</l>
               <l>Well tan'd as 'twas, wou'd ne'r abide.</l>
               <l>Shou'd luſty Blunder once aſſault him,</l>
               <l>In ſpight of Fate it would have maul'd him.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hector;</hi> that of the <hi>Greeks</hi> made ſpoyl,</l>
               <l>As you and <hi>Homer</hi> keep a coyl;</l>
               <l>Ne're bolder ſet upon his foes</l>
               <l>Than he, who told them to their noſe,</l>
               <l>You muſt deliver up your Purſe,</l>
               <l>Or by my Shoul you'l fare the worſe.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Which ſaid, if enemy ſeem'd ſtout,</l>
                  <l>Soon half a dozen balls flew out,</l>
                  <l>And ſtrait one Army fell to rout.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Which if our party no worſe far'd</l>

                  <l>Knew when to fight, when to retreat.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>In which no Mountains, Rocks, or Woods,</l>
               <l>Cou'd ſtop his courſe, nor Bogs, nor Floods;</l>
               <l>As oft he manifeſted, when</l>
               <l>Purſu'd by <hi>Floyd,</hi> and his ſix men.</l>
               <l>Shewing a pair of heels ſo light,</l>
               <l>That ſome miſtook it for plain flight.</l>
               <l>But they are much miſta'ne, alaſs!</l>
               <l>And chiefly in the Millers caſe:</l>
               <l>For though his men and he retir'd</l>
               <l>With ſpeed, after the Mill was fir'd;</l>
               <l>Yet none muſt think the <hi>Count</hi> wou'd run</l>
               <l>From one old Miller and his Son.</l>
               <l>Attribute then the haſte was made</l>
               <l>Only to fear of Ambuſcade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But death, although he ran ſo faſt,</l>
               <l>Has got the heels of him at laſt.</l>
               <l>For which, the tears are numberleſs</l>
               <l>That have been shed, as you may gueſs.</l>
               <l>But to his friends one comfort's left,</l>
               <l>Although he be of life bereft,</l>
               <l>He shan't partake the common fate;</l>
               <l>For neither <hi>Redmon</hi>'s limbs nor pate</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Shall under ſordid rubbish lye</l>
                  <l>Forgot, but shall be plac'd on high,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Where, if his shining Beard, and Hair,</l>
                  <l>Should like ſome new made Star appear,</l>
