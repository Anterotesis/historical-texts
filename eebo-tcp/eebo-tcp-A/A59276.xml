            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved, you ſee here what <hi>Job</hi> ſays of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yea <hi>Job,</hi> that holy Man; he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf to Cheeſe, yes, he doth you Sirs, he doth to Cheeſe like Cheeſe, <hi>Thou haſt curdled me or framed me.</hi> You know beloved, there are ſeveral ſorts of Cheeſe, and ſeveral ways of making Cheeſe, which you, and you, and you underſtand.</p>
            <p>

Like Cheeſe, yea, I ſay, like Cheeſe. You know when Cheeſe is firſt made, they take their Milk and let it ſtand till there come Cream upon it; if this Cream be not put into a clean Veſſel, or if Duſt fall into it, or if not handled with clean Hands, it will be bad Cheeſe, and ſtinking Cheeſe. The tryal of good Cheeſe is by toſting; if you put a piece of Cheeſe to the Fire, and if it does not drop, you, and you, and you, will ſay, 'tis bad hungry Cheeſe, and you will not care to eat it; no, no; but if it drop 'tis a ſign't was made by a good Huſwife.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou haſt crudled me like Cheeſe.</hi> The Soul of Man is Cheeſe, be it good or bad: Yea, yea, hearken to this, by good trout, if we believe <hi>Auguſtine</hi> or St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> too; and if ever the Soul hath Works in it, then it is like good Cheeſe, and will, and will drop at the Fire of Perſecution; it will not burn or ſtink as that old Rogues Soul, and that old <hi>Hogs</hi> Soul, that is there, and there, and there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou haſt crudled me like Cheeſe.</hi> You ſee what <hi>Job</hi> ſays is true; for he was good Cheeſe when all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell did bark at him and ſurrounded him, and that where his Wife tempted him, and I believe ſhe was handſom too, yet notwithſtanding them and hur, ſhe was ſtill good Cheeſe; He was no dry nor lean Cheeſe, for he dropt, yea, and had Grace in him too; but ſhew me a Man here that is ſuch Cheeſe as he was, any of you all: I deſire you, I deſire you, St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Acquitaine,</hi> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> St. <hi>Francis;</hi> thoſe were brave Men, not like you a pack of Rogues.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt formed me like Cheeſe; but hold, I ſay, I knew nothing of my preaching on this occaſion till

laſt night, and ſo having not timely notice, am forc'd to ſpeak leſs methodical, then otherwiſe I ſhould have done. But let me tell you in ſhort, the fire of Hell, is already burning for you if you do not have a care and make your ſelves good Cheeſe, that hath Fat and Moiſture in it; if you do not, the Devil take you all for Knaves and Rogues; and if you do not, you ſhall never go to Purgatory, <hi>no by God,</hi> you ſhall not; and what will you do then?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou haſt crudled me like Cheeſe.</hi> Laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> was St. <hi>Th— Day,</hi> a day that many Souls went <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>hook off the Chain of your Sin, if you had truly prayed to St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and freely given your Alms and Charity. But hold, hold I ſay, inſtead of that you went to the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and played at Cards, and did Swear, and Whore, and was Drunk: O damn'd Rogues!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou haſt crudled me like Cheeſe.</hi> Nay, more than all this, is an aggravation to this buſineſs that lies before on you: The next day being <hi>Gabuly</hi> Fair, ſome of you that I am ſure are hear at this time, ſtole a Bridle, a Bridle; I ſay, you ſtole. Such great Villains you are, that you care not from whom you ſteal; no, I ſay, not from whom: Nay, thou hadſt as lief ſteal from a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman as from a Clown. It is true, it is true, it is you, or you, or you, methinks is—Rogue. Does not he bluſh? Yes he does. Well, I ſhall find him out before I am much older, yea, and tye him with that Bridel my ſelf; then all ſhall be beaten: How like a damn'd Rogue he will look? I will take him, and put the Bitt in his

Mouth, and will ſet the Devil on his Back, and make him gallop with ſpur-galled Sides to Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou haſt crudled me like Cheeſe.</hi> And now beloved, it is time for me to ſpeak of the dead Gentlewoman that lyes before me here, I aſſure you, She was good Cheeſe, and good fat Cheeſe too; for many a drop has ſhe ſweat in going to <hi>Maſs:</hi> She was Threeſcore and ſeven years old, a good Gentlewoman of a good and noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; She had Cows and Sheep, and abundance of Horſes; She was no poor mellow Cheeſe; She never ſtole a Bridle, no, ſhe ſcorned it; and a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Woman ſhe was, that I have known her to go 5 miles to <hi>Maſs</hi> in a Froſty Morning, and a foot too, and yet ſhe had Horſes many; She kept a good Houſe, Bread and white Bread too, good Beer and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſquebah;</hi> for many a Dram have I had of her: And now let us fall on our Knees and pray for her Soul, ſaying,</p>
