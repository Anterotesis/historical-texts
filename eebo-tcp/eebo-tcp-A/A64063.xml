            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THE Subjects of this Kingdom have ever estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (amongst earthly blessings) the greatest to have consisted in the due administration of Justice, and therefore have on all occasions, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to their Princes for the confirmation, and right execution of their Lawes, the undoubted birth-right of every Englishman, the surest sanctuary any can take, and the strongest fortresse to protect the weakest.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. One of these ancient Customes is, That no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>England</hi> should be tryed or proceeded against <hi>nisi per legale judicium parium suorum,</hi> by his <hi>Peeres,</hi> that

            <p n="4">4. The Originall of this Custome in <hi>England</hi> is, for ought I know, as Ancient as any Triall in this Nation, no doubt long <note n="e" place="margin">See M. <hi>Pyrus</hi> Plea for the Lords, p. 29</note> before the Conquest, and since that time amongst the Lawes of <hi>Henry</hi> the First, (which were apparently for the most part drawn from the Customes <note n="f" place="margin">Leg.

According to this <hi>William de Brauce, Anno</hi> 1208. <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. Par. An. 1208. p. 227.</note> affirmed he was ready to satisfie the King, <hi>secundum judicium Curiae suae &amp; Baronum parium meorum,</hi> saith he, which was before <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> And this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome thus antient was at the first establishing of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> confirmed by expresse words in the 29. Chapter, and ever since taken as a great injurie when any hath otherwise been proceeded against. K. <hi>Iohn</hi> soon after the first grant of the <hi>Great Charter</hi> had recourse to the Pope against the Barons, who takes notice their tryall ought to be <note n="h" place="margin">Epist.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55560:3"/>
in the refusal he should leave the Kingdome, who with great resolution answered, he would not, <hi>sine judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio Parium suorum.</hi> So An. 1234. one of the reasons the Earl Mareschall gives for his taking up of armes was, that the King had severall times defied him, <note n="k" place="margin">M. Par. An. 1234. 22. Edit. 1640.</note> 
               <hi>cum semper,</hi> saith he, <hi>paratus essem in curia, juri parere, &amp; stare judicio parium meorum.</hi> By all which and many more Examples, which for brevity I here omit, it hath ever been held an undoubted injury, when any hath been proceeded against otherwise then <hi>per Pares,</hi> in such cases as were of their cognizance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some of the grounds of reason (for avoiding all partiality) on which this is built, I shall hereafter touch, though I can adde nothing to that is so learnedly done by other men: Yet it will not be here amisse to shew that this ancient and fundamentall way of proceeding, hath been never in any kind altered, but to the intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble detriment of the Subject. The cause of making the Statute of 3 <hi>Hen. 7. cap.</hi> 1. is said, to be for that <hi>by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall enormities in untrue demeanings of Sheriffs in making of Panells, and other untrue returns, little or nothing could be found, but divers were almost utterly destroyed, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore it doth enact, that certaine Councellors there named, <hi>should upon Bill or Information call before them the said misdoers, and examine them, and others by whom the truth might be knowne, and to punish such as they should find defective, after the forme and effect of Statutes thereof made, &amp;c.</hi> Yet <hi>how intoller able a burthen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, Censures, Decrees of the Star-chamber were found to the Subject, and the meanes to introduce an Arbitrary power,</hi> every mans memory reacheth to, and the Act for abolishing it, sufficiently declares.</p>
            <p>The 11 <hi>H. 7. cap.</hi> 3. authorized <hi>Iustices of Assize,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55560:4"/>
of the <hi>Peace</hi> upon a bare information (without any find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or presenting by verdict of twelve men) to heare and determine all offences, <hi>by colour of which Act, shaking</hi> (saith <note n="l" place="margin">Inst. 2. p. 51.</note> Sir <hi>Robert Coke) the Fundamentall Law, it is not credible what horrible oppressions were committed, &amp;c.</hi> I might here remember the 31 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 8. and the 34 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 23. which altering that ancient and knowne try all by Jury, were not long lived, being both repealed, the 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. cap. 12. nor could the King by them work that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation he expected. And whereas it is objected, There must somewhere be an Arbitrary power. I grant, some must judge, whether Laws to be made are for the good government of a Common-wealth, &amp; that is the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not in the executing of them: For <note n="m" place="margin">Inst. 4. p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Cum leges institutae fuerint, non erit liberum arbitrium judicare de ipsis, sed oportebit ipsum judicare de ipsas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Under this impartiall way of distributing equall justice to all men (in receiving which certaine it is reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the highest Duke should be levell with the lowest beggar, and is for ought I know the chiefest Levelling aymed at the Subjects of England have enjoyed great Peace and happynesse, ever strugling against the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of any arbitrary power whatsoever. But now of late when we are freed of the Star-chamber, &amp;c. there is an opinion raised by some Grandees who are feared to aime at an Arbitrary power, to carry on their designes, that the Lords, without any presentment upon Oath, or tryall by Iury, may upon a bare information, and examining of certaine Witnesses, proceed against any Commoner whatsoever, and that to deny this, or not submit unto them, is a breach of the Priviledge of the House of Peeres: And a great Lawyer of late hath writ a Tract to justifie their Sentencing, Fining, and Imprisoning any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55560:4"/>
Commoner, and handling all who refuse to answer to them, and by pen defend their so <note n="n" place="margin">M. <hi>Pryns</hi> plea for the Lords, pag. 18, 30, 36, 45.</note> doing, as contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their authority, ignorant, sottish Sectaries, illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Ignoramus's,</hi> altogether unacquainted with our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories and Records, &amp;c. To which I must needs say, (to answer once for all) that this is not a sincere way of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the matter in question, to make the world beleeve there are none but such as contemne the authority of Parliament, ignorant persons, and the like, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this: when I dare boldly say, of such as have stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, and understand the question, foure parts of five are of that opinion. And himselfe, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. holds their indubitable right of Judicature of Commoners to be but in extraordinary cases of <hi>Treason, Felony, Trespasse,</hi> and <hi>Misdemeanors,</hi> tryable onely in Parliament; which, if he shall be pleased to enumerate, what they are that cannot elsewhere be tryed, I shall not much differ with him, but that the tryall of such offences might be proper for Parliament, but such I confesse I know none. And to make that a crime, which no knowne Law calls a crime, is against the Apostles definition of one, <hi>Sinne is the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 4. Rom. 7. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Transgression of the Law,</hi> and againe, <hi>I had not knowne sinne but by the Law.</hi> It is likewise against the Lawes of this Land.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Before I passe farther, it will not be amisse to agree upon the Question, which is not, Whether upon the Petition of the Commons, and that passing the Lords House, the King assenting to it, a Commoner may not be condemned, it being indeed then an Act of Parliament, such were those of 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. against <hi>Richard Lions, William Ellis, &amp;c.</hi> which were confirmed by the King at <hi>Eltham.</hi> Neither if the King and Lords (which I neither affirme, nor deny) can censure in some cases a man according to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55560:5"/>
Law, doth it therefore follow the Lords alone can cause a Commoner to be fined, imprisoned, or executed?

            <p>Neither do I impugn, but that their opinion is of great Authority in point of Law; every circumstance rightly considered, before their delivering of it, of which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted one I conceive to be, the knowing what the Law is, by the Judges, or other, who best understand the thing in question, for if otherwise, it is contrary to sense, to imagine a few Lords (of whom, not many are usually skilled in the Lawes, and being out of the House, are but like other men) should within those walls, as it were by inspiration, be the supreame Judicature of the Realme.

            <p>But the Question is, whether the Lords alone, upon a bare Information (for a Triall by Jury they use not, nor ever did, to my knowledge, without the King) can Try and Censure any Commoner to his Detriment, either in his Person or Estate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55560:7"/>
is punishable by Law, and ought to be Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in His Majesties ordinary Courts of Justice. The Statute of <hi>Marlebridge</hi> provides, <hi>quod tam majores</hi>

            </p>
            <p>All this hath no colour out of the Record, or practice of other times; and it being certain, there was then Crime but onely <hi>Treason</hi> mentioned in that <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Protestation,</hi> as he calls it, why is it not as well

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55560:8"/>
leave to speak,</hi> such being the frailty of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that <hi>laesa patientia fit furor.</hi> Neither are they alone involved in the case, There is a noble Knight, and four grave Aldermen, who have been Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in one of the famous Cities of Europe, who all of them have put out their Protestations in Print, which he found perhaps, more difficult to confute, then to neglect.</p>
            <p>But for <hi>their refusing to Answer, and contemning the Lords Authority to their faces at the Bar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I must needes say, that for my part, I did never hear that refusing to Answer in a Court, and demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the excesses of any Court, was ever reputed a Contempt of the lawfull jurisdiction of that Court: we all remember, when certaine Gentlemen refused to Answer in the Star-chamber, and pleaded against the Jurisdiction of that Court, Yet neither the King nor the Lords excepted against their so doing; And in the end, their demurrer was allowed: It is no contempt to affirme a Court hath not Authority in an especiall case, that is to be determined by the Law, to which every man is to submit: And in a case of Imprisonment, without any limitation of time, certainely the Law ought be very clear that deprives a free-subject of that liberty, is so much to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: And if a Subject may not demurre to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of any Court, every Court may enlarge it's Jurisdiction, and pretend what dormant Rules and Priviledges it pleaseth, upon all occasions, and become a faction of Tyrants over the People, they being disabled to defend themselves from such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, and demurre to their Jurisdictions when they exceede their limits: A Demurrer is a Dilatory plea, not a contempt.</p>

10. For their <hi>appealing from their Iudicature in case of breach of Priviledge, of which themselves alone, and no others are, or can be Iudges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, the thing now in Question is, whether they have a Priviledge to Judge Commoners: It is said in Master Justice <note n="u" place="margin">pag. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Huttons</hi> Argument, that every Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the King, containes in it self, matter of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, (and by consequence, is not against any esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Law;) So may I say of the Priviledges of either House, that they are such as are not against any Statute Law: And that the continuall practice of all Ages hath made known to the world, but more to themselves, and therefore they are the Judges of them: But if a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be of their Priviledges, or it be doubtfull whether they can doe a thing or not. Their Judgement is not to be received, <hi>tanquam ex tripode,</hi> they delivering it not by Inspiration, but by Inquisition; and therefore are bound to certifie themselves by all humane meanes whatsoever, of the truth of every circumstance, as by hearing the Kings Learned Councell; the opinion of Judges, Presidents of former Parliaments, Practice of other Courts in the like cases, and such like.</p>
            <p>And this was the manner of their proceedings, <note n="x" place="margin">Parl. apud <hi>Reding,</hi> 32 H. 6. n. 27. &amp;c.</note> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. when, though the Justices after mature deliberation had among themselves, resolved they ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Priviledges of the High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Yet the chief Justice shewed, the example of other Courts, on which they grounded their Sentence according to Law: And yet that case was in the point of their Speaker, a principall Member of the Commons, and of a difference between him and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> one too of the House of Lords. Neither may they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Priviledges farther then the Law warrants; to

               <hi>Lords in this, or future Parliaments to give Iudgement against Commoners in other Cases of Felony and Treason, even without Commons.</hi>

            <p>And thus I have answered all his Exceptions against this Law. Onely where he makes in so few lines two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations against such as hold this a Law, and think to justifie themselves by it, <hi>of shewing their non-sence rather then reason and Law, their injudiciousnesse and folly, rather then justification, &amp;c.</hi> I am forced to reply, a person of Integrity and Judgement, ought not with such sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse raise envyagainst any that defend themselves by

Law. <hi>Nonsence, Folly, and Injudiciousnesse</hi> are words of relation, and that which seemes Nonsence to him, may be of great weight in others Judgement. But if any should make an <hi>Appeal,</hi> whether to affirme (with these men) this is a Law made in pursuance of the Common right of the Realm, and in affirmation of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is neerer <hi>Nonsence</hi> then to call that a <hi>Protestation</hi> (which by its own nature imports some disagreeing) is in plaine words stiled an <hi>Agreement</hi> or nigher <hi>Folly,</hi> then the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that to have past without the Kings Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, he is expresly said to have assented unto: or more <hi>Injudicious</hi> then to think the Commons not to have been parties to what was agreed in full Parliament, or lesse <hi>Reason</hi> then to say, that Law not to barre the Lords in future, which clearly provides they should never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after have power to judge a Commoner; I do not know, I say, (if any should thus appeal) who could be met with, would not think this Gentlemans Interpretation farther off reason, then the very letter of the Law: <hi>Interpretari le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, est dare rationabilem intellectum sive sensum praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientis, &amp; praecepti.</hi> Neither could he any way tearme <note place="margin">Vide pag. 66.</note> this <hi>raising, murmuring,</hi> or <hi>playing the Bethlehem;</hi> thus to have his own words, retorted on him: for my part, I am confident the Gentleman would never have alleag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Record, and many other Authorities I have met with in his workes, had he thought any would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the truth of his sayings, or had he any other way to weaken what must of necessity be inferred from them, but by such viperine glosses. And now it will not be unfit to see this (as it is undoubtedly a Law) how it hath been practist on all occasions, in which he is so confident there is hundreds of Presidents to the contrary of what is pretended by it, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man (especially claiming

There was a great complaint in Parliament against the Major, Baylifs, and Cominaltee of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for some complyance in a late commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the University; the Commons of that Town in their defence, by their Councell plead against the Jurisdiction of the Court, <hi>Que ceste Court n'ent doit avoir coniscance ne Iurisdiction:</hi> The Lords moved, <note place="margin">num. 57.</note> affirme, <hi>if they will give no other Answer, they will proceed against them, as men that know not what to say.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the end a middle course is taken. The Major and Citizens submit themselves to the Kings Ordinance, touching onely their <hi>Franchises,</hi> by vertue of which submission, the King, by the assent of the Lords, seized the Franchises of the said Town: And in the end, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Chancellor and Schollers, the cognizance and punishment of defaults, in the Assize of Bread, Wine and Beer, and of Flesh, Fish, &amp;c. And the rest of all the Franchises bestowed on the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Bayliffes</hi> againe: This Ordinance gave no content to the Commonalty there, who often molested the Schollars, indicting them on true, and sometimes on feined pretences. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Chancellor and Schollars, about 7 yeares after, <note place="margin">Rot.

            <p n="14">14. And to speak seriously, if the Lords may Try a Commoner, they may Judge any mans title to his Lands, for no Law limiting the extent of their power, but that being Arbitrary, it may reach to all causes whithersoever they will stretch it, and so <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall sit quiet; And the Subject of <hi>England</hi> hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired an illimited power, no, not in the two Houses, and have therefore moderated Parliaments, that they should not subvert the Lawes of the Land.

Onely touching the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of the Lords, it is apparent, they then had an opinion, the King would have tryed him a Lord by the Judges, without them who were his Peeres: And for the Kings giving Judgement against <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Thomas Percy,</hi> he well knowes there was no person then Judged, or brought into Judgement, onely an opinion of the King and Lords delivered upon a desire of the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterbury:</hi> who conceived himself and the <hi>Duke of York</hi> in some suspition of having adhered to <hi>Hotspur,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> whom the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (then newly cleared by them) did free, from having had any complyance with them. Yet so as the King and Lords did affirme the warre formerly raised by them should be held Treason. So indeed judgeing no man, but delivering an opinion, that a War raised by two, whereof one was slaine in Fight, the other beheaded the next day at <hi>Shrewesbury,</hi> should be held Treason, of which there was little que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>His next President is that of <hi>Weston</hi> and <hi>Gomenis,</hi> to <note place="margin">pag. 41. 42.</note>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55560:16"/>
which, though I have answered before, <hi>nu.</hi> 15. in the case of <hi>Hall,</hi> their offences having been committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, and therefore not Tryable by an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way in <hi>England,</hi> and now taken away by Statute: Yet it is apparent, that Judgement was an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, passing at the request of the Commons, by the assent of the Lords, and stopt till the King could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p n="20">20. His next is, that of <hi>Alice Perers, against whom Iudgement of Banishment, and forfeiture of Land, was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 42.</note> 
               <hi>given by the Lords without the King or Commons.</hi> This is the onely President that hath most colour of truth, and to his purpose in all his Book: And whether she a person that laboured then under the publique hate, for her many leud carriages, might not have somewhat acted against her, not fit to be observed at other times I cannot tell, it appearing <note n="u" place="margin">Rot.

But for my part, I doe affirme this was an act of Parliament, That the King was party to the Judgement, is <note n="y" place="margin">Rot.

Many things doubtlesse, past formerly in Parliaments, which are not found Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded; And some Statutes to this day Lawes, are no where enrolled, of which see Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> Instit. 4. pag. 51. But for the Commons being parties to this Judgement, it is so certaine as <hi>Walsingham,</hi> who then

            <p n="21">21.

            <p>But for Sir <hi>Thomas Mortimer</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Cobham</hi> it is certaine, the Commons did not onely Impeach them, but joyned with the King and Lords in all things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them.

It is certain, if the Lords have power to Fine and Imprison a Commoner, they cannot delegate it to the Judges; nor they, who are the Kings Agents in administration of Justice, Fine any man as Deputies to them, but in doing so, must proceed after an ordinary course of Law; and therefore, either that Record of 7 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. is imperfect, or it was done as the former, upon <hi>Cavendishes</hi> submission, who did in part deny his first Accusation of the Chancellor himself, turning it onely on his Clark. And for the Lords Fining a Commoner, I am confident, there never was any one penny paid, unlesse voluntarily, of any summe so imposed by them, though perhaps they may at some time have attempted the doing it, which I doe the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assure my self of, because the House of Peeres ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an intent really to punish by <note n="d" place="margin">Rot Parl. 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. nu. 46.</note> Fine, certain Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their own House, for negligently attending there, (a <note n="e" place="margin">

            <p>But, where he sayes the Lords in this case had witnesses examined upon Oath before them. I am not resolved, the Chancellours Clark protesting his Lords innoceny, <note n="f" place="margin">Rot. Parl. 7 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. nu. 14 post <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="24">24. For those of the 18 <hi>Iocobi</hi> and since: I will onely say, that the course of Trying men in the Lords House, having layen asleep (if ever practist) for about two hundred yeares, then firfi renewed, many might be ignorant of their owne right, nor know how to plead to it: And it is certaine some
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55560:18"/>
of those Presidents he mentions, have never been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, neither were they done without Kings Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; in so much as all was done by an united Vote if put in execution.</p>
            <p>Another President I have met with, is, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by <note n="h" place="margin">Stat. 2. 6 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. cap. 1.</note> 6 <hi>Rich. 2. cap. 1. Stat.</hi> 2. that certaine men <hi>were Indited, Arraigned, or Appealed of High</hi> TREASON <hi>in Parliament next before:</hi> And therefore, that it is plaine Commoners may be Tryed even for TREASON in Parliament. But it is cleare, there is no such thing can be gathered, either by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Act here spoken of <note n="i" place="margin">Rot. Parl. in Octavis sancti Michael. n. 16. et en tierce semaine de quaresme nu. 17.</note> or by the Roll of either Parliament, on any thing else, more then, that there was a Pardon then granted to severall persons, and these words in the Point, <hi>As in the same Parliament is more fully contained,</hi> must have reference to the pardon granted, which doth appeare in the Roll, not to the Arraigning, which is no where found in it.</p>
            <p>There may now be expected that I speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what; If a Subject should be opprest by an illegall Sentence of the Lords, how he is to be rectified, for <hi>non debet esse defectus Iusticia;</hi> and for any Court Spirituall or Temporall exceeding their power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Statute. In the like case a <hi>Prohibition</hi> or <hi>Supersedeas</hi> out of the Kings Bench, lies; though the STATUTE provide not that remedy. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Articulii super chartus chap.</hi> 3. 417. with the Register, fol 185. 187, &amp;c. But this being a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Court, is a greater question, in which there will fall out a great dispute, how farre, and in what sense the two Houses are, the High Court of Parliament,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55560:18"/>
which I intend not at this time to enter into, but will conclude, remembring that true advise of Master <hi>Prinne; That who shall so suffer, shall have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a good Conscience to support him;</hi> and God, no doubt, will in his good time finde some meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him.</p>
