            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN Obedience to an Order of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, and in purſuance of a like Order from the Commiſſioners appointed to examine, take, and ſtate the Publick Accounts, the ſaid <hi>John Farthing</hi> attended the ſaid Commiſſioners on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1695/6, to whom he then exhibited the four following Clauſes, (contained in an Act for an Additional Exciſe on Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, paſt 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1689.) which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prejudicial to his Majeſties Revenue of Exciſe. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt Clauſe in the forementioned Act, directs the increaſe of the Ale-Barrel from Two and Thirty to Four and Thirty Gallons.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49316:3"/>
2. The ſecond alters the Allowance to the Ale-Brewer from two Barrels in Two and Twenty, to Two and an half in Three and Twenty Barrels.</p>
            <p>By both which Alterations, the King loſeth Eight Pounds Seven Shillings and five Pence, for every one hundred Pounds paid the King for Exciſe by the Ale-Brewers, <hi>viz.</hi> By altering the Barrel, Seven Pounds and three Pence; and by the Allowance, One Pound Seven Shillings and Two Pence.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> The Ale-Brewer is enjoyned to ſell no more than 32 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons to the Barrel, and at that rate the Cuſtomers, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Conſumers or Expenders of that Liquor) pay him One Hundred and eight Pounds Seven Shillings and five Pence, for Exciſe of the ſame quantity of the ſaid Liquor, for which the ſaid Brewer pays the King but One Hundred Pounds: By which the King loſeth a Thirteenth part of his whole Exciſe of Ale.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Brewing Retaylers have no Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> Alſo by the ſaid Alteration of the Ale-Barrel, the King lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Seventeenth part of his whole Exciſe of Ale brewed by the Retaylers; who (being diſcharged from Trouble by Popular Action or otherwiſe, for raiſing their Prices on Beer and Ale) ought to pay the Duty by the Barrel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Statutes 51 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. (Stat. of the Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brel) and 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. both which are ſtill in force, and aſcertain the Ale-Barrel to be 32, and of Beer 36 Gallons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Clauſe makes an Allowance to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Brewers and Brewing Retaylers of Ale and Beer, of One Tenth part of all Worts Gaged warm, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing to what degree of heat, and that no part of that Tenth ſhall be charged upon the Brewer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> This Clauſe abates the Force of the Gagers Oath, and gives them Power to make an Allowance of Ten <hi>per</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49316:3"/>
               <hi>Cent.</hi> out of his Majeſties whole Exciſe of Beer and Ale, which the Brewers know how to improve to their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>If Worts be not let down warm, there can be no Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note place="margin">Note.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Fourth Clauſe of the ſaid Act, enjoyns the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to give the Perſons brewing Ale and Beer, and making other exciſable Liquors, (at the time of taking their laſt Gage) true Notes in Writing of the quantity and quality of all exciſable Liquors by them ſo gaged.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Obſervations on the ſaid fourth Clauſe.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THis Clauſe doth (in Effect) diſcharge all Perſons brewing and making Exciſable Liquors, from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true and particular Entries; for it cannot be ſuppoſed, that the Brewers Entries will ever exceed the Gagers Notes, which before this Act paſt they frequently did.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Entries were formerly thought to be ſo conſiderable a Guard to the Revenue of Exciſe, That every Exciſe Act did increaſe the Penalty on Brewers, &amp;c. (Five Pounds more than the preceeding Act) in Caſe of Non-Entries or Falſe Entries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Officers formerly did caſt up their Gages at their own Homes (and generally) after they had repoſed themſelves: But by this Trouble of caſting up their Gages, and giving Duplicates thereof at each Brewhouſe, &amp;c. They are put to the Expence of (at leaſt) Two thirds of the Time more than formerly; and by the unavoidable hurry are much more liable to Miſtakes.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49316:4"/>
4. The Officers (who formerly could go their Rounds in Two or Three Hours) muſt by this expence of Time, make fewer Surveys in 24 Hours than formerly, which gives the Brewers and others many Advantages which they know (too well) how to improve as occaſion ſhall offer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Officers by this Clauſe of giving Notes to the Brewers, &amp;c. (which they cannot conveniently do in the Brewing Offices, which are generally unclean places) are in a manner neceſſitated to repair to the Brewers Compting or Dwelling-Houſes, to draw up theſe Notes; which may create an Underſtanding between the Brewers and Officers, not altogether for his Majeſties Intereſt, directly contrary to the former Methods of Management, when the Officers (generally) had Inſtructions to avoid all Occaſions that might tend to ſuch a Familiarity with the Brewers.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Brewers of <hi>London</hi> being a Body Incorporated, do (doubtleſs) inſtruct each other how to make uſe of theſe Opportunities; and 'tis not to be doubted, but they had a great hand in digeſting theſe Clauſes, though in a Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine manner.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Private Maſh-Tuns, Backs, Gile-Tuns, and Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes are Notions to amuſe Perſons unacquainted with the Affairs of the Exciſe, and pretences made uſe of for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of theſe four Clauſes; (ſo prejudicial to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of Exciſe, and beneficial to the Brewers.) The Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both in <hi>London</hi> and the Country have more ſafe and expeditious Ways to manage Frauds, without incurring the Penalties of Private Storehouſes, &amp;c. And never had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er opportunities then what are given them by this Act.</p>
               <p>Had not one of the Commiſſioners of Exciſe (at the time of paſſing the ſaid Act) been an Ale-Brewer, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49316:4"/>
of Exciſe (who managed the ſaid Revenue Six Years, ending 24<hi>th. June,</hi> 1689. Steered the ſame courſe with the Farmers and Managers their Predeceſſors, it could not eaſily have been conceived, how ſuch a Bill could have received approbation at their Board, from whence it was carried by the Auditor of Exciſe to the Houſe of Commons. Or it might juſtly be ſuſpected they had a Deſign to Advance the Brewers Intereſt, tho' ſo much to the prejudice of the ſaid Revenue.</p>
               <p>But what appears moſt likely, is, That the ſaid <hi>John Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> being about that time in a probability of obtaining the Management or Comptrollment of the Exciſe, and by that means Enabled to make a clear Diſcovery of the Errors in the Management of the aforementioned Commiſſioners and Managers, and of the abuſes committed in the Collecting of, and Accompting for the ſaid Revenue; the ſaid Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners complyed with theſe courſes, to Obviate the dangers which might threaten them by ſuch Diſcovery, and which alſo ſerved the Brewers purpoſes, as before ſet forth.</p>
               <p>That altho' by the Laws of Exciſe, the Cuſtomers and Expenders of Beer and Ale do pay to the Brewers the full Exciſe, yet the common Brewers of Ale do pay to the King but three Fourths thereof. As by the following Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will more plainly appear. <hi>viz.</hi>

The ſaid <hi>John Farthing</hi> further ſets forth, that the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Managing the Revenue of Exciſe for the ſaid Year, 1688.

               <p>That the ſaid <hi>John Farthing</hi> (being in the Year 1689.

               <p>The ſaid <hi>John Farthing</hi> can alſo ſhew (by Tables Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for that purpoſe) what very great Summs of the King's Money ariſing by Exciſe, were from time to time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the hands of the two chief Commiſſioners of Exciſe (who at the ſame time were Receivers General of the ſaid Revenue) and of the then Farmers and Managers, ready upon all occaſions either to buy up Tallies or advance to his then Majeſty at Intereſt of 10 <hi>l.</hi> and 8 <hi>l. per Cent. per Annum.</hi> by which means his ſaid Majeſty paid them double Intereſt for his own Money, firſt as Running Caſh, and then as Advance.</p>

               <p>Alſo the ſaid <hi>John Farthing</hi> is humbly of Opinion, that if Your Lordſhips and the Houſe of Commons ſhall think ſit to abrogate ſeveral Clauſes (herein ſet forth) in an additional Act of Exciſe, paſt the 25. of <hi>July</hi> 1689, and to revive the old Laws of Exciſe, with ſome neceſſary Additions.

Practices, or if any ſuch ſhall happen, that they may eaſily be detected and remedyed.</p>
