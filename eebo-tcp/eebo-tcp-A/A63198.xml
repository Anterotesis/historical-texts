            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> made a ſhort Speech, praiſing
and extolling the Kings Juſtice, and Care of the State,
that his Majeſty hearing of theſe abominable Crimes by report, could

Firſt, for the—Secondly, for the <hi>Sodomy;</hi> when, and in what Kings
Reign theſe Offences were made Death by the Common Law.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner being brought to the Bar by the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Steward</hi> ſpoke to him, bewailing of his Caſe for falling ſo
far from God, and expreſſed his ſorrow for him, not only as for a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but as a Peer; and withall gave him this Caveat; that in, and
out of all the Confeſſion, and Depoſition concerning this buſineſs, the
Earl never fell into theſe foul Crimes, until he firſt fell from God, and
changed his Religion, and that by <hi>Fountayle,</hi> and by perſwaſion of
his Neighbour <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and that he leaving God, God left
him, and that the Dignity, of the Perſon did aggravate the Crime.</p>

               <head>The Priſoner deſires to ſpeak.</head>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Steward</hi> told him he ſhould have time and leaſure enough
to ſpeak for himſelf. In the mean time if he had any thing to deliver
ſhortly; he ſhould be heard, deſiring him to ſpeak boldly without fear;
that he ſhould have an honourable Tryal by thoſe Peers he ſaw pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
who were without exception. But withal he deſired him for his
own weale, and the ſooner to obtain mercy from the King, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
freely without circumſtances, that his own Conſcience was more
than a thouſand Witneſſes.</p>

               <p>Secondly, For a Rape committed againſt his own Wife, in compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her, and forcing her to yield againſt her will, to the luſt of one
<hi>Giles Bradway</hi> at <hi>Sarum,</hi> the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1630. He the ſaid Earl hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Wife by one Arm and one Leg, until the Fellow had ſatisfied
himſelf, the Earl holding a Knife in one hand; which done, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
endeavoured to kill her ſelf with a Knife, but they took the Knife
from her, and brake it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the ſame Night he committed Buggery with <hi>Florence

               </p>
               <p>To all three Indictments, he pleads not guilty, and deſires leave to
ſpeak, which was granted ſo he were ſhort.</p>
               <p>The Earl alledges he is no Scholar, that he hath been kept theſe Six
Weeks cloſe Priſoner in the Tower, where he could have no occaſion
to ſeek out any thing that might clear him, and entreats the <hi>Lord Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
that he might have liberty to have Counſel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65423:3"/>
The Lord Steward replyed, that in all that time, he had
more notice of the <hi>Proceedings</hi> againſt him, than any Priſoner
before had, to his Knowledg, being often before the <hi>Council
Table,</hi> and face to face before his Accuſers; yet to ſatisfie the
Earl, the Lord Steward asked the Opinion of the Judges,
who all in one voice anſwered, that it could not be granted
but in points of Law; if any ſuch occurred, he ſhould have
preſent Determination: Then the Lord Steward ſaid, that
his Tryal muſt be <hi>ſecundum veritatem facti,</hi> little <hi>de jure:</hi> If his
Lordſhip or the Lords doubted any thing, let them ſhew it to
the Lord Steward, and he would ſhew it to the Judges, and
ſo have preſent Anſwer: That now he was to be judged by the
Peers, who were without any exception, and becauſe of
their abſolute Integrity, no Oath was to be taken from them:
So the Earl pleads, not guilty, and ſubmits himſelf to God, his
Peers, and the right of his Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Then begun the Kings Attorney to ſpeak, and open the
whole buſineſs with the Circumſtances and Depoſitions, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them all againſt the Priſoner, but ſo fairly and ſo judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
that none could do better, nor contrive ſo foul a buſineſs
in fairer Terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> clears himſelf of any former ſpleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Perſon, but againſt the Crimes; that he ſhould
ſay nothing but what he could prove clearly; (which indeed
he did perform) that theſe ten years paſt, during the time of
his ſervice to our late Majeſty, and our now preſent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
he had never opened his mouth againſt any Peer
in this Land; wherein he commended greatly the King
in his Government, and the Peers in their Duty to their
Sovereign; then he ſhewed that theſe Deteſtable Crimes
were now proſecuted by a Legal Courſe of Law; that
his Majeſty and People might be clear of them: that the
Lord <hi>Audley</hi> (for ſo they ſtill called him) was Legally
indicted in his own Countrey: Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> goes on, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Depoſitious to be read.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> he inſiſts upon the Rape: If a man, ſaith he,
doth force a maried woman, and that ſhe yeild thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65423:4"/>
yet he dieth by the Law, except ſhe concieve; yea
though ſhe cried not, nor complained in time, for this
is no exception againſt the King,<note place="margin">If a Man force a Whore, yet he dieth by the Law.</note> but againſt the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
Mr. Attorny perſiſts, and ſhews there was no
neceſſity of revealing it, becauſe the woman was in their
Power.</p>
               <p>The Earl tried his Wifes Chaſtity the firſt night of her
Mariage with him, and takes pleaſure to make all men
as bad as himſelf; he tempts her firſt night after her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
to lie with his Favorite <hi>Anthil,</hi> whom the Earl ſaid
he loved above all men; he ſaies alſo to her, that her
Body was his Body, ſhe muſt therefore uſe it at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and uſed Scripture for it.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Anthil</hi> the Son of an Inkeeper, being his Favourite,
he gave his Eldeſt Daughter in Mariage with 8000l. of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
this argues ſtrong affection, and that which all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
abhors,<note place="margin">No Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never ſo ill, but would have his Wife better.</note> (that is to have their Wifes proſtitute to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
the Earl took great delight in.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Anthil</hi> ſcceeds <hi>Skipwith</hi> in the Earls affections,
whom from a Foot-Boy and a Page he advanced to be
his Favourite, and ſo ſtiled him uſually, and made him
ſit at his Table, and makes him his Bed-Fellow: <hi>ſed quor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
hoc?</hi> I leave that to your Lordſhips to judge: to him
he was not ſo favourable as to <hi>Anthil,</hi> in beſtowing his
Wife upon him, and was the Pander and the Baud; when
as moſt men ſtrive to leave their ſucceſſion to legitimate
Children, and not to Spurious Births.</p>
               <p>So I will leave this point of Rape with this truth, that
to force a woman is a great ſin; but for an Husband
to conſent that his Wife ſhall be forced, is very much:
but for an Husband to behold it, to be a ſpectator, yea
to force her, it goes beyond the Bounds of humanity.</p>
               <p>Now as to that ſin which ſhould not be named amongſt
Chriſtians, and a ſtrange ſin in this Land, brought hither
by ſtrangers, I will ſcarce name it, the Law of <hi>England</hi> ſaies,
that Knowledg is a Burden, and I think it is in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<hi>Crimen est bestiale contra naturam,</hi> It is <hi>Crimen Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticum
ſine penetratione cum faemina;</hi> It is <hi>Maſculus cum Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
and therefore Penetration is not lawful to make it So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy;
<hi>Cubitus immunditus</hi> ſupplies the Penetration; <hi>Voluntas ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65423:4"/>
requiretur, non Copulatio;</hi> ſo that the Law of <hi>England</hi> makes
diſtinction of degrees of this filthy ſin, <hi>non est ſpecies Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriae,
ſed Bestialitatis, quia non ſequitur Conceptio.</hi> Many more
paſſages were cited by Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> both out of Scripture
and Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So he concluded that every Breach of this
filthy ſin was within the compaſs of Felony.</p>
               <p>Then he fell upon <hi>Henry Skipwith,</hi> born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who
being come from a Footman, to be the Earls Bedfellow
and Favourite, got from the Earl 500l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he gave not his Son one hundred: he gave him alſo his
Houſe at <hi>Salisbury;</hi> and gave him many Leaſes; and all
his goods by Gift and Deed; beſides all theſe, he did
proſtitute unto him his Lady, and his Eldeſt Sons Wife.</p>
               <p>Then did Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> largely declare all my Lord <hi>Audlyes</hi>
Buſineſs, how <hi>Skipwith</hi> and She did love one another in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
before her Mariage, but never enjoyed her, till after
her Mariage; and by reaſon of her young years what Oyls
and greaſe the Earl uſed, to make her fit for <hi>Skipwith,</hi> which
his heart abhorred to relate. He did aggravate the more

<hi>Skipwith</hi> were nothing, in regard of that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

Lady of 12 years, his own Daughter-in-Law, whoſe
Children (if any had been) ſhould have been Peers of
this Realm; and which is worſe, if worſe can be, the Earl
to be the Spectator and Enconrager of all theſe filthy
Crimes.</p>
               <p>This was confeſt by <hi>Skipwith,</hi> and the young Lady; and as
for the Earl's Filthineſs with his Maid <hi>Blandina,</hi> that was alſo
touched, how the Earl's Houſe was a common Brothel-houſe,
the Earl himſelf delighting to be not only an Actor, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Spectator of Filthineſs; and alſo <hi>Blandina</hi> was abuſed by
himſelf and his Servants for the ſpace of ſeven hours together,
until ſhe had the <hi>French Pox;</hi> and ſo Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> ended his

Then were all the Witneſſes examined,<note place="margin">The Ladies were in a Room behind the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; the Lords that went to them were four, <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Eſſex, Warwick,</hi> &amp; <hi>Leiceſter</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Fumy,</hi> alias <hi>Florence,
Fitz-Patrick, Giles Bradway, Skipwith, Scot, Flore, Walter Tite,</hi> his
Steward, their former Depoſitions were read to them all,
which now again upon Oath they did acknowledge to be
true; Both the Ladies Depoſitions were alſo read, and ſome
of the Lords were ſent to them to take their Oaths whether
they were true or not, which they conſtantly ſtood to upon
Oath.</p>
               <p>Thus did Mr. Attorney clearly prove what he had alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt the Earl; not one Circumſtance at all which he
alledged againſt the Earl, which was not proved by two of
the Witneſſes at the leaſt.</p>
               <p>Then ſpake the <hi>Kings Sollicitor,</hi> reſuming all that was ſaid,
and proved by Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> alledging more Law to prove
the ſame; but in ſubſtance ſaid no more than what was
ſaid before.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Then did the Priſoner ſpeak for himſelf.</head>
               <p>Firſt he excepts againſt the Witneſſes, as baſe and unworthy
perſons, ſuborned by his Wife and his Son, to take away his
Life; whereas, by Law, Witneſſes ought to be honeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and undefamed, which they are not; and alledges Law
for it: for <hi>Fitch-Patrick,</hi> he ſaid he was a <hi>Recuſant,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could be no Witneſs; which was repelled, becauſe he
was never convicted for the ſame; and therefore the Judges
could take no notice of his Recuſancy.</p>
               <p>The Earl ſaid further, That for his Knavery he had
oftentimes beaten him, and turned him away; and that he
was now hired by his Son to bear witneſs againſt him: It
was repelled again by the <hi>Lord Steward,</hi> becauſe it could
not be.</p>
               <p>It was anſwered again by the Judges, that in Law for
the King, all Witneſſes are held to be ſufficient, and that no
honeſt and undefamed men could be witneſſes of ſuch bad

The Lord <hi>Steward</hi> further adds, that the Earl had fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
beyond the practice, in that the Witneſſes were brought
face to face to him, which were all brought there, except the
two Ladies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That ſuppoſing it were true which they depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
(which he hoped would not ſo prove) he urged to be
cleared, whether the Statute did intend that all kind of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(man with man) were <hi>Buggery</hi> or not, ſeeing by their
Confeſſion, there was no Penetration. To this (the Judges
Advice being asked) they anſwered it was <hi>Buggery</hi> by the
Law, and that the Law of this Land made no diſtinction
of <hi>Buggery,</hi> if there be <hi>Emiſsio Seminis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He excepted againſt the Depoſition of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
for the Rape, alledging that the Actor being the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
depoſed, that he had ſpent after he had ſtrugled with
the Counteſs, that he did not penetrate at all.</p>
               <p>To this it was anſwered by the Judges (after asking) that
the Counteſs her own Depoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did clear that Matter,
who declared upon Oath that the Fellow had carnal dealing
with her, being held by the Arm and Leg by her Husband,
and never thereafter knew him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He ſaid that the Wife could not be a Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her Husband: the Judges being asked their Opinions
therein by the Lord <hi>Steward,</hi> anſwered, that in Civil Matters
between Party and Party, a Wife could not be a Witneſs;
but for Criminal matters, and for the King, the Wife may be
a Witneſs,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He urged that his Wife was incontinent, yea
before he married her, and therefore a Whore can be no
Witneſs: the Judges Opinions being asked in this Caſe,
they anſwered, that a common Whore may be raviſhed, and
ſo repelled his Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He alledged that his Wife, his Son, and one Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Wroghton</hi> had plotted together againſt his Life, and ſo all was

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, He beſeeched the Lords to conſider what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

               <p>Wherefore he deſires them to ſee into what a Miſery the

the 14 of <hi>May</hi> following; notice whereof was given him,
and his Coffin carried into the Tower about a week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that he might the better prepare himſelf for Death:

to ſuffer in being come, there repaired unto him of Noblemen,
Gentry, and others, a world of people to behold the ſame.</p>
               <p>He came attired in a plain black Grogram Suit, a falling

that his perſon was ſcarce free, but even both along in the

amend his Gown on his Back, when he came to mount the
Scaffold; which being aſcended, the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> and Doctor

Perſonages, and whole Aſſembly, ſhewing to them all a very
Noble, Manly and Chearful Countenance, ſuch as ſeemed no

ſhewing himſelf to the people, he addreſſed himſelf to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the Deans accompanying him in that Exerciſe, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
