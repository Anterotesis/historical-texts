            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Next, to <hi>palliate</hi> his adultery, he <hi>cogg'd</hi> with her husband. (v. 8.) Thirdly, finding that would not take, he dissembled with him yet farther, and <hi>made him drunk,</hi> (v. 13.)

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52440:46"/>
he contrived the <hi>murder</hi> of the Husband, that so he might carry away the wife (v. 15.)

Your pleading that the <hi>judgment</hi> of <hi>David</hi> was not <hi>changed,</hi> would do you no service, if I should grant it: for there is hardly any sinner, who doth judge of the <hi>creature</hi> as more <hi>valuable</hi> then <hi>God,</hi> when asked which he doth value most; nor is a man the <hi>less</hi> but the <hi>greater</hi> sinner for deliberately acting <hi>against his judgment.</hi> And again remember how much you gave to the <hi>unsanctified man.</hi>

                     <hi>It is not a want of abilities that makes Ministers use Notes; but it is a regard to the work and good of the hearers. I use. Notes as much as any man, when I take pains, and as little as any man, when I am lazy, or busie, or have not leisure to prepare. It is easier to preach three Sermons without Notes, then one with them.</hi>
                  </q>] If it is really <hi>so,</hi> as here you say, that the <hi>using of Notes</hi> is for the <hi>good of the hearers,</hi> and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performance of Gods <hi>work,</hi> then indeed I have been guilty of great <hi>omissions</hi> towards my <hi>flock</hi>: for in all the course of my Ministery, I never made any use of Notes. But I have this for my excuse, that I was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>not</hi> to use them, by very venerable persons, when I was first ordained to be a Preacher. And the reasons given for it were these especially; first because your <hi>reading Preachers</hi> were more <hi>despised</hi> at that time, then of late they have been, (and where the <hi>Preachers</hi> is not <hi>valued,</hi> the <hi>Sermon</hi> finds the less <hi>attention.</hi>) Next because such a Preacher as speaks out of his <hi>memory,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:52440:57"/>
is better able to speak out of his <hi>heart and mind,</hi> then one who is <hi>often,</hi> or <hi>altogether</hi> forced to look into his book. Not will his work be so <hi>lifeless,</hi> as when he reads. He will not be so very apt to <hi>preach his Auditory asleep,</hi> (which you modestly condemn in your self and others.) But since you say the <hi>use of notes</hi> is for the <hi>benefit of the hearers,</hi> and since I know they are used by many eminent Preachers besides your self, I begin to suspect my former <hi>judgment,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may change my <hi>practice</hi> too. For as I never thought the worse of others whom I have known to use Notes, or the better of my self for having never us'd any, so have you given me an occasion to put my self on this question, whether I have not been faulty in bestowing <hi>that time</hi> to put my Sermons into my <hi>memory,</hi> which might better have been imployed in making them <hi>worthy</hi> to be <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</hi> I am really in a strait, and apt to state it in the <hi>affirmative</hi>; for he who spends his <hi>whole time,</hi> in giving <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> to his <hi>compositions,</hi> may make them useful for the <hi>publick,</hi> and fit to be preached from the <hi>Press</hi>; whereas the man that is obliged to speak <hi>at large</hi> upon a <hi>little,</hi> and to content himself with the <hi>sudden effusions</hi> of his soul, can attain to nothing beyond the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> where he speaks little else, then what must <hi>perish</hi> whilest it is <hi>spoken.</hi> I do intend (if God permit) to make a trial of <hi>your way</hi>; and if I shall find it to be the better, will never return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>mine own.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> because you had a <hi>warning</hi> in my <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52440:96"/>
               <hi>Papists,</hi> as an unpassionate Protestant may be allowed, yet do I abhor being a <hi>Papist,</hi> as much as being a <hi>Presbyterian</hi>; and will as soon be a <hi>Turk,</hi> as I will be either. Compare my <hi>praemonition</hi> before the book above-mention'd, with the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> Chapter, and with the <hi>middle</hi> of the <hi>third,</hi> that you may see the <hi>aggravations</hi> of your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>Next, because it is a <hi>groundless,</hi> and so by consequence a <hi>spiteful, inhuman charge.</hi> For where have I ever <hi>defended Popery</hi>? Or when did I write <hi>one word</hi> for <hi>Grotianism,</hi> as you expound it by <note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 381.</note> 
               <hi>Popery?</hi> Or where did I ever use the <hi>word</hi>? Name the <hi>booke,</hi> and the <hi>page,</hi> and the <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical lines</hi> which I have written, if I have written any such thing. Are you an <hi>Answerer of Books,</hi> whilst you <hi>forge,</hi> and <hi>falsifie,</hi> and declaim at random against your <hi>Dreams,</hi> to which you entitle your <hi>Brother's Name,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out directing your Readers to any one <hi>page,</hi> or <hi>expression,</hi> whereby to give some <hi>colour</hi> to your Inventions? What <hi>unstudied Gentleman have I seduced</hi>? or where are the <hi>foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps</hi> which I have <hi>troden,</hi> towards the management of a <hi>plot</hi> to bring in <hi>Popery</hi>? for shame do somwhat like a <hi>Man,</hi> (if not at all like a <hi>Christian</hi>) either to <hi>prove</hi> I am a <hi>Papist,</hi> or to make me at least some <hi>Reparations,</hi> in as <hi>publick</hi> a manner as you have wrong'd me.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because your <hi>Accusation</hi> could not but flie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Face, and significantly call you a <hi>false-Accuser.</hi> For you know it never was my profession, that I was of <hi>Grotius his Religion,</hi> (let his Religion have been what it would) but rather that <hi>Grotius</hi> was of <hi>mine,</hi> by being a <hi>Protestant</hi> and a <hi>Peacemaker.</hi> If I was <hi>mistaken</hi> in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, you should have gather'd from thence, <hi>that I am fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi>; not at all, that <hi>I am a Papist</hi>; because a man may be a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and yet be <hi>mistaken</hi> in his opinion. You are a wilful Deviator from the Thing under Dispute, and shall be made to <hi>acknowledge</hi> that you are such. For it is not our Question, <hi>Whether Grotian Popery is Good</hi>; but, <hi>whether Grotius</hi> (good man) was indeed a <hi>Papist.</hi> Had I <hi>affirm'd</hi> the <hi>former,</hi> I might have been liable to your charge; but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52440:97"/>
you know I onely <hi>denyed the latter</hi>; and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any such thing as <hi>Grotian Popery,</hi> more then any such thing as <hi>Baxterian Paganism.</hi> For though you <note n="†" place="margin">

let it be noted, that either <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Iansenius</hi> are of the Judgment that I am for, Or their greatest friends and Abettors are no less Oppugners of the Calvinists than the <hi>Molinists</hi> themselves;) will you say they <hi>love</hi> what they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,</hi> because they deny that <hi>Iansenius</hi> said it? you will be hooted at, if you do, as a very <hi>strange Creature.</hi> And yet you have done as absur'd a thing.

Whilst you labour to prove that <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> turn'd Papist, you are doing the Papists a special service, by robbing our Churches of such a <hi>prop,</hi> and by tempting as many to turn Papists, as do believe that <hi>Grotius</hi> knew what was <hi>best.</hi> Whereas the <hi>true Protestants</hi> (on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) are encouraged to <hi>adhere</hi> to the Church of <hi>England</hi> (however disgraced and forsaken by a revolting people) by the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of <hi>Grotius</hi> that she was neerest unto the <hi>Primitive,</hi> in point of <hi>purity,</hi> and <hi>pious Order.</hi> 14. The Design which is laid by you and others for the Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Poperie, is driven on by those means which you have <note n="*" place="margin">See your <hi>Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. p.</hi> 46, 47.</note> acknowledged your self to be proper and suitable to the work, notwithstanding you have <hi>hid</hi> them with other Names. The first part of the <hi>plot</hi> is, <hi>to blow up the sparkes
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52440:100"/>
of Schism and Haeresie,</hi> that our Church being divided may become odious, and men be prepared for a Remove. The second is, <hi>An Incessant Indeavour to infect all persons, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those in power, Civil or Military, with the opinion of Libertinism,</hi> (for which look back on Chap. 3.) that so your Doctrines and Practises may have vent, and exercise. Your third plot is, <hi>to get down the learned, judicious, Godly, painful Ministers,</hi> (such as by name I lately mentioned Chap. 6. Sect. 9.) <hi>at least to take away their publick Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi>; that the people may take such Ministers as will hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour them most, and do their work best cheap. The fourth part of the plot is, <hi>to hinder the Union of other Protestants with Episcopal Divines, and the regular exercising of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or maintaining of Church-Order</hi>; that the Papists may say we have no Church, no Government, &amp;c. and that by division we may be disabled from opposing them. The fifth part of it is, <hi>to keep afoot a party of learned Men, who under the Name of Presbyterians may keep an Interest in the people, and partly draw them from Unity, and from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Superiours by pretending a Necessity to abolish Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy and Presbytery, and to set up Presbytery in its stead,</hi> or somewhat else without a Name, expressed at random by <hi>The Scepter and Way of Christ,</hi> thereby to <hi>widen our Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and so prepare a way for Popery.</hi>

Indeed to <hi>Poelenburg</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and so <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring</hi> a person as Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> the words of <hi>Grotius</hi> are plain enough. Plain enough to let them see that <hi>Grotius</hi> was but a <hi>peacemaker,</hi> not a <hi>Papist</hi>: And it seems they are <hi>plain</hi> even to <hi>me,</hi> because I see the <hi>same</hi> thing. But even for that very reason they cannot be <hi>plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi> to <hi>you,</hi> Sir, because you seem to see from them that their Authour <hi>was,</hi> what he was <hi>not.</hi> The printed Judgments of those <hi>three</hi> above mention'd, are directly <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>yours.</hi> Whether <hi>They,</hi> or <hi>you,</hi> are best able to interpret the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Grotius,</hi> I may very well say, <hi>Let the Reader judge.</hi> The <hi>learnedest</hi> persons in all the world (nor <hi>onely</hi> the learnedest, but the <hi>most</hi> too) as well of the <hi>Romish</hi> as of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, do judge of his <hi>Words,</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi> as I have shew'd you.

            </p>
            <p>This being the summe of your chiefest Argument, may be enlarged (by my consent) in the <hi>Major Proposition,</hi> to the utmost pitch of advantage, to which your <hi>own heart</hi> can wish the difficulty improved; to wit by urging that the Bishops were at first invested by the Apostles, with <hi>all manner</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> both <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Office.</hi> And so the <hi>Bishop</hi> in every <hi>Dioecesse,</hi> being lineally the <hi>successor</hi> of that <hi>numerical Bishop</hi> who was <hi>ordained</hi> by the Apostles, is by consequence invested with <hi>all this</hi> power. From whence there flow's <hi>another Sequel</hi> as unavoidable as the former, that not the <hi>least part</hi> of this Sacred <hi>power</hi> can be possibly received but from the <hi>Bishop.</hi>

And you think you prove it by this sad <hi>Syllogism.</hi>
               <q>The Scripture-Bishops were the Pastors of particular Churches, having no Presbyters subject to them. Most of our Ordainers are such Pastors: Therefore most of our Ordainers are Scripture-Bishops.</q>
The <hi>major</hi> of this Syllogism you prove from Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
and the <hi>minor</hi> from Mr. <hi>Pierce.</hi> At least you are
<hi>confident</hi> that you <hi>prove</hi> it; though I shall prove you prove
nothing, except your <hi>forgetfulness of Logick,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else to your prejudice, of which anon.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

you are obnoxious to the publick assertion of D. <hi>Kendal,</hi> that <hi>a little more of the university would have done you no harm.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Next to know what you have done, by disputing thus in <hi>figure,</hi> without all <hi>mood,</hi> observe the <hi>Conclusiveness</hi> of your <hi>Syllogism,</hi> by an <hi>other</hi> just <hi>like</hi> it in all respects. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (in the person of <hi>Diogenes</hi>) you were to prove that a <hi>Cock with his Feathers strips from him alive,</hi> is a <hi>Man</hi> as well as <hi>Plato,</hi> though not as able to <hi>teach School</hi>; you may thus argue for <hi>him,</hi> as you have done for <hi>your self.</hi>
               <q>A man is a living Creature with two feet and without Feathers- A Cock deplumed (like that of <hi>Diogenes)</hi> is such a living Creaturo: Therefore a Cock deplumed (like that of <hi>Diogenes</hi>) is a man.</q>
But then you have taught an <hi>ill Sophistry</hi> against your self.
For the plainest person in all your Parish may prove you to
be an arrant <hi>He athen</hi> by the very same <hi>Logick</hi> which you
have <hi>err'd by.</hi>
               <q>An arrant Heathen is an Animal indued with reason <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter is an Animal indued with reason: Therefore <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter is an arrant Heathen.</q>
The <hi>major</hi> at least must be <hi>as true,</hi> as that which you take
from Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> infinitly <hi>truer,</hi> than that
which you take from Mr. <hi>Pierce.</hi> And you know the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi>
is undeniable. For if the premises are <hi>true, Falshood</hi>
cannot flow from them by any <hi>regular</hi> Deduction. And

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52440:132"/>
that whilst you say <hi>most</hi> of your Ordainers are such Pastors, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> spake of in Scripture-times, (which yet I hope you will retract) you imply a confession, that <hi>some are not.</hi> Nor can I see by what meanes you will excuse your selves unto your selves, for having admitted of <hi>such Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers.</hi> As for your second and third sentences in your <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 199.

               </note> p. 203. Sect. 18. You again pretend to fetch an Argument from the words of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> Your naked affirmation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd in these words. <hi>Where there are no such Presbyters with a President, it is yet enough to prove him a Bishop, that he hath Deacons under him, or but one Deacon.</hi> Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended proof of this assertion is from the words of Doctor <hi>H.</hi> which now ensue. [When the Gospel was first preached by the Apostles, and but few converted, they ordained in every City and Region no more but a Bishop, and one or more Deacons to attend him, there being at the present so small store out of which to take more, and so small need of ordaining more.] Reduce this proofe into a <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> which may serve your interest in any measure, and it will be like your <hi>former,</hi> most dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>false.</hi> For thus you <hi>must</hi> form it, (do what you can) if you intend to make it in <hi>imitation</hi> of a <hi>proof.</hi>
               <q>
                  <p>A primitive Bishop had no more then a Deacon or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to attend him: A Presbyter hath no more then a Deacon or Deacons to attend him: therefore a Presbyter is a Primitive Bishop.</p>
               </q>
Here you see are three <hi>affirmatives</hi> in the <hi>second Figure.</hi>
And by an Argument so form'd I will prove you to be <hi>any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> (either Fish, or Fowle,) with which you have any
the <hi>least Agreement.</hi> Reduce your proof then (a second
time) into a <hi>syllogisme</hi> truly made, and your case will be
<hi>alter'd,</hi> but nothing <hi>mended.</hi> Your fall into the <hi>Fire</hi> will
indeed be <hi>regular,</hi> but you will get no more by it, than if
you continue in the <hi>frying-pan.</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52440:133"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For your</hi> truly form'd <hi>Syllogism will be but thus,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hath none but a Deacon or Deacons to attend him is a Primitive Bishop: A Presbyter hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>one but a Deacon or Deacons to attend him: Therefore a Presbyter is a Primitive Bishop.</p>
               </q>
Here the <hi>matter</hi> is as untoward, as the <hi>Form</hi> was before.
The <hi>Major</hi> proposition being admirably <hi>false.</hi> For though
a man may be a <hi>Bishop</hi> who hath <hi>no more,</hi> to attend him,
when no more are to be <hi>had</hi>; (and that because <hi>no more</hi> are
<hi>needfull,</hi> which is the thing that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
taught you) yet his having <hi>no more,</hi> doth not prove
him to be a <hi>Bishop,</hi> which was the thing to be proved from
Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> When <hi>Ignatius</hi> reckons the <hi>Three</hi> Orders,
<hi>Bishops, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> 'tis as impossible for him to
meane, that <hi>Priests</hi> are <hi>Bishops,</hi> as that <hi>Deacons</hi> are <hi>Priests.</hi>
For though <hi>every Bishop</hi> is a <hi>Priest,</hi> it can no more follow
that <hi>every Priest</hi> is a <hi>Bishop,</hi> than it can possibly follow that
<hi>every Animal is a man,</hi> because it is true, that <hi>every man
is an Animal.</hi> A Primitive <hi>Bishop</hi> and a meer <hi>Presbyter</hi>
may have a <hi>Conversion per Accidens,</hi> and another <hi>conversion
by Contraposition,</hi> but a <hi>simple conversion</hi> they cannot have.
To <hi>say</hi> they can, without <hi>proof,</hi> is but the begging of the
Question; which being sure to be <hi>denyed</hi> you, I shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
you to beg no more.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this subject with a remarkable passage of Mr. <hi>Thorndike.</hi> And I will do it so much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>weightiness</hi> and the <hi>price</hi> of that excellent Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume may probably keep it from the perusal of vulgar Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who onely meddle with the cheapest Bookes.</p>
