            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Who have their Prayers in their owne

is laid asleepe from the houre of death unto

            <p>Yea, since the suspention of our Church-government,
every one that listeth turneth
Preacher, as Shoo-makers, Coblers, Button-makers,
Hostlers and such like, take upon
them to expound the holy Scriptures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
into our Pulpits, and vent strange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
tending to faction, sedition, and
blasphemie.</p>
            <p>What mischiefe these Sectaries have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done, we that have cure of soules in
<hi>London</hi> find and see with great griefe of heart:
<pb facs="tcp:62593:5"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> Our Congregations forsaking their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors;
our people becomming of the Tribe
of <hi>Gad,</hi> running after seducers as if they
were mad; Infants not to be brought to the
Sacrament of Baptisme; men refusing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the holy Communion, and the Lords
Prayer accounted abhominable, &amp;c. A Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
will hardly contain the hurt that these
Sectaries have in a very short time done to
this poore Church; and doth not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
suffer with the Church?
Whence are all these distractions? Who are
the Incendiaries that have kindled &amp; blown
this fire among us but these?</p>
            <p>Considering with my selfe the former
happinesse of this Kingdome, and the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
change that is betide it, it being fallen
from the height of prosperitie to the lowest
ebbe of misery, and this not by the incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Forreigne Nation, but by its owne
children, who imbrue their hands in the
bloud one of another with no lesse inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
then Cannibals or Men-eaters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reluctation at all; the Sonne against
the Father, and the Father against the Son,
being involved in a most cruell Warre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any hopes of Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62593:6"/>
And moreover (which is worst of all)
when I consider that some of our Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(who should like <hi>Moses</hi> stand in the
gap to appease Gods anger) doe increase
the same, not onely by blowing the fire, but
by their Errors and Schismes which they
broach and foment among us; by which they
doe as much as in them lyeth to put mens
soules in as great danger as their bodies.</p>
            <p>And considering againe how wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in a most cruell Warre without any
hopes of peace, may not I cry out with the
Prophet; <hi>O that my head were full of water, and
my eyes a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe
for the slaine of my people!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this being Gods permitting, let us
with patience possesse our souls; let us trust in
him, depend upon him, and in his good time
hee will deliver his Church, and turne all
to the best; and in the meane season every
man doe his best to quench this fire. For
my own part, these sad considerations made
me leave my <hi>Christianography,</hi> and write an

wealths have suppressed them, and
how severely some of them have beene pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
among us.</p>
            <p>I know my reverend Brethren have not
beene wanting to oppose these Hereticks in
writing and preaching, in season and out of
season, using all meanes to suppresse these
Heresies, having to that end chosen speciall
men to preach several Lectures in severall
places; But without your helpe and the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of our Religious Patriots assembled
in Parliament, they doe, and will increase
upon us doe what we can.</p>
            <p>This Treatise I present to your Lordship,
and to this Honourable Senate. What can
bee more sutable or fitter for you, Servants
of the most high God, then that which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to the glory of God, Edification of his
Church, and vindication of the truth against
the illusion of Sectaries and Heretikes?</p>
            <p>What is more correspondent with the
duty of Christian Magistrates then to assist
Gods cause with your politicall Authority?
A question may be asked whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:62593:7"/>
for the Magistrates to use the sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Heretickes? To this I answer; such
whose Heresies are blasphemous in doctrine,
or dangerous to the State, deserve death,
the reason is, because they corrupt the faith.
If such as poyson waters and fountaines at
which men and beasts drinke, deserve Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
punishment, how much more they that
as much as in them lyeth goe about to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
mens soules?</p>
            <p>Yea, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith in his fifth Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat
upon <hi>Iohn; Quantum in ipsis est Christum in
homine occidunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The forenamed St. <hi>Augustine</hi> indeed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
concerning this point for a time, as he
confesseth in one of his Epistles: but when
he saw the City wherein he dwelt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
from Donatisme by the Magistrates
sword, he retracted his opinion.</p>
            <p>And expecting the like successe in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
City, I doe implore your helps, &amp;
that for Iesus Christs sake: and I pray you
give me leave to put you in mind of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
we made in the presence of Almighty
God the searcher of all hearts, with a true
intent to performe the same, as wee should
<pb facs="tcp:62593:7"/>
answer at that great day, when the secrets of
all hearts shall bee disclosed, <hi>viz.</hi> That we
should in like manner without respect of
persons endeavour the extirpation of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Prelacy, Superstition, Heresie, Schisme,
Propha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>enesse, and whatsoever shall bee
found to be contrary to sound Doctrine and
the power of godlinesse, lest wee partake in
other mens sins, and thereby be in danger to
receive of their plagues; and that the Lord
may be one, and his Name one in the three
Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And this I beseech you in the name of
God to take in hand, laying aside all humane
reasons.</p>
            <p>Let not Gods cause goe to racke, nor by
worldly policies and humane reason be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
or retarded.</p>
            <p>The Turke will not suffer <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be

            <p>The plague is of all diseases most infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
I have lived among you almost a Iubile,
and seene your great care and provision to
keep the City from infection, in the shutting
up the sicke, and in carrying them to your
Pest-houses, in setting Warders to keep the
whole from the sicke, in making of fires and
perfuming the streets, in resorting to your
Churches, in powring out your prayers to
Almighty God with fasting and almes to be
propitious to you. The plague of heresie is
greater, and you are now in more danger
then when you buried five thousand a week:
You have power to keep these Hereticks and
Sectaries from Conventickling and sholing
together to infect one another. Fire is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
many great Cities in Europe have
been almost ruinated by it: I have seen your
dilligence and dexterety in quenching it in
the beginning: your breaking open your

Pipes for water making floods in your streets:
your Engins to cast the water upon the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
your industry and paines is admirable.</p>
            <p>Heresie is as dangerous as fire, use your
best endeavours to quench it before it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
us.</p>
            <p>Thus not doubting Right Honourable, &amp;
Right Worshipfull, of your best endeavours
to suppresse these Heretikes and Sectaries, by
whom not only many poore soules are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,

            <p>2. To palliate their Errors, they parvert the holy
Scriptures, as that Monster <hi>Arrius</hi> pretended to have

this he learnt of his father the Devill, who perverted

            </p>
            <p>And for this cause these Heretikes are enemies to

the Creed being a briefe of the Gospell, and to the

In the year 1532 <hi>Munster</hi> received the Gospel, &amp; in the yeare

desert Gods cause. The Landgrave of <hi>Hesse</hi> pittying the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed

extravagancy of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> offering disputation

to work their own ends: One of them feigning himselfe to bee
seazd with a propheticall spirit, ran about the City crying, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,

be killed presently. The Evangelicks or Protestants gathered
themselvs in a place called <hi>Over water,</hi> &amp; there fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
after 3 daies there was a Composition made, that either
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62593:14"/>
Party should enjoy the freedome of their Religion. This
composition gave the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> time to strengthen their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for they sent their letters to <hi>Wezell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lumber. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. page 16.</note> and other places, the
tenor whereof was, that God had sent an holy Prophet to
<hi>Munster,</hi> who spake wonders, and shewed the right way to
salvation; and if they would leave their houses, and come to
<hi>Munster,</hi> they should have ten times more than they left at
home, and with spirituall wealth attaine all worldly riches.
These faire promises drew the scumme of the Towns adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to <hi>Munster,</hi> (the poore and idle sort liking that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
best, that maketh all men alike, all goods common, that
payeth no Rent, Tribute, nor Tithes, that puts downe those
Lawes and Magistrates that restraine their licentiousnesse)
so that in a short time the City was full of strangers, who
looked upon it us upon the land of Promise. The <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
knowing their strength ranne to St. <hi>Maurice</hi> Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
burnt it, seized upon the Armory, pillaged and defaced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches, depopulated the Colledges, burnt a faire Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
and finally drove the Protestants out of the City, crying
out get yee hence all yee wicked, else yee shall all be slaine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> being Masters of the City, began to erect
a government, (although they were enemies to all Superiority,
necessity and nature forcing them to chuse some governours, but
the Prophets over-ruled all: one of the first orders that they
made was, that every man should bring his gold, silver, and
goods into the common stock upon paine of death: and there
were two maiden Prophetesses that discovered the Concealers;
also they ordered that all books should be burnt but the Bible,
which was performed. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leiden</hi> being in a Propheticall
Trance after he had slept three dayes, pretending to be dumbe,
called for writing Tables,<note place="margin">Hortens. p. 26.</note> in which he writ downe that it was
the will of the heavenly Father, that twelve men by him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
should governe the City, which was also put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the ancient Magistrate being discharged. Also that it was
the good will of the Father that a man should not bee tyed to
one Wife,<note place="margin">Page 28.</note> but to marry as many as he pleased: when some
would not approve of this Doctrine, he cyted them before the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62593:15"/>
twelve Governours, swearing upon the new Testament that
this Doctrine was revealed to him from heaven, and to testifie
the evidence of the spirit, hee commanded some of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
to be beheaded: forthwith many Preachers confirmed
this Doctrine, but the greatest confirmation was the Prophets
practise, who presently married 3. wives, &amp; left not till he had
fifteen: many followed his example, and it was accounted a
matter of praise to have many wives: After the promulgation
of this Ordinance, the Brethren ran to the hansomest women,
striving who should be first served, and lay with them without
any contract.</p>
                  <p>After this,<note place="margin">Hortc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Congregation together, and declared that it was the will of the
heavenly Father, that <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> should be King of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse;
That he should sit upon the Throne of his Father <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>
That he should kill all the Kings and Princes, destroy the
ungodly, and save the people that loved righteousnesse. This
Prophesie the multitude entertained, and proclaimed <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Leyden</hi> King of Zion with great acclamations.</p>
                  <p>The new King being a Tailor, made use of his skill, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
the Copes and Carpets of the Churches into Robes, and
set forth his Majesty in gold and silver, his horses were also su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
harnessed, with saddles and foot-cloathes embroydered
with gold: he rode abroad in very great state, having his chiefe
Officers before him; next before him were two young men,
the one carrying a Bible, the other a sword: He himself wore
a great chaine like the Collar of some Order; his Motto was
<hi>Rex justitiae hujus mundi,</hi> the King of righteousnesse of this
world. After him followed fifty Pensioners well clad: three
times a week he kept Court, sitting upon a high Throne in
great Magnificence, under him sate <hi>Knipper dolling</hi> Governour
of the City, and lower, his foure great Counsellours of State: In
that Court he judged all Controversies, most of which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Divorces, for by their new orders any man that was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his wife, might put her away and take another. Among
other memorable acts of this new King, I read, that one of
his wives offending him, he tooke her into the Market-place
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62593:15"/>
and cut off her head, causing the rest of his wives to dance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her, and give thanks to their heavenly Father, and then the
King began to dance himself, commanding the people to dance
with him. Againe <hi>Thuscocurer</hi> the Prophet came to the King
sitting in his Throne in more than ordinary Majesty, saying to
him, King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Gospel must be renewed by thee. <hi>Thus
saith the Lord God, goe and say to the King of Zion, that hee
prepare my Supper in the Church-yard of the great Church:
and that he send forth Preachers of my word into the foure
quarters of the world to teach all Nations the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and to bring them by the spirit of their mouthes into
my Sheep-fold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a publike Communion was celebrated,<note place="margin">Sleidan 154. Ho ten p. 34.</note> which they made
a full meale: a great Feast it was, both for persons, as also for
meat, for there were about foure thousand Communicants,
and three courses of meat; but between them (saith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
there was an entercourse, for the King accused a man of
Treason, and cut off his head and returned againe, and with
bloudy hands he tooke upon him to administer the body and
bloud of Christ, assisted with the Queen, who did the office of
a Deacon, the like did the principall Officers of State. After
Supper the King asked the people, whether they were all hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
disposed to doe Gods will, and to suffer and dye for the
faith: To whom the people answered with one voyce, that
they would.</p>
                  <p>Then rose the Prophet and said; <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 35.</note> 
                     <hi>chuse

things among strange people.</hi> Then he read the names of 28. of
whom himselfe was one; these Apostles went to the Cities to
which they were sent, crying in the streets that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
or else shortly be destroyed: these men were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Cities and put to death, and so there was an end of
their Apostleship.</p>
                  <p>All this while the City was besieged by Count <hi>Waldeck</hi> the

their owne children. The Princes of the Empire assembled at
<hi>Coblents,</hi> pittying the seduced people, sent letters to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Munster,</hi> representing to them their fault and danger
they were in, and that if they did not submit to their naturall
Prince, they should draw the whole force of the Empire upon
them: this was about <hi>December, 1534, Hilversum</hi> also one
of their Prophets being taken by the besiegers, writ out of the
Camp a most sensible Letter to the people of <hi>Munster,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he acknowledgeth that his former Prophesies were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
and entreated them to open their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yes to see how they
were deluded by a company of Rascalls, what a beastly life
they lead, having violated all Lawes of pudicity and honestie.
These Letters moved the hearts of many, who were weary of
their lives that they lived in, and were also pinched with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and they began to murmour against the King, who calling
them together made a fine speech to them, saying that he would
never have thought that they being born again by a new bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
would shew themselves so impatient for Gods cause
whereas they should have followed St. <hi>Pauls</hi> example, bearing
nakednesse, hunger, and cold to attaine the heaven of salvation:
That God was powerfull enough to send them <hi>Manna</hi> and
<hi>Quailes</hi> from heaven? That he had great Troops in <hi>Holland</hi>
and <hi>Freezeland,</hi> that would certainly come with great provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of victualls and beare the enemy back? That God had
revealed to him that at Eafter they should be delivered for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
Finally, the Towne was taken, <hi>Iune</hi> 1535. having
endured a siege of eighteen moneths: after the taking of the
Towne, it was ordered that the innocent people should be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and that all the good Citizens that were come out or kept
in by force, should have restitution of their goods. The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
that yeelded were spared, but the fierce <hi>Anabaptists</hi>
who could never bee tamed, and lay hid in severall holes,
were sought out and killed. The King resisted to the last,
and being taken with <hi>Knipperdoling</hi> and others, was sent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
to a Castle, drawne thither, tyed to a horse taile; hee
was condemned and executed as a Traitor, being tyed to a
stake, and pulled in divers parts of his body with hot pincers
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62593:16"/>
for an houre and more, and then stricken to the heart with a
dagger: with him suffered <hi>Knipperdoling.</hi> The King ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
his Errors; but <hi>Knipperdoling</hi> dyed like a mad beast:
After their deathes they were put into Iron Cages, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon the high steeple of St. <hi>Lambert.</hi> Thus dyed this
imaginary King, and <hi>Anabaptistrie</hi> was suppressed in <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> had surprised <hi>Munster,</hi> so they had
the like projects in many other places, but with ill successe:
As one <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Geles</hi> was sent to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and finding
the people fit objects for his delusions, hee told them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the new Kingdome of righteousnesse at <hi>Munster,</hi>
their liberty of living, their pillaging of Churches, and the
inriching themselves with the goods of the ungodly, and of
the great designes of their King, of the prophesies of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of his Kingdome, with such discourses. In their
private Conventicles they filled the mindes of the people with
a frantick zeale, and made them long to be fing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing Church-Plate,
and the goods of the ungodly, pretending that it was
an easie matter to surprise <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> which Town (with
others) God had given to the King of <hi>Zion,</hi> as the first fruits
of his Reigne over the world: Hereupon they enterprised
the taking of the Towne, and to kill the Magistrates as they
were feasting in their Towne house; but by the providence
of God they were deceived of their purpose. They wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Signall, which was the ringing of the Towne-Bell,
which was not done, (a drunken man having taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the rope) the Company assembled not: many of the
<hi>Anabaptists</hi> were slaine, and others received condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> after the death of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> chose
another King, who with his high Treasurer was taken at
<hi>Virecht</hi> and kept in prison: among the exployts of that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
King, he brought his wife into a wood and there killed
her,<note place="margin">Hort. page 74.</note> that without interruption he might lye with her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and he also cut a young wenches throat, lost she should

                     <p>The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> attribute too much in this Sacrament to
their repentance, faith, mortification, and merit, and little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Gods mercy, which is most contrary to the nature of
this holy Sacrament, which sealeth up unto us out receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Gods favour and grace for his owne mercies sake without
any merit of ours.</p>
                     <p>To palliate this their abhominable error, they pervert divers
places of holy Scripture, as <hi>Matth. 28. Mar.</hi> 10. Out of the
order of words, <hi>Goe and teach all Nations, baptizing them:</hi>
Because that teaching is set befor baptizing, they would have
children taught before they are baptized.</p>
                     <p>To this I answer, 1. Whereas teaching is set before bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. Baptizing is set before teaching, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 4.
John <hi>did baptize in the wildernesse, and teach the baptisme of
repentance:</hi> And againe, where it is said, <hi>repent and beleeve:</hi>
whether is faith or repentance first required?</p>
                     <p>But where finde you (say they) a literall command in all the
new Testament for the Baptisme of Infants?</p>
                     <p>To this I answer: The new Testament doth not literally
command, <hi>Remember to keep holy the Lords day,</hi> nor to say
grace before and after meales, or to pray with our Families eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or morning or for women to receive the Communion, and
many other such like things, which are moral duties, &amp; may be
sufficiently proved by consequence out of the holy Scriptures.
As for example in this very Text which they alleadge against
the baptisme of children: the baptisme of children is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
<hi>Goe and teach all Nations, baptizing, &amp;c.</hi> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, goe and teach all them that are capable of teaching and
baptize them that are capable of baptizing: to make this more
plaine.</p>
                     <p>Is a man should bid his servant, goe sheare all my sheep and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62593:20"/>
mark them: if that servant should sheare all his sheep, and mark
them only that he had shorn, and not mark his Lambs, because
he could not shear them: doth that servant fulfill his Masters
command? No more had the Apostles done, if they had not
marked his lambs as well as his sheep; although they were
not capable of teaching, yet they were capable of marking or
baptizing. In lawes and precepts that be generall, the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of singulars are not necessary; because lawes doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the whole kind: and therefore the holy Apostles bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed

16. 33. Lydda</hi> and her houshold, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 15. The houshold
of <hi>Stephanus, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 16, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Again, whereas our Lord commandeth, <hi>Mark 10. Suffer
little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.</hi> How pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
can an Infant come unto Christ but by Baptisme? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
they cannot, beleeve they cannot, as the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm:
But by baptisme they may come, where the Minister
in Christs stend receiveth them and blesseth them; and why all
this? <hi>Of such is the Kingdome of God,</hi> and therefore saith our
Lord, <hi>Forbid them not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Acts 2. 39. The promise is mad: to you and
your children;</hi> and therefore be baptized. To whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is made, and covenant, let no man forbid baptisme, which
is the seal of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Again, the faith of the Parents may warrant their Infants
baptisme: yea, though they have but an hystoricall faith, and
not a justifying, if they can <hi>credere ad baptismum,</hi> though not
<hi>adsalutem:</hi> this faith maketh their children capable of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme:

                     <p>That a Christian man may not take an oath,<note place="margin">Error 3.</note> because Christ
saith. <hi>Thou shall not sweare at all,</hi> which is repeated, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.
And that it is enough to say, <hi>Yea, yea,</hi> and <hi>nay, nay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ doth not forbid an oath before a Magistrate,
as it is a testimony of truth: he reproveth the Pharisees, who
taught men that they should sweare, not onely by the name of
God, as God had commanded, but also by heaven by the earth,
by their heads, &amp;c. This vitious kind of swearing he forbiddeth,
onely because these things cannot be witnesses of the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred,
nor punish lying. Neither doe the words following,
<hi>Let your communication be yea, yea,</hi> and <hi>nay, nay,</hi> take away
a lawfull oath; but admonish the godly of the goodnesse of
truth, and hatred of lies. That a godly man may lawfully take
an oath, appeareth by these reasons, following: 1. From the
authority of holy Scripture, <hi>By the name of God thou shalt
sweare,</hi> Deut. 6. 4. The reason is set down, <hi>Heb. 6. Because
the Lord is greater, and that an oath is the end of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies:</hi>
so Psal. 15. <hi>He that sweareth to his neighbour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
him not.</hi> 2. From the example of Christ and holy men
in the old and new Testament, <hi>Genes.</hi> 24. 26. 3. From the
worship of God: for an oath is part of Gods worship, being
a calling upon God to be a witnesse of the truth, and an aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the lie.</p>

                  <p>BEfore you have heard of the condition of these Hereticks
in times past: but with griefe of heart I speake it. Now
they lift up their heads, they write books and publish them in

the one by one <hi>Edw: Barber,</hi> and two other by <hi>A. R.</hi> Anno
1642. A fourth by one <hi>Lamb,</hi> with others, and this without any
controle that I can heare of. Yea, they challenge our Divines
openly to defend their Tenets by disputation, and to satisfie the
people. Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> gave them a meeting in <hi>Southwarke,</hi>
where foure of their Disputants appeared on their side, besides

and obscene ones, which he taught unto little children his
Schollers, and to Mistris <hi>May,</hi> who used in her house to sing
such songs, being more fit for a common Bawde, then for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
professing the pure separation. They object against all the
Churches in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> that they have Organs to modulate
their voices in singing: Sure I am, the <hi>Separatists</hi> also had

                  <p>Here I might aske some questions, <hi>viz.</hi> why singing set
Psalmes doth not confine the spirit, (we being commanded
to sing with the spirit) as much as saying set Prayers; and why
the brethren inspired with the spirit, doe not every day sing a
new song, as make a new Prayer, which are set prayers to the
People? and why the people may not pray together with the
Minister (as it was the custome of al Christian Churches) as sing
together: And lastly, why Lay-men doe not pray in the Church
aswel as preach or prophesie in the Church: Do they not in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding

the people to pray with the Minister, as the Papists do

this Sect was one Mr. <hi>Robert Browne,</hi> before named: from

These deny all communion with her; but private communion
they hold lawfull with her members.</p>
                  <p>As for the ancient company of <hi>Brownists</hi> that were under the

as dung by the Testimony of Master <hi>George Iohnson,</hi> and not

                  <p>The second sort of <hi>Brownists</hi> may bee called <hi>Barrawists</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Barrowists.</note>
from their Protomartyr <hi>Barrow,</hi> whose censures are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
then the former, who say that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
is <hi>Sodome, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and that shee was never the

with Infidels? And therefore they proclaime the former Sect,
(for not judging the Church of England so desperately as they
judge her) to be partakers of her adulteries, and that they must
receive of her plagues.</p>
                  <p>Of this Sect <hi>Barrow</hi> was the Father; afterwards <hi>Greenwood,
Brewer, Bois, Rutter.</hi>

                  <p>A third sort of <hi>Brownists</hi> did arise from one Mr. <hi>Wilkinson,</hi>

                  <p>A fourth sort of <hi>Brownists,</hi> who say that there is not any

of judgement is already come, and that <hi>H. N.</hi> judgeth the

his Gospell (in time) shall be rooted out of the world, and
that this Family of Love shall inherit and inhabite the earth

the body, as now men doe, and their soules goe to heaven, but
their Posterities shall continue for ever. This deceiver describeth
eight through-breakings of the light (as he tearmeth them) to
have been in eight severall times, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the time that
now is, which (as he saith) have each exceeded other. The
seventh he alloweth Iesus Christ to be the publisher of, and his
light to be the greatest of all that ever were before him; and he
maketh his owne to be the eight and last and greatest, and the
perfection of all, in and by which Christ is perfected, meaning
holinesse; he maketh every one of his Family of Love to be
Christ; yea, and God, and himselfe God, and Christ in a more
excellent manner, saying that he is godded with God, and
co-deified with him, and that God is hominified with him.

in them hominified, or become man. 2. The young Disciples
are <hi>Adams,</hi> and the illuminated Elders Christs. 3. The eldest
Father of the Family is Christ himselfe. 4. That the estate of
all such as are not of this Sect is a false being, the Antichrist, the
wicked spirit, the kingdome of hell, and the devill himselfe.
5. The Family of Love is perfect in this life, and therefore
that they must not pray for forgivenesse of sins. 6. That their
illuminated Elders doe not sinne. 7. They may ioyne with
any Congregation and Church, and live under the obedience
of any Magistrate though never so ungodly. 8. Whatsoever
is taught by any other then by their illuminated Elders is false:
Such as despise their Family shall bee consumed with everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
fire.</p>
                  <p>Moreover they hold:</p>
                  <p>1. That he who is one of their Congregation is either as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as Christ, or else a very divell.</p>
                  <p>2. That it is lawfull to doe whatsoever the higher Powers
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62593:55"/>
command to be done, though it be done against the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God.</p>
                  <p>3. That it is ridiculous to say, God the Father, God the Son,
God the holy Ghost; as though by saying these words, they
should affirme to be three Gods.</p>
                  <p>4. That every man ought first to be in an errour before he can
come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
                  <p>5. That heaven and hell are present in this world among us,
and that there is none other.</p>
                  <p>6. That they are bound to give almes to none other persons
but to those of their Sect, and if they otherwise doe, they give
their Almes to the divell.</p>
                  <p>7. That they ought not to burie their dead: because it is said,
<hi>let the dead bury the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. That none ought to receive their Sacraments before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
their whole Ordinances, as 1. He must be admitted with
a kisse, then his feet must be washed, then hands laid on him, and
so received.</p>
                  <p>9. That the Angels <hi>Raphael,</hi> and <hi>Gabriel</hi> and others were
borne of a woman.</p>
                  <p>10. That they ought not to say <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes as Prayers,
being righteous and without sinne.</p>
                  <p>11. That there ought to be no Sabbath day, but that all
should be alike.</p>
                  <p>12. That Christ is come forth of the flesh as he came forth
of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. That there was a world before <hi>Adams</hi> time as is now.</p>
                  <p>14. That the Law of God is possible to be kept of every man
that will endeavour himselfe thereto.</p>
                  <p>15. That it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>pedient that they should make manifest their

God mutable, &amp; overthrow the comfort of the godly concerning

certainty of immutable election unto glory, but upon condition,
contingent and mutable: for besides that, it is absurd to make
an uncertaine certainty. These things contrary to the experience
of the godly, who with the Apostle, triumph upon the sence of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62593:67"/>

                     </gap>hy even
such morall grace alone should not of naturall men make spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.
Nay moreover, that God doth not produce the consent
of our will otherwise then by way of morall counselling, and
that the efficacy of Gods working, wherein he exceedeth the
working of the devill, cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

temporary things, but Gods things eternall.</p>
                  <p>This is downe-right Pelagianisme, and warreth against the
whole course of Scriptures, which besides this swasory course of
moving acknowledgeth in the conversion of man another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of working of Gods spirit, and that more divine and of farre
greater efficacy, <hi>Ezek. 36. 26. I will give you a new heart
and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away
the stony heart out of yur flesh, and will give you an heart of
flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. That God in regenerating a man doth not imply that
omnipotent strength whereby he may powerfully and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
bow and bend his will unto faith and conversion; but that
all the gracious operations which God useth for our conversion
being accomplished, neverthelesse man may withstand God, and
his holy Spirit intending that mans conversion; yea, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
doth make actuall resistance; so it lyeth in mans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to be, or not to be regenarate.</p>
                  <p>This amounteth to no lesse then the denying of all efficacy to
Gods grace in our conversion, and to the subjecting of the
worke of Almighty God unto the will of man, which is flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Doctrine of the Apostles, <hi>Eph. 1. 19. That we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> And 2 <hi>Thes.
1. 11. That God fulfilleth all the pleasure of his goodnesse, and
the worke of faith with power.</hi> And 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 3. That Gods
power hath given to us all things that pertaine to life and
godlinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. They teach, that grace and free-will are co-partening
causes joyntly concurring to the beginning of conversion, and
that grace doth not in the order of casuality goe before the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the will. That is, that God doth effectually helpe mans
will to conversion before the will of man moveth and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
or setleth it selfe thereunto.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine was long since condemned by the ancient
Church among the Pelagian Errors out of the Apostles Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>Romans 9. 16. It is not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.

                  <p>1. THey teach, that the perseverance of the faithfull is not an
effect of election, nor any gift of God purchased by the

may totally and finally fall from justifying saith, as also from
grace and salvation, but that frequently also they indeed do fall
from all these, and perish everlastingly.</p>

The opposers of this assurance do evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly shew that they know

They are also refuted by the examples of holy men both in the

                  <p>7. They teach that the faith of those that beleeve but for a
season differeth no: from justifying and saving faith, but onely
in respect of continuance: Christ himselfe manifestly puts, <hi>Mat.
13. 20. Luke</hi> 8. 13. a three-fold disparison between temporisors
and true beleevers, saying that those receive the seed in a stony
ground, these in a good ground, that is, an honest and good
heart: these want root, these have a fast root, these are fruitlesse,
these bring forth their fruit with diversity of yeeld, &amp; that with
patience, that is, with constancy and perseverance.</p>
                  <p>8. They teach that it is absurd that a man should lose his first
regeneration, and be again new-borne spiritually.</p>
                  <p>They that reach this, do thereby deny the uncorruptiblenesse
of that divine seed whereof we are borne anew, contrary to the

9. They teach that Christ never prayed for the faithfulls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible

               <p>SO called of one Mr. <hi>John Traske,</hi> whom the Author knew

One <hi>Theophilus Braborne</hi> endeavoured with him to

to be an everlasting holy day in the Christian Church, and the
religious observation of this day obligeth Christians under the

                  <p>3. That the Sunday, or Lords day is an ordinary working
day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an it is superstition and will-worship to make the same
the Sabbath of the fourth Commandement. Of this opinion was
<hi>Theophilus Braborne.</hi> As the Anabaptists will have no children

he writ a recantation of all his Schismaticall errors.</p>
                  <p>Also <hi>Theophilus Braborne</hi> had his doome in the Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

a Spanish Souldier, who was maimed by the <hi>French</hi>
at the siege of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> his right leg being broken by a shot,
and his left leg with a stone cast from the wall.</p>
               <p>This Order boasteth much of heavenly visions, and divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
(not unlike the <hi>Coetanij</hi> the <hi>Anabaptists</hi>) is that the
blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> appeared to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> with her Son <hi>Iesus</hi>
in her armes: perswading him to erect this Order, to which she
promised to be propitious. They will tell you that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was
rapped up into heaven and that Almighty God shewed him the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> or frame by which he created the world, with many such
like fancies. Moreover, whereas other orders beare the name of
their founders; as the <hi>Dominicans</hi> of <hi>Dominicke;</hi> the <hi>Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62593:78"/>
of <hi>Francis,</hi> they beare the name of Jesus: whereas (saith
my Author) they came from the devill, the father of lyes, they
being the last Engine and device of Satan to supplant the truth.
This Order was confirmed <hi>Anno</hi> 1540. by <hi>Paul</hi> the third Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome. Gregory</hi> the 13. Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> gave to the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
a place in <hi>Rome</hi> called the <hi>Island,</hi> in which they demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
many houses, turned many widdowes out of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and built themselves a most magnificent and sumptuous
Colledge. It is reported, that it cost in building 25. Tun of gold,
in which the Pope placed 500. Jesuites of severall nations.</p>
               <p>2. For their government, the Jesuites have a chife, whom
they call their Generall, who attendeth upon the Pope in <hi>Rome,</hi>
their late General was <hi>Claudius Aquaviva,</hi> his Office is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
the whole Order, and to make new orders: and their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls
commands the Jesuites receive as divine oracles. They
believe and obey their Generall as Christ himselfe.</p>
               <p>Next their General they have foure Assistants, who, as their
Generall attendeth the Pope, so doe they attend their Generall.
The office of these four are to promote the Popes authority into
the foure quarters of the world. The <hi>Iesuites</hi> their Emissaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
signifie unto them in writing how Princes stand affected
to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, theie office is with the Generall to send Governors,
Visiters, Recters, and preachers to the whole Order, and to send
forth the inferiour Jesuites into all places of the world, who take
upon them all manner of fashions: to doe mischiefe among soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
they are arrayed like souldiers: in Princes Courts like No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men,

yea, sometimes they beg of Protestant Ministers, as men
banished for religion: And all this to dive into the secrets of
State, and to disclose the Counsells of Princes.</p>
               <p>3. For their Errors, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> setteth downe 26. some sew
of which I purpose to relate, and especially those in which they
differ from other Papists.</p>
               <p>First, they presumptuously arrogate to themselves the name of
Iesus, which is a name above all names.</p>
               <p>2. They place their Generall in equall authority with Christ,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62593:79"/>
saying, <hi>the voyce of our Generall is the voyce of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Jesuites generally maintaine the Popes temporall
power, as well as spiritual, that he may depose Kings, and dispose
of their kingdomes, which the <hi>French</hi> Papists doe not allow of,
<hi>viz.</hi> Their decree set forth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1611. and among us, <hi>Hart,
Bartley, Preston,</hi> and others disclaime this power given by the
Jesuites to the Pope.</p>
               <p>4. They deny the lawfulnes of the Oath of Allegiance, which
the secular Priests doe all generally allow and take: See <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
Howard, Widrington,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Safe guard
from Ship wrack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The Jesuites also teach it to be not onely lawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also
meritorious to lay hands upon the <hi>Lords Anoynted,</hi> and to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Heretick Kings after the Pope hath declared them to bee
such: see <hi>Mariana, Anti-Cotton;</hi> but the secular Priests dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
and abhor this doctrine.</p>
               <p>6. The Jesuites hold that the Pope is onely <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> a
Bishop, and that all other Bishops hold from him: but the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi>
of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and the French Bishops, with many other,
hold Bishops to be <hi>Iure Divino:</hi> see the History of the Councel
of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. The Jesuites with the Franciscans beleeve the immaculate
conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which the Dominicans and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Papists doe deny.</p>
               <p>8. The Jesuites with the <hi>Pelagians &amp; Arminians,</hi> hold that
God worketh in our conversion onely <hi>moraliter,</hi> by way of
swasion; but Jacobites and other Papists, especially the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
(as we may see in <hi>Alvares</hi> and others) maintain with all
Orthodox Divines, that God worketh Physically, &amp; <hi>per modum
physici agentis</hi> by powerfull inclining the faculty of the will.</p>
               <p>For confutation of these errors, so many books are written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them in English, and some of them are confuted before,
so that I may save my labour.</p>
               <p>These are the most pernitious and dangerous sort of all others.
These are not ignorant Sots, like the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and others,
but educated and brought up in all manner of humane learning,
and so more able to doe mischiefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:62593:79"/>
These take upon them to justifie all the Errors and abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Antichrist; yea, their Idolatries, and Sodomiticall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse
they will defend and maintain.</p>
               <p>And have they not for this cause, (a thing most abhominable
to be spoken of) corrupted the writings of the ancient Fathers,
and new printing of them, make them speak as they wou'd have
them, and also written many books in their names to beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with them of their novelties? A volume will not containe
their cumbustions that they have raised in kingdoms and States.
Their plotting of Treasons, and especially the Powder-treason, a
divillish designe, not to be beleeved in ages to come. Their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of Princes, &amp; all these under pretence of holines. O God,

will set downe, how by a pretended delusion of theirs, a few
of them had almost perverted a whole kingdome of Christians,
in which there is a Patriarke and eighteen Bishops. In the year
of our Lord, 1614. <hi>Tenurazes</hi> being King of the <hi>Georgians,</hi> the

to death, and her body cast out into the fields, left unburied to
be eaten of wild beasts. There being at that time certaine Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
in <hi>Persia,</hi> they sought for her body but found it not, (for
<hi>Moacla,</hi> a late servant of liers, who was slave to a <hi>Persian,</hi> got
leave of her Master to bring home the body and embalme it) the
Jesuites found a dead mans head, and embalming it, travelled
towards <hi>Georgia</hi> with it: and drawing neare, they sent a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
to the King, to let him understand that certaine <hi>Roman</hi>
Christians were come out of <hi>Persia</hi> who brought with them the
head of the holy Martyr <hi>Cetaba</hi> his Mother, which had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them out of many dangers. The Prince hearing this went

and brought the holy Relique to <hi>Chachete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and celebrity placed it in the Church of the holy Martyr St.
<hi>George</hi> of <hi>Aberdall,</hi> and used them with all respect, and sent
them great gifts, which they refused, saying that they had vowed
poverty: Infinite miracles were wrought dayly, great offerings
they had, the sick resorted to them. Those that were past cure,
they told them that their sins were great, and they needed a
long time of Penance which they prescribed them, and after to
returne, before which time they usually dyed: others of whom
they had hope of recovery, they used means, being Physitians, &amp;
attributed their health to the holy Relique, and to the Bishop of

                  <p>A Jesuite (saith he) is a larger spoone for a Traytor to seed
with the Devill than any other Order. Unclasp him, and
he is a gray Wolfe with a golden star in his fore-head. So super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious,
he follw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

giving <hi>Caesar</hi> his due. His vowes seem heavenly, but with med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

together. His best Elements are Confession and Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ance; by
the first he findeth out mens inclinations, and by the latter heaps
wealth to his Seminary. Hee sprang from <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> a
Spanish Souldier, and though he had long since found out the
invention of the Canon, he thought he had not done mischiefe
enough. He is a false key to open Princes Cabinets, and pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Counsells; and where the Popes Excommunication
thunders, he holds the de-crowning of Kings to be no more sin,
then our Puritans doe the suppressing of Bishops. The Order
tis full of irregularity and disobedience, and ambitious above
all measure; for of late dayes in <hi>Portugall</hi> and the <hi>Indies</hi> he
rejected the name of Jesuite, and would be called Apostles Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
In <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Countries that give him freedome, he
weares a maske upon his heart: In <hi>England</hi> he shuffles in, and
puts it upon his face. No place in our Climate hideth him so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
as a Ladies Chamber. The modesty of the Pursevant
hath onely forborne the bed, and so mist him.</p>
                  <p>There is no disease in Christendome that may so properly be
called the Kings evill. To conclude, will you know him beyond
the Sea? In his Seminary he is a Fox; but in the Inquisition a
Lyon Rampant.</p>

the former Sectaries; their doctrines being many of them new.
In describing of then Errors, I purpose to shew their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from the Protestants, which are set down at large in Master
<hi>Perkins</hi> Reformed Catholike.</p>
               <p>1. Concerning Free-will;<note place="margin">1. Concerning Free-will.</note> the dissent is in the cause of the
freedome of mans will in spirituall things, and especially in the
first conversion of a sinner. The Papists say, that mans will
worketh with Gods grace in the first Conversion of a sinner by
it selfe: we say that mans will worketh with Gods grace in the
first Conversion, yet not of it selfe, but by grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>2. Concerning Originall sinne;<note place="margin">2. Original sin.</note> the difference between them
and us standeth not in the abolishment of it, but in the manner
and measure of the abolishment of it. They affirme Originall
sinne to be so farre taken away after Baptisme, that it ceaseth to
be sinne properly, and is nothing else but a defect, and want,
making the heart ready to conceive sinne: we teach, although
it be taken away in the Regenerace in sundry respect: yet it
doth remaine in them, not as a want or defect, but as sin, and that
properly, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17.</p>
               <p>3. Of the certainty of salvation,<note place="margin">3. Certainty of salvation.</note> we hold that a man may
bee certaine of his salvation in this life. They also hold the

                  <p>2. That the righteousnesse whereby man is justified commeth
from Christ, and from him alone.</p>
                  <p>3. The most learned of them say, that the merit of Christs
death is imputed to every sinner that doth beleeve for his satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
before God.</p>
                  <p>We say that the satisfaction made by Christs death and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is imputed to us, and becommeth our righteousnes. They
say it is our satisfaction, and not our righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>The second difference is about the manner of our justification;
we both agree that a sinner is justified by Faith: The difference
is, the Papists understand a generall faith; whereby a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
the Articles of Religion to be true. Wee hold the faith
which justifieth to be a particuler faith; wherby we apply to our

it be used in a good manner.</p>
                  <p>Our distent is in three things. First, they prescribe certaine

Faith, Humility, Meeknesse, Repentance, and good vertues, in
which they excelled. The difference stands in the manner of
worshipping of Saints. The Papists make two degrees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

worshipped, and that alone <hi>Douleia,</hi> whereby the Saints and
Angels are worshipped: We also distinguish adoration or
worship for it is either Religious, or Civill; Religious worship
we give to God alone, Civill worship we give to men. To come

the Saints, being absent from us; much lesse any religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

that they are to maintaine the Minister of their owne

of Tithes, and the Ordinance of Parliament for the true pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them. The non-payment whereof, is one of the chiefe
inducements, that the <hi>Brownists</hi> and some other Sectaries
have to entise the silly people, and to poyson them with their
other errors: which they learnt from the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who
taught also, that Christian men were to pay no rent, nor
submit to any government: for which the <hi>German</hi> Princes

rooted them out of their Dominions.</p>
               <p>Now these latter Hereticks daring not to forbid payment
of rent, nor Magistracy, raile altogether upon the payment of
Tithes, and the Ordinance for Tithes, lately set out by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

in which Tithes are Ceremoniall, as the Sacrifices were,
which were types and figures of Christs Sacrifice, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
once for all, and in him determined.</p>
               <p>Or where Christ or his Apostles may but seeme to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated,
abolished, or changed them, or why the Law for
Tithes should be more abolished then the Law for the Sabbath:
The service of God continuing, why should not the maintenance
thereof continue.</p>
               <p>To conclude, as the Christians, so also the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who
are much more numerous than the Christians, pay their Tithes
with great conscience, the <hi>detention</hi> of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is one of the grand
sinnes, which the two inquisitor Angels of their Law doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
soules after death, <hi>viz. Whether they have payd their
Tithes without fraud,</hi> as witnesseth <hi>Ioannes Baptist a Alfaqui,</hi>
who had been a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Priest. The wisedome of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God,</hi> the practise of all ages, the example of Patriarks,
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> yea the Commandement of God hath
taught us to render God a tenth.</p>
               <p>If this will not suffice, wee have another right, a Title as
good, and as ancient, as any man can shew for his lands; that
is, <hi>the donation of Tithes to the Church,</hi> confirmed by the Kings
and Parliaments of this Kingdome from time to time, ever since
Christianity flourished amongst us. For this <hi>vid.</hi> my <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nography,</hi>
