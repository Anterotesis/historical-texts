         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>IF thou blame me for writing again, on a Subject which I have written on ſo oft, and ſo lately (ſpecially in my <hi>Life of Faith,</hi> and Diſputations of Juſtification) I ſhall not blame thee for ſo doing; but I ſhall excuſe my ſelf by telling thee my reaſons. 1. The occaſion is many loud accuſations of my ſelf, of which I have before given an account. I publiſh it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee the Contention ſtill ſo hot in the Church of Chriſt, and mens Charity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed againſt each other; one ſide calling the other <hi>Socinians,</hi> and the other <hi>Libertines,</hi> (who are neither of them <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) and if I miſtake not, for the moſt part in the dark about <hi>one Phraſe,</hi> and that of mens deviſing, rather than about the ſence: But if indeed it be the ſence that they differ about, it's time to do our beſt to rectifie ſuch Fundamental Errours.</p>
                        <p>I find that all of us agree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all the Phraſes of Scripture. And a Mans Sence is no way known but by his expreſſions: The
<pb facs="tcp:45239:3"/>
queſtion is then, Which is the <hi>neceſſary Phraſe</hi> which we muſt expreſs our ſence by? We all ſay that to Believers, <hi>Chriſt is made our Righteouſneſs; We are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him; He hath ranſomed, redeemed us, as a Sacrifice for our ſins, a price; He hath merited and obtained eternal Redemption for us, that Sin is remitted, covered, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; that Righteouſneſs is Reckoned or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us; that Faith is Imputed to us for Righteouſneſs,</hi> and any thing elſe that is in the Scripture. But all this will not ſerve to make us Chriſtians! What is wanting? Why, we muſt ſay that <hi>Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is Imputed to us as ours, and that Chriſt ſatisfied for our ſins!</hi> Well; The thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified ſeemeth to us true and good and needful, (though the Scripture hath as good words for it as any of us can invent.) We conſent therefore to uſe theſe Phraſes, ſo be it you put no falſe and wicked ſence on them by <hi>other words</hi> of your own: Though we will not allow them to be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> becauſe not in Scripture; (And we are more againſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding new Fundamental Articles of Faith to the Scripture, than againſt adding new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Forms or Ceremonies). But yet it will not ſerve: what is yet wanting? why, we muſt hold theſe words in a right ſenſe! What? yet are not your own deviſed
<pb facs="tcp:45239:3"/>
words a ſufficient expreſſion of the matter! When we have opened <hi>thoſe words</hi> by <hi>other words,</hi> how will you know that we uſe thoſe <hi>other words</hi> in a right ſence, and <hi>ſo in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Our ſence is, that <hi>Righteouſneſs is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, that is, we are accounted Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe for the Merits of Chriſts total fulfilling the Conditions of his Mediatorial Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Father, by his Habitual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, his Actual Perfect Obedience, and his Sacrifice, or ſatisfactory Suffering for our ſins in our ſtead, freely without any merit or Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal act of mans, God hath made an Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion and Deed of Gift, pardoning all ſin, juſtifying and adopting and giving Right to the Spirit and Life eternally to every one that believingly accepteth Chriſt and the Gifts with and by and from him. And when we accept them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are all ours by virtue of this purchaſed Covenant-Gift.</hi> This is our ſhort and plain explication. But yet this will not ſerve: Chriſtianity is yet another thing. What is wanting? Why, we muſt ſay, that <hi>Chriſt was habitually and actually perfectly Holy and Obedient, Imputatively in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, and that each one of us did perfectly fulfil that Law which requireth perfect Habits and Acts in and by Chriſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, and yet did alſo in and by him ſuffer our ſelves Imputatively for not fulfilling it, and
<pb facs="tcp:45239:4"/>Imputatively did our ſelves both ſatisfy God's Justice and merit Heaven; and that we have our ſelves Imputatively a Righteouſneſs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holineſs and Obedience as ſinleſs, and muſt be juſtified by the Law of Innocency, or Works, as having our ſelves imputatively ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it in Chriſt; And that this is our ſole Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; and that Faith it ſelf is not imputed to us for Righteouſneſs; no not a meer particular ſubordinate Righteouſneſs, anſwering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional part of the new Juſtifying Covenant, as neceſſary to our participation of Christ, and his freely given Righteouſneſs.</hi> And muſt all this go into our Chriſtianity! But where is it written? who deviſed it? was it in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Creeds and Baptiſm? Or known in the Church for five thouſand years from the Creation? I profeſs I take the Pope to be no more to be blamed for making a new Church-Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than for making us ſo many new Articles of Faith: And I will not juſtifie thoſe that Symbolize with him, or imitate him in either.</p>
                        <p>But yet many of the men that do this, are good men in other reſpects: and I love their <hi>zeal</hi> that doth all this evil, <hi>as it is for God</hi> and the <hi>honour of Jeſus Christ,</hi> though I love it not as blind, nor their Errour or their Evil. But how hard is it to know what Spirit we are of! But it is the doleful
<pb facs="tcp:45239:4"/>
miſchief which their blind zeal doth, that maketh me ſpeak; That three or four of them have made it their practice to back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite my ſelf, and tell People, <hi>He holdeth dangerous opinions; He is erroneous in the point of Juſtification. And his Books are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and have dangerous Doctrines; He lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the old way of Juſtification, he favoureth Socinianiſm,</hi> and ſuch-like: this is a ſmall matter comparatively. Back-biting and <hi>falſe reports,</hi> are the ordinary fruits of <hi>bitter contentious Zeal,</hi> and the Spirit of a <hi>Sect</hi> as ſuch doth uſually ſo work (yea to confuſion and every evil work,) when it hath baniſhed the <hi>Zeal</hi> of Love and of Good Works. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. And I never counted it any great loſs to their followers, that they diſſwade them from the reading of my writings (as the Papiſts do their Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes) as long as God hath bleſt our Land with ſo many better.</p>
                        <p>But there are other effects that command me once again to ſpeak to them.</p>
                        <p>1. One is, that I have good proof of the lamentable Scandal of ſome very hopeful Perſons of quality, who by hearing ſuch language from theſe men, have bin ready to turn away from Religion, and ſay, If they thus ſet againſt and condemn one another, away with them all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:45239:5"/>2. Becauſe divers great Volumes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſad Evidence tells me that by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſence of Imputation, they have tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted many Learned men to deny Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs abſolutely, and bitterly revile it as a moſt Libertine Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>3. But above all, that they do ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly confirm the Papiſts. I muſt profeſs that <hi>beſides carnal Intereſt and the ſnare of ill Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> I do not think that there is any thing in the World that <hi>maketh or hardneth</hi> and <hi>confirmeth</hi> Papiſts more, and <hi>hindreth</hi> their reception of the Truth, than theſe ſame well-meaning people that are moſt zealous againſt them, by two means: 1. One by <hi>Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>unrulineſs</hi> in Church-reſpects, by which they perſwade men, eſpecially Rulers, that without ſuch a Center as the Papacy, there will be no Union, and without ſuch <hi>Violence</hi> as theirs, there will be no Rule and Order. Thus one extreme doth breed and feed another. 2. The other is by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound ſence of the Doctrine of <hi>Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, (with an unſound De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Faith)</hi> ſaying that every man is to believe it as Gods word (or <hi>fide divinâ</hi>) that his own ſins are pardoned; which when the Papiſts read (that, theſe men make it one of the chief Points of our difference from <pb facs="tcp:45239:5"/>
                           <hi>Rome,</hi>) doth occaſion them to triumph and reproach us, and confidently diſſent from us in all the reſt. I find in my ſelf that my full certainty that they err in Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation and ſome other points, doth greatly reſolve me to neglect them at leaſt, or ſuſpect them in the reſt which ſeem more dubious. And when the Papiſts find men moſt <hi>groſly erring</hi> in the very point where they lay the main ſtreſs of the difference, who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect otherwiſe, but that this ſhould make them deſpiſe and caſt away our Books, and take us as men ſelf-condemned and already vanquiſhed, and diſpute with us with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice as we do with an <hi>Arrian</hi> or <hi>Socinian?</hi> They themſelves that caſt away <hi>our Books</hi> becauſe <hi>they diſſent from us,</hi> may feel in themſelves what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are like to do on this temptation.</p>
                        <p>4. And it is not to be diſregarded, that many private perſons not ſtudied in theſe points, are led away by the Authority of theſe men (for more than <hi>Papiſts</hi> believe as the Church believeth) to ſpeak evil of the Truth, and ſinfully to Backbite and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe Teachers, whom they hear others ſlander: and to ſpeak evil of the things which they know not. And to ſee Gods own Servants ſeduced into <hi>Diſaffection</hi> and <hi>abuſe</hi> and <hi>falſe Speeches</hi> againſt thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb facs="tcp:45239:6"/>
that do moſt clearly tell them the truth, is a thing not ſilently to be cheriſhed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are valuers of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, and of the <hi>Truth</hi> and their <hi>Brethrens Souls,</hi> and that are diſpleaſed with that which the Devil is moſt pleaſed and God diſpleaſed with. Theſe are my Reaſons, ſubmitted to every Readers Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; which may be as various as their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, Intereſts or Prejudices.</p>
                        <p>My Arguments in the third Chapter I have but briefly and haſtily mentioned, as dealing with the lovers of naked Truth, who will not refuſe it when they ſee it in its ſelf-evidence. But they that deſire larger proof, may find enough in Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wotton de Reconcil.</hi> and in <hi>John Goodwin</hi> of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> (If they can read him without prejudice). From whom yet I differ in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification, and take in the habitual and actual Holineſs of Chriſt as well as his Sufferings, and equal in Merits; and think that <hi>pardon it ſelf</hi> is <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by his <hi>Obedience</hi> as well as by his <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>: To ſay nothing of ſome of his too harſh expreſſions, about the Imputation of Faith, and non-imputation of Chriſts Obedience, which yet in ſome explications he mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſheweth that his ſence is the ſame with theirs that place all our Righteouſneſs
<pb facs="tcp:45239:6"/>
in remiſſion of Sin; ſuch as (beſides thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-mentioned) are <hi>Muſculus, Chamier,</hi> and abundance more: And when one ſaith that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>taken</hi> properly, and another that it is taken Relatively in Imputation, they ſeem to mean the ſame thing: For Faith properly taken is eſſentiated by its <hi>Object</hi>; And what <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Office is, and what <hi>Faith's</hi> Office is, I find almoſt all Proteſtants are agreed in ſence, while they differ in the manner of expreſſion, except there be a real difference in this point <hi>of ſimple Perſonating us in his perfect Holineſs,</hi> and making the <hi>Perſon of a Mediator</hi> to contain <hi>eſſentially in ſenſu Civili the very Perſon of every elect ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and every ſuch one to have verily been and done, in ſenſu civili, what Chriſt was and did.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I much marvel to find that with moſt the Imputation of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is ſaid to be for <hi>Remiſſion of the penalty,</hi> and Imputation of <hi>perfect Holineſs</hi> for the obtaining of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eternal Life</hi>; and yet that the far greater part of them that go that way ſay, that <hi>Imputation of all Chriſts Righteouſneſs goeth firſt as the Cauſe, and Remiſſion of Sin followeth as the Effect:</hi> So even Mr. <hi>Robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> pag. 55. and others. Which ſeemeth to me to have this Sence, as if God ſaid to a Believer, [<hi>I do repute thee to have perfectly fulfilled the Law in Chriſt, and ſo to be no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb facs="tcp:45239:7"/>
and therefore forgive thee all thy ſin.</hi>] In our ſence it is true and runs but thus [<hi>I do repute Chriſt to have been perfectly juſt habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and actually in the Perſon of a Mediator in the Nature of Man, and to have ſuffered as if he had been a ſinner, in the Perſon of a Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, by his own Conſent, and that in the very place, and ſtead of ſinners</hi>; and by this to have ſatisfyed my Juſtice, and by both to have merited free <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> to be <hi>given by the new Covenant to all Believers: And thou being a Believer, I do repute thee juſtified and adopted by this ſatisfactory and meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and by this free Covenant-Gift, as verily and ſurely as if thou hadſt done it and ſuffered thy ſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For my own part I find by experience, that almoſt all Chriſtians that I talk with of it, have juſt this very notion of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which I have expreſſed, till ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diſputer by way of Controverſie hath thruſt the other notion into their mind. And for peace-ſake I will ſay again, what I have elſewhere ſaid, that I cannot think but that almoſt all Proteſtants agree in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this point of Juſtification (though ſome having not Acuteneſs enough to form their <hi>Notions</hi> of it rightly, nor Humility e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſuſpect their Underſtandings, wrangle about <hi>Words,</hi> ſuppoſing it to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:45239:7"/>
the <hi>Matter</hi>); Becauſe I find that all are agreed, 1. That no Elect Perſon is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified or Righteous by Imputation while he is an Infidel or Ungodly (except three or four that ſpeak confuſedly, and ſupport the <hi>Antinomians</hi>) 2. That God doth not repute us to have done what Chriſt did in our <hi>individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al natural Perſon's Phyſically:</hi> The Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is about a <hi>Civil perſonating.</hi> 3. That God judgeth not falſly. 4. That Chriſt was not our Delegate and Inſtrument ſent by us to do this in our ſtead, as a man payeth his debt by a Servant whom he ſendeth with the money. 5. That therefore Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is not Imputed to us, as if we had done it by him as our Inſtrument. 6. That all the fruits of Chriſts Merits and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are not ours upon our firſt believing (much leſs before). But we receive them by degrees: we have new pardon daily of new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſins: We bear caſtigatory puniſhments, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Death and Denials, or loſs of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſiſtance of the Spirit: Our Grace is all imperfect, &amp;c. 7. That we are under a Law (and not left ungoverned and lawleſs) and that Chriſt is our King and Judge: And this Law is the Law or Covenant of Grace, containing, beſides the Precepts of perfect Obedience to the Law natural and ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a <hi>Gift of Chriſt with Pardon and Life</hi>; <pb facs="tcp:45239:8"/>
but only on Condition that we thankfully and believingly <hi>accept the Gift</hi>; And threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning non-liberation, and a far ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to all that unbelievingly and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reject it. 8. That therefore this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament or Covenant-Gift is God's Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which he giveth us our Right to Chriſt and Pardon and Life: And no man hath ſuch Right but by this Teſtament-Gift. 9. That this, (called a Teſtament, <hi>Covenant, Promiſe, and Law</hi> in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) doth, beſides the Conditions of our firſt Right, impoſe on us Continuance in the Faith, with ſincere Holineſs, as the neceſſary Condition of our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Juſtification, and our actual Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And that Heaven is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this keeping of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as to the <hi>order of Gods Collation,</hi> though as to the <hi>value</hi> of the Benefit, it is a <hi>Free Gift,</hi> purchaſed, merited and given by Chriſt. 10. That we ſhall all be judged by this Law of Chriſt. 11. That we ſhall all be judged according to our deeds; and thoſe that have done good (not according to the Law of Innocency or Works, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law of Grace) ſhall go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and thoſe that have done evil (not by meer ſin as ſin againſt the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency) but by not keeping the Conditions
<pb facs="tcp:45239:8"/>
of the Law of Grace, ſhall go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment. The ſober reading of theſe following texts may end all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with men that dare not groſly make void the Word of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12, 13.22.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.23.) 12. That to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the day of Judgment, is, to be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to Life Eternal, and not condemned to Hell.</hi> And therefore to be the cauſe or condition that we are <hi>Judged to Glory,</hi> and the Cauſe or Condition that we are <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> then, will be all one. 13. That to be <hi>Judged</hi> according to our deeds, is to be <hi>Justified</hi> or <hi>Condemned</hi> according to them. 14. That the great tryal of that day (as I have after ſaid) will not be, whether Chriſt hath done his part, but whether we have part in him, and ſo whether we have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and performed the Condition of that Covenant which giveth Chriſt and Life. 15. That the whole ſcope of Chriſt's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and all the Goſpel, calleth us from ſin, on the motive of avoiding Hell, (after we are reputed Righteous) and calleth us to Holineſs, Perſeverance and overcoming, on the motive of laying up a good Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having a Treaſure in Heaven, and getting the Crown of Righteouſneſs. 16. That the after-ſins of men imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſerve Hell, or at leaſt temporal
<pb facs="tcp:45239:9"/>
puniſhments, and abatements of Grace and Glory. 17. That after ſuch ſins, eſpecially hainous, we muſt pray for Pardon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that we may be pardoned, (and not ſay I fulfilled the Law in Chriſt as from my birth to my death, and therefore have no more need of Pardon.) 18. That he that ſaith he hath no ſin, deceiveth himſelf, and is a lyar. 19. That Magiſtrates muſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin as God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Officers; and Paſtors by Cenſure in Chriſts name; and Parents alſo in their Children. 20. That if Chriſts <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> and <hi>perfect Obedience,</hi> and Satisfaction and Merit, had bin <hi>Ours</hi> in <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> as <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> as it was <hi>his own,</hi> we could have no <hi>Guilt, no</hi> need of <hi>Pardon,</hi> no ſuſpenſion or detention of the proper fruits of it, no puniſhment for ſin, (ſpecially not ſo great as the with-holding of degrees of Grace and Glory); And many of the conſequents aforeſaid could not have followed.</p>
                        <p>All this I think we are all agreed on; and none of it can with any face be denied by a Chriſtian. And if ſo; 1. Then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſts <hi>perfect Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings, Merit</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> be all given us, and imputed unto us at our firſt believing as <hi>Our own</hi> in the very thing it ſelf, by a full and proper <hi>Title</hi> to the thing:
<pb facs="tcp:45239:9"/>
Or only ſo <hi>imputed to us,</hi> as to be <hi>judged a juſt cauſe of giving us all the effects in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and time forementioned as God pleaſeth,</hi> let all judge as evidence ſhall convince them. 2. And then, whether they do well that thruſt their deviſed ſence on the Churches as an Article of Faith, let the more impartial judge.</p>
                        <p>I conclude with this confeſſion to the Reader, that though the matter of theſe Papers hath been thought on theſe thirty years, yet the Script is <hi>hasty,</hi> and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in order and fulneſs; I could not have leiſure ſo much as to affix in the margin all the texts which ſay what I aſſert: And ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, eſpecially the ſtate of the Caſe, are oft repeated. But that is, leſt once read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffice not to make them obſerved and underſtood; which if many times will do, I have my end. If any ſay, that I ſhould take time to do things more accurately, I tell him that I know my ſtraights of time, and quantity of buſineſs better than he doth; and I will rather be defective in the mode of one work, than leave undone the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of another as great.</p>

                     <p>Whether we are Reputed perſonally to have ſuffered on the Croſs, and to have ſatisfied God's Juſtice for our own ſins, and to have been habitually perfectly Holy, and Actually perfectly Obedient, in Chriſt, or by Chriſt, and ſo to have merited our own Juſtification and Salvation. And whether Chriſt's Righteouſneſs Habitual Active and Paſſive, be ſtrictly made our own Righteouſneſs, in the very thing it ſelf ſimply Imputed to us, or only be made ours in the effects, and Righteouſneſs Imputed to us when we believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath ſatisfied and fulfilled the Law, and thereby merited it for us.

                     <head>CHAP. I. The Hiſtory of the Controverſie.</head>
                     <p>§ 1. IN the Goſpel it ſelf we have firſt <hi>Chriſt's Doctrine delivered by his own mouth.</hi> And in that there is ſo little ſaid of this Subject that I find few that will pretend thence to reſolve the Controverſie, for Imputation in the rigorous ſence. The ſame I ſay of the Acts of the Apoſtles, and all the reſt of the New Teſtament, except <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> having to do with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who could not digeſt the equalizing of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with them, and ſpecially with the factious Jewiſh Chriſtians, who thought the <hi>Gentiles</hi> muſt become <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> as well as to Chriſt, if they would be Juſtified and Saved, at large confuteth this opinion, and freeth the Conſciences of the Gentile Chriſtians from the Impoſition of this yoke (as alſo did all the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.) And in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45239:12"/>
proveth that the Moſaical Law is ſo far from being neceſſary to the Juſtification of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Godly <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves were not Juſtified by it, but by <hi>Faith</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that by the <hi>works of it</hi> (and conſequently not by the works of the Law or Covenant of Innocency, which no man ever kept) no man could ever be juſtified: And therefore that they were to look for Juſtification by Chriſt alone, and by Faith in him, or by meer Chriſtianity; which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might have as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Partition-wall being taken down. This briefly is the true ſcope of <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe Controverſies.</p>
                     <p>§ 2. But in <hi>Paul's</hi> own days, there were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things in his Epiſtles which the unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable did wreſt, as they did the other Scriptures, to their own deſtruction, as <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. And it ſeemeth by the Epiſtle of <hi>James,</hi> that this was part of it: For he is fain there earneſtly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt ſome, who thought that Faith without Chriſtian works themſelves, would juſtifie, and flatly affirmeth, that we are <hi>Juſtified by Works, and not by Faith only</hi>; that is, as it is a <hi>Practical Faith,</hi> in which is contained a <hi>Conſent</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> to <hi>obey,</hi> which firſt putteth us into a juſtified ſtate; ſo it is that <hi>Practical Faith actually working by Love,</hi> and the <hi>actual performance</hi> of our <hi>Covenant,</hi> which by <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as <hi>Continued</hi> and as <hi>Conſummate by the Sentence of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Againſt which ſentence of <hi>James</hi> there is not a ſyllable to be found in <hi>Paul.</hi> But all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture agreeth that <hi>all men ſhall be Judged,</hi> that is, <hi>Juſtified</hi> or <hi>Condemned, according to their works.</hi> But it is not this Controverſie (between <hi>Faith and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45239:13"/>
Works</hi>) which I am now to ſpeak to, having done it enough heretofore.</p>
                     <p>§ 3. From the days of the Apoſtles till <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> this Controverſie was little meddled with: For the truth is, the Paſtors and Doctors took not Chriſtianity in thoſe days for a matter of Shcolaſtick ſubtilty, but of plain <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> And contented themſelves to ſay that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, and that we are Juſtified by Faith; and that Chriſt was made unto us Righteouſneſs, as he was made to us Wiſdom, Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                     <p>§ 4. But withal thoſe three firſt Ages were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon Holineſs of Life, as that they addicted their Doctrine, their Zeal, and their conſtant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to it: And particularly to great auſterities to their Bodies, in great Faſtings, and great contemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of the World, and exerciſes of Mortification, to kill their fleſhly Luſts, and deny their Wills, and Worldly Intereſts; to which end at laſt they got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wilderneſſes, and Monaſteries, where, in Faſting and Prayer, and a ſingle life, they might live as it were out of the World, while they were in it; (Though indeed <hi>perſecution</hi>
firſt drove them thither to ſave themſelves.) Into theſe Deſerts and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thoſe went that had moſt Zeal, but not uſually moſt <hi>Knowledg</hi>: And they turned much of their Doctrine and diſcourſes about theſe Auſterities, and about the practices of a Godly Life, and about all the Miracles which were (ſome really) done, and (ſome feigned) by credulous ſoft people ſaid to be done among them. So that in all theſe ages moſt of their writings are taken up, 1. In defending Chriſtianity againſt the Heathens, which was the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45239:13"/>
work of the Learned Doctors. 2. And in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſwarms of Hereſies that ſprung up. 3. And in matters of Church-order, and Eccleſiaſtical and Monaſtical diſcipline. 4. And in the precepts of a Godly Life: But the point of Imputation was not only not meddled with diſtinctly, but almoſt all the Writers of thoſe times, ſeem to give very much to <hi>Mans free-will,</hi> and to <hi>works of Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> making too rare and obſcure mention of the diſtinct Intereſts of Chriſts Merits in our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at leaſt, with any touch upon this Controverſie: Yet generally holding <hi>Pardon,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> only by Chriſts Sacrifice and Merits; though they <hi>ſpake</hi> moſt of <hi>Mans Holineſs,</hi> when they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led men to ſeek to make ſure of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>§ 5. And indeed at the day of Judgment, the Queſtion to be decided, will not be, Whether Chriſt dyed and did his part, but, Whether we believed and obeyed him and did our part: Not, Whether Chriſt performed his Covenant with the Father; but, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we performed our Covenant with him: For it is not Chriſt that is to be judged, <hi>but we by Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 6. But <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> diſputing about the Power of Nature and Freewill and the Grace of Chriſt, began to make it a matter of great Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſpeaketh) to be a Chriſtian. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> (a <hi>Brittain,</hi> of great wit, and continence, and a good and ſober life, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 120.) ſtifly defended the Power of Nature and Freewill, and made Grace to conſiſt only in the free Pardon of all ſin through Chriſt, and in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Perſwaſions</hi> only to a holy life for the time to come, with Gods common ordinary help. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45239:14"/>
(and juſtly) defended God's ſpecial eternal Election of ſome, and his ſpecial Grace given them to make them repent and believe, and preſevere: (For though he maintained that ſome that were true Believers, Lovers of God, Juſtified and in a ſtate of Salvation, did fall away and periſh, yet he held that none of the <hi>Elect</hi> did fall <hi>away and periſh</hi>; And he maintained that even the Juſtified that fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, had their Faith by a ſpecial Grace above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.) <hi>Vid.

                     <p>§ 7. In this their Controverſie, the point of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification fell into frequent debate: But no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ever aroſe between them, <hi>Whether Chriſt's perſonal Righteouſneſs conſidered Materially or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> was by Imputation made ours as Proprietors of the thing it ſelf, diſtinct from its effects; or, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God reputed us to have ſatisfied and alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obeyed in Chriſt. For <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf, while he vehemently defendeth free Grace, ſpeaketh too little even of the Pardon of ſin: And though he ſay, that <hi>Free Pardon</hi> of ſins is part of Grace, yet he maketh <hi>Juſtification</hi> to be that which we call San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, that makes us inherently Righteous or new-Creatures, by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt: And he thinketh that this is the Juſtification which <hi>Paul</hi> pleadeth to be of Grace and not of works; yet including <hi>Pardon of ſin,</hi> and confeſſing that <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> to Juſtifie, ſignifieth in Scripture, not to make juſt, but to <hi>judg juſt.</hi> And though in it ſelf this be but <hi>de nomine,</hi> and not <hi>de re</hi>; yet, 1. no doubt but as to many texts of Scripture <hi>Auſtin</hi> was miſtaken, though ſome few texts <hi>Beza</hi> and others confeſs to be taken in his ſence: 2. And the expoſition of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45239:14"/>
many texts lieth upon it. But he that took Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt giving us Love to God, could not take it to be by Imputation in the rigorous ſence no queſtion; nor doth <hi>de re.</hi>

And when Church-Tyranny and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, had obſcured the Chriſtian Light, the true ſence of Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, was much obſcured with the reſt, and a world of humane inventions under the name of Good works, were brought in to take up the peoples minds; And the merits of man, and of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſounded louder than the merits of Chriſt, in too many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And the people that were ignorant of the true Juſtification, were filled with the noiſe of Pardons, Indulgences, Satisfactions, Penances, Pilgrimages, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>§ 11. <hi>Luther</hi> finding the Church in this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and woful ſtate, where he lived, did labour to reduce mens minds and truſt, from humane foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and merits, and indulgences, to Chriſt, and to help them to the Knowledg of true Righteouſneſs: But according to his temper in the heat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he ſometimes let fall ſome words which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plainly to make Chriſts own perſonal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it ſelf to be every Believers own by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our ſins to be verily Chriſts own ſins in themſelves by Imputation: Though by many other words he ſheweth that he meant only, that our ſins were Chriſts in <hi>the effects</hi> and not in themſelves, and Chriſts perſonal Righteouſneſs ours in the effects and not in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>§ 12. But his Book on the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and ſome other words, gave occaſion to the errours of ſome then called <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and afterward <hi>Libertines</hi> (when ſome additions were made to their errours.)

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45239:17"/>
                        <hi>Luther</hi> confuted and reduced, better expounding his own words: But <hi>Iſlebius</hi> ere long turned back to the Contrary extreme of Popery, and with <hi>Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Julius Pflug,</hi> (three Popiſh Biſhops made for that purpoſe) promoted the Emperours <hi>Interim</hi> to the perſecution of the Proteſtants.</p>
                     <p>§ 13. The Proteſtant Reformers themſelves ſpake variouſly of this ſubject. Moſt of them rightly aſſerted that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs was ours by the way of Meriting our Righteouſneſs, which was therefore ſaid to be Imputed to us. Some of them follow'd <hi>Luthers</hi> firſt words, and ſaid that Chriſts ſufferings and all his perſonal Righteouſneſs was Imputed to us, ſo as to be ours in it ſelf, and when judged as if we had perſonally done what he did, and were righteous with the ſame Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he was.</p>
                     <p>§ 14. <hi>Ambſdorfius, Gallus,</hi> and ſome other hot <hi>Lutherans</hi> were ſo jealous of the <hi>name</hi> of works, that they maintained that good works were not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation. (Yea as to Salvation ſome called them hurtful:) And <hi>Georgius Major</hi> a Learned ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Divine was numbered by them among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> for maintaining that Good works were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation; as you may ſee in the perverſe writings of <hi>Chluſseburgius</hi> and many others.</p>
                     <p>§ 15. <hi>Andreas Oſiander</hi> (otherwiſe a Learned Proteſtant) took up the opinion, that we are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the very eſſential Righteouſneſs of God himſelf. But he had few followers.</p>
                     <p>§ 16. The Papiſts faſtening upon thoſe Divines who held Imputation of Chriſts perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in it ſelf in the rigid ſence, did hereupon greatly inſult againſt the Proteſtants, as if it had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45239:17"/>
been their common doctrine, and it greatly ſtopt the Reformation: For many ſeeing that ſome made that a Fundamental in our difference, and <hi>articulus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; cadentis Eccleſiae,</hi> and ſeeing how eaſily it was diſproved, how fully it was againſt the Doctrine of all the ancient Church, and what intolerable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences followed, did judge by that of the reſt of our Doctrine, and were ſettledly hardened againſt all.</p>
                     <p>§ 17. The Learned Divines of <hi>Germany</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this, fell to a freſh review of the Controverſie, and after a while abundance of very Learned Godly Doctors fell to diſtinguiſh between the Active and Paſſive Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and not accurately diſtinguiſhing of Imputation, becauſe they perceived that Chriſt ſuffered in our ſtead, in a fuller ſenſe than he could be ſaid to be <hi>Holy</hi> in our ſtead, or fulfil the Law in our ſtead. Hereupon they principally mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Controverſie, as about the ſort of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs Imputed to us: And a great number of the moſt Learned famous Godly Divines of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, maintained that Chriſt's Paſſive Righteouſneſs was Imputed to us, even his whole Humiliation or Suffering, by which the pardon of all ſins of Commiſſion and Omiſſion was procured for us; but that his <hi>Active Righteouſneſs</hi> was not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, though it profited us; but was <hi>Juſtitia Perſonae</hi> to make Chriſt a fit Sacrifice for our ſins, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none of his own, but the Suffering was his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia Meriti.</hi> His Obedience they ſaid was performed <hi>noſtro bono, non noſtro loco,</hi> for our good but not in our ſtead; but his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> both <hi>noſtro bono &amp; loco,</hi> both <hi>for our good</hi> and in <hi>our ſtead</hi>: but neither of them ſo ſtrictly <hi>in nostrâ Perſonâ</hi> in our Perſon, as if we did it by and in Chriſt.

(Imputed I ſay; for I now ſpeak not of <hi>Oſiander's</hi> opinion of Inheſion.) And <hi>Lubbertus</hi> wrote a Conciliatory Tractate favouring thoſe that were for the Paſſive part.

                     <p>§ 18. In England moſt Divines uſed the phraſe, that we were Juſtified by the forgiveneſs of ſin and the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and being accepted as Righteous unto life thereon: But the ſenſe of Imputation few pretended accurately to diſcuſs. <hi>Davenant</hi> who dealt moſt elaborately in it, and maintaineth Imputation ſtiffly, in terms; yet when he telleth you what Proteſtants mean by it, ſaith, that [<hi>Poſſunt nobis imputari, non ſolum noſtrae paſſiones, actiones, qualitates, ſed etiam extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeca quaedam, quae nec a nobis fluunt, nec in nobis hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45239:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
De facto autem Imputantur, quando illorum intuitus &amp; reſpectus valent nobis ad aliquem effectum, aeque ac ſi a nobis aut in nobis eſſent.</hi> (Note, that he ſaith, but <hi>ad aliquem effectum, non ad omnem.</hi>) And he inſtanceth in one that is a <hi>ſlothful fellow himſelf, but is advanced to the Kings Favour and Nobility for ſome great Service done by his Progenitors to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi> And in <hi>one that deſerving death is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned through the Interceſſion of a friend, or upon ſome ſuffering in his ſtead which the King impoſeth on his Friend.</hi> This is the Imputation which <hi>Davenant</hi> and other ſuch Proteſtants plead for; which I think is not to be denied. Were it not for length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the diſcourſe and wearying the Reader, I would cite many other of our greateſt Divines, who plead for the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, that <hi>Davenant</hi> here expoundeth himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But ſome leſs judicious grating upon a harſh and unſound ſence, Mr. <hi>Anthony Wotton</hi> a very Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Godly Divine of <hi>London,</hi> wrote a <hi>Latine</hi> Treatiſe <hi>de Reconciliatione,</hi> one of the Learnedſt that hath ever been written of that ſubject, in which he laboureth to diſprove the rigid Imputation of Chriſts Holineſs and Obedience to man; and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he is Righteous to whom all ſin of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Commiſſion is forgiven; and confuteth theſe three Aſſertions. 1. That <hi>A Sinner is Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have fulfilled the Law in and by Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>And being reputed to have fulfilled the Law, is taken for formally juſt as a fulfiller of it.</hi> 3. <hi>And being formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt as a fullfiller of the Law, Life eternal is due to him by that Covenant,</hi> that ſaith, <hi>do this and live.</hi> Vid. Part. 2. li. 1. Cap. 11. pag. 152. <hi>Cum ſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</hi> Thus and much further <hi>Mr. Wotton</hi> went to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45239:19"/>
the very quick of the Controverſie, and irrefragably overthrew the rigid Imputation.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>William Bradſhaw,</hi> a Learned Godly Nonconformiſt, being grieved at the differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Active and Paſſive Righteouſneſs, and thinking that Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> denied all Imputation of the Active Righteouſneſs (which he did not, but owneth it to be Imputed as a meritorious Cauſe:) Part. 2. li. 1. Cap. 13. pag. 165. <hi>Ne illud quidem negaverim, imputari nobis illius juſtitiam &amp; obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam, ut ad noſtrum fructum redundet: Id unum non concedo, Legem nos in Christo &amp; per Chriſtum ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vâſſe, ut propter eam a nobis praeſtitam vita aeterna ex faedere, Hoc fac et vives, debeatur.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> I ſay attempted a Conciliatory middle way, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the ſame in the main with Mr. <hi>Wotton's</hi>: He honoureth the Learned Godly perſons on each ſide, but maintaineth that the Active and Paſſive Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs are both Imputed, but not in the rigid ſence of Imputation denying both theſe Propoſitions. 1. <hi>That Chriſt by the Merits of his Paſſive Obedience only, hath freed us from the guilt of all ſin, both Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Original, of Omiſſion and Commiſſion.</hi> 2. <hi>That in the Imputation of Chriſts Obedience both Active and Paſſive, God doth ſo behold and conſider a ſinner in Chriſt, as if the ſinner himſelf had done and ſuffered thoſe very particulars which Chriſt did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for him.</hi> And he wrote a ſmall book with great accurateneſs in <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt, and <hi>Latin</hi> after, opening the nature of Juſtification, which hath been deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applauded ever ſince. His boſom-Friend Mr. <hi>Tho. Gataker,</hi> (a man of rare Learning and Humility) next ſet in to defend Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw's</hi> way, and wrote in <hi>Latin</hi> Animadverſions on <hi>Lucius</hi> (who oppoſed <pb n="21" facs="tcp:45239:19"/>
                        <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and erred on one ſide for rigid Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and on <hi>Piſcator</hi> who on the other ſide was for Juſtification by the Paſſive Righteouſneſs only; and other things he wrote with great Learning and Judgment in that cauſe.</p>
                     <p>About that time the Doctrine of perſonal Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the rigid ſence began to be fully improved in <hi>England,</hi> by the Sect of the <hi>Antinomians</hi> (trulyer called <hi>Libertines</hi>) of whom Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> was the moſt eminent Ring-leader, whoſe books took wonderfully with ignorant Profeſſors under the pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling Chriſt and free-Grace. After him roſe Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Simpſon,</hi> and then Mr. <hi>Town,</hi> and at laſt in the Armies of the Parliament, <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> and ſo many more, as that it ſeemed to be likely to have carried moſt of the Profeſſors in the Army, and abundance in the City and Country that way: But that ſuddenly (one Novelty being ſet up againſt another) the opinions called <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> roſe up againſt it, and gave it a check and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed many in the Army and City the clean contrary way: And theſe two Parties divided a great part of the raw injudicious ſort of the profeſſors between them, which uſually are the greateſt part: but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Army which was like to become a Law and example to others.</p>
                     <p>Before this <hi>John Goodwin</hi> (not yet turned <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>) preached and wrote with great diligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Juſtification againſt the rigid ſence of Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who being anſwered by Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robourough,</hi> with far inferiour ſtrength, his book had the greater ſucceſs for ſuch anſwerers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Antinomians</hi> then ſwarming in <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Anthony Burges,</hi> a very worthy Divine was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45239:20"/>
to Preach and Print againſt them; which he did in ſeveral books: but had he been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the men as I was, he would have found more need to have vindicated the Goſpel againſt them than the Law.</p>
                     <p>Being daily converſant my ſelf with the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Souldiers, and hearing their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conteſts, I thought it pitty that nothing but one extreme ſhould be uſed to beat down that other, and I found the <hi>Antinomian</hi> party far the ſtronger, higher, and more fierce, and working towards grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter changes and ſubverſions; And I found that they were juſt falling in with <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt hath repented and believed for us, and that we muſt no more queſtion our Faith and Repentance, than Chriſt.</hi> This awakened me better to ſtudy theſe points; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young, and not furniſhed with ſufficient read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Controverſie, and alſo being where were no libraries, I was put to ſtudy only the <hi>naked mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it ſelf.</hi> Whereupon I ſhortly wrote a ſmall book called <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> of Juſtification, &amp;c. Which contained that Doctrine in ſubſtance which I judg ſound; but being the firſt that I wrote, it had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral expreſſions in it which needed correction; which made me ſuſpend or retract it till I had time to reform them. Mens judgments of it were various, ſome for it and ſome againſt it: I had before been a great eſteemer of two books of one name, <hi>Vindiciae Gratiae,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pembles</hi> and Dr. <hi>Twiſſes,</hi> above moſt other books. And from them I had taken in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of a double Juſtification, one <hi>in foro Dei</hi> as an Immanent eternal Act of God, and another <hi>in foro Conſcientiae,</hi> the Knowledg of that; and I knew no other: But now I ſaw, that neither of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45239:20"/>
thoſe was the Juſtification which the Scripture ſpake of. But ſome half-<hi>Antinomians</hi> which were for the Juſtification before Faith, which I wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, were moſt angry with my book. And Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> wrote againſt it, which I anſwered in an <hi>Apologie,</hi> and fullyer wrote my judgment in my <hi>Confeſſion</hi>; and yet more fully in ſome Diſputations of Juſtification againſt Mr. <hi>Burges,</hi> who had in a book of Juſtification made ſome exceptions; and pag. 346. had defended that [<hi>As in Chriſt's ſuffering we were looked upon by God as ſuffering in him; ſo by Chriſts obeying of the Law, we were beheld as fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Law in him.</hi>] To thoſe Diſputations I never had any anſwer. And ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> then in my <hi>Life of Faith,</hi> I have opened the <hi>Libertine</hi> errours about Juſtification, and ſtated the ſence of Imputation.</p>
                     <p>Divers writers were then employed on theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Mr. <hi>Eyers</hi> for Juſtification before Faith (that is, of elect Infidels) and Mr. <hi>Benjamin Woodbridg,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho. Warren</hi> againſt it. Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> wrote a conſiderable Book of Forgiveneſs of ſin, defending the ſounder way: Mr. <hi>George Hopkins,</hi> wrote to prove that Juſtification and Sanctification are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually carryed on together: Mr. <hi>Warton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Graile,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jeſſop,</hi> (clearing the ſence of Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi>) and many others wrote againſt <hi>Antinomianiſm.</hi> But no man more clearly opened the whole doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, than Learned and Pious Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Black-Fryers,</hi> in a Sermon Printed in the <hi>Lectures</hi> at <hi>St. Giles</hi> in the <hi>Fields.</hi> By ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours the before-prevailing <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> was ſuddenly and ſomewhat marvelouſly ſuppreſſed, ſo that there was no great noiſe made by it.</p>
                     <p>About Imputation that which I aſſerted was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45239:21"/>
the two fore-deſcribed extremes; in ſhort, <q>That <hi>we are Juſtified by Chriſt's whole Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Paſſive, Active,</hi> and <hi>Habitual,</hi> yea the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> ſo far included as by <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> advancing the reſt to a valuable ſufficiency: That the Paſſive, that is, Chriſt's whole Humiliation is <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> firſt, and ſo meritorious, and the Active and Habitual meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious primarily. That as God the Father did appoint to Chriſt as Mediator his Duty for our Redemption by a Law or Covenant, ſo Chriſt's whole fulfilling that Law, or performance of his Covenant-Conditions as ſuch (by Habitual and Actual perfection, and by Suffering) made up one Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification, not diſtinguiſhing with Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> of the pure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the ſervile part of Chriſt's Obedience, ſave only as one is more a part of Humiliation than the other, but in point of Merit taking in all: That as Chriſt ſuffered in our ſtead that we might not ſuffer, and obeyed in our nature, that perfection of Obedience might not be neceſſary to our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> and this in the perſon of a Mediator and Sponſor for us ſinners, but not ſo in our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> as that we truely in a moral or civil ſence, did all this in and by him; Even ſo God repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the thing to be as it is, and ſo far Imputeth Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Merits and Satisfaction to us, as that it is Reputed by him the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification; and that for it God maketh a Covenant of Grace, in which he freely giveth Chriſt, Pardon and Life to all that accept the Gift as it is; ſo that the Accepters are by this Covenant or Gift as ſurely juſtified and ſaved by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as if they had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45239:21"/>
Obeyed and Satisfied themſelves. Not that Chriſt meriteth that we ſhall have Grace to fulfil the Law our ſelves and ſtand before God in a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of our own, which will anſwer the Law of works and juſtifie us: But that the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Gift in the Covenant of Grace being performed by every penitent Believer, that <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> doth <hi>pardon</hi> all <hi>their ſins</hi> (as Gods Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and giveth them a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Life eternal, for Chriſts Merits.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is the ſence of Imputation which I and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſſerted as the true healing middle way. And as bad as they are, among the moſt Learned Papiſts, <hi>Cornelius</hi> a <hi>Lapide</hi> is cited by Mr. <hi>Wotton, Vaſquez</hi> by <hi>Davenant, Suarez</hi> by Mr. <hi>Burges,</hi> as ſpeaking for ſome ſuch Imputation, and Merit: <hi>Grotius de Satisf.</hi> is clear for it.</p>
                     <p>But the Brethren called Congregational or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant in their Meeting at the <hi>Savoy. Oct.</hi> 12. 1658. publiſhing a Declaration of their Faith, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. have theſe words [<hi>Thoſe whom God effectually calleth, he alſo freely juſtifieth; not by infuſing Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs into them, but by pardoning their Sins, and by accounting and accepting their perſons as Righteous, not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Chriſts ſake alone: not by imputing Faith it ſelf, the act of believing, or any other evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them, as their Righteouſness; but by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſts Active Obedience to the whole Law, and Paſſive Obedience in his death, for their whole and ſole Righteouſneſs; they receiving and reſting on him and his Righteouſneſs by Faith.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Upon the publication of this it was variouſly ſpoken of: ſome thought that it gave the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45239:22"/>
ſo great a ſcandal, and advantage to reproach the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as denying all inherent Righteouſneſs, that it was neceſſary that we ſhould diſclaim it: Others ſaid that it was not their meaning to deny Inherent Righteouſneſs, though their words ſo ſpake, but only that we are not juſtified by it: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſaid that it was not the work of all of that party, but of ſome few that had an inclination to ſome of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> principles, out of a miſtaken zeal of free Grace; and that it is well known that they differ from us, and therefore it cannot be imputed to us, and that it is beſt make no ſtir about it, leſt it irritate them to make the matter worſe by a Defence, &amp; give the Papiſts too ſoon notice of it. And I ſpake with one Godly Miniſter that was of their Aſſembly, who told me, that they did not ſubſcribe it, and that they meant but to deny Juſtification by inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. And though ſuch men in the Articles of their declared Faith, no doubt can ſpeak intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and aptly, and are to be underſtood as they ſpeak according to the common uſe of the words; yet even able-men ſometimes may be in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, when eager engagement in an opinion and parties, carryeth them too precipitantly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them forget ſomething, that ſhould be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. The Sentences here which we excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt are theſe two. But the firſt was not much offenſive becauſe their meaning was right; <hi>And the ſame words are in the Aſſemblies Confeſſion, though they might better have been left out.</hi>

                        <p>Our opinion is, 1. That it is better to juſtifie and expound the Scripture, than flatly to deny it: If Scripture ſo oft ſay, that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>reckoned</hi> or <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> it becometh not Chriſtians, to ſay, <hi>It is not</hi>: But to ſhew in what ſence it is, and in what it is not. For if it be ſo Imputed in <hi>no ſence,</hi> the Scripture is made falſe: If in any ſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſhould not be univerſally denied but with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
                        <p>2. We hold, that in Juſtification there is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, 1. The Purchaſing and Meritorious Cauſe of Juſtification freely given in the new Covenant.
This is only Chriſt's Sufferings and Righteouſneſs,
and ſo it is Reputed of God, and Imputed to us.
2. The <hi>Order of Donation,</hi> which is, On <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Acceptance</hi>; And ſo 3. The Condition of our <hi>Title</hi> to the free Gift by this Covenant; And that is, Our Faith, or Acceptance of the Gift ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its nature and uſe.

That we are Juſtified by more ſorts of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than one, in ſeveral reſpects. We are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>only by Chriſts Righteouſneſs</hi> as the Purchaſing and Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification freely given by that new Covenant. We are Juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of God the Father, as performing his Covenant with Chriſt and us, (efficiently). We are juſtified efficiently by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt as our Judg, paſſing a juſt ſentence according to his Covenant: Theſe laſt are neither <hi>Ours</hi> nor Imputed to us: But we are juſtified alſo againſt the Accuſation, of being finally Impenitent Unbelievers or unholy, by the perſonal particular Righteouſneſs of our own Repentance, <hi>Faith and Holineſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For 2. We ſay, that there is an univerſal Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or Righteouſneſs, and there is a particular one. And this <hi>particular</hi> one may be the <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of our Title to all the reſt. And this is our caſe. The Day of Judgment is not to try and <hi>Judg Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>his Merits, but us:</hi> He will judg us himſelf by his new Law or Covenant, the ſum of which is, [<hi>Except ye Repent, ye ſhall all periſh: and, He that believeth, ſhall be ſaved: and he that believeth not, ſhall be condemned.</hi> If we be not accuſed of <hi>Impenitence</hi> or <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> but only of <hi>not-fulfilling the Law of Innocency,</hi> that will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we are to be <hi>tryed</hi> only by <hi>that Law,</hi> which is not true: And then we <hi>refer the Accuſer only to Chriſt's Righteouſneſs,</hi> and to the <hi>Pardoning Law of Grace,</hi> and to nothing in our ſelves to anſwer that charge; And ſo it would be <hi>Chriſt's part</hi> only that would be judged. But <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and all the Scripture aſſureth us of the contrary, that it's <hi>Our part that it is to be tryed</hi> and <hi>judged,</hi> and that we
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45239:25"/>
ſhall be all judged according to what we have done. And no man is in danger there of any other accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but that he did not truly <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Believe,</hi> and live <hi>a holy life to Chriſt</hi>: And ſhall the <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Believer</hi> ſay, <hi>I did never Repent and Believe, but Chriſt did it for me</hi>; and ſo uſe <hi>two Lyes,</hi> one of Chriſt, and another of himſelf, that he may be juſtified? Or ſhall the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy, Impenitent Infidel</hi> ſay, It's true I was never a <hi>Penitent Believer, or holy,</hi> but Chriſt was for me, or Chriſts Righteouſneſs is my ſole Righteouſneſs? that is a faſhood; For Chriſts Righteouſneſs is none of his. So that there is a <hi>particular perſonal Righteouſneſs,</hi> conſiſting in <hi>Faith and Repentance,</hi> which by way of <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of our title to Chriſt and his Gift of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Life, is of abſolute neceſſity in our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Therefore Imputed Righteouſneſs is not the <hi>ſole Righteouſneſs</hi> which muſt juſtifie us.</p>
                        <p>I cited abundance of plain Texts to this purpoſe in my Confeſſion, pag. 57. &amp;c. Of which book I add, that when it was in the preſs, I procured thoſe three perſons whom I moſt highly valued for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> (whoſe laſt work it was in this World) Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> and laſtly Arch-Biſhop <hi>

Vol.</hi> 1. he ſeemed plainly to diſpute againſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Adam's</hi> actual ſin, and his arguments I elſewhere anſwer.) And <hi>Andr. Rivet</hi> wrote a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Judgment of all ſorts of Divines for the contrary. But after he vindicated himſelf, &amp; ſhewed that his Doctrine was, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>fact</hi> is not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> imputed to each of us, as if our <hi>perſons</hi> as <hi>perſons</hi> had been all fully repreſented in <hi>Adam's</hi> perſon (by an arbitrary Law or Will of God) or reputed ſo to be: But that our Perſons being <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> or <hi>Seminally</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> we derive from him firſt our <hi>Perſons,</hi> and in them a corrupted nature, and that nature corrupted and juſtly deſerted by the Spirit of God, becauſe it is derived from <hi>Adam</hi> that ſo ſinned: And ſo that <hi>Adams</hi> fact is imputed to us mediately, <hi>mediante natura &amp; Corruptione,</hi> but not primarily and immediately.</p>
                        <p>This doctrine of the Good and Judicious man was thought too new to eſcape ſharp cenſures, ſo that a rumour was ſpread abroad that he denied all Imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> fact, and placed original guilt only in the Guilt of Coruption, for which indeed he gave occaſion. A Synod being called at <hi>Charenton,</hi> this opinion without naming any Author was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; &amp; all Miniſters required to ſubſcribe it: <hi>Amyral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> being of <hi>Placeus</hi> mind, in a ſpeech of two hours vindicated his opinion. <hi>Placeus</hi> knowing that the Decree did not touch him, took no notice of it. But <hi>Geriſſolius</hi> of <hi>Montauban</hi> wrote againſt him, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him condemned by the Decree, which <hi>Drelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> one that drew it up, denied, profeſſing himſelf of <hi>Placeus</hi> his judgment. and <hi>Rivet</hi> alſo, <hi>Mareſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Carol.

                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:45239:26"/>For my part I confeſs that I am not ſatisfied in his diſtinction of <hi>Mediate</hi> and <hi>Immediate Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> I ſee not, but our <hi>Perſons</hi> as derived from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> being ſuppoſed to be in Being, we are at once Reputed to be ſuch as Virtually ſinned in him, and ſuch as are deprived of God's Image. And if either muſt be put firſt, me-thinks it ſhould rather be the former, we being therefore deprived of God's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage (not by God, but by <hi>Adam</hi>) becauſe he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it away from himſelf. It ſatisfieth me much more, to diſtinguiſh of our <hi>Being</hi> and ſo <hi>ſinning</hi> in <hi>Adam Perſonally</hi> and <hi>Seminally,</hi> or <hi>Virtually</hi>: we were not <hi>Perſons</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> when he ſinned; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we did not ſo ſin in him: And it is a fiction added to God's Word, to ſay that God (becauſe he would do it) reputed us to be what we were not. But we were Seminally in <hi>Adam</hi> as in <hi>Cauſâ natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali,</hi> who was to produce us out of his very eſſence: And therefore that kind of being which we had in him, could not be innocent when he was guilty: And when we had our <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> from him, we are juſtly reputed to be as we are, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of one that actually ſinned: And ſo when our <hi>Exiſtence</hi> and <hi>Perſonality</hi> maketh us capable Subjects, we are guilty <hi>Perſons</hi> of his ſin; though not with ſo <hi>plenary a ſort of Guilt as he.</hi>

Mat. 28.19. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mar. 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Act. 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be Baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt for the Remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> See Acts 8.36, 37, 38. The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch's Faith and Baptiſm. Act. 22.16. <hi>Ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, having called on the name of the Lord.</hi> Rom. 6.3. <hi>So many as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death.</hi> Gal. 3.27. <hi>As many as have been baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> 1. Pet. 3.21. <hi>The like whereunto, Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us, (not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God) by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 4.24, 25. <hi>But for us alſo to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead: who was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification.</hi> [Quaer. <hi>How far Chriſt's Reſurrection is imputed to us.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>II. The Creed, called by the Apoſtles, hath but
[<hi>I believe — the forgiveness of ſins.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>III. The Nicene and Conſtantinopolitane Creed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45239:27"/>
                           <hi>I acknowledg one Baptiſm for the Remiſſion of ſins</hi>;
(Chriſt's Death, Burial, and Reſurrection pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.)</p>
                        <p>IV. Athanaſius's Creed [<hi>Who ſuffered for our Salvation, deſcended into Hell, roſe again the third day. — At whoſe coming all men ſhall riſe again with their bodies, and ſhall give account for their own works; and they that have done good, ſhall go into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life, and they that have done evil into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire.] (Remiſſion</hi> is contained in <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>V. The Fathers ſence I know not where the Reader can ſo eaſily and ſurely gather, without read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all, as in <hi>Laurentius</hi> his Collection <hi>de Juſtif.</hi> after the <hi>Corpus Confeſſionum</hi>; and that to the beſt advantage of the Proteſtant Cauſe. They that will ſee their ſence of ſo much as they account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſary to Salvation, may beſt find it in their Treatiſes of Baptiſm, and Catechizings of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens; Though they ſay leſs about our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie than I could wiſh they had. I will have no other Religion than they had. The Creed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus</hi> in <hi>Hieron. op. Tom.</hi> 2. hath but (<hi>In his Death and Blood we believe that we are cleanſed — and have hope that we ſhall obtain the reward of good merit,</hi> (meaning our own); which the <hi>Helvetians</hi> own in the end of their Confeſſion.</p>
                        <p>VI. The Auguſtane Confeſſion, Art. 3, 4. <hi>Chriſt died — that he might reconcile the Father to us, and be a ſacrifice, not only for original ſin, but alſo for all the actual ſins of men. — And that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe benefits of Chriſt, that is, Remiſſion of ſins, juſtification and life eternal, Chriſt gave us the Goſpel in which theſe benefits are propounded. — To preach
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45239:28"/>
Repentance in his Name, and Remiſſion of ſins among all Nations. For when men propagated in the natural manner have ſin, and cannot truly ſatisfie Gods Law, the Goſpel reproveth ſin, and ſheweth us Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and ſo teacheth us about Pardon of ſins—That freely for Chriſt's ſake are given us, Remiſſion of ſins, &amp; Juſtification by Faith, by which we muſt confeſs that theſe are given us for Chriſt, who was made a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for us, and appeaſed the Father. Though the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel require Penitence; yet that pardon of ſin may be ſure, it teacheth us that it is freely given us; that is, that it dependeth not on the Condition of our worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor is given for any precedent works, or worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of following works. — For Conſcience in true fears findeth no work which it can oppoſe to the Wrath of God; and Chriſt is propoſed and given us, to be a propitiator. This honour of Chriſt muſt not be transferred to our works. Therefore</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, ye are ſaved free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (or of Grace,) And it is of grace, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe might be ſure; that is, Pardon will be ſure; when we know that it dependeth not on the Condition of our worthineſs, but is given for Chriſt. — In the Creed this Article, [I believe the Forgiveneſs of ſins,] is added to the hiſtory: And the reſt of the hiſtory of Chriſt muſt be referred to this Article: For this benefit is the end of the hiſtory, Chriſt therefore ſuffered and roſe again, that for him might be given us Remiſſion of ſins, and life everlaſting.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Art. 6. <hi>When we are Reconciled by Faith, there muſt needs follow the Righteouſneſs of good works. — But becauſe the infirmity of mans nature is ſo great, that no man can ſatisfie the Law, it is neceſſary to teach men, not only that they muſt obey the Law, but alſo how this Obedience pleaſeth, leſt Conſciences fall
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45239:28"/>
into deſperation, when they underſtand that they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie not the Law. This Obedience then pleaſeth, not becauſe it ſatisfieth the Law, but becauſe the perſon is in Chriſt, reconciled by Faith, and believeth that the relicts of his Sin are pardoned. We muſt ever hold that we obtain remiſſion of ſins, and the perſon is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Righteous, that is, is accepted freely for Chriſt, by Faith: And afterward that Obedience to the Law pleaſeth, and is reputed a certain Righteouſneſs, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth rewards.</hi>] Thus the firſt Proteſtants.</p>
                        <p>VII. The 11th Article of the Church of England (to which we all offer to ſubſcribe) is [<hi>Of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of Man. We are accounted Righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt by Faith; and not for our own works or deſervings. Wherefore that we are juſtified by Faith only, is a moſt wholſome doctrine, and very full of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as more largely is expreſſed in the Homily of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The ſaid Homilies (of Salvation and Faith) ſay over and over the ſame thing. As pag. 14. [<hi>Three things go together in our Juſtification: On Gods part his great Mercy and Grace, on Chriſts part, Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is the Satisfaction of Gods Juſtice, or the Price of our Redemption, by the offering of his body, and ſhedding of his blood, with fulfilling of the Law perfectly and throughly; And on our part true and lively Faith in the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt: which yet is not ours, but by Gods working in us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And pag. [<hi>A lively Faith is not only the common belief of the Articles of our Faith, but alſo a true truſt and confidence of the mercy of God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a ſteadfaſt hope of all good things to be received at Gods hand; and that although we through
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45239:29"/>
infirmity or temptation — do fall from him by ſin, yet if we return again to him by true repentance, that he will forgive and forget our offences, for his Sons ſake our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and will make us inheritors with him of his everlaſting Kingdom</hi> — Pag. 23. <hi>For the very ſure and lively Chriſtian Faith, is, to have an earneſt truſt and confidence in God, that he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard us, and is careful over us, as the Father is over the Child whom he doth love; and that he will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto us, for his only Sons ſake; and that we have our Saviour Chriſt our perpetual Advocate and Prince, in whoſe only merits, oblation and ſuffering, we do truſt that our offences be continually waſhed and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whenſoever we repenting truely do return to him with our whole heart, ſteadfaſtly determining with our ſelves, through his grace to obey and ſerve him, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Commandments, &amp;c.</hi>] So alſo the Apology. This is our doctrine of Imputation.</p>
                        <p>VIII. The Saxon Confeſſion oft inſiſteth on the
<hi>free Pardon of ſin, not merited by us, but by Chriſt.</hi>
And expoundeth <hi>Juſtification</hi> to be [<hi>Of unjuſt, that is, Guilty and diſobedient, and not having Chriſt: to be made Juſt, that is, To be Abſolved from Guilt for the Son of God, and an apprehender by Faith of Chriſt himſelf, who is our Righteouſneſs</hi>; (as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> ſay) <hi>becauſe by his Merit we have forgiveneſs,
and God imputeth righteouſneſs to us, and for him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth us juſt, and by giving us his Spirit quickeneth and regenerateth us. — By being Juſtified by Faith alone we mean, that freely for our Mediator alone, not for our Contrition, or other Merits; the pardon of
ſin and reconciliation is given us. — And before, It is certain, when the mind is raiſed by this Faith, that the pardon of ſin, Reconciliation and Imputation of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45239:29"/>
are given for the Merit of Chriſt himſelf</hi> —
And after [<hi>By Faith is meant Affiance, reſting in the Son of God the Propitiator, for whom we are received and pleaſe</hi> (God) <hi>and not for our virtues and fulfilling of the Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IX. The Wittenberge Confeſſion, (In Corp.
Conf. pag. 104) <hi>A man is made Accepted of God, and Reputed juſt before him, for the Son of God our Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone, by Faith. And at the Judgment of God we muſt not truſt to the Merit of any of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which we have, but to the ſole Merit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is made ours by Faith. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the bar of God, where the caſe of true eternal Righteouſneſs and Salvation will be pleaded, there is no place for mans Merits, but only for God's Mercy, and the Merits of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom we receive by Faith: therefore we think our Anceſtors ſaid rightly, that we are juſtified before God by Faith only.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>X. The Bohemian Confeſſion, making Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the principal Article, goeth the ſame way.
[Pag. 183, 184. <hi>By Chriſt men are Juſtified, obtain Salvation and Remiſſion of ſin, freely by Faith in Chriſt, through mercy, without any Work and Merit of man. And his death and blood alone is ſufficient, to aboliſh &amp; expiate all the ſins of all men. All muſt come to Chriſt for pardon and Remiſſion of Sin, Salvation and every thing. All our truſt and hope is to be faſtened on him alone. Through him only and his merits God is appeaſ'd and propitious; Loveth us, and giveth us Life eternal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XI. The Palatinate Confeſſion ib. pag. 149. [<hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God the Father for the moſt full Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, doth never remember any of my ſins, and that pravity which I muſt ſtrive againſt while I live, but contrarily will rather of grace give me the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45239:30"/>
of Chriſt, ſo that I have no need to fear the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. — And</hi> pag. 155. <hi>If he merited, and obtained Remiſſion of all our ſins, by the only and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſion, and death of the Croſs, ſo be it we embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it by true Faith, as the ſatisfaction for our ſins, apply it to our ſelves.</hi> —] I find no more of this.</p>
                        <p>XII. The Polonian Churches of Lutherans and Bohemians agreed in the Auguſtane and Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Confeſſion before recited.</p>
                        <p>XIII. The Helvetian Confeſſion, [<hi>To Juſtifie
ſignifieth to the Apoſtle in the diſpute of Juſtification,
To Remit ſins, to Abſolve from the fault and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to Receive into favour, and to Pronounce juſt —
For Chriſt took on himſelf, and took away the ſins of the World, and ſatisfied Gods Juſtice. God therefore for the ſake of Chriſt alone, ſuffering and raiſed again, is propitious to our ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and imputeth them not to us, but imputeth the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for ours; ſo that now we are not only cleanſed and purged from ſins, or Holy, but alſo endowed with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and ſo abſolved from ſins, Death and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and are righteous and heirs of life eternal.
Speaking properly, God only juſtifieth us, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth only for Chriſt, not imputing to us ſins, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting to us his Righteouſneſs.</hi>] This Confeſſion
ſpeaketh in terms neereſt the oppoſed opinion: But indeed ſaith no more than we all ſay; Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs being given and imputed to us as the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of our pardon and right to life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XIV. The Baſil Confeſſion, Art. 9. [<hi>We confeſs Remiſſion of ſins by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt crucified.
And though this Faith work continually by Love, yet Righteouſneſs and Satisfaction for our Sins, we do not attribute to works, which are fruits of Faith; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45239:30"/>
to true affiance &amp; faith in the blood ſhed of the Lamb of God. We ingenuouſly profeſs, that in Chriſt, who is our Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, Redemption, Way, Truth,
Wiſdom, Life, all things are freely given us. The works therefore of the faithful are done, not that they may ſatisfie for their ſins, but only that by them, they may declare that they are thankful to God for ſo great benefits given us in Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XV. The Argentine Confeſſion of the four Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Cap. 3. ib. pag. 179. hath but this hereof: <hi>When heretofore they delivered, that a mans own proper Works are required to his Juſtification, we teach that this is to be acknowledged wholly received of God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and Chriſt's Merit, and perceived only by Faith.</hi> C. 4. <hi>We are ſure that no man can be made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous or ſaved, unleſs he love God above all, and moſt
ſtudiouſly imitate him. We can no otherwiſe be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that is, become both Righteous and Saved (for our Righteouſneſs is our very Salvation) than if we being firſt indued with Faith, by which believing the Goſpel, and perſwaded that God hath adopted us as Sons, and will for ever give us his fatherly benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
we wholly depend on his beck</hi> (or will.)</p>
                        <p>XVI. The Synod of Dort, mentioneth only Chriſts death for the pardon of ſin and Juſtification.
The Belgick Confeſſion § 22. having mentioned Chriſt and his merits made ours, § 23. addeth,
[<hi>We believe that our bleſſedneſs conſiſteth in Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſins for Jeſus Chriſt; and that our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs before God is therein contained, as</hi> David <hi>and</hi>
Paul <hi>teach; We are juſtified freely, or by Grace,
through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus. We hold this Foundation firm, and give all the Glory to God—preſuming nothing of our ſelves, and our merits,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45239:31"/>
but we reſt on the ſole Obedience of a Crucified Chriſt;
which is ours when we believe in him.</hi>] Here you ſee in what ſence they hold that Chriſts merits are ours; Not to juſtifie us by the Law, that ſaith,
(<hi>Obey perfectly and Live</hi>) but as the merit of our
<hi>pardon,</hi> which they here take for their whole Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>XVII. The Scottiſh Confeſſion, Corp. Conf. pag.
125. hath but [that true Believers <hi>receive in this life Remiſſion of Sins, and that by Faith alone in Chriſts blood: So that though ſin remain — yet it is not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, but is remitted, and covered by Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</hi>] This is plain and paſt all queſtion.</p>
                        <p>XVIII. The French Confeſſion is more plain, §
18. ib. pag. 81. [<hi>We believe that our whole Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs lyeth in the pardon of our ſins; which is alſo as</hi>
David <hi>witneſſeth our only bleſſedneſs. Therefore all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons by which men think to be juſtified before God, we plainly reject; and all opinion of Merit being caſt away; we reſt only in the Obedience of Chriſt, which is Imputed to us, both that all our ſins may be covered,
and that we may get Grace before God.</hi>] So that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Obedience, they think is but for <hi>pardon of ſin, and acceptance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning Proteſtants Judgment of Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is further to be noted; 1. That they are not agreed whether Imputation of Chriſt's perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Obedience, be before or after the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Paſſion in order of nature. Some think that our ſins are firſt in order of nature done away by the Imputation of his ſufferings, that we may be free from puniſhment; and next, that his <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is Imputed to us, to merit the Reward of life eternal: But the moſt learned Confuters of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45239:31"/>
hold, that Imputation of Chriſts <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> together, are in order of nature before our Remiſſion of ſin and Acceptance, as the meritorious cauſe: And theſe can mean it in no other ſence than that which I maintain. So doth <hi>Davenant</hi> de Juſt. hab. et act. &amp; Pet. Molinaeus Theſ. Sedan. Vol. 1. pag. 625. <hi>Imputatio juſtitiae Chriſti propter quam pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata remittuntur, &amp; cenſemur juſti coram Deo.</hi> Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Theſ. Sedan. Vol. 2. pag. 770, 771. § 6 &amp; 10. <hi>maketh the material cauſe of our Juſtification to be the Merits and Satisfaction of Chriſt, yea the Merit of his Satisfaction, and ſo maketh the formal Cauſe of Juſtification to be the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or which is the ſame, the ſolemn Remiſſion of all ſins, and our free Acceptance with God.</hi> Note that he maketh <hi>Imputation</hi> to be the ſame thing with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Acceptance</hi>; which is more than the former ſaid.</p>
                        <p>2. Note, that when they ſay that Imputation is the <hi>Form</hi> of Juſtification, they mean not of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Paſſively as it is ours, but Actively as it is
<hi>Gods Juſtifying act</hi>; ſo <hi>Mareſius ibidem.</hi> And many deny it to be the form: And many think that ſaying improper.</p>
                        <p>3. Note, that it is ordinarily agreed by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
that Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed to us in the ſame ſence as our ſins are ſaid to be imputed to him; (even before they are committed many Ages;) which cleareth fully the whole Controverſie to thoſe that are but willing to underſtand, and blaſpheme not Chriſt; ſo <hi>Mareſius ubi ſupra: Quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum propter deliquia noſtra ei imputata punitus fuit Chriſtus in terris; ita &amp; propter ejus Juſtitiam nobis imputatam coronamur in Caelis.</hi> And <hi>Joh.

Crocius Diſput.</hi> 10. p. 502. And <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> in his ſolid Diſp. <hi>Theſ. Sedan. Vol.</hi> 2. pag. 1053, 1054. While he mentioneth only <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet § 27. ſaith that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is <hi>imputed to us,</hi>
and placeth Chriſts Imputed Righteouſneſs in his Obedience <hi>to the</hi> death; and ſaith that this <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Obedience, in ſuffering,</hi> is our Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.
<hi>Ea igitur Obedientia Chriſti qua Patri paruit uſque ad mortem crucis, qua coram Patre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paruit ut voluntatem ejus perficeret, qua a Patre miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,

He addeth (<hi>Hence we may gather that as Chriſt was made ſin, ſo we are made the Righteouſneſs of God, that is by Imputation</hi>]
which is true.</p>
                        <p>The plain truth in all this is within the reach of every ſound Chriſtian, and ſelf-conceited wranglers make difficulties where there are none. Yea, how far the Papiſts themſelves grant the Proteſtant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Imputation, let the following words of <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> on <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be judg. [<hi>Bellarm. ait; Si ſolum vellent haeretici nobis imputari Merita Chriſti, quia nobis donata ſunt, &amp; poſſumus ea Deo Patri offerre pro peccatis noſtris, quoniam Chriſtus ſuſcepit ſuper ſe onus ſatisfaciendi pro nobis, noſque Deo Patri reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andi, recta eſſet eorum Sententia</hi>: I doubt ſome will ſay, it is falſe, becauſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> granteth it; but <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> addeth [<hi>Haec ille: ſed an noſtra longe abeſt ab illâ, quam in nobis requireret ſententia.</hi>] And I wiſh the Reader that loveth Truth and Peace

Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Gibbon's</hi> Sermon in the Exerciſes at <hi>Giles</hi>'s in the Fields. 3. Mr. <hi>Truman's</hi> great Propitiation. 4. <hi>Joſhua Placeus,</hi> his <hi>Diſput. de Juſtif.</hi> in <hi>Theſ. Salmur. Vol.</hi> 1. 5. And <hi>Le Blank's</hi> late <hi>Theſes</hi>; Which will ſatisfie thoſe that have any juſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for ſatisfaction. And if he add <hi>Wotton de Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliatione,</hi> and <hi>Grotius de Satisfactione,</hi> he need not loſe his labour: no nor by reading <hi>John Goodwin</hi> of Juſtification, though every word be not approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

                           <hi>I take explication to be here more uſeful than argumentation: And therefore I ſhall yet fullier open to you the ſtate of our differences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and brief Propoſitions, as ſhall carry their own convincing light with them.

If any think I diſtinguiſh not accurately enough, let him add what is wanting, and but ſuppoſe that I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where done it, and am not now handling the whole doctrine of Juſtification, but only that of Imputation, and what it neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THough a man that readeth our moſt Learned Proteſtants, profeſſing that they agree even with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf in the ſtating of the caſe of Imputation, would think that there ſhould need no further ſtating of it. I cited you <hi>Bellarmine's</hi>

words before with <hi>Vaſſeurs</hi> conſent: I here add Johan. Crocius de Juſtif. Diſp. 10. pag. 500.501. <hi>Vide hominis ſive vertiginem ſive improbitutem, clamat fieri non poſſe ut Juſtitia Chriſti nobis imputetur eo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu qui haereticis probetur — Et tamen rectam vocat ſententiam, quam ſuam faciunt Evangelici. Quod enim cum rectâ ratione pugnare dicit, nos per Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Chriſti formaliter juſtos nominari &amp; eſſe, nos non tangit: Non dicimus; Non ſentimus: Sed hoc totum proficiſcitur e Sophiſtarum officinâ, qui phraſin iſtam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis affingunt, ut poſtea eam exagitent tanquam noſtram</hi>: (yet ſome of our own give them this pretence.) <hi>Nos ſententiam quam ille rectam judicat, tenemus, tuemur; ſic tamen ut addamus, quod Genti adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae eſt intolerabile, non alia ratione nos juſtos cenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri coram Deo.</hi>] But by Juſtification the Papiſts mean Sanctification: And they count it not intolerable to ſay that the penalty of our ſins is remitted to us, by that Satisfaction to the Juſtice of God according to the Law of Innocency, which Chriſt only hath made. But though many thruſt in more indeed, and moſt of them much more in words; yet you ſee they are forced to ſay as we ſay whether they will or not: For they ſeem unwilling to be thought to agree with us, where they agree indeed.] And the following words of <hi>Joh. Crocius pag.</hi> 506, 507. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhew the common ſence of moſt Proteſtants, [<hi>When</hi> Bellarmine <hi>obſerveth that Imputation maketh us as righteous as Chriſt,</hi> he ſaith, [<hi>If we ſaid that we are Juſtified by Chriſts eſſential righteouſneſs. — But we ſay it not. Yea above all we renounce that which the Sophiſter puts in of his own, even that which he ſaith of Formal Righteouſneſs: For it is not our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we are conſtituted formally Righteous by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45239:34"/>
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which we rather call the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial cauſe.</hi> — § 32. <hi>Chriſts ſatisfaction is made for all: But it is imputed to us, not as it is made for all, but as for us. I illuſtrate it by the like. The Kings Son payeth the debt of a Community deeply indebted to the King, and thence bound to perpetual ſlavery. This payment gets liberty for this, and that, and the other member of the Community: For it is imputed to them by the King as if they had paid it. But this Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion transferreth not the honour to them, but brings them to partake of the Benefit. So when the price paid by Chriſt for all, is imputed to this or that man, he is taken into the ſociety of the Benefit,</hi> — Pag. 503. <hi>Diſtinguiſh between the Benefit, and the Office of Chriſt. The former is made ours, but not the latter,</hi> —Pag. 542. <hi>The Remiſſion of ſin is nothing but the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>Where Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Righteouſneſs, Remiſſion of Iniquities, and non-imputation of ſin, are all one,</hi> — Pag. 547. <hi>God imputeth it as far as he pleaſeth,</hi> — Pag. 548. <hi>Princes oft impute the merits of Parents to unworthy Children,</hi> —Pag. 551. He denyeth that we have <hi>Infinite Righteouſneſs in Chriſt, becauſe it is imputed to us in a finite manner, even ſo far as was requiſite to our abſolution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I will a little more diſtinctly open and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>1. We muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth to the Preceptive part of the Law; and as it relateth to the Retributive part: The firſt <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
is <hi>Innocency</hi> contrary to <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi>: The
ſecond is <hi>Jus ad impunitatem &amp; ad praemium (ſeu d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>2. We muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs,</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:45239:34"/>
which is either ſo called, <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>properly,</hi>
which is the <hi>Relation of Chriſts perſon</hi> to his <hi>Law of Mediation</hi> impoſed on him. 1. As <hi>Innocent</hi> and a perfect obeyer; 2. As one that <hi>deſerved not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but deſerved Reward.</hi> Or it is ſo called <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi>
and <hi>improperly</hi>; which is, Thoſe <hi>ſame Habits,
Acts and Sufferings</hi> of Chriſt, from which <hi>his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Righteous</hi> did reſult.</p>
                     <p>3. We muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>Imputation,</hi> which
ſignifyeth (here) 1. To repute us <hi>perſonally</hi> to have been the <hi>Agents of Chriſts Acts,</hi> the <hi>ſubjects</hi> of his
<hi>Habits and Paſſion</hi> in a Phyſical ſence. 2. Or to repute the ſame <hi>formal Relation</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>
which was in Chriſts perſon, to be in <hi>ours</hi> as the
<hi>ſubject.</hi> 3. Or to repute us to have been the very
<hi>ſubjects of Chriſt's Habits and Paſſion,</hi> and the Agents of his <hi>Acts</hi> in a <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Moral ſenſe,</hi> (and not a phyſical); as a man payeth a debt by his Servant, or Attorney, or Delegate. 4. And conſequently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a <hi>double formal Righteouſneſs</hi> to reſult from the
ſaid <hi>Habits, Acts,</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi>; one to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the
<hi>natural Subject</hi> and <hi>Agent,</hi> and <hi>another to us</hi> as the
<hi>Moral, Political,</hi> or <hi>reputed Subject</hi> and <hi>Agent</hi> (And
ſo his <hi>Formal Righteouſneſs</hi> not to be imputed to us
<hi>in it ſelf as ours,</hi> but <hi>another</hi> to reſult from the ſame
<hi>Matter.</hi>) 5. Or elſe that we are reputed both the
<hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Matter</hi> of his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
morally, and alſo of the <hi>Formal Righteouſneſs</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt himſelf.</hi> 6. Or elſe by Imputation is meant here, that Chriſt being truly reputed to have taken the Nature of ſinful man, and become a Head for all true Believers, in that undertaken <hi>Nature</hi>
and <hi>Office</hi> in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> to have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
<hi>all the Law impoſed on him,</hi> by perfect <hi>Holineſs</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:45239:35"/>
and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Offering</hi> himſelf on the Croſs a
<hi>Sacrifice for our ſins,</hi> voluntarily ſuffering in our
ſtead, as if he had been a ſinner, (guilty of all our
ſins) As ſoon as we believe we are pardoned, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
adopted for <hi>the ſake and merit</hi> of this Holineſs,
Obedience and penal Satisfaction of Chriſt, with as full demonſtration of divine <hi>Juſtice,</hi> at leaſt, and more full demonſtration of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> than if we had ſuffered our ſelves what our ſins deſerved
(that is, been damned) or had never ſinned: And
ſo <hi>Righteouſneſs is imputed to us,</hi> that is, <hi>we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted or reputed righteous,</hi> (not in relation to the Precept, that is, <hi>innocent,</hi> or <hi>ſinleſs,</hi> but in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Retribution,</hi> that is, <hi>ſuch as have Right to Impunity and Life,</hi>) becauſe Chriſt's foreſaid perfect Holineſs, Obedience and Satisfaction, <hi>merited our Pardon, and Adoption, and the Spirit</hi>; or merited the
<hi>New-Covenant,</hi> by which, as an Inſtrument, <hi>Pardon,
Juſtification and Adoption</hi> are given to Believers, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be given to ſanctifie them: And when we believe, we are juſtly <hi>reputed</hi> ſuch as have <hi>Right</hi>
to all theſe purchaſed Gifts.</p>
                     <p>4. And that it may be underſtood how far Chriſt did <hi>Obey</hi> or <hi>Suffer</hi> in our <hi>ſtead,</hi> or <hi>perſon,</hi> we muſt diſtinguiſh, 1. Between his taking the <hi>Nature</hi> of
<hi>ſinful</hi> man, and taking the Perſon of ſinners.
2. Between his taking the <hi>Perſon</hi> of a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and taking the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>you</hi> and <hi>me,</hi> and each particular
ſinner. 3. Between his taking our ſinful perſons
<hi>ſimply, &amp; ad omnia,</hi> and taking them only, <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid, in tantum, &amp; ad hoc.</hi> 4. Between his
<hi>ſuffering</hi> in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of ſinners, and his <hi>obeying</hi> and
<hi>ſanctity in the Perſon</hi> of ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of us in particular.
5. Between his <hi>Obeying</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> in <hi>our Perſon,</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:45239:35"/>
and our <hi>Obeying</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> in his Perſon (<hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Political.</hi>) And now I ſhall make uſe of theſe diſtinctions, by the Propoſitions following.</p>
                     <p>Prop. 1. The phraſe of [<hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed to us</hi>] is not in the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>2. Therefore when it cometh to Diſputation, to them that deny it, ſome Scripture-phraſe ſhould be put in ſtead of it; becauſe, 1. The Scripture hath as good, if not much better, phraſes, to ſignifie all in this that is neceſſary. 2. And it is ſuppoſed that the Diſputants are agreed of all that is expreſs in the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>3. Yet ſo much is ſaid in Scripture, as may make this phraſe [<hi>of Imputing Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to us</hi>]
juſtifiable, in the ſound ſence here explained: For the thing meant by it is true, and the phraſe intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
                     <p>4. Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is imputed to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
in the ſixth ſence here before explained; As the Meritorious cauſe of our Pardon, Juſtification,
Righteouſneſs, Adoption, Sanctification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c. as is opened.</p>
                     <p>5. Chriſt did not ſuffer all in kind (much leſs in duration) which ſinful man deſerved to ſuffer:
As <hi>e. g.</hi> 1. He was not hated of God; 2. Nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived or deſerted of the ſanctifying Spirit, and ſo of its Graces and Gods Image; Nor had 3. any of that permitted penalty by which ſin it ſelf is a miſery and puniſhment to the ſinner. 4. He fell not under the Power of the Devil as a deceiver and ruler, as the ungodly do. 5. His Conſcience did not accuſe him of ſin, and torment him for it. 6. He did not totally deſpair of ever being ſaved. 7. The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45239:36"/>
fire of Hell did not torment his body. More ſuch inſtances may be given for proof.</p>
                     <p>6. Chriſt did not perform all the ſame obedience in kind, which many men, yea all men, are or were bound to perform. As 1. He did not dreſs and keep that Garden which <hi>Adam</hi> was commanded to dreſs and keep. 2. He did not the conjugal offices which <hi>Adam,</hi> and millions more, were bound to. 3.
Nor the Paternal Offices to Children. 4. Nor all the offices of a King on Earth, or Magiſtrate: nor of a Servant, &amp;c. Nor the duty of the Sick. 5. He did not repent of ſin, nor turn from it to God, nor mortifie or reſiſt in himſelf any ſinful luſt; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Saviour by Faith, nor was circumciſed or baptized for the Remiſſion of his ſins; nor loved God or thanked him for redeeming or pardoning him; nor obeyed God in the uſe of any Ordinance or Means, for the ſubduing of ſin, and healing or
ſaving of his Soul from any ſin or deſerved wrath of God; with much more ſuch.</p>
                     <p>7. Chriſt did perform much which no man elſe was bound to do: As to redeem Souls, to work his Miracles and the reſt of the works, peculiar to the Mediator.</p>
                     <p>8. That Law which bound us to Suffering, (or made it our due) bound not Chriſt to it, (as being innocent); But he was bound to it by the Fathers Law of Mediator, and by his own voluntary ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>9. The Law obliging every ſinner himſelf to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
was not <hi>fulfilled</hi> by the <hi>Suffering</hi> of Chriſt our Sponſor: But only the <hi>Lawgiver ſatisfied</hi> by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its Ends. For neither the letter nor ſence of it ſaid, [<hi>If thou ſin, thou or thy ſurety ſhall ſuffer.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:45239:36"/>10. Chriſt <hi>ſatisfied Juſtice</hi> and <hi>obeyed</hi> in <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> which alſo was <hi>Holy</hi> in him.</p>
                     <p>11. He did not this as a <hi>Natural</hi> Root, or Head to man, as <hi>Adam</hi> was; to convey <hi>Holineſs</hi> or
<hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> by <hi>natural propagation,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have done; and did by ſin: For Chriſt had no Wife or natural Children; But as a <hi>Head, by Contract</hi>
as a Husband to a Wife, and a King to a Kingdom,
and a <hi>Head of Spiritual Influx.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. No as being <hi>Actually</hi> ſuch a Head to the Redeemed when he <hi>Obeyed</hi> and <hi>Suffered</hi>; but as a Head by <hi>Aptitude</hi> and <hi>Office, Power</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> who was to <hi>become a Head actually</hi> to every one when they <hi>Believed</hi> and <hi>Conſented</hi>; Being before a <hi>Head for them,</hi> and <hi>over thoſe that did exiſt,</hi> but not a <hi>Head to them,</hi> in act.</p>
                     <p>13. Therefore they were not Chriſts members Political, (much leſs Natural) when he obeyed and died.</p>
                     <p>14. A Natural Head being but a <hi>part of a perſon,</hi>
what it doth the <hi>Perſon doth.</hi> But ſeeing a <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Head,</hi> and all the <hi>members</hi> of his <hi>Body Contracted</hi>
or <hi>Politick,</hi> are every one a <hi>diſtinct Perſon,</hi> it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that each perſon did really or reputatively what the <hi>Head did.</hi> Nay it is a good conſequence that [<hi>If he did it as Head, they did it not</hi> (numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally)
as <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Members.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>15. Chriſt <hi>Suffered</hi> and <hi>Obeyed</hi> in the Perſon of the Mediator between God and man; and as a <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
to the Law of Mediation.</p>
                     <p>16. Chriſt may be ſaid to ſuffer <hi>in the perſon of a
ſinner,</hi> as it meaneth <hi>his own perſon reputed and uſed as</hi> a <hi>ſinner</hi> by his perſecutors, and as he was one who
ſtood before God as an Undertaker to ſuffer for Man's ſin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:45239:37"/>17. Chriſt ſuffered in the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>ſtead</hi> of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
that they might be delivered, though in the
<hi>perſon</hi> of a <hi>Sponſor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18. When we are agreed that the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the
<hi>Sponſor,</hi> and of every <hi>particular ſinner</hi> are divers;
and that Chriſt had not ſuffered, if we had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and that he as a <hi>Sponſor ſuffered in our ſtead,</hi>
and ſo bore the puniſhment, which <hi>not he, but we deſerved</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If any will here inſtead of a <hi>Mediator</hi> or
<hi>Sponſor</hi> call him our <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> and ſay that he
ſuffered <hi>even in all our Perſons reputatively</hi> not
<hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> but <hi>ſecunduùm quid, &amp; in tantum</hi> only;
that is, not repreſenting our <hi>Perſons ſimply</hi> and in all <hi>reſpects,</hi> and to <hi>all ends,</hi> but <hi>only ſo far</hi> as to be a
<hi>ſacrifice</hi> for <hi>our ſins,</hi> and ſuffer in our <hi>place</hi> and <hi>ſtead</hi>
what he ſuffered; we take this to be but <hi>lis de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
a queſtion about the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>words</hi>: And we will not oppoſe any man that thinketh thoſe words fitteſt, as long as we agree in the matter ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.
And ſo many Proteſtant Divines ſay that Chriſt ſuffered in the perſon of every ſinner, (at leaſt Elect,) that is, ſo far only and to ſuch effects.</p>
                     <p>19. Chriſt did not ſuffer ſtrictly, ſimply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
in the <hi>perſon</hi> of any one elect ſinner, much leſs in the millions of perſons of them all, in Law-ſence,
or in Gods eſteem. God did not eſteem Chriſt to be <hi>naturally,</hi> or as an <hi>abſolute Repreſenter, David,
Manaſſeh, Paul,</hi> and every ſuch other ſinner, but only a Mediator that ſuffered in their ſtead.</p>
                     <p>20. God did make Chriſt <hi>to be ſin</hi> for us; that is,
A <hi>Sacrifice for our ſin,</hi> and one that by <hi>Man</hi> was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,</hi>
and by <hi>God and Man</hi> was <hi>uſed,</hi> as <hi>ſinners are,</hi>
and deſerve to be.</p>
                     <p>21. Chriſt was not our <hi>Delegate</hi> in <hi>Obeying</hi> or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45239:37"/>
                        <hi>Suffering</hi>: We did not commiſſion him, or depute him to do what he did in our ſtead: But he did it by God's Appointment and his own Will.</p>
                     <p>22. Therefore he did it on God's terms, and to what effects it pleaſed God, and not on our terms,
nor to what effects we pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>23. God did not ſuppoſe or repute Chriſt, to have committed all or any of the ſins which we all committed, nor to have had all the wickedneſs in his nature which was in ours, nor to have deſerved what we deſerved: Nor did he in this proper ſence
<hi>impute our ſins</hi> to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>24. The falſe notion of God's ſtrict imputing all our ſins to Chriſt, and eſteeming him the greateſt
ſinner in the World, being ſo great a Blaſphemy both againſt the Father and the Son, it is ſafeſt in
ſuch Controverſies to hold to the plain and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of Scripture. And it is not the <hi>Wiſdom</hi>
nor <hi>Impartiality</hi> of ſome men, who greatly cry up the Scripture perfection, and decry the addition of a Ceremony or Form in the Worſhip of God; that yet think Religion is endangered, if our Confeſſion uſe not the phraſes of [<hi>God's Imputing our ſin to Chriſt, and his Imputing Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to us</hi>]
when neither of them is in the Scripture; As if all God's Word were not <hi>big</hi> or <hi>perfect</hi> enough to make us a Creed or Confeſſion in ſuch phraſes as it is fit for Chriſtians to take up with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Countenancing the Papiſts, whoſe Faith is ſwelled to the many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of the Councils, and no man can know how much more is to be added, and when we have all.</p>
                     <p>25. God doth not repute or account us to have <hi>ſuffered</hi> in our Natural perſons what Chriſt ſuffered for us, nor Chriſt to have ſuffered in our Natural perſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:45239:38"/>26. Though Chriſt <hi>ſuffered in our ſtead,</hi> and in a large ſence, to certain uſes and in <hi>ſome reſpects,</hi> as the <hi>Repreſenter,</hi> or in the <hi>Perſons</hi> of ſinners; yet did he not ſo far <hi>repreſent</hi> their perſons in his <hi>Habitual Holineſs and Actual Obedience</hi> (no not in the <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
of his <hi>Suffering,</hi>) as he did in the <hi>ſuffering it
ſelf.</hi> He obeyed not in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of a <hi>ſinner,</hi> much leſs of millions of ſinners; which were to ſay, <hi>In the perſon of ſinners he never ſinned.</hi> He ſuffered, to ſave us from ſuffering; but he <hi>obeyed not to ſave us from obeying,</hi> but to bring us to Obedience. Yet his
<hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> had this <hi>end,</hi> that <hi>perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
might not be <hi>neceſſary</hi> in us to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation.</p>
                     <p>27. It was not <hi>we our ſelves</hi> who did <hi>perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,</hi>
or were <hi>perfectly holy,</hi> or ſuffered for ſin in the
<hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or by <hi>Him:</hi> Nor did we (<hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
or <hi>Morally) merit</hi> our own Salvation by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt; nor did <hi>we ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for our ſins,</hi> nor purchaſe pardon of Salvation to our
ſelves, by our <hi>Suffering</hi> in and <hi>by Chriſt</hi>; All ſuch phraſe and ſence is contrary to Scripture. But Chriſt did this for us.</p>
                     <p>28. Therefore God doth not repute us to have done it, ſeeing it is not true.</p>
                     <p>29. It is impoſſible for the <hi>individual</hi> formal
<hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, to be our <hi>Formal perſonal Righteouſneſs.</hi> Becauſe it is a <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>Accident,</hi>
which cannot be tranſlated from ſubject to ſubject,
and cannot be in divers ſubjects the ſame.</p>
                     <p>30. Where the queſtion is, Whether Chriſts <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, his <hi>Habits, Acts</hi> and
<hi>Sufferings</hi> themſelves, be <hi>Ours,</hi> we muſt conſider how a man can have <hi>Propriety in Habits, Acts and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45239:38"/>
Paſſions</hi> who is the <hi>ſubject</hi> of them: and in <hi>Actions,</hi>
who is the <hi>Agent</hi> of them. To <hi>Give the ſame Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Habit or Paſſion</hi> to another, <hi>is an Impoſſibility,</hi>
that is, to make him by Gift the ſubject of it. For it is not the ſame, if it be in another ſubject. To
<hi>make</hi> one <hi>man really</hi> or <hi>phyſically</hi> to have been the
<hi>Agent</hi> of <hi>anothers Act,</hi> even that <hi>Individual Act,</hi> if he was not ſo, is a contradiction and impoſſibility;
that is, to make it true, that I did that which I did not. To be ours by <hi>Divine Imputation,</hi> cannot be,
<hi>to be ours by a falſe Reputation,</hi> or ſuppoſition that we did what we did not: For God cannot err or lie. There is therefore but one of theſe two ways left, <hi>Either that we our ſelves in perſon, truly had the habits which Chriſt had, and did all that Chriſt did, and ſuffered all that he ſuffered, and ſo ſatisfied and merited Life in and by him, as by an Inſtrument,
or Legal Repreſenter of our perſons in all this</hi>; Which I am anon to Confute: or elſe, That <hi>Chriſts Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
Righteouſneſs, and the <hi>Habits, Acts</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi>
in which it lay, are imputed to us, and made ours; not rigidly in the very thing it ſelf, but in the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi>; In as much as we are as really <hi>Pardoned, Juſtified, Adopted</hi> by them, as the Meritorious cauſe, by the inſtrumentality of the Covenants Donation, as if we our ſelves had done and ſuffered all that Chriſt did, as a Mediator and Sponſor, do and ſuffer for us: I ſay, As <hi>really</hi> and
<hi>certainly,</hi> and with a fuller demonſtration of Gods Mercy and Wiſdom, and with a ſufficient demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Juſtice. But not that our propriety in the benefits is in all reſpects the ſame, as it ſhould have been if we had <hi>been, done, and ſuffered our ſelves</hi>
what Chriſt did. Thus Chriſts Righteouſneſs is ours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:45239:39"/>31. Chriſt is truly <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs</hi>; in more reſpects than one or two: 1. In that he is the <hi>meritorious Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Pardon of all our ſins,</hi> and our full Juſtification, Adoption, and right to Glory:
and by his Satisfaction and Merits only, our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Covenant of Grace againſt the Curſe of the Law of Works is purchaſed. 2. In that he is the Legiſlator, Teſtator and Donor of our Pardon, and Juſtification by this new-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Covenant. 3. In that he is the Head of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux,
and King and Interceſſor, by and from whom the <hi>Spirit</hi> is given, to ſanctifie us to God, and cauſe us ſincerely to perform the Conditions of the Juſtifying and ſaving Covenant, in Accepting and Improving the mercy then given. 4. In that he is the Righteous Judge and Juſtifyer of Believers by
ſentence of Judgment. In all theſe Reſpects he is
<hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>32. We are ſaid <hi>to be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him</hi>: 1. In that, as he was <hi>uſed like a ſinner</hi>
for us, (but not eſteemed one by God) ſo we are uſed
<hi>like Innocent perſons</hi> ſo far as to be <hi>ſaved</hi> by him.
2. In that through his <hi>Merits,</hi> and upon our <hi>union with him,</hi> when we believe and conſent to his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
we are <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>juſtified,</hi> and ſo made
<hi>Righteous</hi> really, that is, ſuch as are not to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi>
but to be glorified. 3. In that the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Inherent Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> to them that are
<hi>in him by Faith,</hi> are for his Merits, given by the Holy Ghoſt. 4. In that God's Juſtice and Holineſs Truth, Wiſdom, and Mercy, are all wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in this way of pardoning and juſtifying
ſinners by Chriſt. Thus are we made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:45239:39"/>31. For <hi>Righteouſneſs to be imputed to us,</hi> is all one as to be accounted <hi>Righteous,</hi> Rom. 4.6, 11. notwithſtanding that we be not Righteous as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillers of the Law of Innocency.</p>
                     <p>34. For <hi>Faith to be imputed to us for Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4.22, 23, 24. is plainly meant, that God who under the Law of Innocency required perfect Obedience, of us to our Juſtification and Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> and <hi>merits</hi> of Chriſt, hath freely given a full <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Life,</hi> to all true Believers; ſo that now by the Covenant of Grace nothing is required <hi>of us,</hi> to our Juſtification, but <hi>Faith</hi>: all the reſt being done by Chriſt: And ſo Faith in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, is reputed truly to be the condition on our part, on which Chriſt and Life, by that Baptiſmal Covenant, are made ours.</p>
                     <p>35. Juſtification, Adoption, and Life eternal are conſidered; 1. <hi>Quoad ipſam rem,</hi> as to the thing it ſelf in value. 2. <hi>Quoad, Ordinem Conferendi &amp; Recipiendi,</hi> as to the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Conveyance</hi> and <hi>Participation.</hi> In the firſt reſpect, <hi>It is a meer free-gift to us, purchaſed by Chriſt</hi>: In the ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, It is a <hi>Reward</hi> to Believers, who thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept the free-Gift according to its nature and uſes.</p>
                     <p>36. It is an error contrary to the ſcope of the Goſpel to ſay, that <hi>the Law of Works, or of Innocency,</hi> doth juſtifie us, as performed either by our ſelves, or by Chriſt. For that Law condemneth and curſeth us; And we are not efficiently juſtified by it, but <hi>from or againſt it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>37. Therefore we have no Righteouſneſs in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> or <hi>Reputation formally ours,</hi> which conſiſteth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45239:40"/>
in the firſt <hi>ſpecies</hi>; that is, in a <hi>Conformity to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive part of the Law of Innocency</hi>; we are not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Innocent</hi>: But only a Righteouſneſs which conſiſteth in <hi>Pardon of all ſin, and right to life,</hi> (with
<hi>ſincere performance of the Condition of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> that is, <hi>True Faith.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>38. Our pardon puts not away our <hi>Guilt of Fact</hi>
or <hi>Fault,</hi> but our <hi>Guilt of, or, obligation to Puniſhment.</hi>
God doth not repute us ſuch as never ſinned, or
ſuch as by our Innocency merited Heaven, but ſuch as are not to be <hi>damned,</hi> but to be <hi>glorified,</hi> becauſe
<hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>adopted</hi> through the Satisfaction and Merits of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>39. Yet the <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> is remitted to us Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively as to the puniſhment, though not in it ſelf;
that is, It ſhall not procure our Damnation: Even as Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is, though not in it ſelf,
yet reſpectively as to the Benefits ſaid to be <hi>made ours,</hi> in as much as we ſhall have thoſe benefits by it.</p>
                     <p>40. Thus both the <hi>Material</hi> and the <hi>Formal Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt are made ours</hi>; that is, <hi>Both</hi>
the <hi>Holy Habits</hi> and <hi>Acts,</hi> and his <hi>Sufferings, with the Relative formal Righteouſneſs of his own Perſon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are altogether one Meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification, commonly called the Material Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But though Forma Denominat; yet if Chriſts Righteouſneſs in Matter and Form, be the Meritorious Cauſe of ours, and that be the ſame with the Material Cauſe,</hi> it is a <hi>very tolerable ſpeech to ſay, that His Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is Ours in it ſelf, while it is the very matter of ours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When any man is <hi>Righteous Immediately by <pb n="63" facs="tcp:45239:40"/>
any action,</hi> that action is called <hi>the Matter</hi> of his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> in ſuch an Analogical ſenſe as Action, an <hi>Accident</hi> may be called <hi>Matter,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of Righteous is founded or ſubjected firſt or partly in that <hi>Action.</hi> And ſo when Chriſt perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>obeyed,</hi> it was the <hi>Matter of his Righteouſneſs.</hi> But to be Righteous and to <hi>Merit</hi> are not all one notion: Merit is adventitious to meer Righteouſneſs. Now it is not Chriſts <hi>Actions</hi> in themſelves that our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs reſulteth from immediately as his own did; But there is firſt his <hi>Action,</hi> then his <hi>formal Righteouſneſs thereby</hi>; and <hi>thirdly, his Merit</hi> by that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which goes to procure the <hi>Covenant-Donation</hi> of Righteouſnaſs to us, by which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant we are <hi>efficiently</hi> made Righteous. So that the name of a <hi>Material Cauſe</hi> is much more properly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Chriſts Actions,</hi> as to his <hi>own formal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> than as to <hi>ours.</hi> But yet this is but <hi>de nomine.</hi> 2. Above all, conſider what that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is which Chriſt merited for us, (which is the heart of the Controverſie.) It is not of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> or ſort with his own. His Righteouſneſs was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>ſinleſs Innocency,</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of the Law of Innocency in Holineſs.</hi> Ours is not ſuch. The diſſenters think it is ſuch by <hi>Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and here is the difference. Ours is but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>retributive part</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>; a <hi>Right to Impunity and Life, and a Juſtification</hi> not at all <hi>by that Law, but from its curſe or condemnation.</hi> The Law that ſaith, <hi>Obey perfectly and live, ſin and die,</hi> doth not juſtifie us as perſons that have perfectly obeyed it, really or imputatively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But its <hi>obligation to puniſhment is diſſolved,</hi> not by it ſelf, but by the Law <hi>of Grace.</hi> It is then by the Law
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45239:41"/>
                        <hi>of Grace</hi> that we are judged and juſtified. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, 1. We are not <hi>really</hi> or <hi>reputatively ſuch</hi> as have <hi>perfectly fulfilled</hi> all <hi>its Precepts:</hi> 2. But we are ſuch as by Grace do <hi>ſincerely perform</hi> the <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of its promiſe. 3. By which promiſe of Gift, we are ſuch as have right to Chriſts own <hi>perſon,</hi> in the Relation and Union of a Head and Saviour, and with him the pardon of all our ſins, and the <hi>right of Adoption to the Spirit, and the Heavenly Inheritance</hi> as <hi>purchaſed by Chriſt.</hi> So that beſides our Inherent or Adherent Righteouſneſs of ſincere <hi>Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Obedience,</hi> as the performed condition of the Law of Grace, we have no other Righteouſneſs our ſelves, but <hi>Right to Impunity and to Life</hi>: and not any <hi>imputed ſinleſs Innocency</hi> at all. God <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth</hi> our ſins and <hi>adopteth</hi> us, for the ſake of Chriſt's ſufferings and <hi>perfect Holineſs</hi>: But he doth not account us <hi>perfectly Holy</hi> for it, nor <hi>perfectly Obedient.</hi> So that how-ever you will call it, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> a <hi>Material Cauſe</hi> or a <hi>Meritorious,</hi> the thing is plain.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>He is made of God Righteouſneſs to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> True: But that's none of the queſtion. But how is he ſo made? 1. As he is made Wiſdom, Sanctification and Redemption as aforeſaid. 2. By Merit, Satisfaction, Direction, Preſcription and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He is the Meritorious Cauſe of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, of our Adoption, of our Right to Heaven, of that new Covenant which is the Inſtrumental Deed of Gift, confirming all theſe: And he is alſo our Righteouſneſs in the ſenſe that <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo much ſtandeth on, as all our Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of Heart and Life, is not of our natural endeavour, but his gift, and operation by his Spirit; cauſing us
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45239:41"/>
to obey his Holy precepts and Example. All theſe ways he is made of God our Righteouſneſs: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Objective way of ſenſe; as he is <hi>Objectively</hi> made our <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> becauſe it is the trueſt wiſdom to know him; So he is objectively made our <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> in that it is that Goſpel-Righteouſneſs which is required <hi>of our ſelves,</hi> by his grace, to believe in him and obey him.</p>
                     <p>41. Though Chriſt fulfilled not the Law by Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Holineſs and Actual Obedience, ſtrictly in the Individual perſon of each particular ſinner; yet he did it in the nature of Man: And ſo humane nature, (conſidered <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and in Chriſt perſonally, though not conſidered as <hi>a totum,</hi> or as perſonally in each man,) did ſatisfie and fullfil the Law and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. As Humane Nature ſinned in <hi>Adam</hi> actually in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and in his individual perſon, and all our <hi>Perſons</hi> were <hi>ſeminally</hi> and <hi>virtually</hi> in him, and accordingly ſinned, or are reputed ſinners, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no nature but what he conveyed who could convey no better than he had (either as to Relation or Real quality): But not that God reputed us to have been <hi>actually exiſtent,</hi> as <hi>really diſtinct perſons</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> (which is not true.) Even ſo Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and ſuffered in our <hi>Nature,</hi> and in our nature as it was in him; and humane ſinful nature in <hi>ſpecie</hi> was Univerſally pardoned by him and <hi>Eternal life freely given to all men</hi> for his merits, thus far impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, their ſins being not imputed to hinder this Gift; which is made in and by the Covenant of Grace: Only the Gift hath the Condition of mans Acceptance of it according to its nature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. And all the individuals that ſhall in time by Faith accept the Gift, are there and thereby made
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45239:42"/>
ſuch as the Covenant for his merits doth juſtifie, by that General Gift.</p>
                     <p>42. As <hi>Adam</hi> was a Head by <hi>Nature,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conveyed Guilt by natural Generation; ſo Chriſt is a Head (not by nature but) by Sacred Contract; and therefore conveyeth Right to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Adoption and Salvation, not by Generation,
but by Contract, or Donation. So that what it was to be <hi>naturally</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſeminally and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
though not perſonlly in exiſtence; even that it is, in order to our benefit by him to be <hi>in Chriſt by Contract or the new Covenant,</hi> virtually, though not in perſonal exiſtence when the Covenant was made.</p>
                     <p>43. They therefore that look upon Juſtification or Righteouſneſs, as coming to us immediately by Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us, without the Inſtrumental Intervention and Conveyance or Collation by this Deed of Gift or Covenant, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found themſelves by confounding and overlooking the Cauſes of our Juſtification. That which Chriſt did by his merits was to procure the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
The new Covenant is a free Gift of pardon and life with Chriſt himſelf, for his merits and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
ſake.</p>
                     <p>44. Though the Perſon of the Mediator be not really or reputatively the very <hi>perſon of each ſinner,</hi>
(nor ſo <hi>many perſons</hi> as there are <hi>ſinners</hi> or <hi>believers,</hi>)
yet it doth belong to the <hi>Perſon of the Mediator,</hi> ſo far (limitedly) to <hi>bear the perſon of a ſinner,</hi> and to
ſtand in the place of the <hi>Perſons of all Sinners,</hi> as to bear the puniſhment they deſerved, and to ſuffer for their ſins.</p>
                     <p>45. Scripture ſpeaking of moral matters, uſually
ſpeaketh rather in Moral than meer Phyſical
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45239:42"/>
phraſe: And in ſtrict Phyſical ſence, Chriſts very perſonal Righteouſneſs (Material or Formal) is not ſo given to us, as that we are proprietors of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing it ſelf, but only of the effects (Pardon, Righteouſneſs and Life,) yet in a larger Moral phraſe that very thing is oft ſaid to be given to us, which is given to another, or done or ſuffered for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. He that ranſometh a Captive from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer, Phyſically giveth the Money to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer &amp; not to the Captive, &amp; giveth the Captive only the Liberty purchaſed: But <hi>morally</hi> and reputatively he is ſaid to give the Money to the Captive, becauſe he gave it <hi>for him.</hi> And it redeemeth him as well as if he had given it himſelf. He that giveth ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds to purchaſe Lands, &amp; freely giveth that land to another; phyſically giveth the <hi>Money</hi> to the <hi>Seller</hi> only, and the Land only to the other. But morally and reputatively we content our ſelves with the metonymical phraſe, and ſay, he gave the other ten thouſand pound. So morally it may be ſaid, that Chriſts Righteouſneſs, Merits and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, was given to us, in that the thing purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by it was given to us; when the Satisfaction was given or made to God. Yea when we ſaid it was made to God, we mean only that he was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively the <hi>Terminus</hi> of active Satisfaction, being the party ſatisfyed; but not that he himſelf was made the Subject and Agent of Habits and Acts, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt as in his humane nature, except as the Divine Nature acted it, or by Communication of Attributes.</p>
                     <p>46. Becauſe the words [<hi>Perſon</hi>] and [<hi>Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>] and [<hi>Repreſenting</hi>] are ambiguous (as all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane language is,) while ſome uſe them in a <hi>ſtricter
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45239:43"/>
ſenſe</hi> than others do, we muſt try by other explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory terms whether we agree in the matter, and not lay the ſtreſs of our Controverſy upon the bare words. So ſome Divines ſay that Chriſt ſuffered in the <hi>Perſon of a ſinner,</hi> when they mean not that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Natural perſon of any one particular
ſinner; but that his own <hi>Perſon</hi> was reputed the Sponſor of ſinners by God, and that he was judged a real ſinner by his perſecuters; and ſo ſuffered as if he had been a ſinner.</p>
                     <p>47. As Chriſt is leſs improperly ſaid to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented our Perſons in his ſatisfactory Sufferings,
than in his perſonal perfect <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi>;
ſo he is leſs improperly ſaid to have <hi>Repreſented all mankind as newly fallen in Adam, in a General ſenſe,
for the purchaſing of the univerſal Gift of Pardon and Life, called, The new Covenant; than to have Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in his perfect Holineſs and his Sufferings, every Believer conſidered as from his firſt being to his Death.</hi>
Though it is certain that he dyed for all their ſins from firſt to laſt. For it is moſt true, 1. That Chriſt is as a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Root of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed;
And as we derive ſin from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo we derive life from Chriſt, (allowing the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Natural and a Voluntary way of derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.)
And though no mans <hi>Perſon</hi> as a <hi>Perſon</hi> was actually <hi>exiſtent</hi> and <hi>offended</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> (nor was by God reputed to have been and done) yet all mens Perſons were <hi>Virtually</hi> and <hi>Seminally</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> as is aforeſaid; and when they <hi>are exiſtent perſons,</hi> they are no better either by <hi>Relative Innocency,</hi> or by <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Diſpoſition,</hi> than he could propagate: and are truly and juſtly reputed by God to be <hi>Perſons Guilty of Adams fact,</hi> ſo far as they were by nature
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45239:43"/>
ſeminally and virtually in him: And Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam</hi> is in a ſort the root of <hi>Man as Man,</hi>
(though not by propagation of us, yet) as he is the
<hi>Redeemer</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf from deſtruction, but more notably the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Saints as Saints,</hi> who are to have no real ſanctity but what ſhall be derived from him by Regeneration, as Nature and Sin is from <hi>Adam</hi> by Generation. But <hi>Adam</hi> did not repreſent all his poſterity as to all the Actions which they ſhould do themſelves from their Birth to their Death; ſo that they ſhould all have been taken for perfectly obedient to the death, if <hi>Adam</hi>
had not ſinned at that time, yea or during his Life.
For if any of them under that Covenant had ever
ſinned afterward in their own perſon, they ſhould have died for it. But for the time paſt, they were Guiltleſs or Guilty in <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was Guiltleſs or Guilty himſelf, ſo far as they were in <hi>Adam</hi>: And though that was but in <hi>Cauſâ, &amp; non extra cauſam</hi>;
Yet a Generating Cauſe which propagateth eſſence from eſſence, by ſelf-multiplication of form, much differeth from an <hi>Arbitrary facient Cauſe</hi> in this. If
<hi>Adam</hi> had obeyed, yet all his poſterity had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs bound to perfect perſonal perſevering O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience on pain of Death. And Chriſt the ſecond
<hi>Adam</hi> ſo far bore the perſon of fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> and
ſuffered in the nature and room of Mankind in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as without any condition on their part at all;
to give man by an act of Oblivion or new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a pardon of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, yea and of all ſin paſt,
at the time of their conſent, though not diſobliging them from all future Obedience. And by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holineſs and Obedience and Sufferings, he hath merited that new Covenant, which <hi>Accepteth</hi> of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45239:44"/>
ſincere, though imperfect, Obedience, and maketh no more in us neceſſary to Salvation. When I ſay he did this <hi>without</hi> any <hi>Condition</hi> on mans part, I mean, He <hi>abſolutely without Condition, merited and gave us the Juſtifying Teſtament</hi> or <hi>Covenant.</hi> Though that Covenant give us not Juſtification abſolutely,
but on Condition of <hi>believing, fiducial Conſent.</hi> 2.
And ſo as this <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Gift</hi> of Juſtification upon Acceptance, is actually given to all fallen mankind as ſuch; ſo Chriſt might be ſaid to ſuffer inſtead of all, yea and merit too, ſo far as to procure them this Covenant-gift.</p>
                     <p>48. The ſum of all lyeth in applying the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of giving Chriſts Righteouſneſs <hi>as ſuch in it
ſelf,</hi> and as <hi>a cauſe of our Righteouſneſs,</hi> or in the
<hi>Cauſality of it.</hi> As our ſin is not reputed Chriſts ſin
<hi>in it ſelf,</hi> and in the culpability of it (for then it muſt needs make Chriſt odious to God) but in its <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of puniſhment</hi>: ſo Chriſt's Material or Formal Righteouſneſs, is not by God reputed to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and abſolutely <hi>our own</hi> in <hi>it ſelf</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> but the <hi>Cauſality</hi> of it as it produceth ſuch and ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                     <p>49. The Objections which are made againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs in the ſound

                        <q>Pag. 100, 101. [If we enquire of the manner how Righteouſneſs and Life is derived from Chriſt, being one unto ſo many, it cannot be, except Chriſt be a general Head of mankind, and one Perſon with them, as <hi>Adam</hi> was. We do not read of any but two who were general Heads, and in ſome reſpect virtually, <hi>All mankind</hi>; the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45239:45"/>
But, 2. How far is he <hi>One perſon with us</hi>? Anſ. 1. In general ſo far as it pleaſed God to make him ſo,<note rend="inter">Not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.</note> and no further. 2. In particular, He and we are one ſo far 1. As to make him liable to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law for us. 2. So far as to free us from that obligation, and derive the benefit of his death to us. Though Chriſt be ſo far one with us as to be lyable unto the penalty of the Law, and to ſuffer it, and upon this ſuffering we are freed; yet Chriſt is not the ſinner, nor the ſinner Chriſt. Chriſt is the Word made fleſh, innocent without ſin, an univerſal Prieſt and King: but we are none of theſe. Though we be accounted as one perſon in Law with him,<note rend="inter">Mark by a Trope.</note> by a Trope; yet in proper ſence it cannot be ſaid <hi>that in Chriſt's Satisfying we ſatisfied for our own ſins.</hi> For then we ſhould have been the Word made fleſh, able to plead Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which are falſe, impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,<note rend="inter">Mark how far.</note> blaſphemous if affirmed by any. It's true, we are ſo one with him, that he ſatisfied for us, and the benefit of this Satisfaction redounds to us, and is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all, upon certain termes; though not actually communicated to all: From this Unity and Identity of perſon in Law (if I may ſo ſpeak) it followeth clearly that Chriſt's ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were not only Afflictions, but Puniſhments in proper ſenſe. —<hi>Pag.</hi> 102, 103. That Chriſt died for all in ſome ſence muſt needs be granted, becauſe the Scripture expreſly affirms it (<hi>vid. reliqua.</hi>) —</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There is another queſtion unprofitably hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45239:45"/>
Whether the <hi>Propitiation</hi> which includeth both Satisfaction and Merit, be to be aſcribed to the Active or Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Both his Active, Perſonal, Perfect and Perpetual Obedience, which by reaſon of his humane nature aſſumed, and ſubjection unto God was due, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that Obedience to the great and tranſcendent Command of ſuffering the death of the Croſs, both concur as Cauſes of Remiſſion and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. The Scriptures uſually aſcribe it to the Blood, Death, &amp; Sacrifice of Chriſt, and never to the Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Active Obedience of Chriſt's to the Moral Law. 3. Yet this Active Obedience is neceſſary, becauſe without it he could not have offered that great Sacrifice of himſelf without ſpot to God. And if it had not been without ſpot, it could not have been propitiatory and effectual for Expiation. 4. If Chriſt as our Surety had performed for us perfect and perpetual Obedience, ſo that we might have been judged to have perfectly and fully kept the Law by him, then no ſin could have been chargeable upon us, and the Death of Chriſt had been needleſs and ſuperfluous. 5. Chriſts Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation freeth the Believer not only from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation unto puniſhment of ſenſe, but of loſs; and procured for him not only deliverance from evil deſerved, but the enjoyment of all good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our full happineſs. Therefore, there is no ground of Scripture for that opinion, that the Death of Chriſt and his Sufferings free us from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and by his Active Obedience imputed to us we are made righteous, and the heirs of life. 6. If Chriſt was bound to perform perfect and perpetual Obedience for us, and he alſo performed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45239:46"/>
it for us, then we are freed not only from ſin, but Obedience too: And this Obedience as diſtinct and ſeparate from Obedience unto death, may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Juſtification of Life, and will be ſufficient to carry the Cauſe. For the tenor of the Law was this, <hi>Do this and live:</hi> And if man do this by himſelf or Surety, ſo as that the Lawgiver and ſupreme Judg accept it, the Law can require no more. It could not bind to perfect Obedience and to puniſhment too. There was never any ſuch Law made by God or juſt men. Before I conclude this particular of the extent of Chriſts Merit and Propitiation, I thought good to inform the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that as the Propitiation of Chriſt maketh no man abſolutely, but upon certain terms pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſavable; ſo it was never made, either to prevent all ſin, or all puniſhments: For it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth man both ſinful and miſerable: And we know that the Guilt and Puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, lyeth heavy on all his poſterity to this day. And not only that, but the guilt of actual and perſonal ſins lyeth wholly upon us, whileſt impenitent and unbelieving and ſo out of Chriſt. And the Regenerate themſelves are not fully freed from all puniſhments till the final Reſurrection and Judgment. So that his Propitiation doth not altogether prevent but remove ſin and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by degrees. Many ſins may be ſaid to be Remiſſible by vertue of this Sacrifice, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be remitted.] So far Mr. <hi>Lawſon.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I would add only theſe Animadverſions.</p>
                     <p>1. That whereas he explaineth <hi>Chriſts perſonating us</hi> in ſuffering by the ſimilitude of a Debtor and his Surety who are the ſame perſon in Law: I note 1.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45239:46"/>
That the caſe of Debt much differeth from the caſe of Puniſhment. 2. That a Surety of Debt is either antecedently ſuch, or conſequently: Antecedently, either firſt one that is bound equally with the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; 2. or one that promiſeth to pay if he do not. I think the Law accounteth neither of theſe to be the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the principal Debtor (as it doth a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant by whom he ſends the Debt.) But Chriſt was neither of theſe: For the Law did not beforehand oblige him with us, nor did he in Law-ſence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to pay the Debt, if we failed. Though God decreed that he ſhould do ſo; yet that was no part of the ſence of the Law. But conſequently, if a friend of the Debtor when he is in Jayl will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his requeſt or knowledg, ſay to the Creditor, I will pay you all the Debt; but ſo that he ſhall be in my power, and not have preſent liberty (leſt he abuſe it) but on the terms that I ſhall pleaſe; yea not at all if he ungratefully reject it] This <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> Satisfyer, or Sponſor, or Paymaſter, is not in Law-ſence the ſame <hi>Perſon</hi> with the Debtor: But if any will call him ſo, I will not contend about a word, while we agree of the thing (the terms of deliverance.) And this is as near the Caſe between Chriſt and us, as the ſimilitude of a Debtor will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>2. I do differ from Mr. <hi>Lawſon</hi> and <hi>Paraeus,</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſine,</hi> and <hi>Olevian,</hi> and <hi>Scultetus</hi> and all that ſort of worthy Divines in this; that whereas they make Chriſts Holineſs and perfect Obedience to be but <hi>Juſtitia perſonae,</hi> neceſſary to make his Sacrifice ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſo effectual: I think that <hi>of it ſelf</hi> it is as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the cauſe of our Pardon, Juſtification and Life, as Chriſts Paſſion is; The Paſſion being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45239:47"/>
and ſo meritorious, and the perſonal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Meritorious and ſo Satisfactory. For the truth is, The Law that condemned us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was not fulfilled by Chriſts ſuffering for us, but the <hi>Lawgiver</hi> ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied inſtead of the fulfilling of it: And that Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lyeth, in the ſubſtitution of that which as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(or more) attaineth the ends of the Law as our own ſuffering would have done. Now the ends of the Law may be attained by immediate Merit of Perfection as well as by Suffering; but beſt by both.
For 1. By the perfect Holineſs and Obedience of Chriſt, the Holy and perfect will of God is <hi>pleaſed</hi>:
whence [<hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>] 2. In order to the ends of Government,
Holineſs and perfect Obedience, is honoured and freed from the contempt which ſin would caſt upon it; and the holineſs <hi>of the Law</hi> in its <hi>Precepts</hi> is publickly honoured in this grand Exemplar; In whom only the will of God was done on Earth, as it is done in Heaven. And ſuch a Specimen to the World is greatly conducible to the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
So that Chriſt voluntarily taking humane nature, which as ſuch is obliged to this Perfection,
He firſt highly merited of God the Father hereby,
and this with his Suffering, went to attain the ends that our ſuffering ſhould have attained, much better.
So that at leaſt as <hi>Meritorious,</hi> if not ſecondarily as
<hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> I ſee not but <hi>Chriſts Holineſs</hi> procureth the <hi>Juſtifying Covenant</hi> for us, equally with his Death. A Prince may pardon a Traitor for <hi>ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſervice of his Friend,</hi> as well as for his ſuffering:
much more for both. This way go <hi>Grotius de ſatisf.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>3. When Mr <hi>Lawſon</hi> ſaith that the Law binds
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45239:47"/>
not to Obedience and Puniſhment both, he meaneth as to the ſame Act: which contradicts not what
<hi>Nigrinus</hi> and others ſay, that it binds a ſinner to puniſhment for ſin paſt, and yet to Obedience for the time to come: (which cannot be entire and perfect.)</p>
                     <p>So pag. 311. <hi>Cap.</hi> 22. <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Whether there be two parts of Juſtification, Remiſſion and Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs. 1. He referreth us to what is aforecited againſt Imputation of Chriſts Active Righteouſneſs, ſeparated or abſtracted for Reward from the Paſſive. 2. He ſheweth that <hi>Paul</hi> taketh <hi>Remiſſion of ſin and Imputation of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for the ſame thing.</hi>] So ſay many of ours.</p>
                     <p>In concluſion I will mind the Reader, that by reading ſome Authors for Imputation, I am brought to doubt whether ſome deny not all true Remiſſion of ſin, that is, Remiſſion of the deſerved puniſhment. Becauſe I find that by <hi>Remiſſion</hi> they mean <hi>A non-Imputation of ſin under the formal notion of ſin</hi>; that God taketh it not to be our ſin, but Chriſts; and Chriſts Righteouſneſs and perfection to be ſo ours, as that God accounteth us not as truly ſinners. And ſo they think that the <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> as well as <hi>Poenae</hi> ſimply in it ſelf is done away. Which if it be ſo, then the <hi>Reatus Poenae,</hi> the obligation to puniſhment, or the <hi>dueneſs</hi> of puniſhment, cannot be ſaid to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or remitted, becauſe it was never contracted. Where I hold, that it is the <hi>Reatus ad Poenam,</hi> the <hi>Dueneſs</hi> of puniſhment only that is remitted, and the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> not as in it ſelf, but in its <hi>Cauſality</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And ſo in all common language, we ſay we forgive a man his fault, when we forgive him all the penalty poſitive and privative. Not eſteeming him, 1. Never to have done the fact. 2. Or that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45239:48"/>
fact not to have been a fault, <hi>and his fault</hi>; 3. but that puniſhment for that fault, is forgiven him, and the fault ſo far as it is a cauſe of puniſhment. We muſt not feign God to judg falſly.</p>
                     <p>This maketh me think of a ſaying of Bp. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhers</hi> to me, when I mentioned the Papiſts placing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Remiſſion of ſin conjunct, he told me that the Papiſts ordinarily acknowledg no Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And on ſearch I find that <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the moſt of them place no true Remiſſion of ſin, in Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For by <hi>Remiſſion</hi> (which they make part of Juſtification,) they mean <hi>Mortification, or deſtroying ſin it ſelf</hi> in the act or habit. But that the <hi>pardon</hi> of the puniſhment is a thing that we all need, is not denyable; nor do they deny it, though they deny it to be part of our Juſtification. For it's ſtrange if they deny Chriſt the pardoning power which they give the Pope. And as <hi>Joh. Crocius de Juſtif.</hi> oft tells them, They ſhould for ſhame grant that Chriſts Righteouſneſs may be as far imputed to us, as they ſay a Saints or Martyrs redundant merits and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogations are.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>Fact and Guilt of Fault</hi> in it ſelf conſidered, be not both imputed firſt to us, that is, If we be not judged ſinners, I cannot ſee how we can be judged <hi>Pardoned ſinners</hi>; For he that is judged to have no ſin, is judged to deſerve no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Unleſs they will ſay that to prevent the <hi>form and deſert</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> is <hi>eminenter,</hi> though not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter,</hi> to forgive. But it is another (even Actual) forgiveneſs which we hear of in the Goſpel, and pray for daily in the Lords prayer. Of all which ſee the full Scripture-proof in Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> of <hi>Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin.</hi>

                     <p>§ 7. Being Phyſically, they are conſequently ſo Morally conſidered, we being Moral Agents, and the Law a Rule of Morality.</p>
                     <p>§ 8. If the <hi>Actions</hi> be righteous or unrighteous, conſequently the Perſon is ſo, in reference to thoſe Actions, ſuppoſing that to be his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> or the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> to be decided.</p>
                     <p>§ 9. Unrighteouſneſs as to this Cauſe, is <hi>Guilt,</hi> or <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi>; and to be unrighteous is to be <hi>Sons,</hi> or Guilty of ſin.</p>
                     <p>§ 10. The <hi>Retributive</hi> part of the Law is, 1. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miant, for Obedience; 2. Penal, for Diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>§ 11. To be Guilty or Unrighteous as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is, to have no right to the reward (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed the Queſtion in judgment): And to be Righteous here, is to have <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>reward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 12. To be <hi>Guilty</hi> as to the penalty; is to be <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re puniendus,</hi> or <hi>Reus poenae,</hi> or <hi>obligatus ad poenam.</hi> And to be righteous here, is to have <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, (quoad poenam damni &amp; ſenſus.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 13. The firſt Law made <hi>perſonal, perfect, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering Innocency</hi> both mans duty, and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reward and Impunity, and any ſin the condition of puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>§ 14. Man broke this Law, and ſo loſt his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and ſo the Condition became naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to him, <hi>de futuro.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:45239:49"/>§ 15. Therefore that Law as a Covenant, that is, the Promiſſory part with its Condition, ceaſed; <hi>ceſſante capacitate ſubditi</hi>; and ſo did the preceptive part. 1. As it commanded abſolute Innocency (of act and habit.) 2. And as it commanded the ſeeking of the Reward on the Condition and by the means of perſonal Innocency. The Condition thus paſſing into the nature of a ſentence; And puniſhment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining due for the ſin.</p>
                     <p>§ 16. But the Law remained ſtill an obliging Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for future perfect Obedience, and made puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for all future ſin: and theſe two parts of it, as the Law of lapſed Nature, remained in force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt ſin, and the new-Covenant promiſe or Law of Grace.</p>
                     <p>§ 17. The eternal Word interpoſing, a Mediator is promiſed, and Mercy maketh a Law of Grace, and the Word becometh mans Redeemer by underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and by preſent actual reprieve, pardon and initial deliverance: and the fallen world, the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſinners, with the Law and obligations which they were under, are now become the Redemers <hi>jure Redemptionis,</hi> as before they were the Creator's <hi>jure Creationis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 18. The Redeemers Law then hath two parts; 1. The ſaid Law of lapſed nature (binding to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture perfect obedience or puniſhment) which he found man under (called vulgarly the Moral Law.) 2. And a pardoning Remedying Law of Grace.</p>
                     <p>§ 19. Becauſe man had diſhonoured God and his Law by ſin, the Redeemer undertook to take mans nature without ſin, and by perfect Holineſs and Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by becoming a Sacrifice for ſin, to bring that Honour to God and his Law which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45239:50"/>
we ſhould have done, and to attain the Ends of Law and Government inſtead of our <hi>Perfection</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> that for the Merit hereof we might be delivered and live.</p>
                     <p>§ 20. This he did in the third perſon of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who as ſuch had a Law or Covenant proper to himſelf, the Conditions of which he performed, (by perfect keeping. 1. The Law of Innocency; 2. Of <hi>Moſes</hi>; 3. And that proper to himſelf alone) and ſo merited all that was promiſed to him, for Himſelf and Us.</p>
                     <p>§ 21. By his Law of Grace (as our Lord-Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) he gave firſt to all mankind (in <hi>Adam,</hi> and after in <hi>Noah,</hi> and by a ſecond fuller edition at his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) a free Pardon of the deſtructive puniſhment (but not of all puniſhment) with right to his Spirit of Grace, Adoption and Glory, in Union with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their Head, on Condition initially of Faith and Repentance, and progreſſively of ſincere Obedience to the end, to be performed by his Help or Grace.</p>
                     <p>§ 22. By this Law of Grace (ſuppoſing the Law of lapſed nature aforeſaid, incluſively) all the World is ruled, and ſhall be judged, according to that edition of it (to <hi>Adam</hi> or by Chriſt) which they are under. And by it they ſhall be Juſtified or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                     <p>§ 23. If the queſtion then be, Have you kept or not kept the Conditions of the Law of Grace, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Performance or nothing muſt ſo far be our Righteouſneſs, and not Chriſts keeping them for us, or Satisfaction for our not keeping them. And this is the great Caſe (ſo oft by Chriſt deſcribed <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to be decided in judgment; and therefore the word <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> are uſed for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45239:50"/>
what is thus perſonal hundreds of times in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>§ 24. But as to the queſtion, <hi>Have we kept</hi> the <hi>Law of Innocency</hi>? we muſt confeſs guilt and ſay, No: neither Immediately by our ſelves, nor Mediately by another, or Inſtrument: for <hi>Perſonal Obedience</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the performance required by that Law; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have no <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> conſiſting in ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance or Innocency; but muſt confeſs ſin, and plead a pardon.</p>
                     <p>§ 25. Therefore no man hath a proper <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Righteouſneſs,</hi> excluding all kind of Guilt whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>§ 26. Therefore no man is juſtified by the Law of Innocency (nor the Law Moſaical as of works;) either by the Preceptive or Retributive part: for we broke the Precept, and are by the Threatning heirs of death.</p>
                     <p>§ 27. That Law doth not juſtifie us, becauſe Chriſt fulfilled it for us: For it ſaid not (in words or ſenſe) [Thou or one for thee ſhall <hi>Perfectly Obey,</hi> or <hi>Suffer</hi>:] It mentioned no Subſtitute: But it is the Law-giver (and not that Law) that juſtifieth us by other means.</p>
                     <p>§ 28. But we have <hi>another Righteouſneſs imputed</hi> to us <hi>inſtead of that Perfect Legal Innocency</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardableneſs,</hi> by which we ſhall be <hi>accepted of God,</hi> and <hi>glorified</hi> at laſt as ſurely and fully (at leaſt) as if we had never ſinned, or had perfectly kept that Law; which therefore may be called our <hi>Pro-legal Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 29. But this Righteouſneſs is not yet either OURS by ſuch a propriety as a Perſonal perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance would have bin, nor OURS to all the ſame
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45239:51"/>
ends and purpoſes: It ſaveth us not from all pain, death or penal deſertion, nor conſtituteth our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion juſt the ſame.</p>
                     <p>§ 30. It is the Law of Grace that Juſtifieth us, both as giving us Righteouſneſs, and as <hi>Virtually judging</hi> us Righteous when it hath made us ſo, and it is Chriſt as Judg according, to that Law (and God by Chriſt) that will <hi>ſentence</hi> us juſt, and <hi>executively</hi> ſo uſe us.</p>
                     <p>§ 31. The Grace of Chriſt firſt giveth us <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> by effectual Vocation: And then the Law of Grace by its <hi>Donative</hi> part or Act doth give us a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with Chriſt as the Churches Head (and ſo to his Body) and with him a right to Pardon of paſt ſin, and to the Spirit to dwell and act in us for the future, and to the Love of God, and Life eternal, to be ours in poſſeſſion, if we ſincerely obey and perſevere.</p>
                     <p>§ 32. The total Righteouſneſs then which we have (as an Accident of which we are the Subjects,) is 1. A right to Impunity, by the free Pardon of all our ſins, and a right to Gods Favour and Glory, as a free gift <hi>quoad valorem,</hi> but as a <hi>Reward</hi> of our Obedience, <hi>quoad Ordinem conferendi &amp; rationem Comparativam</hi> (why one rather than another is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meet for that free gift.) 2. And the <hi>Relation</hi> of one that hath by grace performed the Condition of that free Gift, without which we had been no capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble recipients: which is initially [Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance] the Condition of our Right begun, and conſequently, ſincere Obedience and Perſeverance (the Condition of continued right.)</p>
                     <p>§ 33. Chriſts perſonal Righteouſneſs is no one of theſe, and ſo is not our <hi>Conſtitutive Righteouſneſs</hi>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:45239:51"/>
formally and ſtrictly ſo called: For <hi>Formally</hi> our Righteouſneſs is a <hi>Relation,</hi> (of right;) and it is the Relation of our own Perſons: And a Relation is an accident: And the numerical Relation (or Right) of one perſon cannot be the ſame numerical Accident of another perſon as the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>§ 34. There are but three ſorts of <hi>Cauſes; Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, Conſtitutive,</hi> and <hi>Final.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Chriſt is the efficient cauſe of all our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: (1. Of our Right to Pardon and Life; 2. And of our Goſpel-Obedience:) And that many waies: 1. He is the Meritorious Cauſe: 2. He is the <hi>Donor</hi> by his Covenant; 3. And the Donor or Operator of our Inherent Righteouſneſs by his Spirit: 4. And the moral efficient by his Word, Promiſe, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. And Chriſt is partly the final cauſe.</p>
                     <p>3. But all the doubt is whether his perſonal Righteouſneſs be the <hi>Conſtitutive Cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 35. The <hi>Conſtitutive Cauſe</hi> of natural bodily ſubſtances conſiſteth of <hi>Matter diſpoſed,</hi> and <hi>Form.</hi> Relations have no <hi>Matter,</hi> but inſtead of <hi>Matter</hi> a <hi>Subject</hi> (and that is <hi>Our own perſons</hi> here, and not Chriſt.) and a <hi>terminus</hi> and <hi>fundamentum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 36. The <hi>Fundamentum</hi> may be called both the <hi>Efficient Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Relation</hi> (as commonly it is) and the <hi>Matter</hi> from which it <hi>reſulteth</hi>: And ſo Chriſts Righteouſneſs is undoubtedly the <hi>Meritorious</hi> efficient Cauſe, and undoubtedly not the <hi>Formal</hi> Cauſe of our perſonal Relation of Righteouſneſs: Therefore all the doubt is of the Material Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>§ 37. So that all the Controverſie is come up to a bare <hi>name</hi> and Logical term, of which Logicians agree not as to the aptitude. All confeſs that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45239:52"/>
have no proper <hi>Matter,</hi> beſides the ſubject: all confeſs that the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> is <hi>loco efficientis,</hi> but whether it be a fit name to call it the <hi>Conſtitutive Matter</hi> of a Relation, there is no agreement.</p>
                     <p>§ 38. And if there were, it would not decide this Verbal Controverſie: For 1. <hi>Titulus eſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Juris</hi>: The <hi>fundamentum</hi> of our <hi>Right to Impunity and Life</hi> in and with Chriſt, is the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act</hi> of our Saviour in and by his Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace: that is our <hi>Title</hi>; And from that our Relation reſulteth, the <hi>Conditio tituli vel juris</hi> being found in our ſelves. 2. And our Relation of <hi>Performers</hi> of that Condition of the Law of Grace, reſulteth from our own performance as the <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> (compared to the Rule.) So that both theſe parts of our Righteouſneſs have a nearer <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum</hi> than Chriſts perſonal Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>§ 39. But the <hi>Right</hi> given us by the Covenant (and the Spirit and Grace) being a Right merited firſt by Chriſts perſonal Righteouſneſs, this is a <hi>Cauſa Cauſae, id eſt, fundamenti, ſeu Donationis</hi>: And while this much is certain, whether it ſhall be called a <hi>Remote fundamentum (viz. Cauſa funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti)</hi> and ſo a Remote Conſtitutive Material Cauſe, or only (properly) a Meritorious Cauſe, may well be left to the arbitrary Logician, that uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch notions as he pleaſes; but verily is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie unfit to tear the Church for, or deſtroy Love and Concord by.</p>

                        <q>WE deny, that God doth ſo Impute Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us, as to repute or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count us to have been Holy with all that Habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Holineſs which was in Chriſt, or to have done all that he did in obedience to his Father, or in fulfilling the Law, or to have ſuffered all that he ſuffered, and to have made God ſatisfaction for our own ſins, and merited our own Salvation and Juſtification, in and by Chriſt; or that he <hi>was, did</hi> and <hi>ſuffered,</hi> and <hi>merited,</hi> all this ſtrictly in the <hi>perſon</hi> of every ſinner that is ſaved; Or that Chriſts very individual Righteouſneſs Material or Formal, is ſo made ours in a ſtrict ſenſe, as that we are Proprietors, Subjects, or Agents of the

All this we deny.</p>
                     <p>Let him that will anſwer me, keep to my words, and not alter the ſenſe by leaving any out. And that he may the better underſtand me, I add. 1. I take it for granted that the Law requireth Habitual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as well as Actual Obedience, and is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled without both. 2. That Chriſt loved God and man with a perfect conſtant Love, and never ſinned by Omiſſion or Commiſſion. 3. That Chriſt died not only for our Original ſin, or ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Converſion, but for all our ſin to our lives end. 4. That he who is ſuppoſed to have no ſin of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, is ſuppoſed to have done all his duty. 5. That he that hath done all his duty, is not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by that Law, yea hath right to all the Reward promiſed on Condition of that duty. 6. By Chriſts Material Righteouſneſs, I mean, thoſe Habits, Acts and Sufferings in which his Righteouſneſs did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, or was founded. 7. By his and our <hi>Formal Righteouſneſs,</hi> I mean the <hi>Relation</hi> it ſelf of being <hi>Righteous.</hi> 8. And I hold that Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, did not only <hi>Numerically</hi> (as aforeſaid) but alſo thus <hi>totâ ſpecie,</hi> in kind differ from ours, that his was a <hi>perfect Habitual and Actual Conformity to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45239:54"/>
Law of Innocency, together with the peculiar Laws of Mediator-ſhip, by which he merited Redemption for us, and Glory for himſelf and us: But ours is the Pardon of ſin, and Right of Life, Purchaſed, Merited and freely given us by Chriſt in and by a new Covenant, whoſe condition is Faith with Repentance, as to the gift of our Juſtification now, and ſincere Holineſs, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Victory and Perſeverance as to our poſſeſſion of Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now our Reaſons againſt the denyed ſence of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation are theſe.</p>
                     <p>1. In general this opinion ſetteth up and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth all Antinomianiſm or Libertiniſm, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs,
and ſubverteth the Goſpel and all true Religion and Morality.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean that all that hold it, have ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in themſelves, but only that this is the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and conſequence of the opinion: For I know that many ſee not the nature and conſequences of their own opinions, and the abundance that hold damnable errors, hold them but notionally in a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh faction, and therefore not dammingly, but hold practically, and effectually the contrary ſaving truth. And if the Papiſts ſhall perſwade Men that our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yea theirs that here miſtake, cannot conſiſt with a godly life, let but the lives of Papiſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants be compared. Yea in one of the Inſtances before given; Though ſome of the Congregational-party hold what was recited, yet ſo far are they from ungodly lives, that the greateſt thing in which I differ from them is, the overmuch unſcriptural ſtrictneſs of ſome of them, in their Church-admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Communion, while they fly further from ſuch as they think not godly, than I think God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45239:55"/>
would have them do, being generally perſons fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God themſelves: (Excepting the ſinful aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from others, and eaſineſs to receive and carry falſe reports of Diſſenters, which is common to all that fall into ſidings.) But the errors of any men are never the better if they be found in the hands of godly men: For if they be practiſed they will make them ungodly.</p>
                     <p>2. It confoundeth the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> and of the <hi>Sinner</hi>: As if the Mediator who was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Beloved of the Father, and therefore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reconciling us to him, becauſe he was ſtill
<hi>well-pleaſed</hi> in him, had (not only ſuffered in the room of the ſinner by voluntary Sponſion, but alſo)
in ſuffering and doing, been <hi>Civilly</hi> the very perſon of the ſinner himſelf; that ſinner I ſay, who was an enemy to God, and ſo eſteemed.</p>
                     <p>3. It maketh Chriſt to have <hi>been Civilly</hi> as <hi>many perſons</hi> as there be elect ſinners in the World: which is both beſide and contrary to Scripture.</p>
                     <p>4. It introduceth a falſe ſence and ſuppoſition of our ſin imputed to Chriſt, as if Imputatively it were his as it is ours, even the <hi>ſinful Habits,</hi> the <hi>ſinful Acts,</hi> and the <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>evil, Wicked, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly</hi> and
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous</hi> which reſulteth from them: And ſo it maketh Chriſt really <hi>hated of God</hi>: For God cannot but <hi>hate</hi> any one whom he reputeth to be truly ungodly, a Hater of God, an Enemy to him, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
as we all were: whereas it was only the Guilt of Puniſhment, and not of <hi>Crime,</hi> as ſuch that Chriſt aſſumed: He undertook to ſuffer in the room of
ſinners; and to be reputed one that had ſo underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
But not to be reputed really a ſinner, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſon, hater of God, one that had the Image of the Devil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:45239:55"/>5. Nay it maketh Chriſt to have been incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the worſt man that ever was in the World by juſt reputation; and to have been by juſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation guilty of all the ſins of all the Elect that ever lived, and reputed one of the Murderers of himſelf,
and <hi>one</hi> of the Perſecutors of his Church, or rather
<hi>many</hi>: and the language that <hi>Luther</hi> uſed Catechre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically,
to be ſtrictly and properly true.</p>
                     <p>6. It ſuppoſeth a wrong ſence of the Imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to his poſterity: As if we had been juſtly reputed <hi>perſons exiſtent</hi> in <hi>his perſon,</hi> and ſo in him to have been <hi>perſons that committed the ſame ſin</hi>;
whereas we are only reputed to be <hi>now</hi> (not <hi>then</hi>)
<hi>perſons</hi> who have a <hi>Nature</hi> derived from him, which being then <hi>ſeminally only</hi> in him, deriveth by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation an anſwerable <hi>Guilt</hi> of his ſinful fact, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>natural Corruption.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. It ſuppoſeth us to be Juſtifiable and Juſtified by the Law of Innocency, made to <hi>Adam,</hi> as it ſaith
[<hi>Obey perfectly and Live.</hi>] As if we fulfilled it by Chriſt: which is not only an addition to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but a Contradiction. For it is only the Law or Covenant of Grace that we are Juſtified by.</p>
                     <p>8. It putteth, to that end, a falſe ſence upon the Law of Innocency: For whereas it commandeth
<hi>Perſonal Obedience,</hi> and maketh <hi>Perſonal</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>due</hi> to the offender: This ſuppoſeth the Law to ſay or mean [<hi>Either thou, or one for thee ſhall Obey</hi>;
or, <hi>Thou ſhalt obey by thy ſelf, or by another</hi>: And <hi>if thou ſin thou ſhalt ſuffer by thy ſelf, or by another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas the Law knew no Subſtitute or Vicar, no nor Sponſor; nor is any ſuch thing ſaid of it in the Scripture: ſo bold are men in their additions.</p>
                     <p>9. It falſly ſuppoſeth that we are not Judged and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45239:56"/>
Juſtified by the new Covenant or Law of Grace,
but (but is ſaid) by the Law of Innocency.</p>
                     <p>10. It fathereth on God an erring judgment, as if he reputed, reckoned or accounted things to be what they are not, and us, to have done what we did not. To repute Chriſt a Sponſor for ſinners who undertook to obey in their natures, and ſuffer in their place and ſtead, as a Sacrifice to redeem them, is all juſt and true: And to repute <hi>us thoſe</hi>
for whom Chriſt did this. But to repute Chriſt to have been really and every one of us, or a ſinner, or guilty of ſin it ſelf; or to repute us to have been ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually as Good as Chriſt was, or actually to have done what he did, either Naturally or Civilly and by Him as our ſubſtitute, and to repute us Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by poſſeſſing his formal perſonal Righteouſneſs in it ſelf; All theſe are untrue, and therefore not to be aſcribed to God. To Impute it to us, is but to Repute us as verily and groundedly Righteous by his Merited and freely-Given Pardon, and Right to Life, as if we had merited it our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>11. It feigneth the ſame Numerical Accident
[their <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>] which was in one
ſubject to be in another, which is Impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>12. It maketh us to have ſatisfied Divine Juſtice for our ſelves, and merited Salvation (and all that we receive) for our ſelves, in and by another: And
ſo that we may plead our own Merits with God for Heaven and all his benefits.</p>
                     <p>13. The very making and tenor of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
contradicteth this opinion: For when God maketh a Law or Covenant, to convey the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us, by degrees and upon certain Conditions, this proveth that the very
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45239:56"/>
Righteouſneſs in it ſelf ſimply was not ours: elſe we ſhould have had theſe effects of it both preſently and immediately and abſolutely without new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                     <p>14. This opinion therefore maketh this Law of Grace, which giveth the benefits to us by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and upon terms, to be an <hi>injury</hi> to Believers,
as keeping them from their own.</p>
                     <p>15. It ſeemeth to deny Chriſts Legiſlation in the Law of Grace, and conſequently his Kingly Office. For if we are reputed to have fulfilled the whole Law of Innocency in Chriſt, there is no buſineſs for the Law of Grace to do.</p>
                     <p>16. It ſeemeth to make internal Sanctification by the Spirit needleſs, or at leaſt, as to one half of its uſe: For if we are by juſt Imputation in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count perfectly Holy, in Chriſts Holineſs the firſt moment of our believing, nothing can be added to Perfection; we are as fully <hi>Amiable</hi> in the ſight of God, as if we were ſanctified in our ſelves; Becauſe by Imputation it is all our own.</p>
                     <p>17. And ſo it ſeemeth to make our after-Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unneceſſary, at leaſt as to half its uſe: For if in Gods true account, we have perfectly obeyed to the death by another, how can we be required to do it all or part again by our ſelves? If all the debt of our Obedience be paid, why is it required again?</p>
                     <p>18. And this ſeemeth to Impute to God a nature leſs holy and at enmity to ſin, than indeed he hath; if he can repute a man laden with hateful ſins, to be as perfecty Holy, Obedient and Amiable to him as if he were really ſo in himſelf, becauſe another is ſuch for him.</p>
                     <p>19. If we did in our own perſons Imputatively
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45239:57"/>
what Chriſt did, I think it will follow that we <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>;
that being unlawful to us which was Good in him. It is a ſin for us to be Circumciſed, and to keep all the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſend forth Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and to make Church-Ordinances needful to Salvation. Therefore we did not this in Chriſt:
And if not this, they that diſtinguiſh and tell us what we did in Chriſt, and what not, muſt prove it. I know that Chriſt did ſomewhat which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duty of all men, and ſomewhat proper to the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and ſomewhat proper to himſelf: But that one ſort of men did one part in Chriſt, and another
ſort did another part in him, is to be proved.</p>
                     <p>20. If Chriſt ſuffered but in the Perſon of ſinful man, his ſufferings would have been in vain, or no Satisfaction to God: For ſinful man is obliged to perpetual puniſhment; of which a temporal one is but a ſmall part: <hi>Our perſons</hi> cannot make a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſuffering equal to that perpetual one due to man: but the tranſcendent perſon of the Mediator did.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Chriſt bore both his own perſon and ours: It belongeth to him as Mediator to perſonate the guilty ſinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It belongeth to him as Mediator to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ſinners puniſhment in his own perſon. And if any will improperly call that, the <hi>Perſonating and Repreſenting</hi> of the <hi>ſinner,</hi> let them limit it, and confeſs that it is not <hi>ſimply,</hi> but <hi>in tantum,</hi> ſo far, and to ſuch uſes and no other, and that yet <hi>ſinners did it not in</hi> and <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> but only Chriſt for them to convey the benefits as he pleaſed; And then we delight not to quarrel about mere words; though we like the phraſe of Scripture better than theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:45239:57"/>21. If Chriſt was perfectly Holy and Obedient in our perſons, and we in him, then it was either in the Perſon of Innocent man before we ſinned, or of ſinful man. The firſt cannot be pretended: For man as Innocent had not a Redeemer. If of <hi>ſinful man,</hi> then his perfect Obedience could not be meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of our Salvation: For it ſuppoſeth him to do it in the perſon of a ſinner: and he that hath once ſinned, according to that Law, is the Child of death, and uncapable of ever fulfilling a Law, which is fulfilled with nothing but ſinleſs perfect perpetual Obedience.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>He firſt ſuffered in our ſtead and perſons as ſinners, and then our ſin being pardoned, he after in our perſons fulfilled the Law, inſtead of our after-Obedience to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Chriſts Obedience to the Law was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death. 2. The ſins which he ſuffered for, were not only before Converſion, but endure as long as our lives: Therefore if he fulfilled the Law in our perſons after we have done ſinning, it is in the perſons only of the dead. 3. We are ſtill obliged to Obedience our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But yet though there be no ſuch difference in Time, God doth firſt Impute his ſufferings to us for pardon of all our ſins to the death, and in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his Obedience after it, as the Merit of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. God doth Impute or Repute his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the ſatisfying cauſe of our Pardon, and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Suffering and the reſt of his Holineſs and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as the meritorious cauſe of our <hi>Pardon</hi> and our Juſtification and Glory without dividing them. But 2. that implyeth that we did not our ſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45239:58"/>
do all this in Chriſt: As ſhall be further proved.</p>
                     <p>22. Their way of Imputation of the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, overthroweth their own doctrine of the Imputation of his Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
For if all ſin be fully pardoned by the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Satisfaction, then ſins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> and of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Privation and Corruption are pardoned; and then the whole puniſhment both of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Loſs</hi> is remitted: And he that hath no ſin of Omiſſion or Privation, is a perfect doer of his duty, and holy;
and he that hath no puniſhment of Loſs, hath title to Life, according to that Covenant which he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to have perfectly obeyed. And ſo he is an heir of life, without any Imputed Obedience upon the pardon of all his Diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But</hi> Adam <hi>muſt have obeyed to the Death if he would have Life eternal: Therefore the bare pardon of his ſins did not procure his right to life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, if you ſuppoſe that only his firſt ſin was pardoned: But 1. <hi>Adam</hi> had right to heaven as long as he was ſinleſs. 2. Chriſt dyed for all <hi>Adams</hi> ſins to the laſt breath, and not for the firſt only: And ſo he did for all ours. And if all the ſins of omiſſion to the death be pardoned, Life is due to us as righteous.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>A Stone may be ſinleſs, and yet not righteous nor have Right to life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> True: becauſe it is not a capable ſubject. But a man cannot be ſinleſs, but he is Righteous, and hath right to life by Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But not to puniſh is one thing and to Reward is another?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are diſtinct formal Relations and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45239:58"/>
But where <hi>felicity is a Gift</hi> and called a <hi>Reward</hi> only for the <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of Collation, and where <hi>Innocency</hi> is the ſame with <hi>perfect Duty,</hi> and is the title-Condition; there to be puniſhed is to be <hi>denyed</hi> the <hi>Gift,</hi> and to be <hi>Rewarded</hi> is to have that <hi>Gift</hi> as qualified perſons: and not to <hi>Reward,</hi> is materially to <hi>puniſh</hi>; and to be reputed innocent is to be reputed a Meriter. And it is impoſſible that the moſt Innocent man can have any thing from God, but by way of free-Gift as to the <hi>Thing</hi> in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; however it may be merited in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paternal Juſtice as to the <hi>Order</hi> of donation.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But there is a greater Glory merited by Chriſt, than the Covenant of works promiſed to man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That's another matter, and belongeth not to Juſtification, but to Adoption. 2. Chriſts Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings as well as his Obedience, conſidered as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, did purchaſe that greater Glory. 3. We did not purchaſe or merit it in Chriſt, but Chriſt for us.</p>
                     <p>23. Their way of Imputation ſeemeth to me to leave no place or poſſibility for Pardon of ſin, or at leaſt of no ſin after Converſion. I mean, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their opinion who think that we fulfilled the Law in Chriſt as we are elect from eternity, it leaveth no place for any pardon: And according to their opinion who ſay that we fulfilled it in him as
<hi>Believers,</hi> it leaveth no place for pardon of any ſin after Faith. For where the Law is reputed perfectly fulfilled (in Habit &amp; Act) there it is reputed that the perſon hath no ſin. We had no ſin before we had a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and if we are reputed to have perfectly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt from our firſt Being, we are reputed
ſinleſs. But if we are reputed to have obeyed in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45239:59"/>
him only ſince our believing, then we are reputed to have no ſin ſince our Believing. Nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth ſin, if perfect Habitual and Actual Holineſs and Obedience do not.</p>
                     <p>24. And conſequently Chriſts blood ſhed and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is made vain, either as to all our lives, or to all after our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> believing.</p>
                     <p>25. And then no believer muſt confeſs his ſin, nor his deſert of puniſhment nor repent of it, or be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it.</p>
                     <p>26. And then all prayer for the pardon of ſuch ſin is vain, and goeth upon a falſe ſuppoſition, that we have ſin to pardon.</p>
                     <p>27. And then no man is to be a partaker of the Sacrament as a Conveyance or Seal of ſuch pardon; nor to believe the promiſe for it.</p>
                     <p>28. Nor is it a duty to <hi>give thanks</hi> to God or Chriſt for any ſuch pardon.</p>
                     <p>29. Nor can we expect Juſtification from ſuch <hi>guilt</hi> here or at <hi>Judgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>30. And then thoſe in Heaven praiſe Chriſt in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, when they magnifie him that waſhed them from ſuch ſins in his blood.</p>
                     <p>31. And it would be no lie to ſay that we have no ſin, at leaſt, ſince believing.</p>
                     <p>32. Then no believer ſhould <hi>fear ſinning,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>Impoſſible</hi> and a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> for the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be perfectly innocent to the death, and yet a ſinner.</p>
                     <p>33. Then the Conſciences of believers have no work to do, or at leaſt, no examining, convincing, ſelf-accuſing and ſelf-judging work.</p>
                     <p>34. This chargeth God by Conſequence of wronging all believers whom he layeth the leaſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45239:59"/>
upon: For he that hath perfectly obeyed,
or hath perfectly ſatisfied, by himſelf or by another in his perſon, cannot juſtly be puniſhed. But I have elſewhere fully proved, that Death and other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements are puniſhments, though not deſtructive,
but corrective: And ſo is the permiſſion of our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſinning.</p>
                     <p>35. It intimateth that God wrongeth believers,
for not giving them immediately more of the Holy Ghoſt, and not preſent perfecting them and freeing them from all ſin: For though Chriſt may give us the fruits of his own merits in the time and way that pleaſeth himſelf; yet if it be <hi>we our ſelves</hi> that have perfectly ſatisfied and <hi>merited in Chriſt,</hi> we have preſent Right to the thing merited thereupon,
and it is an injury to deny it us at all.</p>
                     <p>36. And accordingly it would be an injury to keep them ſo long out of Heaven, if they themſelves did merit it ſo long ago.</p>
                     <p>37. And the very <hi>Threatning</hi> of Puniſhment in the Law of Grace would ſeem injurious or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous,
to them that have already reputatively obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfectly to the death.</p>
                     <p>38. And there would be no place left for any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from God, to any act of obedience done by our
ſelves in our natural or real perſon: Becauſe having reputatively fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all that we are capable of by another, our own acts can have no reward.</p>
                     <p>39. And I think this would overthrow all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws and Government: For all true Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are the Officers of God, and do what they do in ſubordination to God; and therefore cannot
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45239:60"/>
juſtly puniſh any man, whom he pronounceth er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Innocent to the death.</p>
                     <p>40. This maketh every believer (at leaſt) as Righteous as Chriſt himſelf, as having true propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in all the ſame numerical Righteouſneſs as his own. And if we be as Righteous as Chriſt, are we not as amiable to God? And may we not go to God in our Names as Righteous?</p>
                     <p>41. This maketh all believers (at leaſt) <hi>equally Righteous</hi> in degree, and every one <hi>perfect,</hi> and no difference between them. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> as Righteous in the act of ſinning as before, and every weak and ſcandalous believer, to be as Righteous as the beſt. Which is not true, though many ſay that Juſtification hath no degrees, but is perfect at firſt;
as I have proved in my <hi>Life of Faith</hi> and elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>42. This too much levelleth Heaven and Earth;
For in Heaven there can be nothing greater than perfection.</p>
                     <p>43. The Scripture no-where calleth our Imputed Righteouſneſs by the name of Innocency, or ſinleſs Perfection, nor Inculpability Imputed. Nay when the very phraſe of <hi>Imputing Chriſts</hi> Righteouſneſs is not there at all, to add all theſe wrong deſcriptions of Imputation, is ſuch Additions to Gods words as tendeth to let in almoſt any thing that mans wit
ſhall excogitate and ill beſeemeth them, that are for Scripture-ſufficiency and perfection, and againſt Additions in the general. And whether ſome may not ſay that we are Imputatively Chriſt himſelf,
Conceived by the Holy Ghoſt; Born of the Virgin Mary, ſuffered under Pontius Pilate, Crucified, &amp;c.
I cannot tell.</p>

                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:45239:60"/>To conclude, the honeſt plain Chriſtian may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſquieting the Church or himſelf, be ſatisfied in this certain ſimple truth; That we are ſinners and deſerve everlaſting miſery: That Chriſt hath ſuffered as a Sacrifice for our ſins in our room and ſtead, and ſatisfied the Juſtice of God: That he hath by his perfect Holineſs and Obedience with thoſe ſufferings, merited our pardon and Life: That he never hereby intended to make us Lawleſs have us Holy, but hath brought us under a Law of Grace: which is the Inſtrument by which he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth, juſtifieth and giveth us Right to life: That by this Covenant he requireth of us Repentance and true Faith to our firſt Juſtification, and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Holineſs and Perſeverance to our Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be wrought by his Grace and our Wills ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and enabled by it: That Chriſts Sufferings are to ſave us from ſuffering; but his Holineſs and Obedience are to merit Holineſs, Obedience &amp; Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for us, that we may be like him, and ſo be made perſonally amiable to God: But both his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Obedience, do bring us under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, where Perfection is not neceſſary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

As are with us, <hi>ſaith Dr. Tullie,</hi> the Sponſor and the Debtor, the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and the Clyent, the Tutor and the Pupil; ſo are all the faithful in Chriſt, both as to their Celeſtial regenerate nature, of which he is the firſt Father, who begetteth ſons by his Spirit and ſeed of the Word to his Image, and as to Righteouſneſs derived by Legal Imputation.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The diſtinction of a <hi>Perſon</hi> into <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Legal,</hi> is <hi>equivoci in ſua equivocata</hi>: He therefore that would not have contention che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and men taught to damn each other for a word not underſtood, muſt give us leave to ask what theſe equivocals mean. What a <hi>Natural Perſon</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, we are pretty well agreed; but a <hi>Political Perſon</hi> is a word not ſo eaſily and commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. <hi>Calvin</hi> tells us that <hi>Perſona definitur homo qui caput habet civile.</hi> (For <hi>omnis perſona eſt homo, ſed non viciſſim: Homo cum eſt vocabulum naturae; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona juris civilis.</hi>) And ſo (as <hi>Albenius</hi>) <hi>civitas, municipium, Caſtrum, Collegium, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitas, &amp; quod. libet corpus, Perſonae appellatione continetur, ut Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</hi>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:45239:61"/>
But if this Definition be commenſurate to the common nature of a civil perſon, then a King can be none; nor any one that hath not a <hi>civil head.</hi> This therefore is too narrow. The ſame <hi>Calvin (in n. Perſonae)</hi> tells us, that <hi>Seneca Perſonam vocat, cum prae ſe fert aliquis, quod non eſt</hi>; A Counterfeit: But ſure this is not the ſence of the Objectors. In general ſaith <hi>Calvin, Tam hominem quam qualitatem hominis, ſeu Conditionem ſignificat.</hi> But it is not ſure every <hi>Quality</hi> or <hi>Condition: Calvin</hi> therefore giveth us nothing ſatisfactory, to the deciſion of the Controverſie which theſe Divines will needs make, whether each believer and Chriſt be the ſame Political Perſon. <hi>Martinius</hi> will make our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie no eaſier by the various ſignifications gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Vet. Vocab. Gel. Scaliger, Valla</hi>; Which he thus enumerateth. 1. <hi>Perſona eſt accidens condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio hominis, qualitas quâ homo differt ab homine, tum in animo, tum in corpore, tum in externis.</hi> 2. <hi>Homo qualitate dictâ proditus</hi>: 3. <hi>Homo inſigni qualitate praeditus habens gradum eminentiae, in Eccleſia Dei, &amp;c.</hi> 4. <hi>Figura, ſeu facies ficta, larva hiſtrionica, &amp;c.</hi> 5. <hi>Ille qui ſub hujuſmodi figura aliquam repreſentat, &amp;c.</hi> 6. <hi>Figura eminens in aedificiis quae ore aquam fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, &amp;c.

When I deny the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to have been the ſame, or to be ſo reputed by God, I mean by <hi>Perſon,</hi> univocally or properly, An <hi>Individual Intelligent ſubſtance.</hi> And they that mean otherwiſe are obliged to Define; For <hi>Analogum per
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45239:62"/>
ſe poſitum ſtat pro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuo ſignificato famoſiore.</hi> If they mean that Chriſt and the Believer are the ſame as to ſome <hi>Quality,</hi> or <hi>Condition,</hi> let them tell us what Quality or Condition it is, and I think we ſhall be found to be of one mind.</p>
                     <p>But I think by the ſimilitudes of a <hi>Sponſor, Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and <hi>Guardian,</hi> that they mean by a <hi>Political Perſon</hi> (not as a <hi>ſociety,</hi> nor ſuch as agree <hi>in Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but) <hi>A natural Perſon ſo related to another Natural perſon, as that what he doth and ſuffereth, Is or Hath, is limitedly to certain ends and uſes as effectual as if that other perſon himſelf did and ſuffered, Were or Had numerically the ſame thing.</hi> I obtrude not a ſenſe on others, but muſt know theirs before I can know where we differ. And if this be the meaning, we are agreed: Thus far (though I greatly diſlike their way that lay much ſtreſs on ſuch humane phraſes,) I grant the thing meant by them. Chriſts Holineſs Habitual and Actual, and his Merits and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are as effectual to a believers Juſtification and Salvation upon the terms of the Covenant of Grace (which is ſealed by baptiſm) as if we had been, done and ſuffered the ſame our ſelves. But ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that this is only [<hi>limitedly</hi>] to <hi>theſe uſes,</hi> and on theſe <hi>termes</hi> and no other, and I think that this is the meaning of moſt Divines that uſe this phraſe.</p>
                     <p>But the ſenſe of thoſe men that I differ from and write againſt (the <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and ſome others that own not thoſe names,) is this: that <hi>A Legal Perſon is one ſo Related to anothers Natural perſon as that what he Hath, Doth, or Suffereth in ſuch a caſe,</hi> is (not only effectual as aforeſaid to others, but) <hi>is in itſelf ſimply Reputed or Imputed to be Morally, though not phyſically, the Habit, Act and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45239:62"/>
Suffering, the Merit and ſatisfactory Sacrifice of the other perſon: And ſo being the reputed Haver, Doer</hi> or <hi>Sufferer, Meriter</hi> or <hi>Satisfyer himſelf, he hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute right to all the proper reſults or benefits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo a man may indeed many ways among us <hi>Repreſent</hi> or <hi>Perſonate</hi> another. If I by Law am Commanded to do this or that ſervice <hi>per meipſum aut per alium,</hi> I do it in the Moral or Law-ſence, becauſe the other doth it in my name and I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſo to do it. So if I appear or anſwer by any Proctor or Attorney; if the Law make it equal to my perſonal appearance and anſwer, it is ſaid that <hi>I did it by him</hi>: (but only ſo far as he doth it as my <hi>Repreſenter</hi> or <hi>in my name</hi>): So if I pay a debt by the hand of <hi>my Servant</hi> or any Meſſenger, if ſo allowed, I do it by that other. So indeed a Pupil, doth by his Guardian what his Guardian doth, only ſo far as the Law obligeth him to conſent or ſtand to it.</p>
                     <p>We did not thus our ſelves fulfil all the Law in and by Chriſt: Nor are we <hi>thus</hi> the <hi>Proprietors</hi> of his <hi>Habitual</hi> perfection, <hi>Merits or Satisfaction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The common reaſon given by the contrary-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is, that he was our <hi>Surety,</hi> or <hi>Sponſor,</hi> or <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſſor</hi>: and ſo we tranſlate <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>2. And they that diſtinguiſh of a Natural and Political Perſon, do but darken the caſe by an ill-expreſſed diſtinction, which indeed is not of two
ſorts of <hi>Perſons,</hi> but between <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
taking <hi>Perſon</hi> properly for <hi>a Natural Perſon</hi>:
It's one thing to be ſuch a <hi>Perſon,</hi> and another thing to have the <hi>Act, Paſſion, Merit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Accepted</hi> for that other <hi>Perſon</hi>: And this latter ſignifieth, either
1. That it was done by <hi>the other perſon mediately,</hi> as being <hi>a cheif Cauſe acting by his Inſtrument.</hi> 2. Or that it was <hi>done for that other Perſon</hi> by another.

                     <p>Among us <hi>Sureties</hi> and <hi>Sponſors</hi> are of ſeveral ſorts: <hi>Grotius de Jure Belli</hi> tells you of another ſenſe of <hi>Sponſion</hi> in the Civil Law, than is pertinent to the objectors uſe: And in Baptiſm the ſame word, hath had divers ſenſes as uſed by perſons of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent intentions. The time was when the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor was not at all taken for the <hi>Political Perſon</hi> (as you call it) of <hi>Parent</hi> or <hi>Child,</hi> nor ſpake as <hi>their Inſtrument,</hi> in <hi>their name</hi>: But was a Third perſon,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45239:64"/>
who (becauſe many parents <hi>Apoſtatized,</hi> and more <hi>Died</hi> in the Childs minority) did paſs his word, 1. <hi>That the Parent was a credible Perſon,</hi> 2. That if he <hi>Dyed</hi> ſo ſoon or <hi>Apoſtatized,</hi> he himſelf would undertake the Chriſtian Education of the Child. But the <hi>Parent</hi> himſelf was <hi>Sponſor for the Child</hi> in a ſtricter ſenſe, (as alſo Adopting Pro-parents were, &amp; as ſome take God-fathers to be now,) that is, they were taken for ſuch, whoſe Reaſon, will and word, we authoriſed to diſpoſe of the Child as obligingly, as if it had been done by his own reaſon will and word, ſo be it, it were but <hi>For his good,</hi> and the Child did own it when he came to age: And ſo they were to ſpeak as in the Childs name, as if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Charity made them his Repreſenters, in the Judgment of many. (Though others rather think that they were to ſpeak as in their own perſons, <hi>e. g.</hi> I dedicate this Child to God, and enter him into the Covenant as obliged by my Conſent.) But this ſenſe of <hi>Sponſion</hi> is nothing to the preſent Caſe.</p>
                     <p>They that lay all upon the very Name of a <hi>Surety</hi> as if the word had but one ſignification, and all <hi>Sureties</hi> properly repreſented the perſon of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal obliged perſon, do deal very deceitfully: There are <hi>Sureties</hi> or <hi>Sponſors,</hi> 1. For ſome Duty, 2. For Debt, 3. For Puniſhment. 1. It is one thing to undertake that another ſhall do a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded duty: 2. It's another thing to undertake that elſe I will do it for him: 3. It's another thing to be Surety that he ſhall pay a Debt, or elſe I will pay it for him: 4. It's another thing to undertake that he ſhall ſuffer a penalty, or elſe to ſuffer for him, or make a Valuable Compenſation.</p>
                     <p>1. And it's one kind of Surety that becometh a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45239:64"/>
                        <hi>ſecond party in the bond,</hi> and ſo maketh <hi>himſelf a debtor</hi>; 2. And its another ſort of Surety that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh only the Debt afterward voluntarily as a Friend</hi>; who may pay it on ſuch Conditions as he and the Creditor think meet, without the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors knowledg. Every Novice that will but open <hi>Calvin</hi> may ſee that <hi>Fidejuſſor</hi> and <hi>Sponſor</hi> are words of very various ſignification; and that they ſeldom or never ſignifie the <hi>Perſon Natural</hi> or <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> (as you call it) of the <hi>Principal: Sponſor eſt qui ſponte &amp; non rogatus pro alio promittit, ut Accurſ. vel quicunque ſpondet, maximè pro aliis: Fidejube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re eſt ſuo periculo fore id, de quo agitur, recipere: Vel, fidem ſuam pro alio obligare.</hi> He is called <hi>Adpromiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> and he is <hi>Debtor,</hi> but not the ſame <hi>perſon</hi> with the <hi>Principal,</hi> but his promiſe is <hi>acceſſoria obligatio, non principalis.</hi> Therefore <hi>Fidejuſſor ſive Interceſſor non eſt conveniendus, niſi prius debitore principali convento: Fidejuſſores a correis ita differunt, quod hi ſuo &amp; proprio morbo laborant, illi vero alieno tenentur: Quare fideijuſſori magis ſuccurrendum cenſent: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niâ namque digni ſunt qui alienâ tenentur Culpâ, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſmodi ſunt fidejuſſores pro alieno debito obligati, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit</hi> Calv.</p>

                        </gap> once uſed of Chriſt as Mediator of Gods Covenant, or the name of a <hi>Surety</hi> as now u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among men, that muſt go to prove that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and the ſeveral ſinners are the ſame <hi>Legal Perſons</hi> in Gods account.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing <hi>Legal-Perſonality</hi> is but a <hi>Relation</hi> of our <hi>Natural perſon,</hi> to another <hi>Natural perſon,</hi> that we may not quarrel and tear the Church when really
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45239:65"/>
we differ not 1. Let our agreement be noted. 2. Our difference intelligibly ſtated.</p>
                     <p>1. It is granted (not only by <hi>Dr. Tullie,</hi> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that accurately handle the Controverſie,) 1.
That Chriſt and the Believer never were nor are our Natural perſon; and that no union with him maketh us to be Chriſt, or God, nor him to be <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
John,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. That we know of no third
ſort of <hi>Natural perſon,</hi> (which is neither Jeſus, nor
<hi>Peter, John,</hi> &amp;c.) But compoſed of both united,
which is conſtituted by our Union. For though it be agreed on, that the ſame Spirit that is in Chriſt is
(operatively) alſo in all his Members, and that therefore our <hi>Communion</hi> with him is more than
<hi>Relative,</hi> and that from this <hi>Real-Communion,</hi> the name of a <hi>Real-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> may be uſed; yet here the
<hi>Real-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is not <hi>Perſonal</hi> (as the ſame Sun quickeneth and illuminateth a Bird and a Frog and a Plant, and yet maketh them not our perſon:)
Therefore he that will ſay we are <hi>Phyſically</hi> one with Chriſt, and not only Relatively; but tell us [<hi>ONE What?</hi>] and make his words Intelligible; and muſt deny that we are <hi>ONE PERSON</hi>: and that by that time we are not like to be found differing.
But remember that while <hi>Phyſical Communion,</hi> is confeſſed by all, what <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NION</hi> we ſhall from thence be ſaid to have (this Foundation being agreed on)
is like to prove but a queſtion, <hi>de realitione &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Yea all the world muſt acknowledg that the whole Creation is <hi>quoad praeſentiam &amp; derivationem</hi>
more dependant on God than the fruit is on the
<hi>Tree,</hi> or the Tree on the Earth, and that God is the inſeperate Cauſe of our <hi>Being, Station, and Life</hi>;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45239:65"/>
And yet this natural intimateneſs, and influx, and cauſality, maketh not GOD and every Creature abſolutely or perſonally <hi>One.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. It is agreed therefore that <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is neither <hi>materially</hi> nor <hi>formally,</hi> any <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> of our <hi>natural Perſons</hi>; (and an <hi>Accident</hi> it is) <hi>unleſs</hi> it can be reduced to that of <hi>Relation.</hi> 1. The <hi>Habits</hi> of our Perſon, cannot poſſibly be the habits of another inherently. 2. The <hi>actions</hi> of one <hi>cannot</hi> poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be the <hi>actions</hi> of another, as the Agent, unleſs as that other as a <hi>principal Cauſe,</hi> acteth by the other as his <hi>Inſtrument</hi> or ſecond Cauſe. 3. The ſame <hi>fundamentum relationis</hi> inherent in One Perſon, is not inherent in another if it be a perſonal Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And ſo the ſame individual Relation that is one Mans, cannot numerically be another Mans, by the ſame ſort of in-being, propriety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or adherence. Two Brothers have a Relation in <hi>kind the ſame,</hi> but not <hi>unmerically.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. And it is agreed that God judgeth not falſly, and therefore taketh not Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to be any more or otherwiſe <hi>ours</hi>; than indeed it is; nor imputeth it to us erroneouſly.</p>
                     <p>5. Yet it is commonly agreed, that <hi>Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> is <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS</hi> in ſome ſenſe; And ſo far is juſtly <hi>reputed Ours,</hi> or <hi>imputed</hi> to us as being <hi>Ours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. And this ambiguous ſyallable [<hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS</hi>] (enough to ſet another Age of Wranglers into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Church-tearing ſtrife, if not hindred by ſome that will call them to explain an ambiguous word) is it that muſt be underſtood to end this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. <hi>Propriety</hi> is the thing ſignified. 1. In the ſtricteſt ſenſe that is called <hi>Ours,</hi> which inhereth in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45239:66"/>
us, or that which is <hi>done</hi> by us. 2. In a larger
(Moral) ſenſe, that which a Man as the <hi>principal Cauſe,</hi> doth by another as his <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing,
commanding, perſwading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. In a yet larger ſenſe that may be called <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS,</hi> which a third perſon doth partly <hi>inſtead</hi> of what we ſhould
<hi>have done (had, or ſuffered)</hi> and partly for our
<hi>uſe,</hi> or <hi>benefit.</hi> 4. In a yet larger ſenſe that may be called <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS,</hi> which another <hi>hath,</hi> or <hi>doth,</hi> or
<hi>ſuffereth</hi> for our <hi>Benefit,</hi> (though not in our ſtead)
and which will be for our good, (as that which a Friend or Father hath, is his Friends or Childs, and
<hi>all things</hi> are <hi>Ours,</hi> whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Godly are owners of the World, in as much as God <hi>will uſe all for</hi> their good).</p>
                     <p>7. It is therefore a <hi>Relation</hi> which Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs hath to us, or we to it, that muſt here be meant by the word [<hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS</hi>]: Which is our
<hi>RIGHT</hi> or <hi>Jus</hi>; And that is acknowledged to be no <hi>Jus</hi> or Right to it in the foreſaid denied ſenſe;
And it is agreed that <hi>ſome Right</hi> it is. Therefore,
to underſtand what it is, the <hi>Titulus ſeu Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum juris</hi> muſt be known.</p>
                     <p>8. And here it is agreed; 1. That we are before Converſion or Faith related to Chriſt as part of the Redeemed World, of whom it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.
<hi>That God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing to them their ſins,</hi> &amp;c.
2. That we are after Faith related to Chriſt as his Covenanted People, Subjects, Brethren, Friends,
and Political Members; yea, as ſuch that have
<hi>Right to,</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſion of</hi> Real Communion with him by his Spirit: And that we have then Right to <hi>Pardon,</hi> Juſtification, and Adoption, (or have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45239:66"/>
Right to <hi>Impunity</hi> in the promiſed degree, and to the <hi>Spirits Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory</hi>). This Relation to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and this
<hi>Right,</hi> to the <hi>Benefits</hi> of his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> are agreed on: And conſequently that his <hi>Righteouſness</hi> is
<hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS,</hi> and ſo may be called, as far as the foreſaid
<hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> import.</p>
                     <p>II. Now a Relation (as <hi>Ockam</hi> hath fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
having no real entity, beſide the <hi>quid abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
which is the <hi>Subject, Fundamentum,</hi> or <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi>
he that yet raileth at his Brother as not ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough, or not being herein ſo wiſe as he, and will maintain that yet <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs</hi> is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS,</hi> muſt name the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of that
<hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Propriety:</hi> What more is it that you mean?
I think the make-bates have here little probability of fetching any more Fuel to their Fire, or turning Chriſt's Goſpel into an occaſion of ſtrife and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al enmity, if they will but be driven to a diſtinct explication, and will not make <hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous</hi>
words their defence and weapons. If you
ſet your quarrelſome Brains on work, and ſtudy as hard as you can for matter of Contention, it will not be eaſie for you to find it, unleſs you will raze out the names of <hi>Popery, Socinianiſm, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi>
or <hi>Solifidianiſm,</hi> Hereſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſtead of real Difference. But if the <hi>angrieſt</hi> and <hi>lowdeſt</hi> Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be in the right, <hi>Bedlam</hi> and <hi>Billingsgate</hi> may be the moſt Orthodox places.</p>
                     <p>Briefly, 1. The foreſaid Benefits of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, (Habitual, Active and Paſſive) as a Meritorious, Satisfactory, Purchaſing Cauſe, are ours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:45239:67"/>2. To ſay that the Benefits are <hi>Ours,</hi> importeth that the <hi>Cauſal Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt is related to <hi>us, and the Effects</hi> as <hi>ſuch a Cauſe:</hi> and ſo is it ſelf <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS,</hi> in that ſenſe, that is, ſo related.</p>
                     <p>3. And Chriſt himſelf is <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS,</hi> as related to us as our Saviour; the Procurer and Giver of thoſe Benefits. And do you mean any more by [<hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS</hi>]?</p>
                     <p>If you ſay that we deny any <hi>Benefits</hi> of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs which you aſſert, name what they are. If you ſay that we deny any true <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum juris,</hi> or reaſon of our title, name what that is. If you ſay that we deny any true Relation to Chriſt himſelf, tell us what it is: If you cannot, ſay that you are agreed.</p>
                     <p>1. If you ſay that the Benefit denied by us, is that we are judged by God, as thoſe that (habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and actively) have perfectly fulfilled the Law of Innocency our ſelves, though not in our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons, yet by Chriſt as repreſenting us, and ſo ſhall be juſtified by that Law of Innocency as the Fulfiller of it, we do deny it, and ſay, That you ſubvert the Goſpel, and the true Benefits which we have by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>2. If you ſay that we deny that God eſteemeth or reputeth us, to be the very Subjects of that Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Righteouſneſs, in the Habits, Acts, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Relation, which was in the Perſon of Chriſt, or to have <hi>done, ſuffered,</hi> or <hi>merited our ſelves</hi> in and by him, as the proper Repreſenter of our Perſons therein; and ſo that his Righteouſneſs is thus imputed to us as truly in it ſelf <hi>our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,</hi> we do deny it, and deſire you to do ſo alſo, leſt you deny Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:45239:67"/>2. If you blame us for ſaying, That we had or have no ſuch Relation to Chriſt, as to our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or the proper full Repreſenter of each Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particular Perſon, by whom we did truly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law of Innocency, habitually and actively,
and ſatisfied, merited, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We do ſtill ſay ſo, and wiſh you to conſider what you ſay, before you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſay the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But if you come not up to this, where will you find a difference.</p>
                     <p>Object. 2. <hi>Chriſt is called The Lord our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and he is made Righteouſneſs to us, and we are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21, &amp;c. <hi>And by the Obedience of one, many are made Righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And are we not all agreed of all this? But can his Righteouſneſs be <hi>Ours</hi> no way but by the foreſaid Perſonation Repreſentating? How prove you that? He is <hi>Our Righteouſneſs,</hi> and his <hi>Obedience maketh us Righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Becauſe the very Law of Innocency which we diſhonoured and broke by ſin, is perfectly fulfilled and honoured by him, as a Mediator, to repair the injury done by our breaking it.</p>
                     <p>2. In that he ſuffered to ſatisfie Juſtice for our
ſin.</p>
                     <p>3. In that hereby he hath merited of God the Father, all that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which we are truly the Subjects of, whether it be Relative, or Qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
or Active; that is, 1. Our Right to Chriſt in Union to the Spirit, to Impunity, and to Glory;
And, 2. The Grace of the Spirit by which we are made Holy, and fulfil the Conditions of the Law
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45239:68"/>
of Grace. We are the <hi>Subjects of theſe,</hi> and he is the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and the <hi>meritorious Cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Life,</hi>
is well called <hi>Our Righteouſneſs,</hi> and by many the
<hi>material Cauſe,</hi> (as our own perfect Obedience would have been) becauſe it is the <hi>Matter</hi> of that Merit.</p>
                     <p>4. And alſo Chriſt's Interceſſion with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſtill procureth all this as the Fruit of his Merits.</p>
                     <p>5. And we are Related as his Members (though not parts of his <hi>Perſon</hi> as ſuch) to him that thus merited for us.</p>
                     <p>6. And we have the Spirit from him as our Head.</p>
                     <p>7. And he is our Advocate, and will juſtifie us as our Judg.</p>
                     <p>8. And all this is <hi>God's Righteouſneſs</hi> deſigned for us, and thus far given us by him.</p>
                     <p>9. And the perfect Juſtice and Holineſs of God,
is thus glorified in us through Chriſt. And are not all theſe ſet together enough to prove, that we juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own all aſſerted by theſe Texts? But if you think that you have a better ſenſe of them, you muſt better prove it, than by a bare naming of the words.</p>
                     <p>Object. 3. <hi>If Chriſt's Righteouſneſs be Ours, then we are Righteous by it as Ours; and ſo God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth it but as it is: But it is Ours</hi>; 1. <hi>By our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him.</hi> 2. <hi>And by his Gift, and ſo conſequently by God's Imputation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have told you before that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be <hi>Ours</hi>; but that this ſyllable <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS</hi> hath many ſenſes; and I have told you in what ſenſe,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45239:68"/>
and how far it is <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS,</hi> and in that ſenſe we are juſtified by it, and it is truly imputed to us, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted or reckoned as <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS:</hi> But not in their ſenſe that claim a ſtrict Propriety in the ſame numerical Habits, Acts, Sufferings, Merits, Satisfaction, which was in Chriſt, or done by him, as if they did become <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>ſame Accidents</hi>; or, as if they did it by an inſtrumental ſecond Cauſe. But it is <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS,</hi> as being done by a Mediator, inſtead of what we ſhould have done, and as the Meritorious Cauſe of all our Righteouſneſs and Benefits, which are freely given us for the ſake hereof.</p>
                     <p>2. He that is made Righteouſneſs to us, is alſo made Wiſdom, Sanctification and Redemption to us: but that <hi>ſub genere Cauſae Efficientis, non autem Cauſae Conſtitutivae:</hi> We are the Subjects of the
ſame numerical <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> which is in Chriſt. Plainly the Queſtion is, Whether Chriſt or his Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, Merits, and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
be <hi>Our Righteouſneſs Conſtitutively,</hi> or only
<hi>Efficiently?</hi> The <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of Chriſt's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Righteouſneſs is <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS,</hi> as an Efficient Cauſe,
but it is neither the neareſt <hi>Matter,</hi> or the <hi>Form</hi> of that Righteouſneſs which is <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS</hi> as the Subjects of it; that is, It is not a Conſtitutive Cauſe nextly material, or formal of it.</p>
                     <p>3. If our Union with Chriſt were Perſonal,
(making us the ſame Perſon) then doubtleſs the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of his Perſon would be the Accidents of ours,
and ſo not only Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, but every Chriſtians would be each of Ours: But that is not
ſo. Nor is it ſo given us by him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:45239:69"/>Object. 4. <hi>You do ſeem to ſuppoſe that we have none of that kind of Righteouſneſs at all, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in perfect Obedience and Holineſs, but only a Right to Impunity and Life, with an imperfect Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteouſneſs in our ſelves: The Papiſts are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs, that a Righteouſneſs we muſt have which conſiſteth in a conformity to the preceptive part of the Law, and not only the Retributive part: But they ſay, It is in our ſelves, and we ſay it is Chriſt's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

And hence they 1. ſeem to take no notice of the Law of Innocency, or of Nature now commanding our perfect Obedience, but only of the Law of Grace. 2. Therefore they uſe to call thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> but Perfections; and the Commands that require them, but <hi>Counſels,</hi> where they are not made Conditions of Life: and ſins not bringing Damnation, ſome call Venial, (a name not unfit) and ſome expound that as properly <hi>no ſin,</hi> but analogically. 3. And hence they take little notice, when they treat of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, of the <hi>Remitting of Puniſhment</hi>; but by <hi>remitting Sin,</hi> they uſually mean the deſtroying the <hi>Habits:</hi> As if they forgot all <hi>actual ſin paſt,</hi> or thought that it deſerved no Puniſhment, or needed no Pardon: For a paſt Act in it ſelf is now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and is capable of no Remiſſion but Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 4. Or when they do talk of Guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, they lay ſo much of the Remedy on Man's <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> as if Chriſt's Satisfaction and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45239:69"/>
Merits had procured no pardon, or at leaſt, of no temporal part of Puniſhment. 5. And hence they ignorantly revile the Proteſtants, as if we denied all <hi>Perſonal Inherent Righteouſneſs,</hi> and truſted only to the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as juſtifying wicked unconverted Men: The Papiſts therefore ſay not that we are innocent or ſinleſs, (really or imputatively); no not when they dream of <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Supererrogation,</hi> unleſs when they denominate <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> only from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Law of Grace, and not that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.</p>
                     <p>2. But if any of them do as you ſay, no wonder if they and you contend: If one ſay, We <hi>are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi> or <hi>Sinleſs</hi> in reality, and the <hi>other, we are ſo</hi> by <hi>Imputation,</hi> when we are ſo no way at all (but ſinners <hi>really,</hi> and ſo reputed); what Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is there to be expected, till both lay by their Errour?</p>
                     <p>Object. 5. <hi>How can God accept him as juſt, who is really and reputedly a Sinner? This diſhonoureth his Holineſs and Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo: Cannot God pardon ſin, upon a valuable Merit and Satisfaction of a Mediator? And though he judg us not <hi>perfect</hi> now, and accept us not as ſuch; yet 1. now he judgeth us Holy, 2. and the Members of a perfect Saviour; 3. and will make us perfect and ſpotleſs, and then ſo judg us, having waſhed us from our ſins in the Blood of the Lamb.</p>
                     <p>Object. 6. <hi>Thus you make the</hi> Reatus Culpae, <hi>not pardoned at all, but only the</hi> Reatus Poenae.</p>

                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:45239:70"/>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If by <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> be meant the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Sinner as he is <hi>Revera Peccator,</hi> and ſo to be <hi>Reus,</hi> is to be <hi>Revera ipſe qui peccavit</hi>; then we muſt conſider what you mean by <hi>Pardon:</hi> For if you mean the <hi>nullifying</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Guilt,</hi> (or <hi>Reality</hi>) it is impoſſible, becauſe <hi>neceſſiate exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> he that hath once ſinned, will be ſtill the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſinned, while he is a Perſon, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>one that ſinned</hi> will cleave to him: It will eternally be a true Propoſition, [<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did ſin]; But if by <hi>Pardon</hi> you mean, the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning</hi> of all the <hi>penalty</hi> which for that ſin is due, (<hi>damni vel ſenſus</hi>) ſo <hi>it is pardoned</hi>; and this is indeed the <hi>Reatus poenae:</hi> Not only the <hi>Penalty,</hi> but the <hi>Dueneſs</hi> of that Penalty, or the Obligation to it, is remitted and nullified.</p>
                     <p>2. Therefore if by <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> you mean an
<hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Puniſhment for that Fault,</hi> this being indeed the <hi>Reatus poenae,</hi> as is ſaid, is done away.
So that we are, I think, all agreed <hi>de re</hi>; And <hi>de nomine</hi> you may ſay that the <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> is done away or remitted, or not, in ſeveral ſenſes: <hi>In ſe</hi>
it is not nullified, nor can be: But as <hi>Dueneſs</hi> of Puniſhment followeth, that is pardoned.</p>
                     <p>Object. 7. <hi>You have ſaid, That though we were not perſonally but ſeminally in</hi> Adam <hi>when he ſinned, yet when we are Perſons, we are Perſons guilty of his actual ſin: And ſo we muſt be Perſons that are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt's Actual Righteouſneſs, and not only of its Effects, as ſoon as we are Believers. For Chriſt being the Second</hi> Adam, <hi>and publick Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have our part in his Righteouſneſs, as truly and as much as in</hi> Adam's <hi>ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:45239:70"/>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We muſt firſt underſtand how far <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin is ours: And firſt I have elſewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that our <hi>Covenant-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Intereſt</hi> ſuppoſeth our <hi>Natural <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi>; and that it is an adding to God's Word and Covenant, to ſay, That he covenanted that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould perſonate each one of his Poſterity in God's imputation or account, any further than they were naturally in him; and ſo that his <hi>innocency or ſin</hi> ſhould be reputed theirs, <hi>as far</hi> as if they had been perſonally the Subjects and Agents. The <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> never was in <hi>Reality</hi> or <hi>God's Reputation,</hi> the <hi>Perſon of</hi> Adam. (Nor <hi>Adam</hi>'s Perſon the Perſon of <hi>Peter</hi>): But <hi>Peter</hi> being virtually and ſeminally in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he ſinned, his Perſon is derived from <hi>Adam</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And ſo <hi>Peter</hi>'s Guilt is not numerically the ſame with <hi>Adams,</hi> but the Accident of another Subject, and therefore another Accident, derived with the Perſon from <hi>Adam</hi> (and from nearer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents). The <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of that <hi>Relation</hi> (of Guilt) is the <hi>Natural Relation</hi> of the Perſon to <hi>Adam,</hi> (and ſo it is <hi>Relatio in Relatione fundata</hi>). The <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of that <hi>natural Relation,</hi> is <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> yea a <hi>ſeries</hi> of Generations from <hi>Adam</hi> to that Perſon: And <hi>Adam</hi>'s Generation being the Communication of a <hi>Guilty Nature with perſonality</hi> to his Sons and Daughters, is the <hi>fundamentum</hi> next following his <hi>perſonal Fault and Guilt</hi> charged on him by the Law: So that here is a long <hi>ſeries</hi> of efficient Cauſes, bringing down from <hi>Adam's Perſon and Guilt</hi> a <hi>diſtinct numerical Perſon</hi> and <hi>Guilt</hi> of every one of his later Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>2. And it is not the ſame ſort of Guilt, or ſo plenary, which is on us, for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Act, as was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45239:71"/>
on him, but a Guilt Analogical, or of another
ſort: that is, He was guilty of being the <hi>wilful
ſinning Perſon,</hi> and ſo are not we, but only of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Perſons whoſe Being is derived by Generation from the wilful ſinning Perſons,</hi> (beſides the guilt of our own inherent pravity): That is, <hi>The Relation is
ſuch which our Perſons have to</hi> Adam'<hi>s Perſon, as make it juſt with God to deſert us, and to puniſh us for that and our pravity together.</hi> This is our <hi>Guilt</hi> of Original ſin.</p>
                     <p>3. And this Guilt cometh to us by Natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation,
and reſultancy from our very Nature ſo propagated. And now let us conſider of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And, 1. Our Perſons are not the ſame as Chriſt's Perſon, (nor Chriſt's as ours) nor ever ſo judged or accounted of God.</p>
                     <p>2. Our <hi>Perſons</hi> were not naturally, ſeminally,
and virtually in Chriſt's Perſon (any further than he is Creator and Cauſe of all things) as they were in <hi>Adams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Therefore we derive not Righteouſneſs from him by Generation, but by his voluntary Donation or Contract.</p>
                     <p>4. As he became not our Natural Parent, ſo our Perſons not <hi>being in Chriſt</hi> when he obeyed, are not
<hi>reputed to have been in him naturally,</hi> or to have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and by him.</p>
                     <p>5. If Chriſt and we are reputed one Perſon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he <hi>obeyed</hi> in our <hi>Perſon,</hi> or we <hi>in his,</hi> or <hi>both.</hi>
If he <hi>obeyed</hi> as a <hi>Reputed Sinner</hi> in the Perſon of each Sinner, his Obedience could not be meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
according to the Law of Innocency, which required ſinleſs Perfection; And he being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45239:71"/>
to have broken the Law in our Perſons, could not ſo be ſuppoſed to keept it. If we obeyed in his <hi>Perſon,</hi> we obeyed as <hi>Mediators,</hi> or Chriſt's, of which before.</p>
                     <p>6. But as is oft ſaid, Chriſt our Mediator under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took in a middle Perſon to reconcile God and Man,
(not by bringing God erroneouſly to judg that he or we were what we are not, or did what we did not,
but) by <hi>being, doing,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> for us, that in
<hi>his own Perſon,</hi> which ſhould better anſwer God's Ends and Honour, than if we had done and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Perſons, that hereby he might <hi>merit</hi> a free Gift of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> (with himſelf) to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a Law of Grace to believing penitent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepters.
And ſo our Righteouſneſs, as is oft open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is a Relation reſulting at once from all theſe Cauſes as fundamental to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Righteouſneſs, his free Gift thereupon, and our Relation to him as Covenanters or United Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
And this is agreed on.</p>
                     <p>Object. 8. <hi>As Chriſt is a Sinner by imputation of our ſin, ſo we are Righteous, by the imputation of his Righteouſneſs. But it is our ſin it ſelf that is imputed to Chriſt: Therefore it is his Righteouſneſs it ſelf that is imputed to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt's Perſon was not the Subject of our perſonal Relative <hi>Guilt,</hi> much leſs of our <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi> or <hi>Acts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. God did not judg him to have been ſo.</p>
                     <p>3. Nay, Chriſt had no <hi>Guilt</hi> of the <hi>ſame kind</hi>
reckoned to be on him; elſe thoſe unmeet Speeches,
uſed raſhly by ſome, would be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was the greateſt Murderer, Adulterer, Idolater,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45239:72"/>
Blaſphemer, Thief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently more hated of God, (for God muſt needs hate a ſinner as ſuch). To be guilty of ſin as we are, is to be reputed truly to be the Perſon that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it: But ſo was not Chriſt, and therefore not ſo to be reputed. Chriſt was but the Mediator that undertook to ſuffer for our ſins, that we might be forgiven; and not for his <hi>own</hi> ſin, real or juſtly reputed: Expoſitors commonly ſay that to be [<hi>made ſin for us</hi>], is but to be made [<hi>a Sacrifice for ſin</hi>]. So that Chriſt took upon him neither our <hi>numerical guilt</hi> of ſin it ſelf, nor any of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi>; but only our <hi>Reatum Poenae,</hi> or <hi>Debt</hi> of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> or (leſt the Wrangler make a verbal quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of it) our <hi>Reatum Culpae non qua talem &amp; in ſe, ſed quatenus eſt fundamentum Reatus poenae:</hi> And ſo his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is ours; not <hi>numerically</hi> the ſame Relation that he was the Subject of made that Relation to us; nor yet a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> as Chriſt's is given us at all, (for his was a <hi>Mediators Righteouſneſs,</hi> conſiſting in, 1. <hi>perfect Innocency</hi>; 2. And that in the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Law,</hi> which bind us not; 3. And in doing his <hi>peculiar Works,</hi> as <hi>Miracles, Reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c. which were all <hi>His Righteouſneſs</hi> as a conformity to <hi>that Law,</hi> and performance of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> which was made with, and to him <hi>as Mediator</hi>). But his Righteouſneſs is the <hi>Meritorious Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of another Righteouſneſs or Juſtification (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from his) freely given us by the Father and himſelf by his Covenant. So that here indeed the Similitude much cleareth the Matter; And they that will not blaſpheme Chriſt by making <hi>guilt of ſin it ſelf</hi> in its <hi>formal Relation</hi> to be his own, and ſo
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45239:72"/>
Chriſt to be <hi>formally</hi> as great a ſinner as all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
ſet together, and they that will not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Goſpel, by making us formally as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as Chriſt in kind and meaſure, muſt needs be agreed with us in this part of the Controverſie.</p>
                     <p>Object. 9. <hi>When you infer, That if we are reckoned to have perfectly obeyed in and by Chriſt, we cannot be again bound to obey our ſelves afterward, nor be guilty of any ſin; you muſt know that it's true, That we cannot be bound to obey to the ſame ends as Chriſt did, (which is to redeem us, or to fulfil the Law of Works) But yet we muſt obey to other ends,</hi> viz. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and to live to God, and to do good, and other ſuch like.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is very true, That we are not bound to obey to all the ſame ends that Chriſt did, as to redeem the World, nor to fulfil the Law of Innocency. But hence it clearly followeth that <hi>Chriſt obeyed not</hi> in each of our Perſons legally, but in the Perſon of a Mediator, ſeeing his due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ours have ſo different <hi>Ends,</hi> and a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent formal Relation, (his being a conformity proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to the Law, given him as Mediator) that they are not ſo much as of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> much leſs numerically the ſame.</p>
                     <p>2. And this fully proveth that we are not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have perfectly obeyed in and by him: For elſe we could not be yet obliged to obey, though to other ends than he was: For either this <hi>Obedience</hi> of
<hi>Gratitude</hi> is a Duty or not; If not, it is not truly
<hi>Obedience,</hi> nor the omiſſion ſin: If yea, then <hi>that Duty</hi> was made a Duty by ſome Law: And if by a Law we are now bound to obey <hi>in gratitude</hi> (or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45239:73"/>
for what ends ſoever) either we do all that we are ſo bound to do, or not. If we do it (or any of it) then to ſay that we did it twice, once by Chriſt, and once by our ſelves, is to ſay that we were bound to do it twice, and then Chriſt did not all that we were bound to, but half: But what Man is he that ſinneth not? Therefore ſeeing it is certain, that no Man doth all that he is bound to do by the Goſpel, (in the time and meaſure of his
<hi>Faith, Hope, Love, Fruitfulneſs,</hi> &amp;c.) it followeth that he is a ſinner, and that he is not ſuppoſed to have done all that by Chriſt which he failed in, both becauſe he was bound to do it himſelf, and becauſe he is a ſinner for not doing it.</p>
                     <p>3. Yea, the Goſpel binds us to that which Chriſt could not do for us, it being a Contradiction. Our great Duties are, 1. To believe in a Saviour. 2. To improve all the parts of his Mediation by a Life of Faith. 3. To repent of our ſins. 4. To mortifie
ſinful Luſts in our ſelves. 5. To fight by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt our fleſh. 6. To confeſs our ſelves ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
7. To pray for pardon. 8. To pray for that Grace which we culpably want. 9. To love God for redeeming us. 10. Sacramentally to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Chriſt, and to receive him and his Gifts; with many ſuch like; which Chriſt was not capable of doing in and on his own Perſon for us,
though as Mediator he give us Grace to do them,
and pray for the pardon of our ſins, as in our
ſelves.</p>
                     <p>4. But the Truth which this Objection intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
we all agree in, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Mediator per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly kept the Law of Innocency, that the keeping of that Law might not be neceſſary to our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45239:73"/>
(and ſo ſuch Righteouſneſs neceſſary in our
ſelves) but that we might be pardoned for want of perfect Innocency, and be ſaved upon our ſincere keeping of the Law of Grace, becauſe the Law of Innocency was kept by our Mediator, and thereby the Grace of the New-Covenant merited, and by it Chriſt, Pardon, Spirit and Life, by him freely given to Believers.</p>
                     <p>Object. 10. <hi>The ſame Perſon may be really a ſinner in himſelf, and yet perfectly innocent in Chriſt, and by imputation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Remember that you ſuppoſe here the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> to be the ſame Man: And then that the two contrary Relations of <hi>perfect Innocency,</hi> or <hi>guiltleſneſs,</hi> and <hi>guilt of any,</hi> (yea much ſin) can be conſiſtent in him, is a groſs contradiction. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he may be guilty, and not guilty in ſeveral partial reſpects; but a <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>guiltleſneſs</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth all guilt. But we are guilty of many a ſin after Converſion, and need a Pardon. All that you ſhould ſay is this, <hi>We are ſinners our ſelves, but we have a Mediator that ſinned not, who merited Pardon and Heaven for ſinners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. But if you mean that God reputeth us to be perfectly innocent when we are not, becauſe that Chriſt was ſo, it is to impute Error to God: He reputeth no Man to be otherwiſe than he is: But he doth indeed firſt give, and then impute a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs Evangelical to us, inſtead of perfect Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
which ſhall as certainly bring us to Glory;
and that is, He giveth us both the Renovation of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45239:74"/>
his Spirit, (to Evangelical Obedience) and a Right by free gift to Pardon and Glory for the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt that merited it; And this thus given us, he reputeth to be an acceptable Righteouſneſs in us.</p>

                     <p>To ſpeak freely, I remember not one Text of Scripture that uſeth the word [<hi>Juſtifie</hi>] in this Doctor's ſenſe; that is, <hi>Only for the ſaid abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Curſe of the Law:</hi> For all thoſe other Texts that ſpeak for Juſtification by Chriſt's Grace, and Faith, <hi>and not by the Works of the Law,</hi> (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, 24, 28, 30. and 4.2, 5, 25. &amp; 5.1, 9, 16, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16, 17. &amp; 3.8, 11, 24. &amp; 5.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) do all ſeem to me to mean, not only that [we are <hi>abſolved from the Maledictory Sentence of the Law</hi>], but alſo that we are firſt <hi>made,</hi> and then accounted Perſons firſt meet for Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and next meet for God's Acceptance of us as juſt, and as Heirs of Life Eternal, and meet for the great <hi>Reward in Heaven:</hi> For when the Apoſtle denieth <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Works</hi>; it is not credible that he meaneth only, that [<hi>By the Works of the Law no Man is abſolved from the Curſe of the Law</hi>]; But alſo, <hi>No Man by the Works of the Law,</hi> is before God taken for a Performer of the neceſſary Condition of Abſolution and Salvation, nor fit for his Acceptance, and for the Heavenly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. But let the Reader here note, that the Doctor ſuppoſeth <hi>James</hi> to mean, that [<hi>By Works a Man is abſolved from the Maledictory Sentence of the Law, and not by Faith only</hi>]. For that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of Juſtification <hi>in foro Dei</hi> is paſt all doubt: And who would have thought that the Doctor had granted this of the Text of <hi>James?</hi> But miſtakes ſeldom agree among themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. And would not any Man have thought
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45239:77"/>
that this Author had pleaded for ſuch an Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as juſtifieth not only from the Maledictory Sentence of the Law, but alſo from the very guilt of ſin as ſin, we being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, (not only pardoned ſinners, but) perfect fulfillers of the Law by Chriſt, and ſo that we are in Chriſt conform to the <hi>Fac hoc</hi> or preceptive part commanding Innocency? Who would have thought but this was his drift? If it be not, all his angry Oppoſition to me, is upon a miſtake ſo foul, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence forbids me to name with its proper Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets: If it be, how can the ſame Man hold, That we are juſtified as in Chriſt, conform <hi>to the Precept</hi> of <hi>perfect Innocency?</hi> And yet that <hi>The Scripture mentioneth no Juſtification at all,</hi> in foro Dei, <hi>beſides that one, which is Abſolution from the Maledictory Sentence of the Law.</hi> But ſtill miſtakes have diſcord with themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. It is the judgment indeed of Mr. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, Wotton, Piſcator, Paraeus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſine, Wende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> and abundance other excellent Divines, that as ſins of omiſſion are truly ſin, and <hi>poena damni,</hi> or privations truly puniſhment; ſo for a ſinner for his ſin to be denied God's Love and Favour, Grace and Glory, is to be puniſhed; and to be pardoned, is to have this privative puniſhment remitted as well as the reſt; and ſo that Juſtification containeth our Right to Glory, as it is the bare forgiveneſs of the penalty of ſin; becauſe Death and Life, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Light are ſuch Contraries, as that one is but the privation of the other: But this Learned Doctor ſeemeth to be of the commoner Opinion, that the Remiſſion of Sin is but one part of our Juſtification, and that by Imputation of perfect
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45239:77"/>
Holineſs and Obedience we muſt have another part, which is our <hi>Right to the Reward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> (and I think a little Explication would end that difference). But doth he here then agree with himſelf? And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the common way of thoſe with whom he joyneth? Do they not hold that Juſtification is more than an <hi>Abſolution from the Maledictory Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law?</hi>
                     </p>

Abſolution is either by <hi>Actual Pardon,</hi> by the Law or Covenant of Grace; which giveth us our <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Impunity:</hi> 2. Or by <hi>Sentence</hi> of the Judg, who publickly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideth</hi> our Caſe, and declareth our Right determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively: Or by execution of that Sentence in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al delivering us from penalty; And who knoweth which of theſe he meaneth? This is but confuſion, to deſcribe by an unexplained equivocal word.</p>
                     <p>And who knoweth what Law he meaneth, whoſe <hi>Maledictory Sentence</hi> Juſtification abſolveth us from? Doth he think that the Law of Innocency, and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Law of Grace are all one, which Scripture ſo frequently diſtinguiſheth? Or that each of them hath not its <hi>Malediction?</hi> If he deny this, I refer him to my full proof of it, to Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> and elſewhere. If not, we ſhould know whether he mean all, or which.</p>
                     <p>3. And what he meaneth by the Sentence of the Law is uncertain: Whether it be the Laws <hi>Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
as obliging us to puniſhment, which is not a <hi>Sentence</hi> in the uſual proper ſenſe, but only a <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sentence,</hi> that is, the <hi>Norma Judicis</hi>; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he mean the <hi>Sentence of God as Judg,</hi> according to the <hi>Law:</hi> which is not the Sentence of the Law
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45239:78"/>
properly, but of the Judg: It's more intelligible

But which-ever he meaneth, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is not true that the Scripture mentioneth no other Juſtification in <hi>foro Dei.</hi> For many of the fore-cited Texts tell us, that it oft mentioneth a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, which is no Abſolution from the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Sentence, (neither of the Law of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of Grace) but a Juſtification of a Man's innocency in <hi>tantum,</hi> or <hi>quoad Cauſam hanc particularem, Viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Sometimes a Juſtifying the Righteous Man againſt the ſlanders of the World, or of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>2. Sometimes a juſtifying a Man in ſome one action, as having dealt faithfully therein.</p>
                     <p>3. Sometimes a judging a Man to be a faithful Godly Man, that performeth the Conditions of Life in the Law of Grace made neceſſary to God's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</p>
                     <p>4. Sometimes for making a Man ſuch, or for making him yet more inherently juſt, or continuing him ſo.</p>
                     <p>5. Sometimes for Juſtification by the Apology of an Advocate, (which is not <hi>Abſolution</hi>).</p>
                     <p>6. Sometimes for Juſtification by <hi>Witness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. And ſometimes, perhaps, by <hi>Evidence.</hi> As appeareth, <hi>Iſa</hi> 50.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. (and ſo God himſelf is ſaid to be juſtified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4.

and juſtifying the Righteous, to give him according to his Righteouſneſs,</hi> (where the <hi>Sentence</hi> is paſſed by the Act of Execution). Is this abſolving him from the Curſe of the Law? So 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.23. ſo <hi>Mat.</hi>
12.37. &amp; <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21, 24, 25. where Juſtification by our <hi>Words</hi> and by <hi>Works</hi> is aſſerted; and many other Texts ſo ſpeak: Frequently to Juſtifie, is to
<hi>maintain</hi> one, or <hi>prove him</hi> to be juſt. It's ſtrange that any Divine ſhould find but one ſort of ſenſe of Juſtification before God mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>I would give here to the Reader, a help for ſome excuſe of the Author, <hi>viz.</hi> that by [<hi>praeter unam illam quae eſt Abſolutio</hi>] he might mean, which is <hi>partly Abſolution</hi> and <hi>partly Acceptation,</hi> as of a fulfiller of the Precept of Perfection by Chriſt, and partly Right to the Reward, all three making up the whole; but that I muſt not teach him how to ſpeak his own mind, or think that he knew not how to utter it; And ſpecially, becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances here prove that even ſo it is very far from Truth, had he ſo ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 7. But what if the word [<hi>Juſtification</hi>] had been found only as he affirmed? If <hi>Juſtice,</hi> (Righteouſneſs) and <hi>Juſt,</hi> be otherwiſe uſed, that's all one in the ſenſe, and almoſt in the word; ſeeing it is confeſſed, that <hi>to Juſtifie,</hi> is, 1. To <hi>make Juſt</hi>; 2. Or to <hi>eſteem Juſt</hi>; 3. Or <hi>ſentence Juſt</hi>; 4. Or to prove Juſt, and defend as Juſt; 5. Or to <hi>uſe</hi> as Juſt by execution. And therefore in ſo many ſenſes as a Man is called <hi>Juſt</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he is incluſively, or by connotation, ſaid to be <hi>Juſtified,</hi> and <hi>Juſtifiable,</hi> and <hi>Juſtificandus.</hi> And I deſire no more of the Impartial Reader, but to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45239:79"/>
turn to his <hi>Concordances,</hi> and peruſe all the Texts where the words [Juſt, Juſtice, Juſtly, Righteous, Righteouſneſs, Righteouſly] are uſed; and if he find not that they are many ſcore, if not hundred times uſed, for that Righteouſneſs which is the Perſons Relation reſulting from ſome Acts or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of his own, (as the Subject or Agent) and otherwiſe than according to his ſolitary ſenſe here, let him then believe this Author.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. But he is as unhappy in his Proofs, as in his ſingular untrue Aſſertion:
<q>[<hi>Rom. 8.2, 4.</hi> The Law of the Spirit of Life, hath freed us from the Law of Sin and of Death. <hi>Gal. 3.13.</hi> God ſent his Son, thta the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us; Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law; <hi>and many more ſuch: Here is no mention of any but</hi> one legal Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion].</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Reader, do you believe that theſe two Texts are a perfect Enumeration. And that if theſe mention but one ſenſe or ſort of Juſtification, that it will follow that no more is mentioned in Scripture: Or if many hundred other Texts have the ſame ſenſe?</p>
                     <p>2. Nay, he hath choſen only theſe Texts where the word [<hi>Juſtification</hi>] or [<hi>Juſtifie</hi>] is not at all found. By which I may ſuppoſe that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth the Controverſie here <hi>de re,</hi> and not <hi>de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
And is that ſo? Can any Man that ever conſiderately opened the Bible, believe that <hi>de re</hi>
no ſuch Thing is mentioned in Scripture. 1. As making a Man a believing Godly Man. 2. Or as performing the Conditions of Life required of us in the Covenant of Grace. 3. Nor eſteeming a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45239:79"/>
Man ſuch. 4. Not defending or proving him to be ſuch. 5. Nor judging him ſuch deciſively. 6. Nor uſing him as ſuch. 7. Nor as juſtifying a Man ſo far as he is Innocent and Juſt againſt all falſe Accuſation of Satan or the World.</p>
                     <p>3. The firſt Text cited by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right contradicts him: Not only <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but divers Proteſtant Expoſitors ſuppoſe, that by the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life</hi> is meant, either the <hi>quickning Spirit it ſelf</hi> given to us that are in Chriſt, or the Goſpel, as it <hi>giveth that Spirit into us</hi>; And that by <hi>delivering</hi> us from the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> is meant either from that <hi>ſin which is</hi> as a <hi>Law within us,</hi> or <hi>Moſes Law,</hi> as it forbiddeth and commandeth all its peculiarities, and ſo maketh <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>not doing</hi> them ſin; and as it declareth ſin, yea, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally irritateth it: Yea, that by the Law of Death is meant, not only that Law we are curſed by, and ſo guilty, but chiefly that Law, as it is ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. to <hi>kill Paul,</hi> and to occaſion the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſin, and the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e of it: And that by [<hi>the fulfilling of the Law in us, that walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit</hi>], is meant [that by the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt, Chriſtians do fulfil the Law, as it requireth ſincere Holineſs, Sobriety and Righteouſneſs, which God accepteth for Chriſt's ſake; which the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> without Chriſt's Spirit, enabled no Man to fulfil]. Not to weary the Reader with citing Expoſitors, I now only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to peruſe, <hi>Ludov. de Dieu</hi> on the Text.</p>
                     <p>And it is certain, that the Law that <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaketh of, was <hi>Moſes</hi> Law: And that he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all along, that the obſervation of it was not neceſſary to the Gentiles, to their <hi>performance,</hi> or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45239:80"/>
Juſtification and Salvation, (<hi>neceſſitate praecepti vel medii</hi>); (for it would not juſtifie the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves). And ſure, 1. all his meaning is not, [The Law will not abſolve Men from the ſenſe of the Law]. But alſo <hi>its Works</hi> will give no one the juſt title of a Righteous Man, accepted of God, and ſaved by him, as judging between the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the wicked: (as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>The Righteous ſhall go into Everlaſting Life,</hi> &amp;c.) 2. And if it were only the <hi>Maledictory Sentence</hi> of <hi>Moſes Law,</hi> as ſuch, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from, as our only Juſtification, then none but Jews and Proſelites who were under that Law, could have the Juſtification by Faith which he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for it curſeth none elſe: For what-ever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law: The reſt of the World were only under the Law of lapſed Nature, (the relicts of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency) and the Curſe for <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Violation; and the Law of Grace made to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and after perfected fullier by Chriſt in its ſecond Edition.</p>

His other Text [<hi>Chriſt redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law</hi>] proveth indeed that all Believers are redeemed from the Curſe of the firſt Law of Innocency, and the Jews from the Curſe of <hi>Moſes Law</hi> (which is it that is <hi>directly</hi> meant): But what's that to prove that theſe words ſpeak the whole and the <hi>only Juſtification?</hi> and that the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth no other?</p>
                     <p>§. 4. He addeth, [<hi>Lex est quae prohibet; Lex quae poenam decernit; Lex quae irrogat: Peccatum eſt tranſgreſſio Legis: Poena effectus iſtius trangreſſionis; Juſtificatio denique abſolutio ab iſta poena: Itaque

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But doth he know but <hi>one ſort of Law</hi> of God? Hath every Man incurred the Curſe by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law that did by <hi>Adams</hi>? Or every Man fallen under the peremptory irreverſible condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Law of Grace paſſeth on them that never believe and repent? Doth this Law, [<hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned</hi>] damn Believers? One Law condemneth all that are not Innocent. Another ſuppoſeth them under that defect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth peremptorily (not every Sinner) but the Wicked and Unbelievers.</p>
                     <p>2. Again here he ſaith, [<hi>Juſtification is Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that Penalty</hi>]. But is a Man abſolved
(properly) from that which he was never guilty of? Indeed if he take <hi>Abſolution</hi> ſo looſly as to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
the juſtifying a Man againſt a falſe Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and pronouncing him <hi>Not-Guilty</hi>; So all the Angels in Heaven may poſſibly be capable of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:
Juſtification is ordinarily ſo uſed, but Abſolution ſeldom by Divines. And his words
ſhew that this is not his ſenſes, if I underſtand them.
But if we are reputed perfect fulfillers of the Law of Innocency by Chriſt, and yet Juſtification is our Abſolution from the Curſe, then no Man is juſtified that is Righteous by that Imputation.</p>
                     <p>3. And how unable is my weak Underſtanding,
to make his words at peace with themſelves? The
ſame Man in the next lines ſaith, [<hi>Lex niſi praeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta neminem juſtificat:</hi> and all <hi>Juſtification before God muſt be legal or none</hi>]; ſo that no Man is juſtified but as reputed Innocent, or a performer of the Law:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45239:81"/>
And yet <hi>Juſtification</hi> is our Abſolution from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and Malediction of the Law; As if he
ſaid, No Man is juſtified but by the pardon of that
ſin which he is reputed never to have had, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from that Curſe and Puniſhment which he is reputed never to have deſerved or been under.
Are theſe things reconcileable? But if really he take <hi>Abſolution</hi> for juſtifying or acquitting from a falſe Accuſation, and ſo to be abſolved from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction of the Law, is to be reputed one that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſerved it, or was under it, then it's as much as to ſay, that there is no pardon of ſin, or that no Man that is pardoned, or reputed to need a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
is juſtified.</p>
                     <p>4. All this and ſuch Speeches would perſwade the Reader that this Learned Diſputer thinketh that I took and uſe the word [Legal] generally as of that which is related to any Law <hi>in genere,</hi> and ſo take
<hi>Evangelical</hi> contrarily for that which is related to no Law: whereas I over and over tell him, that
(ſpeaking in the uſual Language that I may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood)
I take [Legal] <hi>ſpecially</hi> (and not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally)
for that Righteouſneſs, which is related to the <hi>Law of Works</hi> or <hi>Innocency,</hi> (not as if we had indeed ſuch a Righteouſneſs as that Law will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us for; But a <hi>pro-Legal-Righteouſneſs,</hi> one <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it, in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> our perfect Saviour, which ſhall effectually ſave us from that Laws condemnation):
And that by [<hi>Evangelical Righteouſneſs</hi>], I mean,
that which is related to the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> as the Rule of <hi>Judgment,</hi> upon the juſt pleading whereof that Law will not condemn but juſtifie us. If he knew this to be my meaning, in my weak judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ſhould not have written either as if he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45239:81"/>
did not, or as if he would perſwade his Rsaders to the contrary: For Truth is moſt congruouſly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Truth: But if he <hi>knew it not,</hi> I deſpair of becoming intelligible to him, by any thing that I can write, and I ſhall expect that this Reply be wholly loſt to him and worſe.</p>
                     <p>5. His [<hi>Lex niſi praeſtita neminem juſtificat</hi>] is true; and therefore no Man is juſtified by the Law,
But his next words [<hi>&amp; praeſtitam omnes in Chriſto agnoſcunt</hi>] ſeemeth to mean that [<hi>It was performed by us in Chriſt</hi>]; Or that [<hi>It juſtifieth us, becauſe performed perfectly by Chriſt as ſuch</hi>]: Which both are the things that we moſt confidently deny. It was not Phyſically, or Morally, or Politically, or Legally, or Reputatively, (take which word you will) <hi>fulfilled by us in Chriſt:</hi> it doth not juſtifie us, becauſe it was fulfilled by Chriſt, (<hi>as ſuch,</hi> or immediately, and <hi>eo nomine</hi>). It juſtified <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
becauſe he fulfilled it; and ſo their Law doth all the perfect Angels. But we did not perſonally fulfil it in Chriſt; it never allowed <hi>vicarium obedientiae</hi> to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it by our <hi>ſelves</hi> or another: Therefore anothers
<hi>Obedience,</hi> merely as ſuch, (even a Mediators) is not our Obedience or Juſtification: But that Obedience juſtifieth us, as given us only in or to the effecting of our Perſonal Righteouſneſs, which conſiſteth in our right to Impunity, and to God's Favour and Life, freely given for Chriſt's Merits ſake, and in our performance of the Conditions of the Law of Grace, or that free Gift, which is therefore not a co-ordinate but a ſub-ordinate Righteouſneſs (and Juſtification) to qualifie us for the former. This is ſo plain and neceſſary, that if (in ſenſe) it be not underſtood by all that are admitted to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45239:82"/>
Communion, (excepting Verbal Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies or Difficulties) I doubt we are too lax in our admiſſions.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. Next he tel's us of a <hi>threefold reſpect of Juſtification:</hi> 1. <hi>Ex parte principii.</hi> 2. <hi>Termini.</hi> 3. <hi>Medii:</hi> (I find my ſelf uncapeable of <hi>teaching him,</hi> that is a Teacher of ſuch as I, and therefore preſume not to tell him how to diſtinguiſh more congruouſly, plainly, and properly, as to the terms). And <hi>as to the Principle or Fountain whence it floweth,</hi> that is, <hi>Evangelical Grace in Chriſt,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>It is thus neceſſary, that in our lapſed State all Juſtification be Evangelical</hi>].</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who would deſire a <hi>ſharper</hi> or a <hi>ſofter,</hi> a more <hi>diſſenting</hi> or a more <hi>conſenting</hi> Adverſary? Very good: If then I mean it <hi>ex parte principii,</hi> I offend him not by aſſerting Evangelical Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The Controverſie then will be only <hi>de nomine,</hi> whether it be congruous thus to call it. And really are his <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> put into our Creed, and become ſo neceſſary as to be worthy of all the ſtreſs that he layeth on them, and the calling up the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World to arrive by their Zeal againſt our Phraſe? Muſt the Church be awakened to riſe up againſt all thoſe that will ſay with Chriſt, [<hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified</hi>]. And with <hi>James,</hi> [<hi>By Works a Man is juſtified, and not by Faith only</hi>], and [<hi>we are judged by the Law of Liberty</hi>], and as Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22. [<hi>The Father judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judgment to the Son</hi>]; and that ſhall recite the 25<hi>th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Even now he ſaid at once, [<hi>There is no Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> in foro Dei, <hi>but Abſolution,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life hath freed us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Here is no
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45239:82"/>
mention of any Juſtification but Legal</hi>]. And now [<hi>All our Juſtification</hi> ex parte principii, is <hi>only Evangelical</hi>]. So then <hi>no Text</hi> talks of <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juſtification,</hi> or of Juſtification <hi>ex parte prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipii:</hi> And <hi>Abſolution</hi> which defineth it, is named <hi>ex parte principii.</hi> And yet all <hi>Juſtification</hi> is <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical.</hi> Is this mode of Teaching worthy a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by a Theological War?</p>
                     <p>2. But Reader, Why may not I denominate Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
<hi>ex parte principii? Righteouſness</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally a Relation: To juſtifie conſtitutively, is to
<hi>make Righteous.</hi> To be Juſtified, (or Juſtification
<hi>in ſenſu paſſivo</hi>) is to be made <hi>Righteous</hi>; And <hi>in foro,</hi> to be <hi>judged Righteous:</hi> And what meaneth he by <hi>Principium</hi> as to a Relation, but that which other Men call the <hi>Fundamentum,</hi> which is <hi>loco Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientis,</hi>
or a remote efficient? And whence can a Relation be more fitly named, than from the <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum,</hi>
whence it hath its formal being? Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
bear with my Error, or correct it, if I miſtake.
I think that as our <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is not all of one
ſort, no more is the <hi>fundamentum:</hi> 1. I think I have no Righteouſneſs, whoſe immediate <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi>
is my ſinleſs Innocency, or fulfilling the Law of Works or Innocency, by my ſelf or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and ſo I have no <hi>fundamentum</hi> of ſuch.
2. I hope I have a Righteouſneſs conſiſting in my perſonal <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Impunity</hi> and <hi>Life</hi>; and that <hi>Jus</hi>
or <hi>Right</hi> is mine by the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>free Condonation</hi> and
<hi>Donation</hi> by the Goſpel-Covenant or Grant: And
ſo that Grant or Goſpel is the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of it:
But the Merits of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs purchaſed that Gift, and ſo thoſe Merits are the remote <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum</hi>
or efficient: And thus my Juſtification,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45239:83"/>
by the Doctor's confeſſion, is Evangelical. 3. I muſt periſh if I have not alſo a ſubordinate perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteouſneſs, conſiſting in my performance of thoſe Conditions on which the New-Covenant gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the former. And the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of this Righteouſneſs is the Reality of that performance,
as related to the Irrogation, Impoſition, or Tenor of the Covenant, making this the Condition. This is my Hereſie, if I be heretical; and be it right or wrong, I will make it intelligible, and not by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unſaying, involve all in confuſion.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. He addeth, [<hi>Ex parte Termini Legalis eſt, quia terminatur in ſatisfactione, Legi praeſtanda: Liberavit me à Lege mortis, &amp;c. And hence,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>the denomination is properly taken.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Reader here ſeeth that all this Zeal is exerciſed in a <hi>Game at Words,</hi> or <hi>Logical Notions</hi>; and the Church muſt be called for the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirage, to ſtand by in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arms to judg that he hath won the Day: What if the <hi>denomination be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be taken from</hi> the <hi>Terminus?</hi> Is it as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as you frightfully pretend to take it <hi>aliunde?</hi> 2. But ſtay a little: Before we come to this, we muſt crave help to underſtand what he talketh of: Is it, 1. <hi>Juſtificatio, Juſtificans (active ſumpta)?</hi> Or, 2. <hi>Juſtificatio Juſtificati (paſſive)?</hi> 3. Or <hi>Juſtitia?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. The firſt is <hi>Actio,</hi> and the <hi>Terminus</hi> of that Action is two-fold. 1. The Object or Patient (a believing Sinner). 2. The Effect, <hi>Juſtificatio paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivè,</hi>
neither of theſe is <hi>the Law,</hi> or its <hi>Maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
But which of theſe is it that we muſt needs name it from?</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>paſſive</hi> or <hi>effective</hi> Juſtification is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Subjects Reception called <hi>Paſſio:</hi> In
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45239:83"/>
reſpect of the form received, it is as various as I before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>1. The Effect of the Donative Juſtification of the Law of Grace, is <hi>Juſtitia data</hi>; a Relation
(oft deſcribed).</p>
                     <p>2. The Effect of the Spirits giving us <hi>Inherent Righteouſneſs,</hi> is a <hi>Quality given, Acts excited,</hi> and a Relation thence reſulting.</p>
                     <p>3. The Effect of <hi>Juſtification per ſententiam Judicis,</hi> is immediately a Relation, <hi>Jus Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. The Effect of an Advocates Juſtification, is
<hi>Juſtitia &amp; perſona ut defenſa ſeu vindicata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. The Effect of <hi>Executive Juſtification,</hi> is Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Impunity or Liberation. And are all theſe one
<hi>Terminus,</hi> or hence one name then? Theſe are the
<hi>Termini</hi> of <hi>Juſtificatio Juſtificantis, ut Actionis</hi>; and nothing of this nature can be plainer, than that,
1. Remiſſion of ſin (paſſively taken) the <hi>Reatus</hi> or
<hi>Obligatio ad poenam,</hi> (the firſt <hi>ad quem,</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>à quo</hi>) are both the immediate <hi>Termini</hi> of our Act of Juſtification. 2. That the <hi>Terminus Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
as it is the formal Relation of a Juſtified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as ſuch, is the Law as <hi>Norma Actionum,</hi> as to Righteous Actions, and the Law or Covenant, as making the Condition of Life, as to thoſe Actions,
<hi>ſub ratione Conditionis &amp; Tituli.</hi> And the Promiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Minatory part of the Law, as <hi>Juſtitia</hi> is
<hi>Jus praemii, &amp; impunitatis.</hi> Firſt, The Actions,
and then the Perſon are Juſt in Relation to the Law or Covenant, by which their Actions and they are to be judged. But the remoter <hi>Terminus</hi> is the
<hi>malum à quo,</hi> and the <hi>bonum ad quod.</hi> And as <hi>à

quo,</hi> it is not only the <hi>evil</hi> denounced, but alſo the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45239:84"/>
                        <hi>Reatus,</hi> or Obligation to it, and the efficacious Act of the Law thus curſing, and the <hi>Accuſation</hi> of the Actor or Accuſer, (real or poſſible) that is ſuch a
<hi>terminus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. But when he ſaith, <hi>Ex parte Termini Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis eſt,</hi> either ſtill he taketh <hi>legal generally,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Law of <hi>Innocency,</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> and of <hi>Grace,</hi> or not. If he do, I muſt hope he is more <hi>intelligent</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> than to inſinuate to his Reader, that I ever mention an <hi>Evangelical Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
that is not ſo legal, as to be denominated from the Law of Grace, as diſtinct from that of Works:
If not, he was indebted to his intelligent Reader for ſome proof, that no Man is juſtified againſt this falſe Accuſation; [Thou art by the Law of Grace the Heir of a far ſorer puniſhment, for deſpiſing the Remedy, and not performing the Conditions of Pardon and Life. And alſo for this thou haſt no right to Chriſt, and the Gifts of his Covenant of Grace]. But no ſuch proof is found in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
nor can be given.</p>
                     <p>III. But his [<hi>Quia Terminatur in ſatisfactione Legi praeſtanda</hi>]. I confeſs it is a Sentence not very intelligible or edifying to me. 1. <hi>Satisfactio pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie

<hi>ſolutio ejuſdem</hi> is <hi>Legi praeſtanda,</hi> but not <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtita</hi>
by us (perſonally or by another): For we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kept the Law, nor bare the full Penalty; And

Chriſt <hi>performed the Law,</hi> as it obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as Mediator, and as a Subject, but not as <hi>it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged us</hi>; for it obliged us to <hi>Perſonal performance only:</hi> And Chriſt by bearing that Puniſhment (in
ſome reſpects) which we deſerved, ſatisfied the
<hi>Law-giver,</hi> (who had power to take a Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
but not <hi>the Law:</hi> unleſs ſpeaking improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will ſay that the <hi>Law is ſatisfied,</hi> when the remote ends of the Law-giver and Law are obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For the Law hath but one fixed ſenſe, and may be it ſelf changed, but changeth not it ſelf, nor accepteth a <hi>tantundem:</hi> And Chriſt's ſuffering for us, was a <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the Law, which peculiarly
<hi>bound him</hi> to ſuffer, and not a Satisfaction <hi>loco ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionis ejuſdem:</hi> And it was no <hi>fulfilling</hi> the <hi>Penal part</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> as it bound <hi>us</hi> to ſuffer: For ſo it bound none but us; ſo that the <hi>Law</hi> as <hi>binding</hi> us to <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Suffering,</hi> was neither <hi>fulfilled,</hi> nor
ſtrictly <hi>ſatisfied</hi> by Chriſt; but the <hi>Law-giver</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and the remote ends of the Law attained,
by Chriſt's perfect fulfilling all that Law which bound himſelf as Mediator.</p>
                     <p>Now whether he mean the Law as binding us to <hi>Duty,</hi> or to <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> or both, and what by <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> I am not ſure: But as far as I can make ſenſe of it, it ſeeneth to mean, that <hi>Poena</hi> is <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio loco obedientiae,</hi> and that Puniſhment being our Due, this was <hi>ſatisfactio Legi praeſtandâ,</hi> (for he ſaith not <hi>Praeſtita</hi>). But then he muſt judge that we are juſtified only from the <hi>penal Obligation</hi> of the Law, and not from the <hi>preceptive Obligation</hi> to perfect Obedience. And this will not ſtand with the ſcope of other Paſſages, where he endureth not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45239:85"/>
my Opinion, that we are not <hi>juſtified</hi> by the <hi>fae hoc,</hi> the Precept as fulfilled, or from the <hi>Reatus Gulpae in ſe,</hi> but by Chriſt's whole Righteouſneſs from the <hi>Reatus ut ad paenam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. But if this be his ſenſe, he meaneth then that it is only the <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> that <hi>Juſtification</hi> is properly denominated from. And why ſo? 1. As
<hi>Juſtitia</hi> and <hi>Juſtificatio paſſive ſumpta, vel ut effectus,</hi>
is <hi>Relatio,</hi> it hath neceſſarily no <hi>Terminus à quo</hi>;
And certainly is <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> to be rather denominated from its own proper <hi>Terminus ad quem.</hi> And as
<hi>Juſtification</hi> is taken for the Juſtifiers <hi>Action</hi>; why is it not as well to be denominated from the <hi>Terminus ad quem, as à quo? Juſtificatio efficiens ſic dicitur,
quia Juſtum facit: Juſtificatio apologetica, quia Juſtum vindicat vel probat. Juſtificatio per ſententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
quia Juſtum aliquem eſſe Judicat: Juſtificatio executiva, quia ut Juſtum eum tractat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if we muſt needs denominate from the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus à quo,</hi> how ſtrange is it that he ſhould know but of <hi>one</hi> ſenſe of <hi>Juſtification?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. But yet perhaps he meaneth, [<hi>In ſatisfactione Legi praeſtitâ,</hi> though he ſay <hi>praeſtandâ,</hi> and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominateth from the <hi>Terminus à quo:</hi> But if ſo,
1. Then it cannot be true: For <hi>ſatisfacere &amp; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificare</hi>
are not the ſame thing, nor is <hi>Juſtifying giving Satisfaction</hi>; nor were we juſtified when Chriſt had ſatisfied, but long after: Nor are we juſtified <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe Chriſt ſatisfied, (that is, immediately) but becauſe he gave us that <hi>Jus ad impunitatem &amp; vitam &amp; ſpiritum ſanctum,</hi> which is the <hi>Fruit</hi> of his Satisfaction. 2. And as is ſaid,
if it be only <hi>in ſatisfactione,</hi> then it is not in that
<hi>Obedience which fulfileth</hi> the preceptive part as it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45239:85"/>
bound us: for to ſatisfie for not fulfilling, is not to fulfil it. 3. And then no Man is juſtified, for no Man hath ſatisfied either the Preceptive or Penal Obligation of the Law, by himſelf or another:
But Chriſt hath ſatisfied the Law-giver by Merit and Sacrifice for ſin.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Liberavit nos à Lege Mortis,</hi> I before ſhewed impertinent to his uſe, Is <hi>Liberare &amp; Juſtificare,</hi> or <hi>Satisfacere</hi> all one?

There be other Acts of <hi>Liberation</hi> beſides <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> For it is [<hi>The Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life</hi>] that doth it: And we are freed both from the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>indwelling-ſin,</hi> (called a Law) and from the Moſaical Yoak, and from the Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Conditions of the Law of Innocency, though not from its bare Obligation to future Duty.</p>
                     <p>§. 7. He addeth a Third, <hi>Ex parte Medii, quod eſt Juſtitia Chriſti Legalis nobis per fidem Imputata: Omnem itaque Juſtificationem proprie Legalem eſſe conſtat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When I read that he will have but one ſenſe or ſort of Juſtification, will yet have the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to be <hi>ex termino,</hi> and ſo juſtifieth my diſtinction of it, according to the various <hi>Termini</hi>; And here how he maketh the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be but the <hi>MEDI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M</hi> of our Juſtification, (though he ſhould have told us which ſort of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> he meaneth) he ſeemeth to me a very favourable conſenting Adverſary: And I doubt thoſe Divines who maintain that Chriſt's Rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>teouſneſs is the <hi>Cauſa Formalis</hi> of our Juſtification, (who are no ſmall ones, nor a few, though other in anſwer to the Papiſts diſclaim it) yea, and thoſe that make it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45239:86"/>
but <hi>Cauſa Materialis,</hi> (which may have a ſound ſenſe) will think this Learned Man betrayeth their Cauſe by prevarication, and ſeemeth to ſet fiercly againſt me, that he may yeeld up the Cauſe with leſs ſuſpicion. But the truth is, we all know but in part, and therefore err in part, and Error is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it ſelf. And as we have conflicting Fleſh and Spirit in the <hi>Will,</hi> ſo have we conflicting <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Fleſh</hi> in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; And it is very perceptible throughout this Author's Book, that in one line the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Darkness</hi> ſaith one thing, and in the next oft the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> ſaith the contrary, and ſeeth not the inconſiſtency: And ſo though the <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>fleſhy</hi> part riſe up in wrathful ſtriving Zeal againſt the Concord and Peace of Chriſtians, on pretence that other Mens Errors wrong the Truth, yet I doubt not but Love and Unity have ſome intereſt in his lucid and Spiritual part. We do not only grant him that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is a <hi>Medium</hi> of our Juſtification, (for ſo alſo is <hi>Faith</hi> a <hi>Condition,</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitio Receptiva</hi> being a <hi>Medium</hi>); nor only ſome <hi>Cauſe,</hi> (for ſo alſo is the <hi>Covenant-Donation</hi>); but that it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an <hi>efficient meritorious Cauſe,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if Righteouſneſs had been that of our own, <hi>Innocency</hi> would have been founded in <hi>Merit,</hi> we may call Chriſt's Righteouſneſs the <hi>material Cauſe</hi> of our Juſtification, remotely, as it is <hi>Materia Meriti,</hi> the Matter of the <hi>Merit</hi> which procureth it.</p>
                     <p>2. But for all this it followeth not that all Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is only <hi>Legal,</hi> as <hi>Legal</hi> noteth its reſpect to the Law of Innocency: For 1. we are juſtified from or againſt che Accuſation of being non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of the Condition of the Law of Grace;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45239:86"/>
2. And of being therefore unpardoned, and lyable to its ſorer Penalty. 3. Our particular ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Perſonal Righteouſneſs conſiſting in the ſaid performance of thoſe Evangelical Conditions of Life, is ſo denominated from its conformity to the Law of Grace, (as it inſtituteth its own Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
as the meaſure of it, (as <hi>Rectitudo ad Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi>).
4. Our <hi>Jus ad impunitatem &amp; vitam,</hi> reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the <hi>Donative</hi> Act of the Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, as the <hi>Titulus qui eſt Fundamentum Juris,</hi> or ſuppoſition of our Faith as the Condition.
5. This Law of Grace is the <hi>Norma Judicis,</hi> by which we ſhall be judged at the Laſt Day. 6. The
ſame Judg doth now <hi>per ſententiam conceptam</hi> judg of us, as he will then judg <hi>per ſententiam prola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</hi>
7. Therefore the Sentence being <hi>virtually</hi> in the Law, this ſame Law of Grace, which in <hi>primo inſtanti</hi> doth make <hi>us Righteous,</hi> (by <hi>Condonation</hi>
and <hi>Donation</hi> of Right) doth <hi>in ſecundo inſtanti,
virtually</hi> juſtifie us as containing that regulating uſe, by which we are to be ſententially juſtified.
And now judg Reader, whether no Juſtification be Evangelical, or by the Law of Grace, and ſo to be denominated: (for it is <hi>lis de nomine</hi> that is by him managed). 8. Beſides that the whole frame of Cauſes in the Work of Redemption, (the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
his Righteouſneſs, Merits, Sacrifice, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Act, Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are ſure rather to be called Matters of the Goſpel, than of the Law.</p>
                     <p>And yet we grant him eaſily; 1. That Chriſt perfectly fulfilled the Law of Innocency, and was juſtified thereby, and that we are juſtified by that Righteouſneſs of his, as the meritorious Cauſe.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45239:87"/>
2. That we being guilty of Sin and Death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of that Law, and that Guilt being remitted by Chriſt, as aforeſaid, we are therefore juſtified from that Law, (that is, from its Obligation of us to Innocency as the neceſſary terms of Life, and from its Obligation of us to Death, for want of Innocency): But we are not juſtified by that Law, either as fulfilled or as ſatisfied by <hi>us our ſelves,</hi> either perſonally or by an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſubſtitute or proper Repreſentative, that was <hi>Vicarius Obedientiae aut poenae.</hi> 3. And we grant that the Jews were delivered from the poſitive Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Law, which is it that <hi>Paul</hi> calleth, <hi>The Law of Works.</hi> And if he pleaſe, in all theſe reſpects to call <hi>Juſtification Legal,</hi> we intend not to quarrel with the name, (though what I called <hi>Legal</hi> in thoſe <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> I choſe ever after to call rather, <hi>Juſtitia pro-legalis</hi>). But we cannot believe him, 1. That it is <hi>only Legal</hi>; 2. Or that that is the <hi>only</hi> (or moſt) proper denomination.</p>
                     <p>§. 8. He proceedeth thus, [<hi>And it will be vain, if any argue, That yet none can be ſaved without Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Works, according to which it is confeſſed that all men ſhall be judged: for the diſtinction is eaſie (which the Author of the Aphoriſms ſomewhere uſeth) between the firſt or Private, and the laſt or Publick Juſtification.— In the firſt ſenſe it is never ſaid, That Works juſtifie, but contrary, That God juſtifieth him that worketh not,</hi> Rom. 4.5. <hi>In the latter we confeſs that Believers are to be juſtified according to Works, but yet not Of (or By) Works, nor that that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation maketh men juſt before God, but only ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is ſuch another <hi>Conſenting Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:45239:87"/>
as once before I was put to anſwer; who with open mouth calls himſelf conſequentially what he calleth me; if the ſame <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and not the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> make the Guilt. Nay let him conſider whether his <hi>grand</hi> and moſt <hi>formidable Weapon [So alſo ſaith</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>with other Papiſts</hi>] do not wound himſelf: For <hi>they</hi> commonly ſay, That <hi>the firſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> is not of <hi>Works,</hi> or <hi>Works</hi> do not firſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us. Have I not now proved that he <hi>erreth and complyeth with the Papiſts?</hi> If not, let him uſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Arguments himſelf.</p>
                     <p>2. But why is the firſt <hi>Juſtification</hi> called <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate?</hi>
Either he meaneth God's <hi>making us juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutively,</hi>
or his <hi>judging</hi> us ſo: and that <hi>per ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam conceptam</hi> only, or <hi>prolatam</hi> alſo.</p>
                     <p>1. The common diſtinction in Politicks, <hi>inter judicium Privatum &amp; Publicum,</hi> is fetcht from the
<hi>Judg,</hi> who is either <hi>Perſona privata vel publica:</hi> a
<hi>private</hi> Man, or an <hi>authorized Judg</hi> judging as
ſuch: And ſo the Judgment of Conſcience, Friends,
Enemies, Neighbours, mere Arbitrators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is
<hi>Judicium privatum</hi>; and that of a <hi>Judg in foro,</hi> is
<hi>Judicium publicum,</hi> (yea, or in ſecret, before the concerned Parties only in his Cloſet, ſo it be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive):
If this Learned Doctor ſo underſtand it,
then, 1. <hi>Conſtitutive Juſtification</hi> (which is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt) is publick Juſtification, being done by God the Father, and by our Redeemer, who ſure are not herein <hi>private</hi> authorized <hi>Perſons.</hi> 2. And the firſt <hi>ſentential Juſtification,</hi> as merely <hi>Virtual,</hi>
and not yet <hi>Actual,</hi> viz. as it's virtually in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Law of Grace as <hi>norma Judicis</hi> is <hi>publick in ſuo genere,</hi> being the <hi>virtus</hi> of a Publick Law of God, or of his Donative Promiſe. 3. And the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45239:88"/>
firſt <hi>Actual Juſtification, per Deum Judicem per
ſententiam conceptam</hi> (which is God's ſecret judging the Thing and Perſon to be as they are) is (ſecret indeed <hi>in ſe,</hi> yet revealed by God's publick Word but) publick as to the Judg. 4. And the firſt <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia prolata</hi> (the fourth in order) is ſomeway publick as oppoſite to ſecreſie, (for, 1. it is before the Angels of Heaven; 2. And in part by Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive demonſtrations on Earth): But it is certainly by a <hi>publick Judg,</hi> that is, God. 5. And the firſt
<hi>Apologetical Juſtification</hi> by Chriſt our <hi>Interceding Advocate,</hi> is publick both <hi>quoad perſonam,</hi> and as
<hi>openly</hi> done in Heaven: And if this worthy Perſon deny any Juſtification <hi>per ſententiam Judicis,</hi> upon our firſt Believing, or before the final Judgment,
he would wofully fall out with the far greateſt number of Proteſtants, and eſpecially his cloſeſt Friends, who uſe to make <hi>a Sentence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as Judg to be the <hi>Genus</hi> to Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>But if by [<hi>Private</hi> and <hi>Publick Juſtification</hi>]; he means [<hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>open</hi>]. 1. How can he hope to be underſtood when he will uſe Political Terms unexplained, out of the uſual ſenſe of Politicians: But no men uſe to <hi>abuſe words</hi> more than they that would keep the Church in flames by <hi>wordy Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,</hi> as if they were of the terms of Life and Death. 2. And even in that ſenſe our firſt Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is <hi>publick</hi> or open, <hi>quoad Actum Juſtifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantis,</hi> as being by the Donation of a publick Word of God; Though <hi>quoad effectum in recipiente,</hi> it muſt needs be ſecret till the Day of Judgment, no Man knowing anothers Heart, whether he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſound Believer: And ſo of the reſt as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:45239:88"/>Concerning, what I have ſaid before, ſome may Object, 1. <hi>That there is no ſuch thing as our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation notified before the Angels in Heaven.</hi> 2. <hi>That the</hi> Sententia Concepta <hi>is God's Immanent Acts, and therefore Eternal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt, I ſay, 1. It is certain by <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.10. that the Angels know of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Sinner, and therefore of his Juſtification and publickly Rejoyce therein. Therefore it is noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to them. 2. But I refer the Reader for this, to what I have ſaid to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in my <hi>Diſputation of Juſtification,</hi> where I do give my thoughts, That this is not the Juſtification by Faith meant by <hi>Paul,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> aſſerteth it to be.</p>
                     <p>To the Second, I ſay, Too many have abuſed Theology, by the miſconceiving of the diſtinction of <hi>Immanent</hi> and <hi>Tranſient Acts</hi> of God, taking all for <hi>Immanent</hi> which effect nothing <hi>ad extra.</hi> But none are properly <hi>Immanent quoad Objectum,</hi> but ſuch as God himſelf is the <hi>Object</hi> of, (as <hi>ſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligere, ſe amare</hi>): An Act may be called indeed immanent in any of theſe three reſpects; 1. <hi>Ex parte Agentis</hi>; 2. <hi>Ex parte Objecti</hi>; 3. <hi>Ex parte effectus.</hi> 1. <hi>Ex parte agentis,</hi> all God's Acts are <hi>Immanent,</hi> for they are his Eſſence. 2. <hi>Ex parte Objecti vel Termini,</hi> God's Judging a Man Juſt or Unjuſt, Good or Bad, is tranſient; becauſe it is denominated from the ſtate of the <hi>Terminus</hi> or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: And ſo it may be <hi>various</hi> and <hi>mutable</hi> deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively, notwithſtanding God's <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Immutability.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Sententia Concepta</hi> is not <hi>ab Aeterno.</hi> 3. As to the <hi>Effect,</hi> all confeſs God's Acts to be Tranſient and Temporary. But there are ſome that <hi>effect</hi> not (as to judg a thing to be what it is).</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:45239:89"/>3. Either this Militant Diſputer would have his Reader believe that I ſay, That a <hi>Man is juſtified by Works,</hi> in that which he called [<hi>making juſt,</hi> and the <hi>firſt Juſtification</hi>], or not: If he would, ſuch
<hi>untruth</hi> and <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> (contrary to the full drift of many of my Books, and even that which he ſelected to oppoſe) is not a congruous way of diſputing for <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> nor indeed is it tolerably ingenuous or modeſt. If not,
then why doth he all along carry his profeſſed agreement with me, in a militant ſtrain, perſwading his Reader, that I ſavour of Socinianiſm or Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or ſome dangerous Error, by ſaying the very
ſame that he ſaith. O what thanks doth God's Church owe ſuch contentious Diſputers for ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Orthodoxneſs, that like <hi>noctambuli,</hi> will riſe in their ſleep, and cry, Fire, Fire, or beat an Allarm on their Drums, and cry out, <hi>The Enemy,
The Enemy,</hi> and will not let their Neighbours reſt!</p>
                     <p>I have wearied my Readers with ſo oft repeating in my Writings (upon ſuch repeated importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others) theſe following Aſſertions about Works.</p>
                     <p>1. That we are never juſtified, firſt or laſt, by Works of <hi>Innocency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Nor by the <hi>Works</hi> of the Jewiſh Law (which
<hi>Paul</hi> pleadeth againſt).</p>
                     <p>3. Nor by any Works of Merit, in point of Commutative Juſtice, or of <hi>diſtributive</hi> Governing Juſtice, according to either of thoſe Laws (of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,</hi>
or <hi>Jewiſh</hi>).</p>
                     <p>4. Nor by any Works or Acts of Man, which are ſet againſt or inſtead of the leaſt part of God's

Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt's Merits, or any of his part or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>5. Nor are we at firſt juſtified by any <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Works of Love, Gratitude or Obedience to Chriſt,</hi>
as <hi>Works</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from our firſt <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Repentance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Nor are we juſtified by <hi>Repentance,</hi> as by an

ſignifieth our change from <hi>

ſo is <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>7. Nor are we juſtified by <hi>Faith</hi> as by a mere Act,
or moral good Work.</p>
                     <p>8. Nor yet as by a proper efficient Inſtrument of our Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>9. Much leſs by ſuch <hi>Works</hi> of Charity to Men,
as are without true love to God.</p>
                     <p>10. And leaſt of all, by Popiſh bad Works, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Good,</hi> (as Pilgrimages, hurtful Auſterities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>But if any Church-troubling Men will firſt call <hi>all Acts</hi> of Man's Soul by the name of WORKS, and next will call no Act by the name of <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> but the <hi>belief of the Promiſe</hi> (as ſome) or the <hi>accepting</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs given</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us,</hi> as <hi>in ſe,</hi> our own (as others) or [the <hi>Recumbency on this Righteouſneſs</hi>] (as others) or all theſe three <hi>Acts</hi> (as others); and if next they will ſay that this <hi>Faith juſtifieth</hi> us only as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe</hi>; And next that to look for Juſtification by any other Act of Man's Soul, or by this Faith in any other reſpect, is to truſt to that Juſtification by <hi>Works,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> confuteth, and to fall from Grace, I do deteſt ſuch corrupting and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45239:90"/>
abuſing of the Scriptures, and the Church of Chriſt. And I aſſert as followeth;</p>
                     <p>1. That the Faith which we are juſtified by, doth as eſſentially contain our belief of the Truth of Chriſt's Perſon, Office, Death, Reſurrection, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as of the Promiſe of Imputation.</p>
                     <p>2. And alſo our conſent to Chriſt's Teaching,

                     <p>3. And our <hi>Acceptance</hi> of Pardon, Spirit, and promiſed Glory, as well as Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>4. Yea, that it is eſſentially a Faith in God the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>5. That it hath in it eſſentially ſomewhat of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Love to God, to Chriſt, to Recovery, to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
that is, of Volition; and ſo of Deſire.</p>
                     <p>6. That it containeth all that Faith, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily requiſite at Baptiſm to that Covenant; even a <hi>conſenting-practical-belief</hi> in God the <hi>Father, Son,</hi>
and <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and <hi>is</hi> our Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>7. That we are juſtified by this <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is
[<hi>A moral Act of Man, adapted to its proper Office,
made by our Redeemer, the Condition of his Gift of Juſtification, and ſo is the moral receptive aptitude of the Subject,</hi> or the <hi>Diſpoſitio materiae vel ſubjecti Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipientis</hi>]:

of its Intereſt in our Juſtification is [<hi>Conditio praeſtita</hi>] ſpeaking <hi>politically,</hi> and [<hi>Aptitudo vel Diſpoſitio moralis Receptiva</hi>] ſpeaking logically;
which Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſtill calleth <hi>Cauſa diſpoſitiva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. That Repentance as it is a change of the Mind from Unbelief to Faith, (in God the Father,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45239:90"/>
Son; and Holy Ghoſt) is this Faith denominated from its <hi>Terminus à quo</hi> (principally).</p>
                     <p>9. That we are continually juſtified by this Faith as continued, as well as initially juſtified by its firſt Act.</p>
                     <p>10. That as this <hi>Faith</hi> includeth a <hi>conſent</hi> to <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Obedience,</hi> (that is, Subjection) ſo the <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>
of that <hi>conſent</hi> in <hi>ſincere Obedience,</hi> is the Condition of our Juſtification as continued (Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily)
as well as Faith (or conſent it ſelf) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily:
And that thus <hi>James</hi> meaneth, that we are Juſtified by Works.</p>
                     <p>11. That God judging of all things truly as they are, now judgeth Men juſt or unjuſt, on theſe Terms.</p>
                     <p>12. And his Law being <hi>Norma judicii,</hi> now <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi>
judgeth us juſt on theſe terms.</p>
                     <p>13. And that the Law of Grace being that which we are to be judged by, we ſhall at the laſt Judgment alſo be judged (and ſo juſtified) thus far by or according to our ſincere Love, Obedience,
or Evangelical Works, as the Condition of the Law or Covenant of free Grace, which juſtifieth and glorifieth freely all that are thus Evangelically qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
by and for the Merits, perfect Righteouſneſs and Sacrifice of Chriſt, which procured the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or free Gift of Univerſal Conditional Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Adoption, before and without any Works or Conditions done by Man whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Reader, Forgive me this troubleſom oft repeating the ſtate of the Controverſie; I meddle with no other. If this be Juſtification by Works, I am for it. If this Doctor be againſt it, he is againſt much
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45239:91"/>
of the Goſpel. If he be not, he had better have kept his Bed, than to have call'd us to Arms in his Dream, when we have ſadly warred ſo many Ages already about mere words. For my part, I think that ſuch a ſhort explication of our ſenſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of ambiguities, is fitter to end theſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, than the long diſputations of Confounders.</p>
                     <p>4. But when be ſaith, [<hi>Works make not a Man juſt, and yet we are at laſt juſtified according to them</hi>], it is a contradiction, or unſound. For if he mean <hi>Works</hi> in the ſence excluded by <hi>Paul,</hi> we are not juſtified <hi>according to them, viz.</hi> ſuch as make,
or are thought to make the <hi>Reward to be not of Grace,</hi> but <hi>of Debt:</hi> But if he take <hi>Works</hi> in the
ſenſe intended by <hi>James, ſincere Obedience</hi> is a <hi>ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary conſtitutive part</hi> of that <hi>inherent or adherent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Righteouſneſs, required by the Law of Grace, in
ſubordination to Chriſt's Meritorious Righteouſneſs</hi>;
And what Chriſtian can deny this? So far it <hi>maketh</hi>
us <hi>Righteous,</hi> (as <hi>Faith</hi> doth <hi>initially</hi>). And what is it to be <hi>juſtified according to our Works,</hi> but to be judged, ſo far as they are ſincerely done, to be ſuch as have performed the ſecondary part of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of free-given Life?</p>
                     <p>5. His [<hi>According</hi>] but not [<hi>ex operibus</hi>] at the Laſt Judgment, is but a Logomachie [<hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>]
ſignifieth as much as I aſſert: But [<hi>ex</hi>]
is no unapt Prepoſition, when it is but the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate part of Righteouſneſs and Juſtification, of which we ſpeak, and ſignifieth (with me) the ſame as [<hi>According</hi>].</p>
                     <p>6. His Tropical Phraſe, that [<hi>Works pronouce us juſt</hi>] is another ambiguity: That the Judg
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45239:91"/>
will <hi>pronounce us juſt according to them, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
ſecond part of the Conſtitutive Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi>
of our <hi>Subordinate Righteouſneſs,</hi> is certain from
<hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and the ſcope of Scripture: But that they are only <hi>notifying Signs,</hi> and no part of the
<hi>Cauſe</hi> of the day to be tryed, is not true, (which too many aſſert).</p>
                     <p>§. 9. He proceedeth, [<hi>If there be an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juſtification at God's Bar, diſtinct from the legal one, there will then alſo be in each an abſolution of divers ſins: For if the Goſpel forgive the ſame ſins as the Law, the ſame thing will be done, and a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Juſtification will be unprofitable and idle. If from divers ſins, then the Law forbids not the ſame things as the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's pitty ſuch things ſhould need any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                     <p>1. It's a falſe Suppoſition, That <hi>all Juſtification</hi>
is <hi>Abſolution from ſin:</hi> To juſtifie the ſincerity of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> is one act or part of our Juſtification, againſt all (poſſible or actual) falſe Accuſation.</p>
                     <p>2. The Law of Innocency commanded not the Believing Acceptance of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Pardon, and ſo the Remnants of that Law in the hand of Chriſt (which is the Precept of perfect Obedience <hi>de futuro</hi>) commandeth it only conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
ſuppoſing the Goſpel-Promiſe and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have gone before, and ſelected this as the terms of Life; ſo that as a <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>genere</hi> (exiſtent only <hi>in ſpeciebus</hi>) commandeth Obedience, and the Law of Innocency <hi>in ſpecie</hi> commanded [<hi>perſonal
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45239:92"/>
perfect perpetual Obedience, as the Condition of Life</hi>];
ſo the Goſpel commandeth <hi>Faith</hi> in our <hi>Redeemer,</hi>
as the new Condition of Life: on which ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
even the Law of lapſed Nature further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us thereto: And as the Commands differ, ſo do the Prohibitions.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain ſort of ſin excepted from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by the pardoning Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Final non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of its Conditions: And to judg a Man not guilty of this ſin, is part of our Juſtification, as is aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>§. 10. He addeth, [<hi>If Legal and Evangelical Juſtification are ſpecie diſtinct, then ſo are the Courts in which we are juſtified.— If diſtinct and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſo he that is juſtified by the law, is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No Man is juſtified by the Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency or Works, but Chriſt: Did I ever ſay that, [<hi>That Law juſtifieth us</hi>], who have voluminouſly wrote againſt it? If he would have his Reader think ſo, his unrighteouſneſs is ſuch as civility for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids me to give its proper Epithets to. If not, againſt what or whom is all this arguing?</p>
                     <p>2. I call it [Legal] as it is that perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt our Surety, conform to the Law of Innocency; by which he was juſtified (though not abſolved and pardoned): I call it [<hi>pro Legalis juſtitia</hi>], becauſe that Law doth not juſtifie us for it (but Chriſt only) but by it given us <hi>ad effecta</hi>
by the New-Covenant; we are ſaved and juſtified from the Curſe of that Law, or from Damnation,
is certainly as if we had done it our ſelves: I call
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45239:92"/>
Faith our Evangelical Righteouſneſs, on the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons too oft mentioned. Now theſe may be called
<hi>Two Juſtifications,</hi> or (rather) <hi>two parts of one,</hi>
in ſeveral reſpects, as pleaſeth the Speaker. And all ſuch Word-Souldiers ſhall have their liberty without my Contradiction.</p>
                     <p>3. And when will he prove that theſe two Sorts,
or Parts, or Acts, may not be at once tranſacted at the ſame Bar? Muſt there needs be <hi>one Court</hi> to try <hi>whether I am a true Believer,</hi> or an <hi>Infidel,</hi> or
<hi>Hypocrite</hi>; and <hi>another</hi> to judg that <hi>being ſuch,</hi> I am to be juſtified againſt all Guilt and Curſe, by vertue of Chriſt's Merits and Interceſſion? Why may not theſe two parts of <hi>one Man's Cauſe</hi> be judged at the ſame Bar? And why muſt your Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils be taught ſo to conceive of ſo great a buſineſs, in it ſelf ſo plain?</p>
                     <p>§. 11. He proceedeth, [<hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of this Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſtification is made to be, that we may be made partakers of the Legal Juſtification out of us, in Chriſt: And ſo our Juſtification applyeth another Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and our Remiſſion of ſins another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No Sir; but our <hi>particular ſubordinate ſort of Righteouſneſs,</hi> conſiſting in the performance of the Conditions of the free Gift, (<hi>viz.</hi> a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuitable <hi>Acceptance</hi>) is really our <hi>Diſpoſitio receptiva,</hi> being the Condition of our Title to that <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> which for Chriſt's Righteouſneſs if freely given us. And our <hi>perſonal Faith and Sincerity</hi> muſt be juſtified, and we <hi>in tantum,</hi> before our Right to Chriſt, Pardon and Life can be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in foro.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:45239:93"/>2. And to juſtifie us as ſincere Believers, when others are condemned as Hypocrites, and Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and Impenitent, is not Pardon of Sin. Theſe Matters ſhould have been put into your (excellent)
Catechiſm, and not made ſtrange, much leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and oppoſed, when laying by the quarrels about mere words, I am confident you deny none of this.</p>
                     <p>§. 12. He addeth, [<hi>Then Legal Juſtification is nothing but a bare word, ſeeing unapplyed; as to the Matter it is nothing, as it is not called Healing by a Medicine not applyed; nor was it ever heard that one Healing did apply another</hi>].</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Alas, alas, for the poor Church, if this be the Academies beſt! ſorrow muſt excuſe my Complaint! If it be an Argument it muſt run thus: If <hi>Legal</hi> (or <hi>pro-legal) Righteouſneſs</hi> (that is, our part in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs) be none to us (or none of our Juſtification) when not-apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than it is none alſo when it is applyed: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is none till applyed: Chriſt's Merits, or Legal Righteouſneſs juſtifie himſelf, but not us till applyed: (Do you think otherwiſe, or do you wrangle againſt your ſelf?) But I deny your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: How prove you that it is <hi>none when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed therefore?</hi> Or the Cure is none when the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is applyed?</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you'l ſay, That <hi>then</hi> our <hi>Perſonal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſubordinate Juſtification,</hi> is ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and ſo the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on, and followeth the leſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:45239:93"/>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt's own Righteouſneſs is before ours. 2. His Condition, Pardon to fallen Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is before ours. 3. This Gift being Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, excepteth the non-performance of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And the nature of a Condition, is to <hi>ſuſpend the effect of the Donation</hi> till <hi>performed.</hi> 4. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the performance goeth before the ſaid Effect, and our Title. 5. But it is not therefore any <hi>cauſe</hi> of it, but a <hi>removal</hi> of the <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi>; nor hath the Donation any other dependance on it. And is not all this beyond denial with Perſons not ſtudiouſly and learnedly miſled?</p>
                     <p>But you ſay, <hi>It was never heard that one Healing applyed another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And ſee you not that this is a <hi>lis de nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> and of a name of your own introduction for illuſtration? If we were playing at a Game of Tropes, I could tell you that the <hi>Healing</hi> of Mens <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> is applicatory for the <hi>healing</hi> of their <hi>Guilt</hi>; And the healing of Men's Ignorance, Pride, and Wrangling about words, and frightning Men into a Conceit that it is about Life and Death, is applicatory as to the healing of the Churches Wounds and Shame. But I rather chuſe to ask you, Whether it was never heard that a <hi>particular ſubordinate perſonal Righteouſness</hi> (even <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi>) was made by God the Condition of our Right to Pardon, and Life by Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? Did you never teach your Sholars this, (in what words you thought beſt?) And yet even our Faith is a Fruit of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; but nevertheleſs the Condition of other Fruits.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay that our <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Performance</hi> is not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45239:94"/>
to be called <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> I refer you to my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>; And if the word <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> be not ofter (ten to one) uſed in Scripture for ſomewhat Perſonal, than for Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs imputed, then think that you have ſaid ſomething.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay, <hi>But it juſtifieth not as a Righteouſneſs, but as an Inſtrument.</hi> I Anſwer, 1. I have ſaid elſewhere ſo much of its Inſtrumentality, that I am aſhamed to repeat it. 2. It <hi>juſtifieth</hi> not at all, (for that ſignifieth <hi>efficiency</hi>); but only maketh us capable Recipients. 3. <hi>We are juſtified by it</hi> as a <hi>medium,</hi> and that is a Condition performed (as aforeſaid): And when that Condition by a Law is made both a <hi>Duty</hi> and a <hi>Condition</hi> of Life, the performance is by neceſſary reſultancy [a <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>]. But we are not juſtified by it, as it is a <hi>Righteouſneſs in genere</hi>; nor as a mere moral Virtue or Obedience to the Law of Nature; but as it is <hi>the performance of the Condition of the Law of Grace</hi>; and ſo as it is <hi>this particular Righteouſneſs,</hi> and no other.</p>
                     <p>§. 13. [<hi>In Legal Juſtification</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken preciſely, either there is Remiſſion of ſin, or not: If not, What Juſtification is that? If yea, then Evangelical Juſtification is not neceſſary to the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it; becauſe the Application is ſuppoſed,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What I uſually call [Evangelical Righteouſneſs] he ſuppoſeth me to call <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; which yet is true, and ſound, but ſuch as is before explained.</p>

not only whether we received Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
but whether by Faith we received Chriſt in all the Eſſentials of his Office, and to all the eſſential ſaving Uſes: Yea, whether according to the ſenſe of the Baptiſmal Covenant, we firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly

received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gave up our ſelves to God the

ſincerely that Covenant.</p>
                     <p>3. But let me defend the Word of God: Faith is imputed for Righteouſneſs, even <hi>this Faith now deſcribed</hi>; 1. <hi>Remotely, ex materiae aptitudine,</hi> for its fitneſs to its formal Office; And that fitneſs is,
1. Becauſe it is an <hi>Act of Obedience to God,</hi> or <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good,</hi> (for a <hi>bad</hi> or <hi>indifferent Act</hi> doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie).
2. More ſpecially as it is the <hi>receiving,
truſting,</hi> and <hi>giving</hi> up <hi>our ſelves</hi> to God the <hi>Father,</hi>
Son, and Holy Ghoſt, to the proper ends of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
or a ſuitable Reception of the freely offered Gift; and ſo connoteth Chriſt the Object
(for the Object is eſſential to the Act <hi>in ſpecie</hi>).
2. But proximately <hi>Faith</hi> is ſo <hi>reputed,</hi> or imputed,
as it is the <hi>performance</hi> of the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Covenant or Donation.</p>
                     <p>And to be <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> includeth, That [<hi>It is the part required of us by the Law of Grace, to make us partakers of the Benefits of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which meriteth Salvation for us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a legal and perfect Righteouſneſs of our own,</hi> (which we have not). Or, [<hi>Whereas we fell ſhort of a Righteouſneſs of Innocency, Chriſt by ſuch a Righteouſneſs hath merited our Pardon and Salvation, and given title to them by a New Covenant of Grace, which maketh this Faith the Condition of our Title; and if we do this, we ſhall be judged evangelically Righteous; that is, ſuch as have done all that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their right in Chriſt and the ſaid Benefits; and therefore have ſuch a Right</hi>].</p>

                     <p>§. 2. The conciliatory Propoſitions which I laid down in an Epiſtle to Mr. <hi>W. Allens</hi> Book, I will here tranſcribe, that the Reader may ſee what it is that theſe Militant Doctors war againſt.</p>

                        <hi>Leſt any who know not how to ſtop in mediocrity,</hi> ſhould be tempted by Socinians or Papiſts, to think that we countenance any of their Errors, or that our Differences in the point of Juſtification by Faith or Works, are greater than indeed they are; and leſt any weak Opinionative Perſons, ſhould clamour unpeaceably againſt their Brethren, and think to raiſe a name to themſelves for their differing Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I ſhall here give the Reader ſuch evidences of our real Concord, as ſhall ſilence that Calumny.</p>
                     <p>Though ſome few Lutherans did, upon peeviſh ſuſpiciouſneſs againſt <hi>George Major</hi> long ago, aſſert, That [Good Works are not neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on]: And though ſome few good Men, whoſe Zeal without Judgment doth better ſerve their own turn than the Churches, are jealous, leſt all the good that is aſcribed to Man, be a diſhonour to God; and therefore ſpeak as if God were honoured moſt by ſaying the worſt words of our ſelves; and many have uncomely and irregular Notions about theſe Matters: And though ſome that are addicted to ſidings, do take it to be their Godly Zeal to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and reproach the more underſtanding ſort, when they moſt groſly err themſelves: And though too many of the People are carried about through injudiciouſneſs and temptations to falſe Doctrines and evil Lives; yet is the Argument of Proteſtants thus manifeſted.</p>
                     <p>1. They all affirm that Chriſt's Sacrifice, with his Holineſs and perfect Obedience, are the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe of the forgiving Covenants, and of our Pardon and Juſtification thereby, and of our Right to Life Eternal, which it giveth us. And that this Price was not paid or given in it ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45239:100"/>
to us, but to God for us; and ſo, that our foreſaid Benefits are its Effects.</p>
                     <p>2. They agree that Chriſt's Perſon and ours were not really the ſame; and therefore that the ſame Righteouſneſs, which is an Accident of one, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be an Accident of the other.</p>
                     <p>3. They all deteſt the Conceit, that God ſhould aver, and repute a Man to have done that which he never did.</p>
                     <p>4. They all agree that Chriſt's Sacrifice and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are really ſo effectual to procure our Pardon,
Juſtification, Adoption, and right to the ſealing Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and to Glory, upon our Faith and Repentance; that God giveth us all theſe benefits of the New-Covenant as certainly for the
ſake of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, as if we had
ſatisfied him, and merited them our ſelves: and that thus far Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is ours in its Effects, and imputed to us, in that we are thus uſed for it, and ſhall be judged accordingly.</p>
                     <p>5. They all agree, that we are juſtified by none,
but a practical or working Faith.</p>
                     <p>6. And that this Faith is the Condition of the Promiſe, or Gift of Juſtification and Adoption.</p>
                     <p>7. And that Repentance is a Condition alſo,
though (as it is not the ſame with Faith, as Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Unbelief is) on another aptitudinal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
even as a willingneſs to be cured, and a willingneſs to take one for my Phyſician, and to truſt him in the uſe of his Remedies, are on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral accounts the Conditions on which that Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will undertake the Cure, or as willingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to ſubjection and thankful acceptance of a purchaſed Pardon, and of the Purchaſers Love and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45239:100"/>
future Authority, are the Conditions of a Rebel's Pardon.</p>
                     <p>8. And they all agree, that in the firſt inſtant of a Man's Converſion or Believing, he is entred into a ſtate of Juſtification, before he hath done any outward Works: and that ſo it is true, that good Works follow the Juſtified, and go not before his initial Juſtification: as alſo in the ſenſe that <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſpake it, who took Juſtification, for that which we call Sanctification or Converſion.</p>
                     <p>9. And they all agree, that Juſtifying Faith is
ſuch a receiving affiance, as is both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipateth of ſome kind of Love to the juſtifying Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as well as to Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>10. And that no Man can chuſe or uſe Chriſt as a Means (ſo called, in reſpect to his own intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to bring him to God the Father, who hath not
ſo much love to God, as to take him for his end in the uſe of that means.</p>
                     <p>11. And they agree, that we ſhall be all judged according to our Works, by the Rule of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, though not for our Works, by way of commutative, or legal proper merit. And Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the Genus, whoſe Species is Juſtifying and Condemning: and to be judged according to our Works, is nothing but to be juſtified or condemned according to them.</p>
                     <p>12. They all agree, that no Man can poſſibly merit of God in point of Commutative Juſtice, nor yet in point of Diſtributive or Governing Juſtice,
according to the Law of Nature or Innocency, as
<hi>Adam</hi> might have done, nor by the Works of the Moſaical Law.</p>

                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:45239:101"/>13. They all agree, that no Works of Mans are to be truſted in, or pleaded, but all excluded, and the Conceit of them abhorred.</p>
                     <p>1. As they are feigned to be againſt, or inſtead of the free Mercy of God.</p>
                     <p>2. As they are againſt, or feigned, inſtead of the Sacrifice, Obedience, Merit, or Interceſſion of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>3. Or as ſuppoſed to be done of our ſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>4. Or as ſuppoſed falſly to be perfect.</p>
                     <p>5. Or as ſuppoſed to have any of the afore-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Merit.</p>
                     <p>6. Or as materially conſiſting in Moſaical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</p>
                     <p>7. Much more in any ſuperſtitious Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>8. Or in any Evil miſtaken to be Good.</p>
                     <p>9. Or as any way inconſiſtent with the Tenor of the freely pardoning Covenant. In all theſe ſenſes Juſtification by Works is diſclaimed by all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants at leaſt.</p>
                     <p>14. Yet all agree, that we are created to good Works in Chriſt Jeſus, which God hath ordained,
that we ſhould walk therein; and that he, that nameth the Name of Chriſt, muſt depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
or elſe he hath not the Seal of God; and that he that is born of God ſinneth not; that is,
predominantly. And that all Chriſt's Members are Holy, Purified, zealous of Good Works, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that they might perfect Holineſs in God's fear,
doing good to all Men, as loving their Neighbours as themſelves; and that if any Man have not the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45239:101"/>
Sanctifying Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, nor without Holineſs can ſee God.</p>
                     <p>15. They all judg reverently and charitably of the Ancients, that uſed the word [Merit of Good Works], becauſe they meant but a moral aptitude for the promiſed Reward, according to the Law of Grace through Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>16. They confeſs the thing thus deſcribed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
however they like not the name of Merit,
leſt it ſhould countenance proud and carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>
                     <p>17. They judg no Man to be Heretical for the bare uſe of that word, who agreeth with them in the ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>18. In this ſenſe they agree, that our Goſpel-Obedience is ſuch a neceſſary aptitude to our Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
as that Glory (though a free Gift) is yet truly a reward of this Obedience.</p>
                     <p>19. And they agree, that our final Juſtification by Sentence at the Day of Judgment doth paſs upon the ſame Cauſes, Reaſons, and Conditions, as our Glorification doth.</p>
                     <p>20. They all agree, that all faithful Miniſters muſt bend the labour of their Miniſtry in publick and private, for promoting of Holineſs and good Works, and that they muſt difference by Diſcipline between the Obedient and the Diſobedient. And O! that the Papiſts would as zealouſly promote Holineſs and good Works in the World, as the true
ſerious Proteſtants do, whom they factiouſly and peeviſhly accuſe as Enemies to them; and that the Opinion, Diſputing, and name of good Works,
did not cheat many wicked Perſons into ſelf-flattery and Perdition, while they are void of that which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45239:102"/>
they diſpute for. Then would not the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Heathens be deterred from Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the wickedneſs of theſe nominal Chriſtians,
that are near them: nor would the ſerious practice of that Chriſtianity, which themſelves in general profeſs, be hated, ſcorned, and perſecuted by ſo many, both Proteſtants and Papiſts; nor would ſo many contend that they are of the True Religion,
while they are really of no Religion at all any further, than the Hypocrites Picture and Carcaſs may be called Religion: Were Men but reſolved to be ſerious Learners, ſerious Lovers, ſerious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſers according to their knowledg, and did not live like mockers of God, and ſuch as look toward the Life to come in jeſt, or unbelief, God would vouchſafe them better acquaintance with the True Religion than moſt Men have.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. One would think now that this ſhould meet with no ſharp Oppoſition, from any Learned lover of Peace; and that it ſhould anſwer for it ſelf, and need no defence. But this Learned Man for all that, among the reſt of his Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, muſt here find ſome Matter for a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
                     <p>And 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. he aſſaulteth the third Propoſ. [<hi>They all deteſt the Conceit, that God ſhould aver, and repute a Man to have done that which he never did</hi>].</p>
                     <p>And is not this true? Do any ſober Men deny it, and charge God with Error or Untruth? Will not this Man of Truth and Peace, give us leave to be thus far agreed, when we are ſo indeed?</p>

I ſubſcribe to his words, [<hi>It is God s Righteouſneſs; ſeeing it is not of Works (for in them it were neceſſary that there be found no blot) but of Grace, which blotteth out and extinguiſheth all ſin: And this begetteth us a double benefit, for it ſuffereth us not to be lift up in mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is all the Gift of God, and it ſheweth the greatneſs of the benefit</hi>]. This is as apt an Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my Judgment of <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> as I could chuſe. But it's given to ſome Men to extol that in one Man, which they fervently revile in others. How frequently is <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> by many accuſed as favouring Free-Will, and Man's Merits, and ſmelling of Pelagianiſm?

And he oft tells us, It is <hi>Faith it ſelf,</hi> and not only Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in, that is imputed for Righteouſneſs, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth: And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 80. he calleth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, [the <hi>Retribution of Faith</hi>].

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45239:103"/>
Phraſe of Man's inventing: But if indeed you mean any more than I by your <hi>ſenſus forenſis, viz.</hi> that ſuch a <hi>ſuffering</hi> and <hi>meriting</hi> for us may, in the lax improper way of ſome Lawyers ſpeaking, be called, [<hi>Our own Doing, Meriting, Suffering,</hi> &amp;c.] I have proved, that the Doctrine denied by me, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Reader, I remember what <hi>Grotius</hi> (then Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, thirty years before his Death) in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Letter of Church-Orders, Predeſtination, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, and Magiſtrates, animadverting on <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> ſaith, <hi>How great an injury thoſe Divines, who turn the Chriſtian Doctrine into unintelligible Notions and Controverſies, do to Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; becauſe it is the duty of Magiſtrates to diſcern and preſerve neceſſary ſound Doctrine, which theſe Men would make them unable to diſcern.</hi> The ſame I muſt ſay of their injury to all Chriſtians, becauſe all ſhould hold faſt that which is proved True and Good, which this ſort of Men would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to diſcern. We juſtly blame the Papiſts for locking up the Scripture, and performing their Worſhip in an unknown Tongue. And alas, what abundance of well-meaning Divines do the ſame thing by undigeſted Terms and Notions, and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Diſtinctions, not adapted to the Matter, but cuſtomarily uſed from ſome Perſons reverenced by them that led the way? It is ſo in their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, both of Theology and other Sciences; and the great and uſeful Rule, <hi>Verba Rebus aptanda ſunt,</hi> is laid aſide: or rather, Men that underſtand not Matter, are like enough to be little skilful in the expreſſing of it: And as Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> ſaith, A cloudy unintelligible ſtile, uſually ſignifieth a clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45239:104"/>
unintelligent Head, (to that ſenſe): And as Mr. <hi>J. Humfrey</hi> tells Dr. <hi>Fullwood,</hi> (in his unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable late Plea for the Conformiſts againſt the charge of Schiſm) <hi>pag.</hi> 29. [<hi>So overly are men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily wont to ſpeak at the firſt ſight, againſt that which others have long thought upon</hi>]; that ſome Men think, that the very jingle of a diſtinction not underſtood is warrant enough for their reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Doctrine as dangerous and unſound, which hath coſt another perhaps twenty times as many hard ſtudies, as the Reproachers ever beſtowed on that Subject.</p>
                     <p>To deliver thee from thoſe Learned Obſcurities, read but the Scripture impartially, without their Spectacles and ill-deviſed Notions, and all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification that is neceſſary, will be plain to thee: And I will venture again to fly ſo far from flattering thoſe, called Learned Men, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, as to profeſs that I am perſwaded the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of honeſt unlearned Chriſtians, (even Plowmen and Women) do better underſtand the Doctrine of Juſtification, than many great Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will ſuffer themſelves or others to underſtand it, by reaſon of their foreſtalling ill-made Notions: theſe unlearned Perſons commonly conceive, 1. That Chriſt in his own Perſon, as a Mediator, did by his perfect Righteouſneſs and Sufferings, merit for us the free pardon of all our ſins, and the Gift of his Spirit and Life Eternal, and hath promiſed Pardon to all that are Penitent Believers, and Heaven to all that ſo continue, and ſincerely obey him to the end; and that all our after-failings, as well as our former ſins, are freely pardoned by the Sacrifice, Merits, and Interceſſion of Chriſt, who alſo giveth
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45239:104"/>
us his Grace for the performance of his impoſed Conditions, and will judg us, as we have or have not performed them]. Believe but this plain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and you have a righter underſtanding of Juſtification, than many would let you quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, who tell you, [That Faith is not imputed for Righteouſneſs; that it juſtifieth you only as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Cauſe, and only as it is the reception of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and that no other Act of Faith is juſtifying, and that God eſteemeth us to have been perfectly Holy and Righteous, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all the Law, and died for our own ſins, in or by Chriſt, and that he was politically the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of every Believing Sinner]; with more ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>And as to this diſtinction which this Doctor will make a Teſt of the Orthodox, (that is, Men of of his Size and Judgment) you need but this plain explication of it.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>In Law-ſenſe, a Man is truly and fitly ſaid himſelf to have done that, which the Law or his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract alloweth him to do either by himſelf or another</hi>;
(as to do an Office, or pay a Debt by a Subſtitute or Vicar). For ſo I do it by my Inſtrument, and the Law is fulfilled and not broken by me, becauſe I was at liberty which way to do it. In this ſenſe I deny that we ever fulfilled all the Law by Chriſt;
and that ſo to hold ſubverts all Religion as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Hereſie.</p>
                     <p>2. But in a tropical improper ſenſe, he may be
ſaid to [<hi>be eſteemed of God to have done what Chriſt did; who ſhall have the benefits of Pardon, Grace,
and Glory thereby merited, in the manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure given by the free Mediator, as certainly as if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45239:105"/>
had done it himſelf</hi>]. In this improper ſenſe we agree to the <hi>Matter,</hi> but are ſorry that improper words ſhould be uſed as a ſnare againſt ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and the Churches Love and Concord. And yet muſt we not be allowed <hi>Peace?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 4. But my free Speech here maketh me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how ſharply the Doctor expounded and applyed one word in the retracted Aphoriſms: I ſaid (not of the <hi>Men,</hi> but of the <hi>wrong Opinion</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by me) [<hi>It fondly ſuppoſeth a Medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one that is juſt, and one that is no ſinner] one that hath his ſin or guilt taken away, and one that hath his unrighteouſneſs taken away: It's true in bruits and inſenſibles that are not ſubjects capable of Juſtice,</hi> there is, <hi>&amp;c.

                        </hi> injuſtum, <hi>where Righteouſneſs is not due. But when there is the</hi> debitum habendi, <hi>its privative.</hi> The Doctor learnedly tranſlateth firſt the word [<hi>fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>] by [<hi>ſtolide</hi>]; and next he (<hi>fondly,</hi> though not <hi>ſtolidè</hi>) would perſwade the Reader, that it is ſaid of the <hi>Men,</hi> though himſelf tranſlate it [<hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina</hi>].</p>
                     <p>And next he bloweth his Trumpet to the War, with this exclamation, [<hi>Stolide! O vocis mollitiem, &amp; modeſtiam!

                     <p>2. The <hi>Stolidi Theologi</hi> then is his own phraſe!
And in my Opinion, another Mans Pen might better have called the Men of his own Opinion [<hi>Eccleſiae Reformatae clariſſimos Heroas</hi>] compared with others!
I take <hi>Gataker, Bradſhaw, Wotton, Camero,</hi> and his followers; <hi>

                     <p>§. 5. But I muſt tell him whether I abhor the Scripture Phraſe, [<hi>We are dead, buried, and riſen with Chriſt</hi>].</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, No; nor will I abhor to ſay, That <hi>in ſenſu forenſi, I am one political Perſon with Chriſt,</hi> and am <hi>perfectly holy</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> by and <hi>in him,</hi> and died and redeemed my ſelf by him, when he ſhall prove them to be Scripture Phraſes: But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader not to be ſo <hi>fond,</hi> (pardon the word) as by this bare queſtion to be enticed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it is any of the meaning of thoſe Texts that uſe that Phraſe which he mentioneth, that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45239:106"/>
[<hi>Legally,</hi> or <hi>in ſenſu forenſi, every Believer is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to have</hi> himſelf perſonally <hi>died a violent death on the Cross, and to have been buried, and to have riſen again,</hi> and aſcended into Heaven, nor yet to be now there in Glory, becauſe Chriſt did and doth all this in our very Legal Perſon. Let him but 1. conſider the Text, 2. and Expoſitors, 3. and the Analogy of Faith, and he will find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>we ſo live by Faith on a dying, buried, riſen and glorified Saviour, as that as ſuch he dwelleth objectively in our Hearts, and we partake ſo of the Fruits of his Death, Burial, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Glory, as that we follow him in a Holy Communion, being dead and buried to the World and Sin, and riſen to newneſs of Life, believing that by his Power we ſhall perſonally, after our death and burial, riſe alſo unto Glory.</hi> I will confeſs that we are perfectly <hi>holy and obedient by and in Chriſt,</hi> as far as we are now <hi>dead, buried,</hi> and <hi>riſen</hi> in him.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. And here I will ſo far look back, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, That he (as ſome others) confidently telleth us, That [<hi>the Law bound us both to perfect Obedience, and to puniſhment for our ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pardon by our own ſuffering in Chriſt, may ſtand with the reputation, that we were perfectly Obedient and Righteous in Chriſt.</hi>]</p>

I ask him,</p>
                     <p>1. Was not Chriſt as our Mediator perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habitually, and actually, without Original or Actual Sin?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="195" facs="tcp:45239:106"/>2. If all this be reputed to be <hi>in ſe,</hi> our own as
<hi>ſubjected in</hi> and <hi>done</hi> by <hi>our ſelves political,</hi> or <hi>in
ſenſu forenſi</hi>; Are we not then reputed <hi>in foro,</hi> to have no original or actual ſin, but to have inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently fulfilled all the Law, from the firſt hour of our lives to the laſt? Are we reputed <hi>innocent</hi> in Chriſt, as to <hi>one</hi> part only of our lives, (if ſo,
which is it?) or as to all?</p>
                     <p>3. If as to all, is it not a <hi>contradiction</hi> that in Law-ſenſe, we are reputed perfectly Holy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and yet ſinners.</p>
                     <p>4. And can he have need of Sacrifice or Pardon,
that is reputed never to have ſinned (legally)?</p>
                     <p>5. If he will ſay that in Law-ſenſe, we have or are <hi>two Perſons,</hi> let him expound the word <hi>Perſons</hi>
only, as of <hi>Qualities</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> (nothing to our Caſe in hand); or elſe ſay alſo, That as we are holy and perfect in one of our own Perſons, and
<hi>ſinful, unrighteous,</hi> or <hi>ungodly</hi> in another, ſo a Man my be in Heaven in one of his own Perſons, and on Earth, yea and in Hell in the other: And if he mean that the ſame Man is <hi>juſtified</hi> in his Perſon in Chriſt, and condemned in his other Perſon; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which of theſe is the <hi>Phyſical</hi> Perſon, for I think its that which is like to ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>§. 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 224. He hath another touch at my Epiſtle, but gently forbeareth contradiction as to <hi>Num.</hi> 8. And he ſaith ſo little to the 11<hi>th,</hi> as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no anſwer.</p>

                     <p>And what hath he againſt this? Why that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45239:107"/>
which taketh up many pages of his Book, and ſeemeth his chief ſtrength in moſt of his Conteſt, <hi>viz. [The Papiſts ſay the ſame</hi>] and [ſo ſaith <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>]. It's ſtrange that the ſame kind of Men that deride <hi>Fanatick Sectaries,</hi> for crying out in Church-Controverſies, [O <hi>Antichriſtian Popery, Bellarmine,</hi> &amp;c.] ſhould be of the ſame Spirit, and take the ſame courſe in greater Matters, and not perceive it, nor acknowledg their agreement with them! But as Mr. <hi>J.

If not, is this Doctor more to be blamed for making them <hi>better than</hi> they are, or for making <hi>us worſe?</hi> which ever it be, <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould defend <hi>Truth.</hi> If they do, I heartily rejoyce, and it ſhall be none of my labour any more (whatever I did in my <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi>) to prove that they do not. Let who will manage ſuch ungrateful Work. For my part, I take it for a better Character of any Opinion, that Papiſts and Proteſtants agree in it, than that the Proteſtants hold it alone. And ſo much for [<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi>] though I think I know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what they teach, than his Book will truly tell me.</p>
                     <p>§. 9. But he addeth, [<hi>Humane Juſtifying Works are in reality adverſe to the free Mercy of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be accounted of no value to Righteouſneſs</hi>].</p>

                     <p>2. Doth not the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſay, That a <hi>Man</hi> is
<hi>juſtified by Works,</hi> and <hi>not by Faith only?</hi> Jam. 2.</p>
                     <p>3. Doth not Chriſt ſay, <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Do not I over and over tell the World, That I hold Juſtification by Works in no ſenſe, but as
ſignifying the ſame as [<hi>According to Works</hi>] which you own? And ſo both <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Thing</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by you to be Scriptural.</p>
                     <p>5. I have before deſired the Reader to turn to the words, [<hi>Righteous, Righteouſneſs, Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

ſay if he dare, that they are to <hi>be had in no price to Righteouſneſs:</hi> Or let him read the Texts cited by me in my <hi>Confeſſion of Faith.</hi>

                     <p>Reader, I proved that the generality of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are agreed in all thoſe twenty Particulars, even in all the material Doctrines about Man's Works and Juſtification, while this warlike Doctor

The more the better, I am glad if it be ſo, and will here end with ſo welcome a Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that maketh us all herein to be Friends: only adding, That when he ſaith that [<hi>ſuch are all Works whatever,</hi> (even Faith it ſelf) <hi>which are called into the very leaſt part of Juſtification</hi>]; even as a <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſubordinate perſonal Evangelical Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> ſuch as Chriſt and <hi>James,</hi> and a hundred Texts of Scripture aſſert; I anſwer, I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, till I ceaſe believing the Scriptures to be true; which I hope will never be: And am ſorry that ſo worthy a Man can believe ſo groſs an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, upon no better reaſons than he giveth: And yet imagine, that had I the opportunity of free conference with him, I could force him to manifeſt, That he himſelf differeth from us but in meer words or ſecond Notions, while he hotly proclaimeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> greater diſcord.</p>

                        <p>§. 1. Between twenty and thirty years ago, I did in a private Diſputation prove our guilt of the ſins of our nearer Parents; and becauſe many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45239:110"/>
doubted of it, I have oft ſince in other writings mentioned it: About three years ago, having two Books of Mr. <hi>William Allens</hi> in my hand to peruſe, in order to a Publication, (a <hi>Perſwaſive to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and a <hi>Treatiſe of the Two Covenants</hi>); in a Preface to the latter, I ſaid, [<hi>That moſt Writers, if not moſt Chriſtians, do greatly darken the Sacred Doctrine, by overlooking the Intereſt of Children in the Actions of their nearer Parents, and think that they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of no guilt, and ſuffer for no original ſin, but</hi> Adam'<hi>s only,</hi> &amp;c.] You faſtened on this, and <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeriouſly the Juniors, not raſhly to believe one that brings forth ſuch Paradoxes of his</hi> (or <hi>that</hi>) <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> which you added to your [<hi>O caecos ante Theologos quicunque unquam fuiſtis</hi>]: The charge was expreſſed by [<hi>aliud inveniſſe peccatum Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale, multo citerius quam quod ab</hi> Adamo <hi>traductum eſt</hi>]. Hereupon I thought it enough to publiſh that old private Diſputation, which many before had ſeen with various Cenſures: Now you ſend me in your Letter the ſtrange tidings of the ſucceſs: You that deterred your <hi>Juniors</hi> by ſo frighful a warning, ſeem now not only to <hi>agree with me,</hi> that we <hi>are guilty of our nearer Parents ſin,</hi> and contract addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional pravity from them as ſuch, (which was my Aſſertion) but over-do all others, and Truth it ſelf in your Agreement! Now you take it for an injury to be reported to think otherwiſe herein than I do: yea, and add, [<hi>Which neither I, nor any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe I know of, denies as to the thing, though in the extent, and other circumſtances, all are not agreed, and you may in that enjoy your Opinion for me</hi>]. This is too kind: I am loth to tell you how many
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45239:111"/>
that I know, and have read, deny it, leſt I tempt you to repent of your Agreement.</p>
                        <p>But doth the World yet need a fuller evidence, that ſome Men are <hi>de materiâ</hi> agreed with them, whom they raiſe the Country againſt by their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and Suſpicions?</p>
                        <p>But ſurely what paſſion or ſpatling ſoever it hath occaſioned from you, I reckon that my labour is not loſt: I may tell your <hi>Juniors,</hi> that I have ſped ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary well, when I have procured the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed conſent of ſuch a Doctor. Either you were of this mind <hi>before</hi> or <hi>not</hi>: If not, it's well you are brought to confeſs the Truth, though not to confeſs a former Error. If yea, then it's well that ſo loud and wide a ſeeming diſagreement is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be none, that your Juniors may take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not be frightned from Love and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord by every melancholy Allarm.</p>
                        <p>Yea, you declare your conformity to the Litany, [<hi>Remember not our Offences, nor the Offences, of our Fore fathers</hi>], and many words of indignation you uſe for my queſtioning it. All this I like very well as to the Cauſe; And I matter it not much how it looks at me: If you <hi>agree</hi> more <hi>angrily</hi> than others diſagree, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> hath ſome advantage by the Agreement. Though me-thinks it argueth ſomewhat unuſual, that ſeeming Diſſenters ſhould cloſe by ſo vehement a Colliſion.</p>
                        <p>But yet you <hi>will not agree</hi> when you <hi>cannot chuſe but agree,</hi> and you carry it ſtill as if your Allarm had not been given without cauſe: Muſt we <hi>agree,</hi> and not <hi>agree?</hi> What yet is the Matter? Why it is [<hi>a new original ſin</hi>]. My ordinary expreſſions of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45239:111"/>
it may be fully ſeen in the Diſputation: The phraſe you laid hold on in a Preface is cited before, [<hi>That we participate of no guilt, and ſuffer for no original ſin but</hi> Adam'<hi>s only</hi>], I denied. And what's the dangerous <hi>Errour</hi> here? That our <hi>nearer Parents</hi> ſin was <hi>Adams,</hi> I may preſume that you hold not. That we are <hi>guilty</hi> of ſuch, you <hi>deny not:</hi> That <hi>it is ſin,</hi> I find you not denying: ſure then all the difference muſt be in the word [ORIGINAL].</p>
                        <p>And if ſo, you that ſo hardly believe your loud-noiſed diſagreements to be but <hi>verbal,</hi> muſt pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently give me leave here to try it. Is it any more than the <hi>Name</hi> ORIGINAL that you are ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly offended at? Sure it is not: Elſe in this Letter purpoſely written about it, you would have told your <hi>Reader what it is.</hi> Suffer me then to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon your Allarm'd Juniors to come and ſee what a <hi>Spectrum</hi> it is that muſt affright them; and what a Poppet-Play or dreaming War it is, that the Church is to be engaged in, as if it were a matter of Life and Death? <hi>Audite juvenes!</hi> I took the word [ORIGINAL] in this buſineſs to have ſeveral ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications. Firſt, That is called [<hi>ORIGINAL] Sin,</hi> which was the <hi>ORIGO</hi> of all other ſins in the Humane World: And that was not <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>ſin,</hi> but <hi>Eves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. That which was the <hi>ORIGO</hi> of ſin to all the World, ſave <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> communicated by the way of Generation: And that was <hi>Adams</hi> and
<hi>Eves</hi> conjunct, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Their firſt ſinful Acts;
2. Their Guilt; 3. And their habitual pravity
(making it full, though in Nature following the Act). This Sin, Fact, Guilt, and Habit, as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45239:112"/>
of the Perſons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> are not Accidents of our Perſons.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Our perſonal participation</hi>; 1. <hi>In the guilt</hi> of the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>; 2. And of a vicious
<hi>privation</hi> and <hi>habit</hi> from them, as ſoon as we are Perſons. Which is called <hi>Original</hi> ſin, on three accounts conjunct; 1. Becauſe it is a participation of their <hi>Original Act</hi> that we are guilty of; 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in us <hi>ab Origine,</hi> from our <hi>firſt Being</hi>;
3. And becauſe it is the <hi>Origo</hi> of all our <hi>Actual Sins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. I call that alſo [ORIGINAL] (or <hi>part of Original Sin</hi>) which hath but the two later only;
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. Which is in us <hi>AB ORIGINE,</hi> from our firſt perſonal being; 2. Which is the <hi>Root</hi> or
<hi>ORIGO</hi> in our ſelves of all our <hi>Actual Sins:</hi> And thus our <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> derived from our <hi>nearer Parents,</hi> and not from <hi>Adam,</hi> is our <hi>Original Sin</hi>;
That is, 1. Both <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Habit</hi> are in us from our <hi>Original,</hi> or firſt Being; 2. And all our Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sin ſpringeth from it as a partial Cauſe: For I may preſume that this Reverend Doctor doth not hold that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin derived to us is in one <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> (which is not partible) and our nearer
<hi>Parent</hi>'s in another; but will grant that it is <hi>one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſity</hi>
that is derived from both, the latter being a Degree added to the former; though the <hi>Reatus</hi>
having more than <hi>one fundamentum,</hi> may be called
<hi>diverſe.</hi> That <hi>Origo &amp; Active &amp; paſſive dicitur,</hi>
I ſuppoſe we are agreed. Now I call the <hi>vicious Habits</hi> contracted from our nearer Parents by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reaſon of <hi>their own ſins,</hi> ſuperadded to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
which elſe we ſhould have derived from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45239:112"/>
                           <hi>Adam,</hi> a <hi>part</hi> of our <hi>original ſinful Pravity,</hi> even a ſecondary part. And I call our <hi>guilt</hi> of the ſins of our <hi>nearer Parents</hi> (not <hi>Adam</hi>'s) which you will, either a <hi>ſecondary Original Guilt,</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> or a ſecondary <hi>part</hi> of our <hi>Original Guilt.</hi> See then our dangerous diſagreement: I call that ORIGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL,
which is in us <hi>ab Origine,</hi> when we are firſt Perſons, and is partly the Root or <hi>Origo</hi> in us of all our following Actual Sin: though it was not the
<hi>Original Sin</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> or the firſt of Sins. The Doctor thinks this an Expreſſion, which all <hi>Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi>
muſt be warned to take heed of, and to take heed of the Doctrine of him that uſeth it. The Allarm is againſt this dangerous word [<hi>ORIGINAL</hi>].
And let a Man awake tell us what is the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>But I would bring him yet to agreement even <hi>de nomine,</hi> though it anger him. 1. Let him read the <hi>Artic.</hi> 9. <hi>of the Church of England,</hi> and ſeeing there <hi>Original Sin</hi> is ſaid to be that <hi>corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whereby we are far gone from Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>are of our own Nature inclined to evil, ſo that the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit. The luſt of the fleſh called <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, which ſome do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Wiſdom, ſome Senſuality, ſome the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome the deſire of the Fleſh, not ſubject to the Law of God]:</hi> Seing a degree of all this ſame Luſt is in Men from the ſpecial ſins of their Fore-fathers, as well as from <hi>Adam</hi>'s; Is not this Degree here called <hi>Original Sin?</hi> (why the Church omitted the <hi>Imputed Guilt</hi> aforeſaid, I enquire not).</p>
                        <p>2. If this will not ſerve, if he will find me any Text of Scripture, which uſeth the Phraſe, [<hi>ORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINAL Sin</hi>], I will promiſe him hereafter to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45239:113"/>
uſe it in no other ſenſe, than the Scripture uſeth it.</p>
                        <p>3. If that will not ſerve, if the Maſters of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage will agree, (yea, to paſs by our <hi>Lexicons,</hi>
if the Doctors of that Univerſity will give it us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their hands) that the word [ORIGINAL]
is unaptly and dangerouſly applyed to that ſinful
<hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Pravity</hi> which is in us <hi>ab Origine Noſtrae exiſtentiae,</hi> and is the internal <hi>Radix vel Origo</hi> of all our Actual Sin, in part of Cauſality, I will uſe that Epithete ſo no more.</p>
                        <p>4. If all this will not ſerve, if he himſelf will give me a <hi>fitter Epithete,</hi> I will uſe it: And now we <hi>over-agree</hi> in Doctrine, a word ſhall not divide us, unleſs he will be angry becauſe we are agreed,
as <hi>Jonas</hi> was that the <hi>Ninivites</hi> were ſpared, becauſe it ſeemed to diſgrace his Word.</p>
                        <p>§. II. <hi>pag.</hi> 4, 5, &amp;c. You invite me to, [<hi>a full entire retractation of my Doctrine of Juſtification</hi> (you add, <hi>By Works</hi>) and the <hi>ſecondary Original Sin</hi>].</p>
                        <p>1. Will you take it well if I retract that which you profeſs now to hold, and know none that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth,
then there is no pleaſing you: If I muſt be thought to wrong you for ſeeming to differ from you, and yet muſt retract all: What, yours and all Mens?</p>
                        <p>2. Do you mean the <hi>words</hi> or the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
(as you call it) <hi>by Works?</hi> For the words, I take you for a ſubſcriber to the 39 <hi>Articles</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that you reject not the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James:</hi>
And for the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> I confeſs it is a motion ſuitable to the Intereſt of your <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> (though not of the Truth): He that cannot confute the Truth,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45239:113"/>
would more eaſily do his Work, if he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Defenders of it to an <hi>Entire Retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Hereupon, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. you recite my words, of the difficulty of bringing ſome Militant Divines to yield: Your Admonition for Self-Application of them is uſeful, and I thank you for it: But is it not a ſtreight that ſuch as I am in, between two contrary ſorts of Accuſers? When Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi>
and Multitudes on that ſide, Reproach me daily for <hi>Retractations,</hi> and <hi>you</hi> for want of them? How natural is it now to Mankind, to deſire to be the Oracles of the World, and that all ſhould be <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,</hi>
or <hi>Retracted,</hi> which is againſt their Minds?
How many call on me for Retractation? Mr.
<hi>Tombes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> for what I have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for Infants-Baptiſm: The <hi>Papiſts</hi> for what I have Written againſt them: And how many more?
And as to what I <hi>have Retracted, One</hi> reproached me for it, and another either knoweth not of it, or perſwadeth others that it is not done.</p>
                        <p>You ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 6. [<hi>A great out-cry you have made of me, as charging you with things you have Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi>— And pag. 7. <hi>What's the reaſon you have not hitherto directed us to the particulars of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation; what, when, where?— You direct one indeed, to a ſmall Book, above Twenty years a-go retracted.— All I can pick up of any ſeeming Retractation,</hi> is that you ſay, <hi>that Works are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at leaſt to the continuation of our Juſtification.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Either this is Written by <hi>a Wilful,</hi> or a <hi>Heedleſs</hi> miſtaking of my words. The firſt I will not ſuſpect; it muſt therefore be the ſecond, (for I muſt not judg you <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nable</hi> to underſtand plain Engliſh). And is it any wonder if you have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45239:114"/>
many ſuch Miſtakes in your diſputes of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when you are ſo <hi>heedleſs</hi> about a matter of Fact? Where did I ever ſay, that I had <hi>Recanted?</hi> Or that I <hi>Retracted</hi> any of the Doctrine of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which I had laid down? Cannot you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between <hi>Suſpending,</hi> or <hi>Revoking,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting</hi> a <hi>particular Book,</hi> for the ſake of ſeveral <hi>Crude and Incongruous</hi> Expreſſions, and Retracting or Recanting <hi>that Doctrine of Juſtification?</hi> Or can you not underſtand words, that plainly thus Diſtinguiſh? Why talk you of <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>where,</hi> and conjecture at the <hi>words,</hi> as if you would make the Reader believe, that indeed it is ſome confeſſed Errors of mine, which you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed? and that I take it for an Injury, becauſe I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Retracted them? And ſo you think you ſalve your Confutation, whatever you do by your Candour and Juſtice: But you have not ſo much as Fig-leaves for either. It was the <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> or <hi>Book,</hi> that I ſaid was above Twenty years a go Revoked: When in my Treatiſe of Infant-Baptiſm, I had craved Animadverſions on it, and promiſed a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Edition, if I Publiſhed it any more; I forbad the Reprinting it, till I had time to Correct it; and when many called for it, I ſtill deny'd them. And when the <hi>Cambridg</hi> Printer Printed it a ſecond time, he did it by Stealth, pretending it was done beyond Sea. In my <hi>Confeſſion</hi> Twenty years ago, I gave the Reaſons, <hi>Preface, pag.</hi> 35. [<hi>I find that there are ſome Incautelous Paſſages in my Aphoriſms, not fitted to their Reading, that come to ſuck Poyſon, and ſeek for a Word to be Matter of Accuſation and Food for their Cenſuring opinionative Zeal.</hi>— And pag. 42. <hi>If any Brother underſtand not any word in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45239:114"/>
my Aphoriſms which is here Interpreted, or miſtake my ſenſe about the Matter of that Book, which is here more fully opened; I muſt expect, that they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret that by this. And if any one have ſo little to do as to write againſt that Book (which is not unlikely) if he take the Senſe contrary to what I have here and elſe-where ſince then Publiſhed, I ſhall but neglect him as a Contentious, Vain Wrangler, if not a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator</hi>]. I Wrote this ſharply, to forwarn the Contentious, not knowing then that above Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after, Dr. <hi>Tully</hi> would be the Man. Pag. 43. [<hi>If any will needs take any thing in this Book to be rather a Retractation, than an Explication, of what I have before ſaid, though I ſhould beſt know my own Meaning; yet do ſuch commend me, while they ſeem to blame me: I never look to write that which ſhall have no need of Correction.</hi>— And Cap. 1. pag. 2. [<hi>Leſt I ſhould prove a further Offence to my Brethren, and a Wrong to the Church, I deſired thoſe who thought it worth their Labour, to vouchſafe me their Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, which I have ſpent much of theſe Three laſt years in conſidering, that I might Correct what-ever was diſcovered to be Erroneous, and give them an account of my Reaſons of the reſt. I have not only ſince S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PPRESSED that Book which did offend them, but alſo laid by thoſe Papers of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which I had written, leſt I ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offenſive,</hi> &amp;c.] In my Apologie elſe-where I have ſuch-like Paſſages, ever telling Men that [<hi>It was the firſt Book I wrote in my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexperienced Youth; that I take the Doctrines of it to be ſound and needful, ſave that in divers places they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully and incautelouſly worded.</hi> (As the Word [<hi>Covenant</hi>] is oft put for [<hi>Law,</hi>] &amp;c.) And that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45239:115"/>
I wrote my <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Diſputes</hi> of <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as an Expoſition of it; and that I <hi>Retracted,</hi> or <hi>Suſpended,</hi> or <hi>Revoked,</hi> not the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but the <hi>Book,</hi> till I had Corrected it, and did diſown it as too unmeet an Expreſſion of my Mind, which I had more fully expreſt in other <hi>Books.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And is not this plain Engliſh? Doth this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> Man, to intimate that I accuſe him of writing againſt that Doctrine of Juſtification which I <hi>Recanted,</hi> and to call for the <hi>What,</hi> and <hi>Where,</hi> and <hi>When?</hi> Yea, and tell me, that I [<hi>refer you to a ſmall Book</hi>] when inſtead of <hi>referring</hi> you to it, I only blame you for referring to that alone, when I had ſaid as before?</p>
                        <p>When many Divines have publiſhed the firſt Edition of their Works imperfectly, and greatly corrected and enlarged them in a Second (as <hi>Beza</hi> his <hi>Annotations, Polanus</hi> his <hi>Syntagma,</hi> and many ſuch) all Men take it for an Injury for a Neighbour twenty years after, to ſelect the firſt Edition to confute as the Author's Judgment: Much more might I, when I publiſhed to the World, that I <hi>Suſpended the whole Book,</hi> and <hi>have theſe twenty</hi> four years hindred the Printing of it; profeſſing that I have in many larger Books, more intelligibly and fully opened the ſame things.</p>
                        <p>Yea, you fear not <hi>pag.</hi> 23. to ſay, That I tell you of <hi>about</hi> 60 <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Retractations,</hi> in <hi>part at leaſt which I have Written</hi>]; when never ſuch a word fell from me. If I ſay, That one that hath publiſhed his <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of a <hi>ſmall Book</hi> written in <hi>Youth,</hi> not for the <hi>Doctrine of it,</hi> but <hi>ſome unfit</hi> Expreſſions, and hath ſince in al-moſt thirty Years time, written about ſixty Books, in many or

moſt of which is ſomewhat of the ſame Subject, and in ſome of them he fullier openeth his Mind; ſhould be dealt with by an Adverſary, according to ſome of his later and larger Explications, and not according to the Mode and Wording of that one Suſpended Book alone: Shall ſuch a Man as you ſay, that I <hi>[tel you of about ſixty Books of Retractations]?</hi> Or will it not abate Mens reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your diſputing Accurateneſs, to find you ſo untruſty in the Recitation of a Man's words? The truth is, it is this great Defect of <hi>Heed</hi> and <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs,</hi> by haſty Temerity, which alſo ſpoileth your Diſputations.</p>
                        <p>But, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. the Aphoriſms muſt be, [<hi>The moſt Schollar-like, and Elaborate (though Erroneous) Book in Controverſie, you ever Compoſed</hi>]. Anſw. 1. Your Memory is faulty: Why ſay you in the next, that I <hi>appeal</hi> to my Diſputation of Juſtification and <hi>ſome others; but you cannot Trudg up and down, to every place I would ſend you, your Legs are too weak?</hi> Either you had read all the ſixty Books which you mention (the Controverſal at leaſt) or not: If <hi>not,</hi> How can you tell that the Aphoriſms is the moſt <hi>Elaborate</hi>?

Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Kendale,</hi> indeed differed from you; the latter ſeeking (by Biſhop <hi>

(And if any of us all grow no Wiſer in thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years Study, we may be aſhamed). But to give you your due Honour, I will name you with your Equals, as far as I can judg, <hi>viz.

(if I may preſume to liken my Betters) no Men ſeem to me to have been ſo like you, as <hi>Guilielmus Rivet,</hi> (not <hi>Andrew</hi>), Mr. <hi>George Walker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Roborough.</hi> (I hope this Company is no Diſhonour to you).

                        <p>2. Yet I am very confident, that all they whom you mention, are of the ſame in ſome thing or other; and in particular, that we are <hi>Juſtified by Faith, and not by the Works of the Law, or any Works in the ſence denied by St.</hi> Paul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Do not I, with as great Confidence as you,
lay Claim to the ſame Company and Concord? And if one of us be miſtaken, muſt your bare Word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine which it is? Which of us hath brought the fuller Proofs?

as much Evidence, that I am loth to ſubſcribe to what I believe not, as yours doth of you. And you that know which of my Books is the moſt Elaborate, ſure know, that in that Book which I Wrote to explain thoſe Aphoriſms (called my
<hi>Confeſſion</hi>) I cite the Words of <hi>above an Hundred Proteſtant Witneſſes,</hi> that give as much to <hi>Works</hi> as I do: And that of this Hundred, one is the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
Confeſſion, one the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Synod, one the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> one the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
each one of which being Collectives, contain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
(And here I tell you of more). And have you brought <hi>more</hi> Witneſſes? Or <hi>any</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
Did you <hi>Confute,</hi> or once <hi>take Notice</hi> of any of theſe?</p>
                        <p>4. Do you not here before you are aware, let your Reader know that it was, and ſtill is, in the Dark, that you Alarm the World about our <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Differences,</hi> and run to your Arms undreſt,
before your Eyes are open? <hi>Qui conveniunt in ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo tertio,</hi> &amp;c. They that agree with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, do ſo far agree between themſelves: But Dr.

<hi>Ergo.</hi>— The Article referreth to the Homilies,

                        <p>5. May not I then retort your Argument, and bid you [<hi>For ſhame let it be no longer</hi> Bellarnine, <hi>and</hi>

Alas! How few? In all <hi>London,</hi> not a Man hath yet given me Notice of his Diſlike, or Diſſent. And ſure your <hi>own Pen</hi> is a good Confuter of you.

                        <p>You tell me, that <hi>You Charged me only with new Original Sin, underived from</hi> Adam, <hi>unknown, unheard of before, in the Chriſtian World.</hi>

Tell the World if you can, when I called it [<hi>New Original Sin, or underived from</hi> Adam, <hi>or unknown, or unheard of</hi>]. There are more ways than one of Derivation from <hi>Adam.</hi> It is not derived from him by ſuch <hi>Imputation</hi> as his firſt Sin; but it is derived from him as a <hi>partial Cauſa Cauſae,</hi> by many Gradations. All Sin is ſome-way from him. Either you mean that <hi>I ſaid, that it was not Derived from</hi> Adam, or you gather it by ſome Conſequence from what I ſaid. If the Firſt, ſhew the Words, and the Shame ſhall be mine. If not, you know the old Law, that to falſe Accuſers, it muſt be done as they would have done to the Accuſed. But if it be your <hi>Conſequence,</hi> prove it, and tell the World, what are the Premiſes that infer it.</p>
                        <p>§. VI. <hi>Pag.</hi> 12. You friendly help me to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by my ſelf,</hi> however you profeſs that <hi>you profit not</hi> by me! What I have ſaid to you againſt [<hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Judging</hi>], I have firſt ſaid to my ſelf, and the more you warn me of it, the more friendly you are: If it be not againſt ſuch as you but <hi>my ſelf,</hi> it is againſt my ſelf that I have a Treatiſe on that Subject; but I begin to think my ſelf in this more <hi>Seeing</hi> than you; for I <hi>ſee it both in my ſelf and you,</hi> and <hi>you</hi> ſeem to ſee it in <hi>me,</hi> and <hi>not in

Or rather, firſt, rub your Eyes, and tell us what is the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie? Tully</hi> ſometimes talkt at this rate in his Orations, but verily much better in his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
                        <p>And you ſee no cauſe to repent, but you <hi>bleſs God that you can again and again call to all Youth, that as they love the Knowledg of Truth, they take me not for an Oracle in my bold dividing Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi>].</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Name of <hi>Truth</hi> is thus abuſed, is no News; I would the Name of God were not: And I am ſorry, that <hi>you ſee no Cauſe to repent.</hi> I am obliged to love you the better, for being

                        <p>Will you ceaſe theſe empty general Oſtentations, and chooſe out any one Point of real<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Difference between you and me about Juſtification, and come to a fair Trial, on whoſe ſide the Churches of Chriſt have been for 1500 years after Chriſt; yea, bring me but any two or one conſiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that was for a thouſand years for your Cauſe againſt mine, and I will ſay, that you have done more to confute me by far, than yet you have done; and if <hi>two only</hi> be againſt me, I will pardon you for calling me Singular.</p>
                        <p>§. VII. <hi>Pag.</hi> 13, 14, 15. You again do keep up the <hi>Dividing Fear,</hi> are offended that I perſwade you, that by <hi>Melancholy Phantaſms you ſet not the Churches together by the Ears, and make People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they differ, where they do not:</hi> And you ask, <hi>Who began the Fray?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Do you mean that I began with <hi>you?</hi> You do not ſure: But is it that I <hi>began with the Churches,</hi> and you were <hi>neceſſitated to defend</hi> them? Yes, if <hi>Gallus, Ambſdorfius, Schluſſelburgius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Criſpe,</hi> and his Followers, be the Church? But, Sir, I provoke you to try it by the juſt Teſtimony of Antiquity, <hi>who began to differ from the Churches.</hi>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:45239:119"/>
In this Treatiſe I have given you ſome Account, and <hi>Voſſius</hi> hath given you more. which you can never anſwer: But if my Doctrine put you upon this Neceſſity, what hindred you from perceiving it theſe twenty years and more, till now? O Sir, had you <hi>no other work</hi> to do, but to Vindicate the Church and Truth? I doubt you had.</p>
                        <p>§. VIII. But <hi>pag.</hi> 15. You are again incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that [<hi>All the Difference betwixt you and me, or others of the ſame Judgment in the Point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is meerly Verbal; and that in the Main we are agreed</hi>]. And again you complain of your <hi>weak Legs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I do agree with very many againſt, <hi>their wills in Judgment</hi> (becauſe the <hi>Judgment</hi> may be <hi>conſtrained</hi>), but with none in <hi>Affection,</hi> as on their part. Did I ever ſay, that <hi>I differed not from you?</hi> I tell you, I know not what your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, nor know I <hi>who is</hi> of your Mind? But I have not barely <hi>ſaid,</hi> but oft proved, that (though not the <hi>Antinomians</hi>) the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are moſtly here agreed in the Main. If you could not have time to read my larger Proof, that ſhort Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to Mr. <hi>Allen's</hi> Book of the Covenant, in which I proved it, might have ſtopt your Mouth from calling for more Proof, till you had better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed what was given.</p>
                        <p>But you ſay, [<hi>Are perfect Contradictions no more than a difference in Words? Faith alone, and not Faith alone? Faith with and without Works? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our Dulneſs here</hi>].</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Truly, Sir, it is a tedious thing, when a Man hath over and over Anſwered ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45239:120"/>
Objections; yea, when the full Anſwers have been twenty years in Print, to be put ſtill to ſay over all again, to every Man that will come in and ſay, that <hi>his Legs</hi> are <hi>too weak</hi> to go ſee what was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before: How many ſcore times then, or hundreds, may I be called to repeat.</p>
                        <p>2. If I muſt pardon your <hi>Dulneſs,</hi> you muſt pardon my <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> (or chuſe) who believe that there is no ſuch [<hi>perfect Contradictions</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt's, [<hi>By thy Words thou ſhalt be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>]
and <hi>Paul's, [Juſtified by Faith, without the Works of the Law]</hi> or [<hi>not of Works</hi>]; and <hi>James</hi>'s
[<hi>We are juſtified by Works, and not by Faith only</hi>]. Muſt we needs proclaim <hi>War</hi> here, or cry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
out, <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>Popery?</hi> Are not all theſe Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable?
Yea, and <hi>Pauls</hi> too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>The Doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. But did I ever deny that it is [<hi>by Faith alone and without Works]?</hi> Where, and when? But may it not be, <hi>by Faith alone</hi> in one ſenſe, and not
<hi>by Faith alone</hi> in another ſenſe?</p>
                        <p>4. But even where you are ſpeaking of it, you cannot be drawn to diſtinguiſh of <hi>Verbal</hi> and <hi>Real Differences.</hi> Is it here the <hi>Words,</hi> or <hi>Senſe,</hi> which you accuſe? The <hi>Words</hi> you dare not deny to be
<hi>Gods own</hi> in Scripture, ſpoken by <hi>Chriſt, Paul,</hi> and
<hi>James.</hi> My <hi>Senſe</hi> I have opened to you at large,
and you take no Notice of it; but as if you abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Explication</hi> and <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> ſpeak ſtill againſt the <hi>Scripture Words.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>§. IX. <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. But you ſay, [<hi>Let any diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reader compare the</hi> 48 §. <hi>of this Preface with the Words</hi> in pag. 5. <hi>of your Appeal to the Light,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45239:120"/>
and 'tis likely he will concur with me,</hi> in that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Phantaſm,</hi> or <hi>Fear:</hi> For <hi>'tis worth the noting, how in that dark Appeal where you diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Popiſh Points,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſome-where the Difference is reconcileable, others in effect but in words; we have no Direction upon which Rank we muſt beſtow Juſtification, nothing of it at all from you, Name or Thing: But why, next to the All-ſeeing God, you ſhould know beſt your ſelf</hi>].</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Alas, Sir, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be in ſuch a manner mentioned! I anſwered this ſame Caſe at large in my Confeſſion, Apologie, Diſpute of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Twenty years ago, or near; I have at large Opened it in a Folio (<hi>Cathol. Theol.</hi>) which you ſaw, yea, in the <hi>very</hi> part which you take Notice of; and now you publiſh it [<hi>worth the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that I did not alſo in one ſheet of Paper,</hi> Printed the other day againſt a Calumnie of ſome Sectarian Hearers, who gave me no Occaſion for ſuch a work. Had it not been a Vanity of me, Should I in that ſheet again have repeated, how I and the Papiſts differ about Juſtification? Were you bound to have read it in that ſheet, any more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than in many former Volumns? It's no matter for me; But I ſeriouſly beſeech you, be hereafter more ſober and juſt, than to deal with your Brethren, the Church and Truth, in ſuch a manner as this! But by this Talk I ſuſpect, that you will accuſe me more for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more of the Difference in this Book. But, 1. It is enough for to open <hi>my own Meaning,</hi> and I am not obliged to open other Mens: And my own I have opened by ſo many Repetitions, in ſo many Books, as nothing but ſuch Mens <hi>Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obſtructed</hi> Minds, could have Excuſed.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45239:121"/>
2. The Papiſts minds ſure, may be better known by their own Writings, than by mine: The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> telleth it you: What need I recite it? 3. I tell you again, as I did in my Confeſſion, that I had rather all the Papiſts in the World agreed with us, than diſagreed: I like a Doctrine the <hi>better,</hi> and not the worſe, becauſe all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World conſenteth to it. I am not ambitious to have a <hi>Religion to my ſelf,</hi> which a Papiſt doth not own. Where they differ, I am ſorry for it: And it pleaſeth me better, to find in any Point that we are agreed, than that we differ. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, nor any ſuch as you, by crying [<hi>O Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh! Antichriſtian</hi>!] ſhall tempt me to do by the Papiſts, as the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> and ſome <hi>Oratorians,</hi> do by the <hi>Calviniſts:</hi> I will not with <hi>Alvarez, Arnoldus, Gibieuf,</hi> &amp;c. make the World believe, that my Adverſaries are much further from me than they are, for fear of being cenſured by Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be one of them. If I would have been of a Church-Faction, and ſold my Soul to pleaſe a Party, I would have begun before now, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a bigger Price for it, than you can offer me if you would.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pag,</hi> 17. You ſay, [<hi>Pile one Diſtinction or Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on another, as long as you pleaſe; as many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Faiths, and Works, and Juſtifications, as you can name, all this will never make two Poles meet</hi>].</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> And do you cry out for <hi>War</hi> in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Confuſion, as long as you will, you ſhall never tempt me by it to renounce my Baptiſm, and Liſt my ſelf under the grand Enemy of <hi>Love and Concord,</hi> nor to Preach up <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Diviſion</hi>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:45239:121"/>
for nothing, as in the Name of Chriſt. If you will handle ſuch Controverſies, without <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> of <hi>Faiths, Works,</hi> and <hi>Juſtifications,</hi> I will never perſwade any Friend of mine to be your Pupil, or Diſciple. Then <hi>Simon Magus</hi>'s faith, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> faith muſt all paſs for the ſame, and juſtifie accordingly. Then indeed, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, yea, and Chriſt, as our Teacher, King and Judg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt paſs for the <hi>Works</hi> by which no Man is Juſtified! If <hi>Diſtinction</hi> be <hi>unſound,</hi> detect the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of it: If not, it is no Honour to a diſputing Doctor to reproach it.</p>

                           <hi>Anſw. O Juniors,</hi> Will not ſuch deceiving Words ſave you from my Deceits? But, 1. Is there a <hi>Law,</hi> and unalterable Law for the ſenſe of Words? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Words of the ſacred Text muſt have no new Senſe put upon them. 2. Are you ſure that it was <hi>Publick uſage,</hi> and <hi>Impoſition from</hi> whence they firſt received their being? How ſhall we know
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45239:122"/>
that they grew not into publick uſe from one Mans firſt Invention, except thoſe that (not <hi>Publick uſe,</hi> but) <hi>God Himſelf</hi> made? 3. Are you ſure that all or moſt Words now, <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> have the ſame, and only the ſame uſe or ſenſe, as was put upon them at the firſt? Is the change of the ſenſe of Words a ſtrange thing to us? 4. But that which concerneth our Caſe moſt, is, Whether there be many Words either of <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> in the Scripture, or of <hi>Latine, Engliſh,</hi> or any common Language, which have not <hi>many Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations?</hi> Your Reputation forbids you to deny it. And ſhould not thoſe many Significations be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed as there is Cauſe?

Is the change that is made in all Languages in the World, made by the ſame publick uſage and impoſition, from which at firſt they received their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? 6.

You tell me what <hi>ſad work</hi> you are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and no wonder, Sin and Paſſions are ſelf-troubling things: And it's well if it be ſad to your ſelf alone, and not to ſuch as you tempt into Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, Hatred, and Diviſion. It ſhould be ſad to every Chriſtian, to ſee and hear thoſe whom they

                        </p>
                        <p>But <hi>doubtleſs,</hi> many that ſeem killed by ſuch Blows as ſome of yours, are ſtill alive? And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a one is in Heaven, that by Divines pretending to be Orthodox, were damned on Earth! And many Men are more agreed than they were aware of. I have known a Knaviſh Fellow ſet two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality on Fighting, before they ſpake a word to one another, by telling them ſecretly and falſly what one ſaid againſt the other.

There is more skill required to <hi>narrow</hi> differences, than to <hi>widen</hi> them; and to <hi>reconcile,</hi> than to <hi>divide</hi>; as there is to <hi>quench</hi> a Fire, than to <hi>kindle</hi> it; to <hi>build,</hi> than to <hi>pull down</hi>; to <hi>heal,</hi> than to <hi>wound.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45239:123"/>
there are very few at all, that have not various Significations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>That this Speaking-Art requireth ſo much time and ſtudy, and all Men are ſo defective in it, and the variety of Mens skill in it is ſo very great, that no Men in the World do perfectly agree in their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and uſe of Words.</hi> The doleful plague of the Confuſion of Tongues, doth ſtill hinder our full Communication, and maketh it hard for us to underſtand Words our ſelves, or to be underſtood by others; for <hi>Words</hi> muſt have a three-fold apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Signification. 1. To <hi>ſignifie</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi>
2. And the <hi>Speakers conceptions</hi> of it. 3. And this as adapted to the hearers Mind, to make a true Impreſſion there.</p>
                        <p>3. That God in Mercy hath not made <hi>Words</hi> ſo neceſſary as <hi>Things,</hi> nor neceſſary but for the ſake of the <hi>Things:</hi> If <hi>God, Chriſt, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi>
be known, believed, and duly accepted, you ſhall be ſaved by what Words ſoever it be brought to paſs.</p>
                        <p>4. Therefore <hi>Real Fundamentals,</hi> or <hi>Neceſſaries to Salvation,</hi> are more eaſily defined than <hi>Verbal
ones:</hi> For <hi>more</hi> or <hi>fewer</hi> Words, <hi>theſe</hi> or <hi>other</hi>
Words are needful to help <hi>ſome</hi> Perſons, to Faith,
and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as their Capacities are different.</p>
                        <p>5. But as he that truly <hi>believeth in,</hi> and <hi>giveth up</hi> himſelf to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, according to the ſenſe of the Baptiſmal Covenant, is a true Chriſtian, to be loved, and
ſhall be ſaved; ſo he that underſtandeth <hi>ſuch Words,</hi> as help him to that true <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Conſent,</hi>
doth know ſo much of the <hi>Verbal part,</hi> as is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45239:123"/>
to his Chriſtianity and Salvation.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>And he that is ſuch, holdeth no Hereſie or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror inconſiſtent with it: If he truly love God, it's a contradiction to ſay, that he holdeth an Error incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Love of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Therefore ſee that you Love all ſuch as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
till ſome proved or notorious inconſiſtents nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Profeſſion diſoblige you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. <hi>Take your ſelves to be neither of Roman, or any other Church as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, which is leſs than the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality of all Chriſtians headed by Chriſt alone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. <hi>Make this Love of all Chriſtians the ſecond part of your Religion, and the Love of God, of Chriſt,
of Holineſs and Heaven, the firſt; and live thus in the ſerious practice of your Covenant, even of Simple Chriſtianity: For it's this that will be your Peace,
in Life and at Death.</hi>

Had you ſaid, that I had been unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in my Endeavours, your Authority might have gone for Proof with many: But you could ſcarce have ſpoken a more incredible word of <hi>me,</hi> than that I ſeem to make little account of Method, I look for no ſharper Cenſure from the Theological Tribe, than that I <hi>Over-do in my Endeavours after Method.</hi> You ſhall not tempt me here unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to anticipate what Evidence I have to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for my acquittance from this Accuſation.</p>
                        <p>2. But yet I will ſtill ſay, that it is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary either to Salvation, or to the Churches Peace, that we all agree in <hi>Methods and Expreſſions,</hi>
as that we agree in the hearty reception of Chriſt,
and obedience to His Commands? So much Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod all muſt know, as to know the <hi>Beginning</hi> and the <hi>End,</hi> from the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Means,</hi> God from the Creature, and as our true conſent to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant doth require; and I will thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe all the help which you give me to go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But I never yet ſaw that Scheme of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
or of any of its Heads, which was any whit large, (and I have ſeen many) which was ſo exact in <hi>Order,</hi> as that it was dangerous in any thing to forſake it. But I cannot think meet to talk much of <hi>Method,</hi> with a Man that talketh as you
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45239:124"/>
do of <hi>Diſtinguiſhing,</hi> and handleth the Doctrine of Juſtification no more Methodically than you do.</p>
                        <p>§. XII. But <hi>pag.</hi> 19. you inſtance in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Proteſtants and Papiſts, about the <hi>Neceſſity of Good works, which is wide in reſpect of the placing or ranking of them,</hi> viz. <hi>The one ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the firſt Juſtification, the other not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining it to its proper rank and province of Inherent Holineſs, where it ought to keep</hi>].</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wonderful! Have you that have ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called to me to tell how I differ about Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, brought your own, and as you ſay, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants difference to this? Will none of your Readers ſee now, who cometh nearer them, you or I?</p>
                        <p>1. Is this diſtinction our proof of your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs in <hi>Method,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Expreſſion?</hi>
What meaneth a diſtinction between [<hi>Firſt-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi>] and <hi>[Inherent Holineſs]?</hi> Do you dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference them <hi>Quoad ordinem,</hi> as <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second?</hi>
But here is no <hi>Second</hi> mentioned: Is it in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things [<hi>Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>Inherent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs]?</hi> What ſignifieth the [<hi>Firſt</hi>] then? But Sir, how many Readers do you expect who know not, 1. That it is not to the <hi>Firſt Juſtification</hi> at all, but to that which they call the <hi>Second</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſerteth the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or uſe of Mans meritorious <hi>Works?</hi> See what I have fully cited out of them for this, <hi>Cath.

Divines do conſtantly preach for, and the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> at large aſſert; though they diſown the
<hi>name of Merit,</hi> as many of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do. They ordinarily ſay with <hi>Auſtine, Bona opera ſequuntur Juſtificatum, non praecedunt Juſtificandum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. But, I hope, the word [<hi>Firſt</hi>] here over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlipt your your Pen, inſtead of [<hi>Second</hi>]: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it did ſo: What's the difference between <hi>the Papiſts firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond Juſtification,</hi> and the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Inherent Holineſs?</hi> None that ever I heard or read of: Who knoweth not that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> take <hi>Juſtification</hi> for <hi>Inherent Holineſs?</hi> And is this the great difference between <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which I am ſo loudly accuſed for not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? viz. <hi>The Papiſts place Good-Works before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> that is, <hi>Inherent Holineſs</hi>; and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants more rightly place them before Inherent Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> Are you ſerious, or do you prevaricate?</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hold, that there are ſome <hi>Duties and common Grace,</hi> uſually <hi>preparatory</hi> to Converſion (or Sanctification); which ſome <hi>Papiſts (de nomine)</hi> call <hi>Merit</hi> of <hi>Congruity,</hi> and ſome will not. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, that <hi>Faith</hi> is in order of nature, at leaſt, before that <hi>Habitual Love,</hi> which is called <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Works thereof.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, that <hi>Works of Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> follow our Firſt Sanctification, and make up but the <hi>Second part of it,</hi> which conſiſteth in the <hi>Works of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> If you ſpeak not of <hi>Works</hi> in the ſame ſenſe in each part of your Aſſignation, the Equivocation would be too groſs, <hi>viz.</hi> If you ſhould mean [<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts rank</hi> the <hi>neceſſity of preparatory Common Works,</hi> or the <hi>Internal act of Faith, or Love, ſtretching it

to the Firſt Juſtification</hi>; and <hi>Proteſtants rank other Works,</hi> viz. <hi>The fruits</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> with <hi>Inherent Holineſs.</hi> All agree, 1. That <hi>Common Works go</hi> before <hi>Sanctification.</hi> 2. That Internal Love, and other Grace, do <hi>conſtitute</hi> Sanctification in the Firſt part of it. 3. That <hi>Special Works</hi> proceeding from <hi>Inward Grace,</hi> are the effects of the Firſt <hi>Part,</hi> and the conſtitutive Cauſes of the Second Part of Sanctification; as the word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth alſo to <hi>Holineſs of Life:</hi> And whilſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> take <hi>Juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And is this it in the Application that your Zeal will warn Men of, that we muſt in this take heed of joyning with the <hi>Papiſts?</hi> Do you mean [<hi>Rank Good-Works with Inherent Holineſs,</hi> and not with <hi>the Firſt Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>you then</hi> do <hi>widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Papiſts]?</hi> Will not your Reader ſay, 1. What doth <hi>Inherent Holineſs differ from</hi> the Firſt <hi>Sanctification?</hi> 2. <hi>Do you not invite</hi> me <hi>thus herein to be a Papiſt,</hi> when they rank them no where but, as you ſay, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do? 3. Do not you here proclaim, that <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not about the neceſſity of Good-works to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification? But yet I that would make no Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences wider than they are, can find ſome greater than you have mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Truly Sir, I am grieved and aſhamed, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee how Learned <hi>Papiſts</hi> will make merry with ſuch Paſſages; and ſay, <hi>See here how we differ from the Proteſtants! See what it is for,</hi> that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45239:126"/>
Doctors ſeparate from the Church of</hi> Rome! viz. <hi>Becauſe we make Good-Works neceſſary to the Firſt Juſtification, which unleſs equivocally ſpoken, is falſe; and becauſe the Proteſtants rank them with Inherent Holineſs, as we do</hi>]. What greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will they deſire againſt us, than to chooſe us ſuch Advocates? And to ſhew the World that even where their keeneſt Adverſaries condemn them, and draw Men from them, they do but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them? Who knoweth what a Temptation they may make of ſuch paſſages to draw any to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery? It is my aſſurance, that ſuch <hi>Over-doing,</hi> is <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoing</hi>; and that miſtaken Accuſations of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> greatly advantage them againſt us, which maketh me the more againſt ſuch Dealing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>ſinfulneſs,</hi> of pretending that any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among Chriſtians, are greater than indeed they are.</p>
                        <p>But may not I think that you take the word [<hi>Juſtification</hi>] here in the <hi>Proteſtant Senſe,</hi> and not in the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> when you ſay that they <hi>rank Good-work's-neceſſity as ſtretcht to the Firſt Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</hi> No ſure: For, 1.

                        <p>The Definition of Juſtification, is a work of Art; but Juſtification is a Work of Grace.</p>
                        <p>A wicked damnable Man, or a damned Devil, may <hi>define</hi> Juſtification, and ſo have the <hi>Definition</hi> of it; but not Juſtification it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>The Definition of Juſtification, Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is <hi>Quid Logicum</hi>; but <hi>Juſtification, Faith, Love,</hi> &amp;c. are things <hi>Phyſical</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi>

                        <p>By this time you have helpt Men to underſtand by an Inſtance, why St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much warneth Chriſtians to take heed leſt any deceive them by vain Philoſophy, even by Sophiſtry, and abuſed, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Notions.</p>
                        <p>Remember, Sir, that our Caſe is of grand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; As it is ſtated in my <hi>Direct.</hi> 42. which you aſſaulted; it is [<hi>Whether if the Queſtion were of the Object of Predeſtination, of the nature of the Will's liberty, Divine concourſe,</hi> and <hi>determining way of Grace, of the Definition of Juſtification, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a few well ſtudied Divines are not here to be preferred before Authority, and the major Vote.</hi> Such are my words. I aſſert, 1. That the <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Juſtification, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. is a work of Art. 2. And I have many and many times told the World (which you ſeem to ſtrike at) that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do not differ ſo much in their <hi>Real concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Matter,</hi> as they do in their <hi>Definitions.</hi> 1. Becauſe <hi>Definitions</hi> are made up of <hi>Ambiguous words,</hi> whoſe Explication they are not agreed in; and almoſt all Words are ambiguous till explained; and ambiguous Words are not fit to define, or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45239:131"/>
be defined, till explained. And, 2. Becauſe both ſelecting fit terms, and explaining them, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them, are works of Art, in which Men are unequal; and there is as great variety of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Conceptions, as of Faces. 3. And I have often ſaid, That a <hi>Knowledg intuitive,</hi> or a <hi>Simple apprehenſion</hi> of a thing as <hi>Senſate,</hi> or an <hi>Internal experience,</hi> or <hi>Reflect act,</hi> and a general notion of ſome things, may prove the truth of Grace, and ſave Souls, and make us capable of Chriſtian Love and Communion, as being true ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. 4. And conſequently I have often ſaid, that many a thouſand Chriſtians have <hi>Faith, Hope, Deſire, Love, Humility, Obedience, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adoption, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt,</hi> who can <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi> none of theſe: Unleſs you will ſpeak equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally of <hi>Definition</hi> it ſelf, and ſay as good <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon,</hi> and as <hi>Gutherleth,</hi> and ſome other Romiſts, that <hi>Notitia intuitiva eſt definitio,</hi> who yet ſay but what I am ſaying, when they add, [<hi>Vel ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem inſtar definitionis</hi>]. If all are without <hi>Faith, Love, Juſtification, Adoption,</hi> who cannot give a true Definition of them, how few will be ſaved? How much more then doth <hi>Learning</hi> to Mens ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, than Grace? And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> then is not ſo far below <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Spirit of Chriſt, as we (juſtly) believe.</p>
                        <p>The Caſe is ſo weighty and palpable, that you have nothing to ſay; but as you did about the Guilt of our nearer Parents ſins, to yield all the Cauſe, and with a paſſionate clamour to tell Men that I miſtake you, or wreſt your words; of which I ſhall appeal to every ſober Reader, that will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe the words of mine which you aſſault, and yours
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45239:131"/>
as they are an Anſwer to mine.</p>
                        <p>In a word, you go about by the abuſe of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial <hi>Axiome</hi> of <hi>Definitions,</hi> 1. To ſentence moſt Chriſtians to Hell, and caſt them into Deſperation, as wanting the Grace which they cannot define. 2. And to deſtroy Chriſtian Love and Concord, and tear the Church into as many Shreds, as there be diverſities of Definitions uſed by them. 3. And you would tempt us to think much hardlier of your ſelf, than we muſt or will do; as if your <hi>Faith, Juſtification,</hi> &amp;c. were unſound, becauſe your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions are ſo.</p>
                        <p>I know that <hi>

I take all <hi>Theologie</hi> to be together, <hi>Scientia-affectiva-practica</hi>; for our <hi>Intellect, Will,</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> muſt be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt or ruled by it: But it is firſt <hi>Scientia,</hi> and we muſt <hi>know</hi> before we can <hi>will</hi> and <hi>practiſe.</hi> And though all right knowledg tend to Practice, yet forgive me for telling you, that I think that many holy Perſons in Scripture and Primitive times, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and practiſed more than you or I, who knew not how to form an exact Logical Definition. And that he that knoweth the things of the Spirit ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, by Scripture Notions, may practiſe them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45239:134"/>
as fully, as he that knoweth and ſpeaketh them in the Notions of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>; or elſe the School-Men excel the Apoſtles. Though ambling be an eaſie Pace, which Horſes are taught by Gives and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it followeth not that a Horſe cannot travel as far in his natural pace. When you have ſaid all, <hi>Logical defining</hi> ſhall be a work of Art, and the <hi>Church ſhould</hi> not <hi>be torn,</hi> and <hi>Souls ſhall not be damned,</hi> for want of it. He that <hi>Loveth, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, Hopeth, Obeyeth,</hi> and by <hi>doing</hi> them hath a reflecting perception what they are, and hath but ſuch a knowledg of the Goſpel as may be had without a proper Definition, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                        <p>Pag. 28, 29. you ſay, [<hi>Nor is the Doctrine of Juſtification ſo high and difficult, but that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Chriſtian may underſtand it ſufficiently to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Still I ſee we ſhall agree whether you will or not: O, Sir, it is juſt the contrary that I wrote for: And I need but repeat your words to anſwer you. I am not diſparaging your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, otherwiſe than you may ſo call the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating of needful truth: Nor did I ever preſume to offer you my Tutorage: You ſpeak all this with too much tenderneſs. But that which I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten almoſt all my Books of Controverſie againſt, is this <hi>making the Way to Heaven more difficult</hi> and be wildring, than the Scriptures make it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that I have perſwaded Men to lay leſs ſtreſs on arbitrary humane Notions: But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45239:135"/>
is now, whether it be your <hi>Courſe</hi> or <hi>mine,</hi> that is guilty of this? Are <hi>Logical Definitions</hi> the <hi>neceſſary Way to Heaven?</hi> Doth the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently reveal ſuch <hi>Definitions</hi> to all? Do <hi>all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Believers</hi> by the <hi>uſe of the Scripture,</hi> know how to <hi>define?</hi> Do not Logicians make true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining one of the ſureſt ſigns of <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>accurate</hi> knowledg? Why ſhould you and I diſpute thus about Matters of Fact? I know by the principles of Conformity, that your Judgment is not like to be <hi>narrower</hi> than <hi>mine</hi> about the ſtate of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Individuals: I ſuppoſe you would take as many to the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> as Believers, as I would, and <hi>abſolve</hi> as many, and <hi>pronounce</hi> as many <hi>ſaved</hi> at <hi>Buryal.</hi> Let you and I call but a dozen of the next Families together, and deſire every Man and Woman of them, to give you a Definition of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, (out of the hearing of the reſt) and if they all <hi>give you a true definition,</hi> and <hi>one definition,</hi> I will write a Retractation. I know you not; but by your now telling me, of your <hi>underſtanding</hi> of the duties of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> I may ſuppoſe that you <hi>have been a Paſtour,</hi> (elſe—). And if ſo, that you have had perſonal conference with <hi>moſt</hi> (if not <hi>all</hi>) of your Flock. If you have found them all ſuch <hi>able concordant Definers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> you have had a more learned Flock than I had. I doubt your <hi>Learned Scholars</hi> could not do it, till they met with ſome ſuch <hi>Elias</hi> or <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> as you! Yea, let us take only ſuch as by their Lives we commonly judg truly Godly Chriſtians: And if all <hi>theſe</hi> give you <hi>one</hi> and a <hi>true</hi> definition of Juſtification, then do you tell them that <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> is no ſuch difficult work, but ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45239:135"/>
may and do attain it, and I that make it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, make the way to Heaven difficult, for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining is the way to Heaven: But if not one of many Score or Hundred (till you teach them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new) do give you a <hi>true</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I will go on and ſtill ſay, that <hi>They wrong Souls, the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>the Church, who pretend ſuch neceſſity and facility of defining,</hi> and <hi>will cenſure, reproach,</hi> or damn all that agree not with them in a Definition, when they have as <hi>real</hi> though leſs <hi>diſtinct</hi> a knowledg of the thing.</p>
                        <p>I doubt not but you know how much difference there is among Learned Men about <hi>Definitions</hi> themſelves in general: Whether they belong to Metaphyſicks, Logicks, or Phyſicks?

Whether <hi>Definitio objectiva</hi> be properly called <hi>Definitio,</hi> or only <hi>Formalis?</hi> Whether <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi> may be properly defined? <hi>An Genus defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niri poſſit?

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you hold on thus to talk as in your ſleep, and will not ſhut your Chamber-door, but commiſſion the Preſs to report your words to the World, how can your beſt Friends ſecure your reputation?

                        <p>In caſe of <hi>Subtilties</hi> which depend upon <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> in that proportion which few, even faithful Men attain, I remember but one of theſe ways that can be taken; Either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>ſuſpend</hi> our <hi>Judgments,</hi> and not to meddle with them, till we can reach them our ſelves; Or to take them <hi>fide humana,</hi> or as <hi>probabilities</hi> on the Credit of ſome Men, rather than others: As to the firſt, I am for as much <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

as will ſtand with the part of a Learner (where we muſt learn; and in uſeleſs things for a total ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion).

                        <p>What abundance of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do place Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation only in <hi>Fogiveneſs of Sins?</hi> And yet as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (I know not which is the greater ſide) do make that <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> but one part, and <hi>Imputation of Righteouſneſs</hi> another.

Or as more ſay that Chriſts <hi>Paſſive Righteouſneſs</hi> as Satisfaction, ſaveth us from Hell or Puniſhment, and His <hi>Active</hi> as meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, procureth <hi>Life</hi> as the reward? When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, rejecting that Diviſion, ſay; That both freedom from Puniſhment, and right to Glory are the conjunct effects of His Habitual, Active, and Paſſive Righteouſneſs, as an entire Cauſe (in its kind); as <hi>Guil.

                        <p>And I need not <hi>tell</hi> any Man that hath read ſuch Writers, that they ordinarily diſtinguiſh of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and give not the ſame Definition of one ſort as of <hi>another,</hi> nor of the <hi>Name</hi> in one <hi>Senſe</hi> as in another.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>2. They are not agreed in their very <hi>Logical Rules,</hi> and Notions, to which their Definitions are reduced; no not ſo much as of the number and nature of Cauſes, nor of <hi>Definitions</hi> (as is aforeſaid): And as I will not undertake to prove that all the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts and Primitive Paſtours, knew how to define <hi>Efficient, Material, Formal</hi> and <hi>Final Cauſes</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> ſo I am ſure that <hi>all</hi> good Chriſtians do not.</p>
                        <p>3. And when <hi>Juſtification</hi> is defined by Divines,
is either the <hi>Actus Juſtificantis,</hi> and this being in the predicament of Action, what wonder if they diſagree about the <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Formal Cauſes</hi> of it?</p>
                        <p>Nay, it being an Act of God, there are few Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that tell us what that Act is: <hi>Deus operatur per eſſentiam:</hi> And <hi>Ex parte agentis,</hi> his Acts are his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and all but one. And who will thus diſpute of the Definition and Cauſes of them, Efficient, Material, Formal, Final? when I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to declare, that this Act of Juſtifying is not an immanent Act in God, nor without a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, but Gods Act by the Inſtrumentality of his <hi>Goſpel-Covenant</hi> or <hi>Promiſe,</hi> many read it as a new thing; and if that hold true that the Firſt Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith, is that which Gods Goſpel-Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Inſtrument of, as the <hi>Titulus ſeu Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Juris,</hi> being but a <hi>Virtual</hi> and not an Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sentence, then the Definition of it, as to the Cauſes, muſt differ much from the moſt common Definitions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:45239:144"/>But moſt Proteſtants ſay that <hi>Juſtification</hi> is <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia Judicis.</hi> (And no doubt but there are three ſeveral <hi>ſorts,</hi> or Acts called Juſtification, 1. Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive by the <hi>Donative Covenant,</hi> 2. <hi>Sentential,</hi> 3. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive.</hi>) And here they are greatly at a loſs, for the deciſion of the Caſe, <hi>what Act of God this Sententia Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> is. What it will be after death, we do not much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree: But what it is immediately upon our believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It muſt be an <hi>Act</hi> as in <hi>patiente,</hi> or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſence denominated from ſuch an <hi>effect.</hi> And what Judgment and Sentence God hath upon our believing, few open, and fewer agreee. Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ſaith it is a <hi>Sentence</hi> in <hi>Heaven notifying</hi> it to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: But that is not all, or the chief: ſome run back to an Immanent Act; moſt leave it undetermined: And ſure the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Sentence</hi> in general, ſignifieth no true Conception of it at all, in him that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what that <hi>Sentence</hi> is, ſeeing Univerſals are <hi>Nothing</hi> (out of us) but as they exiſt in individuals. Mr. <hi>Lawſon</hi> hath ſaid that wihch would reconcile Proteſtants, and ſome Papiſts, as to the Name, <hi>viz.</hi> that Gods <hi>Execution</hi> is his <hi>Sentence</hi>; He <hi>Judgeth</hi> by <hi>Executing</hi>: And ſo as the chief puniſhment is the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Spirit,</hi> ſo the Juſtifying Act, is the <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive donation</hi> of the Spirit. Thus are we diſagreed about <hi>Active Juſtification</hi> (which I have oft endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured Conciliatorily fullier to open.)</p>
                        <p>And as to <hi>Paſſive Juſtification</hi> (or as it is <hi>Status Juſtificati</hi>) which is indeed that which it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in this Controverſie to open, I have told you how groſly ſome deſcribe it here before. And all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not what <hi>Predicament</hi> it is in: ſome take it to be in that of <hi>Action, ut recipitur in paſſo</hi>; and ſome in that of Quality and Relation Conjunct: But moſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45239:144"/>
place it in Relation; And will you wonder if all Chriſtian Women, yea or Divines, cannot define that Relation aright. And if they agree not in the notions of the <hi>Efficient, Material, Formal and Final Cauſes,</hi> of that which muſt be <hi>defined</hi> (as it is capable) by its <hi>ſubjectum, fundamentum</hi> and <hi>terminus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I would not wiſh that the Salvation of any Friend of mine (or any one) ſhould be laid on the true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Definition of Juſtification, Active or Paſſive, <hi>Conſtitutive, Sentential</hi> or <hi>Executive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now the Judicious will ſee, whether the Church and Souls of Men be well uſed by this pretence, that all Proteſtants are agreed in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Cauſes</hi> and Definition of Juſtification; and that to depart from that <hi>one</hi> Definition (where is it?) is ſo dangerous as the Doctor pretendeth, becauſe the <hi>Definition</hi> and the <hi>Definitum</hi> are the ſame.</p>

                        <p>When the <hi>Moors</hi> were ſentenced to ruin in <hi>Spain,</hi> one of the Diſciples of <hi>Valdeſſo</hi> (a Scholar) fell into the diſpleaſure of the Bp. of <hi>Toledo:</hi> A Neighbour Doctor knowing that the Bps. favour might beſtead him — (whether accidentally or contrivedly I know not) hit upon this happy courſe: The Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and he being together in a ſolemn Convention, the Scholar was taking Tobacco, and the Dr. ſeeing the ſmok threw firſt a Glaſs of Beer in his face, and cryed <hi>Fire, Fire</hi>; The Scholar wiped his face, and went on; The Doctor next threw an <hi>Ink-bottle in his Face,</hi> crying ſtill <hi>Fire, Fire</hi>; The Scholar being thus blackt, perceived that he was like to be taken for a <hi>Moor,</hi> and ruined, and he went out and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully waſh'd his face: the Doctor charged him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for affronting him (yea and injuriouſly calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating him) by the fact: For ſaith he, there was neceſſary Cauſe for what I did: There is no ſmoak without ſome fire: that which fired you might next have fired the Houſe, and that the next Houſe, and ſo have burnt down all the City: and your action intimateth as if I had done cauſeleſly what I did, and done you wrong: The Scholar anſwered him; I knew not, Sir, that it was unlawful to waſh me, but I will take no more Tobacco that I may no more offend you; But if in this froſty weather the <hi>thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of my <hi>breath</hi> ſhould be called <hi>ſmoak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45239:146"/>
No, ſaith the Doctor, It is not you, nor any private man that muſt be judg whether you are on Fire or not, in a publick danger: Muſt the City be hazarded, if you ſay that it is not Fire? The Scholar asketh, may I not refer the caſe to the ſtanders-by, and waſh my face if they ſay, It was no Fire? No, ſaith the Dr. that is but to call in your Aſſociates to your help, and to add <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> to your diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: I perceive what principles you are of.

                        <p>But pardon this digreſſion, and let you and I ſtand to the judgment of any righteous and competent Judge, whether you deal not with me in notorious injuſtice, ſo be it the Caſe be truly ſtated.</p>
                        <p>The perſon whom you aſſaulted is one, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted (with ſucceſs) the ſubverſion of Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm and the clearing of truth; their Ignorance of which was the Cauſe of their other Errours. But having let fall, (for want of uſe in writing) ſome incongruous words (as <hi>Covenant</hi> for <hi>Law,</hi> &amp;c.) and that ſomewhat often, and ſome excepting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Book, he craved their animaverſions, and promiſed to ſuſpend the Book till it were corrected; and purpoſely wrote a far greater Volumn in expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what was dark, and defence of what was wrongfully accuſed, and many other Volumns of full defence: No man anſwereth any of theſe: but after twenty years, or thereabout, (though I proteſted in print againſt any that would write againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms, without regard to the ſaid Explications) you publiſh your Confutation of part of thoſe Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms, and that with moſt notorious untruth, charg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing me to deny <hi>all Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs,</hi>

                        <p>1. Seeing I am turned to my Reader, I will crave his impartial judgment: I never <hi>received</hi> and <hi>agreed on</hi> a ſtate of the queſtion with this Doctor: He writeth againſt my books: In thoſe Books I over and over and over diſtinguiſh of Juſtification, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive, Sentential,</hi> and <hi>Executive</hi> (beſides thoſe ſubordinate ſorts, by <hi>Witneſs, Evidence, Apology,</hi> &amp;c.)

have not patience to be much longer in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were more neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Two ſheets more tell us that the Doctor is yet angry; And little that's better that I can find. In the firſt, he ſaith again, that [<hi>I am buſie in ſmoothing my way where none can ſtumble in, a thing never queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by him, nor by any Man elſe, he thinks, who owns the Authority of the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi>]. And have I not then good Company and Encouragement not to change my Mind?</p>
                  <p>But, 1. He feigneth a Caſe ſtated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me, who never had to do with him before, but as with others in my Writings, where I ſtate my Caſe my ſelf. 2. He never ſo much as toucheth either of my Diſputations of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> in which I ſtate <hi>my Caſe</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> it. 3. And he falſly feigneth the Caſe ſtated, in words (and he ſuppoſeth in a ſenſe) that I never had do do with: Saying, [<hi>I charge you with a new ſecondary Original Sin, whoſe Pedegree is not from</hi> Adam: <hi>I engage not a ſyllable further</hi>]. And pag. 8. [<hi>You have aſſerted that this Novel Original Sin is not derived from our Original Father; no line of Communication between them; a ſin beſides that which is derived from</hi> Adam,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45239:153"/>
                     <hi>as you plainly and poſſitively affirm</hi>]. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid that it had no <hi>Pedegree,</hi> no line of <hi>Communication,</hi> no kind of derivation from <hi>Adam.</hi> 4. Yea, if he would not touch the Diſputation where I ſtate my Caſe, he ſhould have noted it as ſtated in the very Preface which he writeth againſt; and yet there alſo he totally overlooketh it, though opened in divers Propoſitions. 5. And the words in an Epiſtle to another Mans Book, which he faſteneth ſtill on were theſe; [<hi>Over-looking the Intereſt of Children in the Actions of their nearer Parents, and think that they participate of no Guilt, and ſuffer for no Original Sin, but</hi> Adams <hi>only</hi>]. And after, [<hi>They had more Original Sin than what they had from</hi> Adam]. 6. He tells me, that [<hi>I ſeem not to underſtand my own Queſtion, nor to know well how to ſet about my Work</hi>]; and he will teach me how to manage the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> that <hi>I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,</hi> and ſo he tells me <hi>how</hi> I MUST ſtate the Queſtion hereafter, (ſee his words). Reader, ſome Reaſons may put a better Title on this Learned Doctors actions; but if ever I write at this rate, I heartily deſire thee to caſt it away as utter DISHONESTY and IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUDENCE.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:45239:153"/>It troubleth me to trouble thee with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions. I hold, 1. That <hi>Adams</hi> Sin is imputed (as I opened) to his Poſterity. 2. That the degree of Pravity which <hi>Cains</hi> nature received from <hi>Adam,</hi> was the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive enclining Cauſe of all his Actual Sin: 3. But not a neceſſitating Cauſe of <hi>all thoſe</hi> Acts; for he might poſſibly have done leſs evil and more good than he did. 4. Therefore not the <hi>Total principal Cauſe</hi>; for <hi>Cains free-will</hi> was <hi>part</hi> of that. 5 <hi>Cains actual ſin increaſed</hi> the <hi>pravity</hi> of his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 6. And <hi>Cains Poſterity</hi> were (as I opened it) <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>Cains actual ſin</hi>; and their <hi>Natures</hi> were the more <hi>depraved</hi> by his <hi>additional pravity,</hi> than they would have been by <hi>Adams ſin alone</hi> (unleſs <hi>Grace preſerved</hi> or <hi>healed</hi> any of them).</p>
                  <p>The Doctor in this Paper, would make his Reader believe that he is [<hi>for no meer Logomachies</hi>] and that the difference is not in <hi>words only,</hi> but <hi>the thing.</hi> And do you think that he differeth from me in any of theſe Propoſitions, or how this <hi>ſin is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from</hi> Adam? Yet this now muſt be the Controverſie <hi>de re.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do you think (for I muſt go by <hi>thinking</hi>) that he holdeth any other <hi>Derivation</hi> than this? Or did I ever deny any of this?
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45239:154"/>
But it is vain to ſtate the Caſe to him: He will over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>look it, and tell me what I <hi>ſhould have</hi> held, that he may not be thought to make all this Noiſe for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith <hi>pag.</hi> 8. [<hi>If it derive in a direct line from the firſt Tranſgreſſion, and have its whole Root faſtened there, what then? why then ſome words which he ſets together are not the beſt ſenſe that can be ſpoken.</hi> It is then but <hi>words,</hi> and yet it is the <hi>thing:</hi> What he may mean by [a <hi>direct Line</hi>], and what by [<hi>whole Root faſtened</hi>] I know not; but I have told the World oft enough <hi>what I mean</hi>; and what <hi>he meaneth,</hi> I have little to do with.</p>
                  <p>But if he think, 1. That <hi>Adams Perſon</hi> did commit the ſin of <hi>Cain,</hi> and of all that ever were ſince committed; and that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das his act,</hi> was <hi>Adams perſonal act.</hi> 2. Or that <hi>Adams ſin</hi> was a <hi>total</hi> or <hi>neceſſitating</hi> Cauſe of all the evil ſince committed; ſo do not I, (nor doth he, I doubt not). And now I am caſt by him on the ſtrait, either to accuſe him of <hi>differing de re,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Doctrinal errour,</hi> or elſe that he knoweth not when the difference is <hi>de re,</hi> and when <hi>de nomine,</hi> but is ſo uſed to confuſion, that <hi>Names and Things</hi> do come promiſcuouſly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45239:154"/>
into the Queſtion with him: And which of theſe to chuſe, I know not.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may ſee that I mentioned [<hi>Actual Sin, and Guilt</hi>]: And I think few will doubt, but <hi>Adams</hi> [<hi>Actual ſin,</hi> and <hi>Cains,</hi>] were divers; and that therefore, the <hi>Guilt</hi> that <hi>Cains</hi> Children had of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin and of <hi>Cains</hi> was not the ſame: But that <hi>Cauſa cauſae</hi> is <hi>Cauſa cauſati,</hi> and ſo that all following Sin was <hi>partly</hi> (but <hi>partly</hi>) <hi>cauſed</hi> by <hi>Adam's,</hi> we ſhall ſoon agree.</p>
                  <p>He addeth that I muſt make good that <hi>new Original Sin</hi> (for he can make uſe of the word <hi>New,</hi> and therefore <hi>made</hi> it) <hi>doth mutare naturam, as the Old doth. Anſ.</hi> And how far it <hi>changeth it,</hi> I told him, and he taketh no notice of it: The <hi>firſt ſin</hi> changed Nature from <hi>Innocent</hi> into <hi>Nocent</hi>; the <hi>Second</hi> changeth it from <hi>Nocent into more Nocent:</hi> Doth he deny this? Or why muſt I prove any more? Or doth nothing but Confuſion pleaſe him?</p>
                  <p>3. He ſaith, I muſt prove that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of Progenitors ſins is conſtant and neceſſary, not uncertain and contingent. Anſ.</hi> Of this alſo I fully ſaid what I held, and he diſſembleth it all, as if I had never done it: And why muſt I prove more?
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45239:155"/>
By what Law can he impoſe on me what to hold?</p>
                  <p>But really doth he deny that the <hi>Reatus culpae,</hi> yea and <hi>ad Poenam,</hi> the Guilt of nearer Parents ſins is <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> the <hi>Childs,</hi> though <hi>Grace</hi> may <hi>pardon</hi> it? If he do not, why doth he call on me to prove it? If he do confeſs the <hi>Guilt,</hi> and deny it <hi>neceſſary,</hi> when will he tell us what is the <hi>Contingent uncertain Cauſe</hi>? For we take a <hi>Relation</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Guilt</hi> is) <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> to <hi>reſult a poſito fundamento.</hi>

He next cavilleth at my Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, about which I only ſay, either the Reader will peruſe the <hi>cited words,</hi> and <hi>my words, which ſhew</hi> to what <hi>end I cited them</hi> (to prove our <hi>Guilt</hi> of our <hi>nearer Parents</hi> ſins) or he will not.

His ſecond <hi>Spark</hi> is <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> on a ſheet of mine, before mentioned, which are ſuch as I am not willing to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with, ſeeing I cannot either <hi>handle</hi> them, or <hi>name</hi> them as the nature of them doth require, without offending him: And if what is here ſaid (of <hi>Imputation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation</hi>)
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45239:155"/>
be not enough, I will add no more, nor write over and over ſtill the ſame things, becauſe a Man that will take no notice of the many Volumns which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all his Objections long ago, will call for more, and will write his Animadverſions upon a ſingle Sheet that was written on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other particular occaſion, and pretend to his diſcoveries of my Deceits from the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> of that <hi>Sheet,</hi> and from my naming the <hi>Antinomians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I only ſay, 1. If this Mans way of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting were the <hi>common way,</hi> I would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor <hi>Diſputing,</hi> and be aſhamed of the <hi>Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. I do friendly deſire the Author of the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that would faſten ſuch Doctrines on the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> as a Character of the <hi>Party,</hi> to obſerve that this Doctor ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuteth their partiality; and that their Academical Church-Doctors, are as <hi>Confuſed,</hi> as <hi>Vehement</hi> maintainers of ſuch expreſſions as they account moſt unſavoury, as any even of the <hi>Independants</hi> cited by them: Yea, that this Doctor would make us queſtion whether there be now any <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> among us, and ſo whether all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts that have charged the Conformiſts,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45239:156"/>
yea or the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> with having among them Men of ſuch unſound Principles, have not wronged them, it being indeed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> which they maintain, whom I and others call <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi>
and <hi>Libertines:</hi> And I hope at leaſt the ſober and ſound <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> are Orthodox, when the vehementeſt <hi>Sectaries</hi>
that calumniated my Sermon at <hi>Pinners Hall,</hi> are vindicated by ſuch a Doctor of the Church.</p>
                  <p>3. I yet conclude, that if this <hi>One Mans Writings</hi> do not convince the Reader, of the <hi>Sin and Danger</hi> of Allarming Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another, as Adverſaries to great and neceſſary Doctrines, on the account of meer <hi>Words</hi> not <hi>underſtood,</hi> for want of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs and skill in the expreſſive Art, <hi>I take him to be utterly unexcuſable.</hi>

            <head>A POSTSCRIPT, ABOUT <hi>Mr.</hi> DANVERS'<hi>s</hi> Laſt BOOK.</head>
            <p>WHen this Book was coming out of the Preſs, I received another Book of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> againſt Infants Baptiſm, in which he mentioneth Dr. <hi>Tullies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> what a <hi>Papiſt</hi> I am, in his <hi>Juſtif Paul.</hi> (with Dr. <hi>Pierces</hi> former Charges) and lamenting that no more yet but <hi>one Dr. Tully</hi> hath <hi>come forth to Encounter me,</hi> Epiſt. and Pag. 224. The peruſal of that Book (with Mr. <hi>Tombs ſhort Reflections</hi>) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth me to ſay but this inſtead of any further Confutation.</p>
            <p>That it is (as the former) ſo full of falſe Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations ſet off with the greateſt Audacity (even a few Lines of my own about our meeting at Saint <hi>James</hi>'s left with the Clerk, groſly falſified) and former falſifications partly juſtified, and partly paſt over, and his moſt paſſionate Charges ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

upon Miſtakes, and managed by Miſreports, ſometime of <hi>Words,</hi> ſometime of the <hi>Senſe,</hi> and ſometime of <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi>; in ſhort, it is ſuch a bundle of <hi>Miſtake, Fierceneſs</hi> and <hi>Confidence,</hi> that I take it for too <hi>uſeleſs</hi> and <hi>unpleaſant</hi> a Work to give the World a particular Detection of theſe Evils. If I had ſo little to do with my Time as to write it, I ſuppoſe that few would find leiſure to read it: And I deſire no more of the willing Reader, then ſeriouſly to peruſe my Book (<hi>More Reaſons for Infants Church-memberſhip</hi>) with his, and to examine the Authors about whoſe Words or Senſe we differ. Or if any would be Informed at a cheaper rate, he may read Mr. <hi>Barrets</hi> Fifty <hi>Queries</hi> in two ſheets. And if Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> revile me, for not tranſcribing or anſwering more of his <hi>Great Book,</hi> when I tell the Reader that I <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to have the Book before him,</hi> and am not bound to tranſcribe ſuch a Volume already in Print, and that I anſwer as much as I think needs an Anſwer, leaving the reſt as I found it to the Judgment of each Reader, he may himſelf take this for a <hi>Reply</hi>; but I muſt judg of it as it is.</p>
            <p>I find but one thing in the Book that needeth any other Anſwer, than to peruſe what is already Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Fiſher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Haggar,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> did: Let any Man read Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> Anſwer to me, yea and that Paſſage by him now cited, and ſee whether there be a word of denial: Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> or <hi>Haggar</hi> I never ſaw: Their Books I had ſeen, but never read two Leaves to my remembrance of Mr. <hi>Fiſhers,</hi> though I numbered it with thoſe that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on that Subject, as well I might: I knew his Education and his Friends, and I ſaw the Great Volume before he turned <hi>Quaker,</hi> but I thought it enough to read Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and others that wrote before him, but I read not him, nor all Mr. <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars</hi>: If I had, I had not taken them for compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of a fact <hi>far from them,</hi> and that <hi>three years</hi> after: Could they ſay, that <hi>no one ever did ſo?</hi> The truth is that three years after, miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my words, as if I had affirmed it to be <hi>their ordinary practice</hi> (as you may read in them) which I never did, nor thought, they vehemently deny this: (And ſuch <hi>heedleſs reading</hi> occaſioneth many of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Accuſations). I never ſaid that <hi>no Man ever denied it</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I have not read <hi>all that ever was written,</hi> nor ſpoken with all the World: But <hi>no Man ever denied it to me,</hi> nor did I <hi>ever read any that denied it.</hi> And in a matter of Fact, if that Fame be not credible, which is of things <hi>Late</hi> and <hi>Near,</hi> and not <hi>Contradicted</hi> by <hi>any one</hi> of the <hi>moſt intereſſed Perſons themſelves,</hi> no not by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> himſelf, we muſt ſurceaſe humane Converſe: Yet do I not thence undertake that the ſame was true, either of <hi>thoſe Perſons,</hi> or ſuch as other Writers beyond Sea have ſaid it off. I <hi>ſaw not</hi> any one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> or any other in <hi>River</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by <hi>Dipping at Age:</hi> If you <hi>do no ſuch thing,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:45239:159"/>
I am ſorry that I believed it, and will recant it. Had <hi>I not ſeen</hi> a <hi>Quaker</hi> go naked through <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> at the Aſſizes, and read the <hi>Ranters</hi> Letters full of Oathes, I could have proved neither of them. And yet I know not where ſo long after to find my Witneſſes: I abhor Slanders, and receiving ill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports unwarrantably: I well know that this is not their ordinary Practice: The <hi>Quakers</hi> do not thoſe things now, which many did at the riſing of the Sect; and if I could, I would believe they never did them.</p>
            <p>2. This Book of Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> with the reſt of the ſame kind, increaſe my hatred of the <hi>Diſputing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious</hi> way of writing, and my trouble that the Cauſe of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> hath ſo oft put on me a neceſſity to write in a Diſputing way, againſt the Writings of ſo many Aſſailants.</p>
            <p>3. It increaſeth my Grief for the Caſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yea of well-meaning godly Chriſtians, who are unable to judg of many Controverſies agitated, otherwiſe than by ſome Glimpſes of poor Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the eſteem which they have of the Perſons which do manage them, and indeed take their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions upon truſt from thoſe whom they moſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and value; and yet can ſo hardly know whom to follow, whilſt the groſſeſt Miſtakes are ſet off with as great confidence and holy pretence, as the greateſt Truths. O how much ſhould Chriſtians be pitied, that muſt go through ſo great Temptations!</p>
            <p>4. It increaſeth my Reſolution, had I longer to live, to converſe with Men that I would <hi>profit,</hi> or <hi>profit</hi> by, either as a <hi>Learner</hi> hearing what they <hi>have</hi> to ſay, without importunate Contradiction, or as a <hi>Teacher</hi> if they deſire to Learn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of me: A <hi>School</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:45239:159"/>
way may do ſomething to increaſe Knowledg; but <hi>drenching Men,</hi> and <hi>ſtriving</hi> with them, doth but ſet them on a fiercer ſtriving againſt the Truth: And when they that have need of ſeven and ſeven years Schooling more, under ſome clear well ſtudied Teacher, are made Teachers themſelves, and then turned looſe into the World (as <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes) to militate <hi>for</hi> and <hi>with</hi> their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> what muſt the Church ſuffer by ſuch Contenders?</p>
            <p>5. It increaſeth my diſlike of that Sectarian di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding hurtful Zeal, which is deſcribed <hi>James</hi> 3. and abateth <hi>my</hi> wonder at the rage of Perſecutors: For I ſee that the ſame Spirit maketh the ſame kind of Men, even when they moſt cry out againſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and ſeparate furtheſt from them.</p>
            <p>6. It reſolveth me more to enquire leſs after the Anſwers to Mens <hi>Books</hi> than I have done: And I ſhall hereafter think never the worſe of a Mans writings, for hearing that they are anſwered: For I ſee it is not only eaſie for a <hi>Talking Man</hi> to <hi>talk on,</hi> and to <hi>ſay ſomething for</hi> or <hi>againſt any thing,</hi> but it is <hi>hard</hi> for them to <hi>do otherwiſe,</hi> even to hold their <hi>Tongues,</hi> or <hi>Pens,</hi> or <hi>Peace:</hi> And when I change this Mind, I muſt give the greateſt <hi>belief</hi> to <hi>Women</hi> that will talk moſt, or to them that <hi>live longeſt,</hi> and ſo are like to have the laſt word, or to them that can train up militant Heirs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to defend them when they are dead, and ſo propagate the Contention. If a ſober Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt and ſecond writing (yea of <hi>poſitive Principles</hi>) will not inform me, I ſhall have little hope to be much the wiſer for all the reſt.</p>
            <p>7. I am fully ſatisfied that even good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45239:160"/>
with odious faults and injuries in one another, and be habituated to a ready and eaſie forbearing and forgiving one another. I will not ſo much as deſcribe or denominate Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Citations of Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> to prove my Popery and Crimes, nor his paſſages about the Wars, and about my Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Self-contradictions, and Repentances, leſt I do that which ſavoureth not of Forgiveneſs: O what need have we all of Divine Forgiveneſs!</p>
            <p>8. I ſhall yet leſs believe what any Mans <hi>Opinion</hi> (yea or Practice) is by his <hi>Adverſaries Sayings, Collections, Citations,</hi> or moſt vehement Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than ever I have done, though the Report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pretend to never ſo much Truth, and pious Zeal.</p>
            <p>9. I ſhall leſs truſt a <hi>confounding ignorant</hi> Reader or Writer, that hath not an accurate <hi>defining</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Underſtanding, and hath not a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, exerciſed, diſcerning</hi> Knowledg than ever I have done; and eſpecially if he be engaged in a <hi>Sect</hi> (which alas, how few parts of the Chriſtian World eſcape!) For I here (and in many others) ſee, that you have no way to ſeem Orthodox with ſuch, but to run quite into the contrary Extream: And if I write againſt both Extreams, I am taken by ſuch Men as this, but to be <hi>for both and againſt both,</hi> and to <hi>contradict my ſelf.</hi> When I write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſecutors, I am one of the Sectaries, and when I write againſt the Sectaries, I am of the Perſecutors ſide: If I belie not the Prelatiſts, I am a Conformiſt: If I belie not the <hi>Anabaptiſts, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants,</hi> &amp;c.
