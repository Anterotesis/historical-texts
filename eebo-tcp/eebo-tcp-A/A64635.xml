            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The two beasts</hi> in Cap. 13. verse
11. are plainly distinguished, and that
distinction must necessarily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

Likewise for the <hi>great</hi> beast men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

in the eighth and eleventh verses,
(which is the last head of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
can be no other but the second
beast mentioned in the thirteenth
Chapter, verse 22 who revived the

this is <hi>Singular,</hi> but such as it is, <hi>I</hi>
will not conceal from you; The
<hi>Pontifices</hi> among the ancient <hi>Rom.</hi>
(as <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus,</hi> noteth in
his second Book of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
were obnoxious to no other
jurisdiction, neither were bound to
render account of their doings to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
they were only at the command
of the <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
was so great that the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
thought it inconvenient that
this Supremacy should be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to any other, therefore by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeing
it to themselves, and anex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to their <hi>imperial</hi> Crown, they
did by this means extinguish the
<hi>Spiritual</hi> Magistracie, and in a sort
extinguish the <hi>solemne</hi> Magistracy,

which (under the 5. former heads)
was distinguished from all other
superiour Governments, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted

and Abominations of the Earth.</hi>
And in the rest of the Chapter the
Mystery of the Woman, and the

declared and one thing amongst
the rest,<note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> that she <hi>sitts on seven hills,</hi>)
the Conclusion is,<note place="margin">Verse 18.</note> 
               <hi>That she is the
great Citie which raigneth over the
Kings of the Earth.</hi> In this Chapter
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> proceeds in the same
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56045:24"/>
ter, and tells, how he saw first a
mighty Angel descending from
Heaven and proclaiming the fall
of this <hi>Babylon,</hi> (Verse 2. 3.) and
towards the end of the Chapter, to
confirm the matter wih a sign, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
mighty Angel takes up a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
and throwes it into the Sea,
with this word with like violence
<hi>Babylon shall be thrown, and no more
be found.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 21.</note> In the middest between
the Voyces of these two Angels is
inserted a long Speech, uttered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

at this fourth Verse which I
have now read and extending to

               <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> partly descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
her pride and security going

bringing in as it were the Funeral

            <p>This is the Order now for the
meaning of the words, that shall
appeare best by resolving three
Questions. 1. <hi>Whose this Voyce is?
2. To whom it speaks?</hi> And 3. <hi>What?</hi>
We need not be long to seek <hi>Who it
is</hi> that speaks; For both those that
speak before and after are expresly
called Angels, and he that now
speaks lacks that Addition, and the
interest that he challengeth in those
that are spoken to, calling them
<hi>My People,</hi> sheweth plainly (to
use the words of our blessed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
in his speech to <hi>Peter</hi> at the
Sea of <hi>Tiberias) It is the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 21. 7</note> And
albeit those relations between the
Lord and his People are often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Scripture, without any
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56045:25"/>
restraint to any one person in the
blessed Trinity, yet because he that
here speaks telleth of the <hi>Lord Gods
judgeing the great Citie,</hi> Verse the 8.
As of another and third person,
<hi>Strong is the Lord God that judgeth
her.</hi> And again, Verse 20. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Prophets and Apostles,
saith, <hi>God hath avenged you on her.</hi>
It is evident that he who hear

            <p>That <hi>Babel</hi> was a City in <hi>Chaldea,</hi>

Glory of Kingdomes</hi> (as it is called

this is the <hi>literal</hi> Babel, whereunto
there is a reference in this Text,
What now is the <hi>Mystical</hi> Babylon
which here Gods People are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to leave. Questionlesse some
City answering to this, in <hi>State,</hi> in

God, neither must we take it for the
buildings onely and houses, but
for the State also and Policy; as

lead us.</p>
            <p>There be two Opinions recited
by Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this

But this hath no manner of

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56045:29"/>
of the Text: This is not seated
on <hi>seven</hi> hills, nor hath it seven

to come, nor will those
things that are foretold of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Babel</hi> agree to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and is rejected by the
<hi>learned</hi> of that side: And himselfe
names another, (which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
for the better) <hi>viz.</hi> that
here by <hi>Babel</hi> is meant the <hi>Citie of
Rome.</hi> As that was in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi>
time, for as he shewes out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
Look <hi>as old</hi> Babylon was
the head of that Empire, whose
King persecuted and lead into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
the People of God, so
did <hi>Rome</hi> then: This is not onely
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> judgement, but <hi>Salmeron,
Viegas,</hi> and others of that side <hi>that
Babylon is Rome.</hi> They do well
to yield to the clear evidence of
truth so clear in deed as it would be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56045:30"/>
too shameful <hi>impudence</hi> to deny it;

estate. That before it received Christs
Faith, and that which shall be in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs

saith in this and the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
<hi>It shall revolt from the Bishop of</hi>
Rome, <hi>and from the Faith</hi> (as he
saith) <hi>a little before Antichrists com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or at least at the beginning of his

and then by the ten Kings menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the former Chapter (who
had given their Kingdomes unto
her;) shall she be ruined and burnt,
<hi>&amp;c</hi> In this Exposition, <hi>the revolt
that he tells of from the Obedience of
the See of</hi> Rome, is a Fancy of his
own, and hath not the least ground
in St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Vision, That the revolt
<hi>from the Faith,</hi> whereof the Apostle

            <p>For the better clearing whereof,

               <hi>Angels</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
more distinctly, to see whether
it doe agree to the present estate of
<hi>Rome</hi> or no: The Angel tells <hi>Iohn</hi>
in the last Verse of the former
Chapter, <hi>The woman which thou
sawest is the great City which reigneth
over the Kings of the Earth,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(Verse 5.) upon her forehead
is a name written, <hi>Mysterie Babylon
the great.</hi> Touching this greatness
I may spare my pains to speak
much, there is a learned Book of
<hi>Iustus Lipsius</hi> which he intitles <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miranda,</hi>
marvells, touching the
greatness of <hi>Rome,</hi> not long after in
concurrence thereto, there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
made by <hi>Thomas Stapleton</hi> our
Countreyman Professour at <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaine,</hi>
which he intitles <hi>Vere admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa,</hi>
Marvels indeed, touching
the greatness of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> wherein by comparison he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56045:33"/>
indeavours to shew that for large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Extent, strength</hi> and <hi>power</hi>
over Princes themselves, <hi>honour</hi>
yielded unto it, the greatness and
magnificence of the <hi>Romane Church</hi>
doth far surpass the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.
These two books were both print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, and set forth at <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> 1600. as if

            <p>
               <hi>For the</hi> reigning over the
Kings of the Earth <hi>by this great
City, (which is another point
of the Angels description.) It is true
that heathen</hi> Rome <hi>had anciently in
the borders and confines of the
state, sundry Kings that held their
Kingdomes of her, Such were the</hi>
Herods, Aretas <hi>and</hi> Agrippa <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the</hi> New Testament; <hi>but
these were neither in number nor

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56045:34"/>
their subjection to be compared
with those that the</hi> now Rome <hi>reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
over:</hi> And no great marvel if the
Roman Emperour armed with thirty or
fourty Legions had many Kings at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
(<hi>saith</hi> Stapleton) but that the
Pope being altogether unarmed, should
give Lawes to the Kings of the Earth:
and either advance them to their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
or depose them, who would not
account worthy of great marvel? true,
<hi>but the Angel</hi> shewes us the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">Verse 12.</note>
               <hi>the</hi> ten hornes which thou sawest
are ten Kings which have received no<note place="margin">Verse 17.</note>
Kingdome as yet but receive power, as
Kings at once with the beast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his
Will, and to agree and to give their
Kingdome unto the beast, until the
Word of God shall be fulfilled.</p>

               <hi>great City, where the bodies of two

the Lord was Crucified,</hi> since in the

<hi>Deputy,</hi> and to a Romane
<hi>Death,</hi> our Lord was put, But this
doth no less stick by <hi>Christian</hi> Rome
unto this day, to be <hi>drunken with
the bloud of Saints and Martyrs of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi>
Let Histories be turned, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56045:41"/>
an exact account taken, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands (otherwise good
<hi>Christians</hi>) have been slain and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacred
merely for his pleasure sake,
And because they would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to her Obedience; I think it
will very evidently appeare that
they are imcomparably more then
all those that suffered Martyrdome
for the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion under
<hi>Heathen</hi> Romes <hi>persecution.</hi> To
omit those whom as an <hi>Imperious
Harlot</hi> she hath caused to be <hi>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
for calling her name in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>Thus you see the Description of
<hi>Babylon</hi> doth no lesse agree to the
<hi>present, then the old Heathen</hi> Rome,
the <hi>great City, her command over the
Kings of the Earth; Her inchanting</hi>
Cup, <hi>Her wantonness</hi> and <hi>delicacy,
Her arrogancy</hi> and <hi>pride:</hi> Lastly,
that <hi>bloudy</hi> and <hi>bloud thirsty Cruelty
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56045:41"/>
against the worshippers of Christ,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
by her, and (which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to observe) by her alone;
for in no other part of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
world you shall find it.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, since neither
<hi>Heathen</hi> Rome <hi>onely,</hi> as she was
heathen (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have
it) can be <hi>Babylon, nor partly Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and partly Antichristan,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from the Pope, with a gap
of a thousand years between (as
<hi>Viegas</hi> divineth) And the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
that the Holy Ghost sets upon
<hi>Babylon</hi> doth no lesse, but rather
more agree to the present <hi>Pontifical</hi>
Rome, then to the old <hi>Imperial.</hi>
It is the <hi>falsely</hi> termed Christian, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Rome, which
is the <hi>Babylon,</hi> out of which Gods
People are called.</p>
            <p>And <hi>how</hi> they are <hi>to go out of her,</hi>
it rests to be considered: <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56045:42"/>
cites Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> to prove that
it is <hi>Corde non Corpore,</hi> not in place
but affection; But the Temple of
Gods people departing from <hi>Babel</hi>
would seemto imply both; And the
rather because this great City is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 8</note>

               </hi> and <hi>Egypt:</hi> now
such was the departure of <hi>Lott</hi> out
of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Israel out of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true that by <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Edict
Gods people were permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into their own Countrey to
the place where the Lords worship
was then <hi>fixed;</hi> Now there is no
such place specially appointed, as
our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> shews in his

But certainly if any of Gods people
cannot by separation in judgement
and affection so live, as not to be
<hi>partakers of the sins</hi> of Babylon, they
are to go out bodily also, and in no

Gods people are warned to do, even

reason which confirms this charge
of going out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is drawn
from the danger of participation <hi>in
her sins, and in her Plagues,</hi>

He that cannot give a true defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

But if (as by the whole stream of

            <p>Yea will some man say, But

that is the <hi>School Doctrine,</hi> but the

thou whatsoever thou dost or sufferest,

               <hi>But it is no wonder,
those things which I
have said, have not so
clear or certain an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
in the writings
of the Fathers; for it
was then a mystery of
iniquity; which wrought,
the book of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56045:61"/>
was as yet sealed up; And it is
a most true speech, every prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
is a riddle, while 'tis not
fulfilled. And though those Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
very much excelled us in all
manner of gifts, and specially in
the holinesse of life, yet no man
hath cause to wonder, that all these
things did not seem so clear to
them, as by the grace of God they
are now to us, who do see this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
now consummated daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, while <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in its purity, the Fathers
of that age, might well have
wondred with great admiration,
as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> himself did, and
look upon it as incredulous, that
it should have degenerated into
that pride, Idolatry, Murder, and
become the <hi>Mother of all abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi>
&amp;c. even as we would at

abounded with writers against it,

Religion, in opposition to

upon him a <hi>spirit</hi> of prophesie, in

<hi>advancer of Popery,</hi> and be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>over-run</hi> with it, and become a

Doctor <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> in his

Observations upon the 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.
and other places gives us the like
Article, agreed upon in <hi>Synodo Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionali
Gapensi. Anno</hi> 1604. which
hath very little or no difference
from the former, and so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
to be repeated. Which do
fully agree with the <hi>Synod of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
by by the <hi>Arch-bishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
and the rest of the Clergy
there in the Convocation holden
at <hi>Dublin, 1615. num. 80. viz.
The Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>is so farre
from being the supreme head of
the Vniversal Church of Christ,
that his works and doctrine, do
plainly discovar him to be the man
of sin, foretold in holy Scripture,
whom the Lord shall consnme with
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56045:79"/>
the spirit of his mouth, and abolish
with the brightnesse of his coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>former Synod</hi> may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be undervalued with some,
by bearing the name of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;</hi>
but seeing it consents with
the <hi>latter</hi> which was <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi>
why may it not be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to a further mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
betweene them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters. And it stands but
with justice; that if <hi>Presbytery</hi>
have had a hand in the <hi>match</hi> of
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> with <hi>Popery,</hi> (which
seems to have been without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of parties) it should upon
this evidence be the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in assisting in the <hi>divorce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in regard that above-said
<hi>Article</hi> of <hi>the Church of Ireland,</hi>
confirmed by the <hi>judgement</hi> of
the late <hi>Primate,</hi> hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against by Doctor <hi>Heylene</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:56045:79"/>
for that (as he saith) there is <hi>no
such doctrine in the book of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
nor in any publick monument,
or record of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
but the contrary rather.</hi>

shall cite some passages out of the
book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the book of <hi>Articles,</hi>
as a larger declaration of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and leave it to the <hi>Readers</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In the third part of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of good works, speaking
against the Popish singing of
<hi>Trentals,</hi> and the <hi>superstitious</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to serve the Papacy, these
words are as followeth: <hi>viz. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
be to God, who did put light
in the heart of King</hi> Henry <hi>the
eighth; to put away all such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions,
and Pharisaical Sects, by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56045:80"/>
Antichrist invented,</hi> &amp;c. which
can be meant of no other, but the
<hi>See of Rome;</hi> by the words not
long after. viz. <hi>Let us rehearse
some other kinds of Papistical su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,
&amp;c.</hi> In the second
part of the Sermon of salvation,
speaking against the <hi>Popish opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of justification by works;</hi>
these words are as followeth.
<hi>Iustification is not the office of
man, but of God; for man cannot
make himself righteous by his own
works, neither in part, nor in the
whole, for that were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
arrogancy</hi> and <hi>presumption</hi> of
man, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> could set up
against God, etc. and so accounts
it not the doctrine of a <hi>Christian,</hi>
that sets forth <hi>Christs glory,</hi> but
of him that is an <hi>adversary</hi> to
<hi>Christ,</hi> and his Gospel; and a setter
forth of <hi>mans vain-glory,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56045:80"/>
And that passage in the third
part of the Sermon against the
<hi>perill of Idolatry,</hi> p. 69. I leave
to the Readers judgement, if the
sense can be understood, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then of the <hi>See of Rome,</hi> in
these words following. viz. <hi>Now
concerning (popish) excessive deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Images and Idols, with paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
gilding, adorning with preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vestures, pearles and stones,
what is it else but for the further
provocation and inticement to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
fornication; which the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Church, understandeth well
enough. For she being indeed, not
only an harlot (as the Scripture
calls her) but also a foule, filthy,
old harlot (for she is indeed of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
yeares) and understanding
her lack of nature and true beauty,
and great lothsomnesse, which of
her self she hath; she doth (after
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56045:81"/>
the custome of such harlots) paint
her self, and deck and tire her self
with gold, pearle, stone, and all
kind of pretious jewels, that she
shining with the outward beauty
and glory of them, may please the
foolish fantasie of fond lovers, and
so entice them to spiritual forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with her. Who if they saw
her (I will not say naked) but in
simple apparel, would abhorre her,
as the foulest, and filthiest harlot
that ever was seen; According as
appeareth by the description of the
garnishing of the great strumpet of
all strumpets, the Mother of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
set forth by Saint Iohn in
his Revelation</hi> (Apoc. 17.) <hi>who
by her glory provoked the Princes
of the earth, to commit whoredome
with her,</hi> &amp;c, and it followeth,
pag. 77. <hi>And it is not enough to
deck Idols, but at the last, come in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56045:81"/>
the Priests themselves likewise
decked with gold and pearle, and
with a solemn pace, they pass forth
before these golden puppets, and
fall down to the ground on their
marrow-bones before the sehonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Idols, and then rising up again,
offer up odours and incense to
them:</hi> &amp;c. He that reads the
whole, cannot judge of it to be
meant otherwise, then of the
<hi>Papacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if the</hi> fifth and sixth part
of the Sermon against wilful rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
<hi>be viewed, there will be
found such a large narration of
the pride and ambition of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of</hi> Rome, <hi>that there will not
need any further help to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of that 2 Thes. 2. to him,
which thus beginneth, viz.</hi> After
that ambition and desire of domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
entred once into Ecclesiastical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56045:82"/>
whose greatnesse (after the
doctrine and the example of our
Saviour) should chiefly stand in
humbling themselves; And that
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did by intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ambition challenge, not only
to be the head of all the Church
dispersed throughout the world,
but also to be Lord of all kingdoms
of the world, as is expressely set
forth in the book of his own Canon-Lawes.
<hi>He</hi> became at once the
spoyler and destroyer both of the
Church, which is the kingdom of
our Saviour Christ, and of the
Christian Empire, and all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
kingdomes, as an universal Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
over all. <hi>The particulars of
whose actions to that end, are
there related. viz.</hi> The Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> stirring up subjects to rebell
against their Soveraigne Lords,
even the Son against the Father,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56045:82"/>
pronouncing such Schismaticks,
and persecuting them, who resused
to acknowledge his above-said
challenge of supreme authority over
them; discharging them from their
oath of fidelity made not only to the
Emperour, but to other Kings and
Princes throughout Christendome.
The most cruell and bloody wars
raised amongst Christian Princes of
all kingdoms: the horrible murder
of infinite thousands of Christian
men, being slain by Christians, the
losse of so many great Cities, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
Dominions, and Kingdomes,
sometimes possessed by Christians in
Asia, Affrick, and Europe; The
miserable fall of the Empire, and
Church of Greece, sometime the
most flourishing part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
into the hands of the Turks;
The lamentable diminishing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
and ruine of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56045:83"/>
and all by the practice and
procurement of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> chiefly, which is in the
Histories and Chronicles written
by the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
and friends to be seen,
claiming also to have divers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Kings to their vassals,
liege men, and subjects, &amp;c. beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
themselves more like Kings
and Emperours in all things, then
remained like Priests, Bishops and
Ecclesiastical; <hi>or, (as they would
be called</hi>) spiritual persons in any
one thing at all, <hi>&amp;c. and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with an exhortation of all
good subjects,</hi> knowing those the
speciall instruments of the Devill,
to the stirring up of all Rebellion,
to avoid and flee them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is not this a full description of
the pride of</hi> that man of sinne.
2 <hi>Thess. 2. in</hi> exalting himselfe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56045:83"/>
above all Kings and Princes, <hi>and
that</hi> son of perdition (<hi>being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood</hi>
actively:) <hi>who was the
cause of the</hi> perdition, <hi>or losse of
so many thousands of Christian
mens lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the</hi> sixth part of the
same Sermon, <hi>you have a more
particular relation of the</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi>'s blood-shed, (<hi>accoding
to the description of that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
Revel. 17. 6.) in these words.
viz.</hi> And as these ambitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> have
overflowed all <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
with streams of Christian blood,
shed by the rebellims of ignorant
subjects against their naturall
Lords and Emperours, whom they
have stirred thereunto by false
pretences: so is there no Countrey
in Christendome, which by the like
means of false pretences, hath not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56045:84"/>
been over-sprinkled with the blood
of subjects, by rebellion against their
naturall Soveraigns, stirred up by
the same Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>And in conclusion, as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
often entitles the Bishops of
Rome,</hi> unsatiable wolfes, <hi>and
their Adherents,</hi> Romish greedy
wolfes; <hi>so doth it in speciall</hi> call
the See of <hi>Rome, the</hi> Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
beast, in these words; <hi>viz.</hi>
The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bruit blindnesse, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and superstition of the
English in King <hi>Johns</hi> time, <hi>and
how much they were inclined</hi>
to worship the Babilonical beast of
Rome, and to fear all his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and causelesse curses, he
abused them thus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have transcribed these the
more largely out of the Book of</hi>
Homilies, <hi>both that such as have
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56045:84"/>
rejected them as</hi> Popish <hi>may see
their errour, and those that now
so much favour the</hi> See <hi>of</hi> Rome,
<hi>that they call such language</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<hi>may have their</hi> mouthes stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
<hi>being it is from the</hi> mouth
of the Church of England <hi>in her
Homilies, which is a good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for her</hi> sons <hi>to say after her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let the Reader judge whether
these passages do not confirme,
rather then contradict, or</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
(<hi>as Doctor</hi> Heylene <hi>saith)
to the</hi> Articles of Ireland, <hi>and
the</hi> Primates <hi>judgement of the</hi>
See of Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall only alledge one pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
more, and that is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the second part of</hi> the
Sermon for Whit-sunday. <hi>viz.</hi>
Wicked and nought were the Popes
and Prelates of <hi>Rome</hi> for the most
part, as doth well appear by the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56045:85"/>
story of their lives, and therefore
worthily accounted among the
number of false Prophets, and
false Christs, which deceived the
world a long while, the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
us from their Tyranny and
pride, that they may never enter
into this Vineyard again; but that
they may be utterly confounded,
and put to flight in all parts of the
world. And he of his great mercy
so work, <hi>that the Gospel of his
Son may be truly preached to the
beating down of</hi> sin, death, the
Pope, the Devill, and all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Antichrist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This latter passage is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by Doctor <hi>Heylene,</hi> as an
evidence, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> either
<hi>here,</hi> or <hi>any where else,</hi> in the
book of Articles or Homilies,
which how the force of it can be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56045:85"/>
extended so farre beyond its
<hi>own sphere,</hi> both not appeare:
For his principal argument, that
he finds here the <hi>Pope and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
distinguished as much as the
Devil and the Pope.</hi> 'Tis <hi>answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
The destiuction here is not
between the Pope and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
but between him and <hi>his
Antichristian kingdom;</hi> for the
words are not, the Pope, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
and <hi>Antichrist;</hi> but, <hi>and all the
kingdome of Antichrist.</hi> That
Universality (<hi>all</hi>) comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both head and members.
And if we should allow a <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate,</hi>
(in the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Devill</hi>)
for the government of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
one as the <hi>visible</hi> head, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as the <hi>invisible,</hi> or the one him
that <hi>reigneth;</hi> the other <hi>by whom
he receiveth power so to do:</hi> (Rev.
13. 4.) both might be thus owned
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56045:86"/>
without infringing the title of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Howsoever 'tis not the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
from such <hi>niceties</hi> in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of words (which the book of
<hi>Homilies,</hi> are not strict in, as might
be shewed in several instances)
but the observation of the <hi>scope</hi>
and drist of the place, the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring</hi>
it with others, the <hi>concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
of the judgement of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
eminent <hi>Bishops</hi> afore-cited,
(who cannot be imagined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
against the doctrine of it)
will carry the sense of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
with the <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biassed</hi>
Reader: and so much for
the book of <hi>Homilies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto which I might also adde
the opinion of some <hi>learned</hi> men,
liveing and dying within the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
communion of the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> To instance onely in
<hi>Padrio Paulo,</hi> who wrote the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story

            <p>I am not ignorant of other conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
by learned men, signifying
a threefold Baptisme. <hi>Sanguinis,
flaminis, fluminis,</hi> or, the <hi>thrice</hi>

of persons coming to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
the <hi>two</hi> several times in the
year, in the Ancient Church set
apart for it, Easter and Pentecost,
called <hi>dies baptismatum,</hi> which
is <hi>Calvins</hi> and <hi>Bezaes;</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the double act in it, the
<hi>inward</hi> Baptisme of Christ, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56045:93"/>
               <hi>outward</hi> baptisme of <hi>Iohn;</hi> that
is to say, the <hi>Ministers;</hi> which are
Mr.<note n="a" place="margin">Answ. to <hi>Rhemist.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. on <hi>N. T</hi> upon this place.</note> 
               <hi>Cartwrights</hi> words upon
the place, who also saith, <hi>by a
trope both Sacraments are here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under one,</hi> but I conceive, that
which we first gave, is the best;
And 'tis observable, that the
Apostle saith, <hi>the doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismes,</hi>
'tis not the absolute <hi>want</hi>
of it, when it cannot be had,
but the rejecting of the <hi>doctrine</hi>
of it that damnes. 'Tis possible
that some of those <hi>three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi>
converted by Saint <hi>Peters</hi>
Sermon, might have died before
they could come to the water,
and yet be saved; but if they had
<hi>rejected the doctrine</hi> of it, when
they were bad to be baptized,
like the Pharisees <hi>rejecting the
Counsel of God</hi> against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or like <hi>Naman</hi> who despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56045:94"/>
the river <hi>Iordan,</hi> I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p>A well ordered discipline is
the <hi>ornament</hi> of the Church, but
upon the <hi>confession</hi> and <hi>doctrine</hi>
of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> it was to be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
in which sence the Apostles
and Prophets in their <hi>doctrines</hi>
are called the <hi>foundation</hi> of it;
Jesus Christ being the <hi>chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
stone,</hi> and (as some think) is
the sence of that, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 14.
that in the <hi>twelve foundations</hi>
were the names of the <hi>twelve
Apostles,</hi> in relation to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinals;
So much for that.</p>
            <p>Now the next is, the doctrine
<hi>of laying on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of hands.</hi> Here is
the great question, What is meant
by it? That it is a <hi>Fundamentall,</hi>
cannot be denied; if Baptisme be
one, this must be another: see in
the verse how like <hi>twins</hi> they
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56045:94"/>
are borne and bred under the
same roof, And 'tis observable,
that in the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
the plural number, doctrines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
to both.</p>
            <p>In the search of several Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
I find these two exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
most worthy of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>The first is, <hi>Confirmation</hi> of
children after Baptisme, which
hath somewhat of <hi>Antiquity</hi> for it,
most of the Writers of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> incline that
way, and even <hi>Calvin</hi> is of that
mind also, and in his Comment
upon this place, stands much for
it, and wisheth it had not been
laid aside; <hi>hodie retinenda pura
institutio, superstitio autem corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda;</hi>
and produceth this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of confirming of children
in the Primitive times, to be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56045:95"/>
they were then <hi>baptized,</hi>
but I conceive it cannot be the
sence, for this reason; because 'tis
not a <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> and hard to
prove, it was then (like <hi>Baptisme</hi>
and the rest) esteemed to be of
a necessary use and belief in the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Church, according to
that of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Magnopere cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum est ut id teneamus, quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus creditum est, hoc est enim verè &amp; propriè Catholicum. contr. haeresin. cap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>That
is, to be held for a Catholick ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which hath been believed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, alwayes, and by all;</hi> And
our Church saith, <hi>children bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
have all things necessary to
their salvation;</hi> The Papists that
hold it to be a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> do not
say 'tis a <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> and when
it was observed by us, we took it
to be only an ancient laudable
<hi>custome</hi> of the Church, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was so in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time,
in the Church of the Hebrewes,
it doth not appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:56045:95"/>The second Exposition is, that it
should be meant <hi>an ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi>
which clearly in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s
time we find was wont to be by
<hi>laying on of hands.</hi> This is <hi>Pareus</hi>
his sense upon this place. It was
(saith he)<note n="a" place="margin">Initialis doctrina de mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterio Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae quia tum ordinabantur per impositio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem manuum.</note> 
               <hi>an initial doctrine,
concerning the Ministery of the
Church then ordained by imposition
of hands;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Totum munus Prophericum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Gualterus</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon this place, saith, <hi>In
this is contained the whole fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Preachers,</hi> &amp;c. designed
unto it by <hi>imposition of hands:</hi>
But none so full as Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>
in his answer to the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
upon this place, his words
are these. viz. <hi>By the imposition
of hands the Apostle meaneth no
Sacrament, much lesse confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after Baptisme; but by a trope
or borrowed speech, the Ministers
of the Church; upon the which
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56045:96"/>
hands were laid, which appeareth
in that whosoever believeth not;
that there ought to be a Ministery
by order</hi> (or Ordination) <hi>to teach
and govern the Church; overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Christianity, whereas if Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of children were a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it is not; yet a man hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rest, and denying the use of
it, might notwithstanding be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
And some lines after, gives
us summarily the sense of this
verse, viz. <hi>to be the doctrine of the
Sacraments, and of the Ministery
of the Church:</hi> Ye see, in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
what a dangerous thing it
is, no lesse then the hazard of
their own salvation, to lay aside
an <hi>ordained</hi> Ministery, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the doctrine of it, which men
now frequently presume.</p>
            <p>And 'tis observable, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he useth, he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56045:96"/>
as a <hi>Maxime</hi> then in his time,
taken for granted; not to be
<hi>proved,</hi> but <hi>supposed;</hi> no man
then so much as questioning the
necessity of it, for though there
were then divers disputes about
<hi>discipline</hi> and ceremonies, (in
which this learned <hi>Authour</hi>
then appeared) yet both parties
esteemed alike of <hi>Ordination</hi> to
be a <hi>sacred institution,</hi> none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
to take upon them the
office of the Ministery without it;
Well, this I conceive to be the
sence here of <hi>laying on of hands,</hi>
viz. <hi>That it was a Principle of the
Catechisme taught to Christians at
their first reception, that there
was to be a successive ordination,
or setting apart of persons for the
Ministery, for an authorative
preaching of faith and repentance,
and administration of Sacraments,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56045:97"/>
called laying on of hands from
the outward rite; as the Lords
Supper, by breaking of bread; And
this was the judgement</hi> of the
most Reverend and learned <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of our Church, the late <hi>Arch-Bishop
of Armagh,</hi> which hath the
rather emboldned me to employ
my thoughts in the confirmation
of it; and surely, if it be a <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,</hi>
the knowledge of the
sense of it, is of a greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
then to be <hi>slighted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, it is considerable, how
well this doth sute with Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> expression elsewhere,
speaking of Ordination, 2 <hi>Tim.
1. 6. Stirre up the gift of God
that is in thee by the putting on of
my hands,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 14. <hi>neglect not
the gift that is in thee, given thee
with the laying on of the hands of
the Presbytery,</hi> both thus suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56045:97"/>
reconciled; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was
the <hi>principal,</hi> the Presbyters were
his <hi>assistants,</hi> according to the
constitutions and custome of our
Church in Ordination. The <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
is not to do it alone, but
with the assistance of at least <hi>three
or four of the Ministers,</hi> which
was after the pattern of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times; The injunction of
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for it, is accordingly.
2 <hi>Tim. 5. 22. Lay hands suddenly
on no man,</hi> i. e. ordain. And it is
the more observable, that all are
from <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Apostle,
it being one argument to prove
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was the Authour of
this <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> by the
use of this expression here, which
is not in the Epistles of any <hi>other</hi>
Apostle.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, we read of <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
gifts of tongues, &amp;c. given
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56045:98"/>
by <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
but they cannot be understood
here, for they were but <hi>temporary,</hi>
and ceased, like <hi>Scaffolds,</hi> which,
after the building of an house, are
taken down, but what is meant
here, must be as the <hi>foundation</hi>
which remains to the last, and
all falls with it, that agrees to an
<hi>Ordained Ministery,</hi> which must
continue for the preaching of
<hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of <hi>Sacraments</hi> to the <hi>end
of the world.</hi> In which sence is
that last speech of our Saviour.
<hi>Matth. 28. Lo, I am with you unto
the end of the world,</hi> it cannot be
limited to the persons of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
(with whose deaths those
Administrations did not expire)
but must be understood <hi>collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
of the whole body of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
then as it were <hi>in their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56045:98"/>
loines,</hi> who should <hi>succeed</hi> in
preaching, and Baptisme, and
through whom a successive <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
assistance of the spirit,</hi> is to
be transferred in and through
those, unto the worlds end. This
power of officiating, was <hi>powred
on the head of the Apostles,
and descendeth to the skirts of
their garments, in these dayes.</hi>
And how <hi>like</hi> a fundamental,
<hi>Ordination</hi> is, may easily appear;
it began at the foundation of the
Church, and was one of the <hi>first</hi>
stones laid in this Edifice, and it
must continue to the last, for as
the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is to continue
till the <hi>second coming</hi> of Christ, so
the Ministers of it have the same
term also (<hi>Ephes. 4. 13.) He gave
some Pastors, Teachers, &amp;c. Till
we all come unto a perfect man,
unto the measure of the Stature
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56045:99"/>
of the fullnesse of Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. Ye have a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>four or five</hi> stories high of
severall Acts and Ministrations;
but <hi>Ordination</hi> of a Ministery is
the Foundation, Salvation is at
the <hi>top</hi> of this <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ladder, but
Ordination at the <hi>bottome: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
will call on the name of the
Lord, shall be saved, but how shall
they call on him, on mhom they
have not believed? how shall they
believe on him, of whom they have
not heard? and how shall they hear
without a Preacher, and how shall
they preach, except they be sent?</hi> &amp;c.
See, praying, believing, hearing,
preaching, and then as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all, a <hi>Mission of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
for that end; what is said of
the Commandements of the Law,
(<hi>Iames 2.) he that offends in one,
is guilty of all;</hi> such is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56045:99"/>
of the principles of
the <hi>Gospel;</hi> break one link, and
all are endangered; He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
his <hi>Baptisme,</hi> renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
his <hi>Faith,</hi> into which he was
baptized, even the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of our Saviour signified
by it, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. Consider what ye
do in renouncing the <hi>Ministery by
whom ye were baptized, and have
believed</hi> (1 Cor. 3. 5.) if any effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
be in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the qualification &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
faculty of the person offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating,
see what hazard you run
in rejecting of such so ordained?</p>
            <p>Ye know the speech of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Matth. 23. 17. He that
swears by the Altar, sweareth
by it, and all things thereon;</hi>
and is not the contrary true, he
that despiseth the Altar, despiseth
not only that, but all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56045:100"/>
on it: If the Ordination or
Mission of the person through
Gods institution, be of any efficay
to what is officiated, I may leave
the application to your selves.</p>
            <p>Consider what ye do in a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
renouncing of an ordained
Ministery, as to Baptisme and
believing, through whom as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentals,
ye did partake of
them; <hi>If the foundation fall,
how can the building stand:</hi> As
ye see here Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes an
ordained Ministery, a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
principle of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So much for the sence of the
Text, what is meant <hi>by laying on
of hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Ordination be a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
principle, hence then
these 2 things may be inferred.</p>
            <p>1. A necessity of continuing an
ordained Ministery in the Church,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56045:100"/>
and the neglect of it to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derming
of the foundation of it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That</hi> Ordination is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an internal call from God, but
an externall from Man; <hi>for 'tis
denominated here from</hi> laying on
of hands.</p>
            <p>First <hi>a necessity</hi> of continuing
such a distinct Order and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
for preaching, and other
sacred Administratihns; This sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
would heretofore have been
accounted <hi>needlesse</hi> to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but it is necessary and <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
now, there being many set
against the very <hi>function,</hi> as if any
man might of himself assume it.
To such I shall represent these
considerations following. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That in all ages there have
been some persons set apart for
such divine Offices even <hi>before
the Law,</hi> or constitution of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:56045:101"/>
and the <hi>Levites;</hi> as since, see
some appointed, <hi>Exod. 19. 22.
Let the Priests which come near to
the Lord sanctify themselves,</hi>
(Chap. 24. 5.) called <hi>young men
of the Children of Israel,</hi> sent of
<hi>Moses,</hi> who <hi>offered the burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and sacrifice unto the Lord,</hi>
and this is usually interpreted to
be the <hi>First-borne,</hi> and that of the
<hi>principall</hi> of the families, instead
of which the <hi>Levites</hi> were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
taken, (see <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 12.)
And what a setled Priesthood
there was in <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi>
time to the <hi>Captivity;</hi> and after
it upon their return; who knows
not? see <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. A speech to
the Priests, and for that five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-yeer
gap betwixt the Old
Testament and the New, when
the <hi>Prophets</hi> ceased, yet a <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
continued, that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56045:101"/>
of God, then was not to put
to the charity of Passengers, as
beggars are by the high way, but
some were appropriated to it; <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
that forsook the <hi>Temple,</hi>
yet retained a <hi>Priesthood,</hi> though
of his own corrupt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ect.</hi> That of the Law was
a <hi>Priesthood,</hi> but we speak of a
<hi>Ministery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. We stand not upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
words or Titles; neither doth the
Apostle, for as (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9.) he
calls the Priests of the Law <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
and their office a Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so he implies, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospel might have
that Title of <hi>Priests (1 Cor.</hi> 9. 13.)
by taking his Argument for their
maintenance from the Priests,
Altar, and Temple, <hi>as they that
serve at the Altar, partake of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56045:102"/>
Altar; even so hath God ordained,
that those that preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
should live of the Gospel;</hi> and
the name hath only grown igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious,
by the Church of <hi>Rome's</hi>
retaining it, whom if by way of
distinction, they had been called
by us <hi>sacrificers</hi> (as Bishop
<hi>Downham</hi> observes) there had
been no offence in it. All that
read the <hi>Fathers,</hi> know it is the
term used by them; whose Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of the Ministery are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
<hi>De Sacerdotio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Apostle makes it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>a change of the Priesthood,
(Hebr.</hi> 7. 12.) not a <hi>nulling</hi> of it,
upon which change of a ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
none presumed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to officiate without an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination;
Iohn Baptist</hi> who was
the preparative voice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
was ordained to it, and his
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56045:102"/>
disciples were <hi>set apart</hi> by him;
our Saviour did the like in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
first Twelve for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and baptizing, and then 72
after them, when one of the
twelve was lost, no other step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
into his place without a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
choice of him; <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 14. 23. whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they came and converted
any nation, were carefull of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
Successors. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as
his last, gives that charge to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> after him, and in
all Ages of the Church from the
Primitive times, both in the Greek
and Latine Church, it hath been
observed to this day succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively.</p>
            <p>So that for such as would
have no such office of a Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by ordination, but all men left
to themselves to officiate at their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56045:103"/>
pleasure, we may say with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
(1 <hi>Cor. 11. 16.) We have had
no such custome, neither the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of God,</hi> (or as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Iob
cap. 5. 1.) call now if there be any
will answer thee, and to which of
the Saints wilt thou turn,</hi> where
is there any such President in all
the reformed Churches? The <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
would have a <hi>King as all
other nations;</hi> These are upon
the contrary singularity. 'Tis
true, the <hi>New Ierusalem (Revel.
21.</hi> 22. meant <hi>heaven,</hi> is found
without a Temple and a Priest,
because Christ shall then <hi>give up
his kingdome to his Father (1 Cor.
15.</hi>) i. e. the manner of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
government by the <hi>Scepter</hi>
of his word, and <hi>Seale</hi> of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and then <hi>God shall be all
in all,</hi> but till then, a setled Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
must be continued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:56045:103"/>Secondly, if no successive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Ministery, why doth Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> spend so much time in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
to a <hi>future provision</hi> for
them. (1 <hi>Cor. 9. Gal. 6. 6. 1 Tim.
5.</hi> 17.) can we think it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for himself, and such then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
who expected <hi>Martyrdome</hi>
weekly; why such large directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the <hi>qualification</hi> of such,
as were to be ordained by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
in his Epistles to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> surely it was written
for our instruction now.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, consider what <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
must be the issue of the
contrary, our <hi>Saviour</hi> pitied the
people, when they were like
<hi>Sheep without a Shepherd;</hi> That
which is every mans work, is no
bodies: As in reason, the office
of the Ministery must be <hi>weakly</hi>
and negligently done, when no
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56045:104"/>
persons are appointed to make it
their study and sabour, fo when
<hi>gaps</hi> are thus opened for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
may not <hi>Iesuits</hi> and such
lik Agents creep in under other
forms, and <hi>privily bring in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
heresies,</hi> to the seducing of
the hearers; I am loth to imagine
that this should be at the <hi>bottome</hi>
of this assertion, that so with the
more specious pretext, they
might take away the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as indeed one must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the other; for if there be
no need of a <hi>setled ordained</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
what use of a <hi>setled
meanes</hi> alotted for it.</p>
            <p>If any shall stumble at that
speech often in the mouthes of
some, <hi>Isa. 54. 13. All thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
shall be taught of the Lord,</hi> he
may be satisfied by this double
Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:56045:104"/>1. It was fulfilled in that time
of our Lord and Saviour, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them immediately by himself,
which he expounds accordingly;
(<hi>Iohn 6. 45.) It is written in the
Prophets, they shall be all taught
of God, every man therefore that
hath learned of the Father, cometh
unto me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Lord is said to teach,
when he doth it by a Ministery,
sent by him according to that of
<hi>Ierem. 3. 15. I will give you Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
after my own heart, that shall
feed you with knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
&amp;c.</hi> fulfilled under
the Gospel. And we grant, that
though the proposal of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is by the Minister, yet the
illumination of the mind, and the
rectifying of the heart through
it, is from God.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If that of Saint</hi> Peter
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56045:105"/>
(1 <hi>Eph. 4. 10.) he objected,</hi> As
every man hath received the gift,
so let him minister the same as
good Stewards of the manifold
grace of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I conceive it is not meant
the <hi>gift</hi> of preaching, but of
<hi>Almes.</hi> The words immediately
before, are these. <hi>Vse hospitality
one to another without grudging,</hi>
there is the <hi>manner,</hi> and then in
these words, <hi>As every one hath
received the gift, so let him mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
is implyed the <hi>measure</hi> of it;
agreeing with that of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
injunction, 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 2. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one lay by him</hi> (to that end) <hi>as
God had prospered him, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That these temporal things
are the gift of God; the fourth
Petition of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi>
shewes sufficiently. And that
collections of these, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56045:105"/>
them to the poor, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>ministring to the Saints.</hi>
See 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 4. cap.</hi> 9. 1. and sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
grace, (<hi>cap.</hi> 8. 19.) and what
other sense can there be of that
(<hi>cap. 9. 8.) God is able to make
all grace abound,</hi> but of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
blessings, as the next
words shew, <hi>to multiply your seed
sowen, and minister bread for your
food,</hi> (V. 10.) and they may be
called the <hi>manifold grace</hi> or gift
of God, by the divers sorts of
them to be administred, food, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
relieving of the sick, &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they are distinctly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
at the last day, (<hi>Matth.
25.</hi>) And are not all bountiful
charitable persons, the Lords
<hi>Stewards,</hi> in dispensing these
things to those of <hi>his houshold of
Faith;</hi> so that upon these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
the place appears to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56045:106"/>
to be farre off from any applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it to Preaching. Indeed
the next verse may be so meant. <hi>If
any man speak, let him speak as the
Oracles of God,</hi> &amp;c. but yet to
be understood with this limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> of a man ordained and
constituted (as we have said) for
that end.</p>
            <p>In a word, to allow all sorts of
men to be preachers, is to make
the <hi>whole body an eye, a tongue,</hi>
&amp;c. and if so as the Apostle saith,
<hi>where is the hearing, are all teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
are all interpreters?</hi> 'tis an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from the absurdity, as if
ye would expect the foot to see,
the hand to speak; In Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
dayes it was said, <hi>Who is sufficient
for these things?</hi> and shall all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
think themselves so now;
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly to it:</hi> i. e. to <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:56045:106"/>
study, reading, and not to
<hi>intangle himself</hi> with the things
of this world, which might take
him off, and may they now meet in
<hi>tradesmen</hi> and <hi>manufactures?</hi> and
the office be performed without
either? Is there not a distinction
made between the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the <hi>elders</hi> of it,
(<hi>Acts</hi> 20.) between the <hi>Church</hi>
and the <hi>Angel</hi> of it, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 2.)
which if it be not meant of <hi>one</hi>
person, the <hi>Bishop</hi> (as <hi>Ignatius</hi>
stiles him so about twelve years
after, which was the judgement of
the <hi>Primate</hi>) yet must at least be
collectively meant of the <hi>Bishop,</hi>

then to have <hi>curam animarum;</hi>
why not now? or where doth it
appear, the term is expired?
I conclude this point with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the several steps of
our declinings, or defections of
later yeares; First, we were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at some <hi>titles</hi> of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
then at the <hi>office</hi> it selfe;
First, at such a Ministery <hi>so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi>
then at the <hi>ordaining</hi> of
any Ministery at all. First, the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56045:107"/>
               <hi>solemn Assemblies</hi> in publick were
forsaken, and a retreat made into
<hi>corners,</hi> then the <hi>Preachers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
slighted, called by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the Masters of Assemblies:</hi>
First, a <hi>ceremony</hi> in baptizing of
Infants scrupled at, then the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of Infants</hi> themselves; nay,
the Sacrament of Baptisme by <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
called into question also; First,
the <hi>Communion</hi> forborne, out of
offence to some <hi>gesture,</hi> now
the Sacrament <hi>it selfe</hi> neglected,
and contemned, as if we may now
live <hi>above</hi> and <hi>without</hi> Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
&amp; without any <hi>ordained</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
to administer each, as indeed
the one must follow the other.</p>
            <p>This is the train laid to blow
us up, what <hi>Iacob</hi> said after <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
was lost, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> must
go too; <hi>All these things are
against me,</hi> may be our applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56045:108"/>
for the Church. If any <hi>thirty
years</hi> agone, should have foretold
that this <hi>Garden</hi> of God should
have brought forth these weeds,
that such Tenents should have so
prevailed among us, he would
have been by the most religious
persons of that age, taken for one
that <hi>dreamed;</hi> and they ready to
have answered for their <hi>Mother</hi>-Church,
as <hi>Hazael</hi> did for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
when the Prophet told him,
what evill he should be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of.</p>
            <p>Let us be of <hi>moderate</hi> spirits,
and not run beyond the bounds
of any president in the <hi>Primitive</hi>
times, walk not <hi>in wayes not cast
up;</hi> (Jerem. 6. 16.) enquire for
the <hi>old paths, where is the good
way, and walk therein;</hi> be not
like those in the next words, that
said, <hi>we will not walk in them;</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:56045:108"/>
but in new ones, according to
your own fancies. Let the <hi>Tribe
of Levi be purged,</hi> but let not
the physick be so strong as to
<hi>destroy</hi> them. Saint <hi>Paul magnified</hi>
his own office; this is but to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it from being trodden under
feet, and the end is your good,
that in these distracted times, ye
might not be without <hi>leaders,</hi> so
ordained and fitted, <hi>to guide your
feet in the way of peace,</hi> and so
much for the first, A necessity of
an <hi>ordained Ministery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>second</hi> observation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
is, that <hi>Ordination is not onely an
internal Call of God, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
of man;</hi> for so 'tis deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
by that very act, <hi>laying
on of hands,</hi> i. e. implying the
hand of <hi>God</hi> is not all in the holy
frame of the heart of the person
by his <hi>spirit,</hi> requisite in every
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56045:109"/>
true believer, but there must be
the hands of <hi>men</hi> in the designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him in <hi>his</hi> name also. The
first was wont to be asked, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ordained,<note place="margin">Book of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> viz. <hi>Whether in his
heart or conscience, he found himself
truly called to the Ministry, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the will of our Lord Iesus
Christ.</hi> This perswasion of his
gave a <hi>capacity,</hi> but the <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
actually conferred on him,
was by the <hi>imposition of hands,</hi>
Ability and faithfulnesse were
the qualifications, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to officiate, was transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Timothy (2 Eph.</hi> 2. 2.) by
that means. Ye know those two
<hi>memento's</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to him,
<hi>Neglect not the gift</hi> (1 Tim. 4.
14.) <hi>Stirre up the gift of God
which is in thee</hi> (2 Tim. 1. 16.)
<hi>by the laying on of my hands, and
of the hands of the Presbytery;</hi> if it
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56045:109"/>
should be asked, What is here
meant by <hi>the gift,</hi> I conceive
there is no necessity of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it, either of gifts of <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
or <hi>saving</hi> gifts of the Spirit;
for as the former doubtlesse were
found in <hi>Timothy</hi> before his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and the latter from his
childhood, &amp; education; (2 <hi>Epist.
cap. 3. 15. cap.</hi> 1. 5.) so 'tis a
doubt if it were in the power of
<hi>Timothy</hi> to transferre either of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
those by this means, they being
to be left to Christ himself, who
<hi>enlightens every man that cometh
into the world;</hi> and to that holy
Spirit who <hi>blowes when, and
where it listeth,</hi> but the surest
sence is to take it for the <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
given him for the officiating,
and exercising these abilities, and
<hi>transferring</hi> of it unto others:
And in this sence I grant <hi>gifted</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:56045:110"/>
men may preach, and perform
other ministerial acts, i. e. who
with the <hi>internall</hi> have received
this <hi>externall</hi> power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
also, according to Christs ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
through <hi>imposition of hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
taken for <hi>internall</hi> abilities,
and 'tis not improbable, but at
the solemn meeting of the Church
of God, both Ministery and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in <hi>Fasting and Prayer,</hi> (which
was the injunction of our Church,
&amp; should have been the practice)
to invocate God for the assisting
<hi>grace of his spirit,</hi> to be given to
the person ordained, might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
for that end; and that the
receiving accordingly of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
might be so far <hi>operative,</hi> as
to be a confirmation of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the more, against errors and
heresies, in the execution of it;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56045:110"/>
The falling into which may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be the judgement of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some, who of late dayes have
run without it, which agrees with
the observation <hi>Chemnitius</hi> makes
of <hi>Origen,</hi> who neglected <hi>Orders,</hi>
and fell into the like; and at last
made himselfe <hi>incapable</hi> of them.

               </gap> in the

to be understood of the gift of
<hi>authority</hi> to be exercised and
transferred unto others by <hi>laying
on of hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis further confirmed by
the many examples that do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
our Saviour gave his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
not only an <hi>inward</hi> call
by his Spirit, but an <hi>open verball</hi>
call before the people; Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>

Holy Ghost,</hi> yet presumed not to
officiate, till he had <hi>imposition of

your selves Ministers, our

            <p>'Tis frequent to hear an ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            </p>

if they mean since the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

distinguish between <hi>from</hi> and

the great his time, about
600 yeares after Christ; there
were <hi>then</hi> no such defilements of
doctrine in it, that it should be a

we were not then to seek for an
<hi>ordained Ministery,</hi> there having
been for many hundreds of years,
before that, a flourishing Church
among us, which the <hi>Saxons</hi>
whom he came to convert, had
been the persecutors and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of, as <hi>Gildas</hi> tells us, so that in
that, or the former, sense, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is not worth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But fourthly, I suppose they

complaint of the <hi>Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
to <hi>Rome. How is that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
City become a harlot? it was full
of judgement, righteousnesse lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in her; but now murderers,</hi> &amp;c.
i. e. Since the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
corrupt in doctrine and
worship.</p>
            <p>For this, first we thus answer.
While we were under the <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi>
of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> it
doth not appear that he ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
usurped, more then a <hi>mandatory
nomination</hi> of the Bishop to be
consecrated, which out of a blind
fear of his excommunication was
assented unto, but the <hi>consecration</hi>
was not by him, but other Bishops
here within our selves. And I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the ordination or <hi>consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to be derived from such as
<hi>gave imposition of hands,</hi> not from
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56045:117"/>
the <hi>mandate</hi> for them to do it;
<hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and the <hi>Kings</hi>
succeeding, assumed the like
power in the <hi>nomination</hi> of the
person (which accordingly might
not be gainsaid:) but from thence
it cannot be argued, that our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
or consecration was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from them, for the Kings
<hi>mandate</hi> served not to <hi>give power</hi>
to ordain (which those Bishops
had before <hi>intrinsecally</hi> annexed
to their office) but only was a
warrant <hi>to apply</hi> this power to
the person named in that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date.
Now this being all which
was usurped by the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in relation to the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations
of our Bishops in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
when we were under the
<hi>Tyranny</hi> of the Papacy, there is as
little force for our deriving our
ordination from him also. And if
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56045:117"/>
those Bishops of <hi>Sidon,</hi> which
(as Arch-Deacon<note n="*" place="margin">De Minister. Anglican.</note> 
               <hi>Mason</hi> tells us)
assisted in the first consecration
in <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. as in <hi>Edward</hi> the
sixth's time, were not <hi>meerly Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular,</hi>
but had their consecration
from the Greek Church, which
is altogether a stranger to the See
of <hi>Rome;</hi> it would take off some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
from the pretence of a <hi>totall</hi>
derivation from thence.</p>
            <p>But still it may be objected,<note place="margin">Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that
we have at least received our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
from such as professed
the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> it could not be called
properly the <hi>Religion of Rome,</hi>
till the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> which
determined many years after our
falling off from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi>
The Papists ask us, Where was
<hi>our</hi> Religion before <hi>Luther?</hi>
we might reply, Where was the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56045:118"/>
               <hi>Popish Religion</hi> before that time.
'Tis true, most of those <hi>poysonous</hi>
errours were sowen up and down
the world <hi>before,</hi> but not <hi>collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
fully into a body; and so own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and <hi>headed</hi> by the Papacy till
then. For till that time, scarce any
point we hold now against them
but there were some of their <hi>own
Authours</hi> who held it also. So
that to speak properly the now
<hi>Romish</hi> Religion in their <hi>new
Creed,</hi> with other appurtenances,
was established since our form of
ordination.</p>
            <p>2. Suppose we received our
ordination from such who were
<hi>corrupted with Popish errours,</hi> yet
if they retained the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls</hi>
of Christian Religion,
their ordination may be valid:
those like some part of the <hi>barke</hi>
of the tree uncut, may convey
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56045:118"/>
the <hi>Sappe</hi> from the root to the
preserving of life in the branches.
What Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith of the
<hi>Donatists</hi> in some things, <hi>mecum
sunt,</hi> they concurre with me;
in other things they are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
may be applicable to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and if so, why
may we not receive through
them, what was <hi>of Christs</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them, without being defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with that corrupt part which
is their <hi>own?</hi> why may not there
be in this a <hi>separation</hi> of the <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
from the vile?</hi> And in our
reformation we withdrew our
selves no further from her, then
she hath declined from her self in
the <hi>Apostles</hi> time, and from the
ancient state and condition of it
then, as one saith well, <hi>Nostra
Ecclesia ab hodierna Romana Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia
contaminata recessit, ut ad
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56045:119"/>
pristinam, puram, Apostolicam, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam

the present corrupted
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we might
be nearer a kin to the first, pure,
Apostolical Roman Church in
the primitive times.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In a word,</hi> we do affirme
that neither their <hi>corruption in
opinion, or vitiosity of life,</hi> do, or
did, void it to the party ordained;
none doubts of the <hi>Baptisme</hi>
of our fore-fathers administred
by those of the like in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if there needed any
<hi>reiteration,</hi> by them who survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
our reformation: neither do
we renew the <hi>orders</hi> received in
that Church, when any <hi>Priest</hi> is
converted, and betakes himself to
our communion, and why should
it be questioned here? Let the
<hi>Seal</hi> be of <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>brasse,</hi> the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56045:119"/>
impression is alike valid, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed

            <p>Is it not strange, that those who

as Bishop <hi>Downham, Abbot,
Iewell,</hi> and the late eminent <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
with divers others; that now
they should (with their very
calling and profession) be styled
<hi>Popish;</hi> can we think otherwise,
but that <hi>the hand of Ioab</hi> (I mean
the Jesuit) is privily in it. Is it
not a wonder it should so come
about, that such as have been the
greatest <hi>enemies</hi> to the <hi>See</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> should be reckoned as
<hi>members,</hi> and friends of it; and
thus perpetually yoked together
as <hi>twins;</hi> nay trod under foot as
<hi>unsavory salt,</hi> upon that very
account, as being Episcopall. Is
this a just reward of their labour?
in the defence of your profession;
thus to be aspersed by you, as <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solon
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56045:123"/>
to Hushay, Is this thy kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to thy friend?</hi> Certainly those
of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot but
smile within themselves, that they
have thus covertly deluded us,
and so closely taken a revenge
of those their adversaries.</p>
            <p>How true is that speech of
our Saviour, <hi>A Prophet</hi> is <hi>not
without honour, save in his own
country;</hi> other nations, <hi>French</hi>

this is, to the expectation of

            <p>THey are the words of our

the Apostles, and why
they may not be continued to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56045:124"/>
their Successors, (who are to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

that the late offence taken against

arise from a misapprehension of
the sense of them; The <hi>Primates</hi>
judgement of which I think fit
to manifest, who in all his <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations,</hi>
constantly observed
them.</p>
            <p>They consist of <hi>two</hi> clauses.</p>
            <p>1. Receive the Holy Ghost.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>2. Whose sins thou forgivest,
they are forgiven; and whose sins
thou dost retain, they are retained.</p>
            <p>1. For the first; (<hi>Receive the
Holy Ghost</hi>) We do not here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the <hi>sanctifying</hi> graces
of the spirit: For the Apostles
had received <hi>them</hi> before, in that
they were bid by our Saviour, to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56045:125"/>
               <hi>rejoyce, that their names were
written in heaven</hi> (the evidence
of which is, heaven wrot in the
heart here) and had his witnesse,
<hi>that they had believed, and had
kept his word,</hi> for whom he had
also also prayed in that sense; <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
them through thy truth,</hi>
John 17.</p>
            <p>And if this had been the gift,
there had been no particular
thing given to them, for all that
will be saved, must in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
partake of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9.
<hi>If any man have not the spirit of
Christ, he is none of his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though it be the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>a good Christian,</hi> yet 'tis not
a sufficient warrant for him, to
take upon him <hi>the Ministery.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Again, it cannot be meant
of the <hi>extraordinary</hi> gifts of the
Holy Ghost, viz. <hi>Gifts of tongues,</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:56045:125"/>
&amp;c. For in that sense the <hi>Holy
Ghost was not yet given,</hi> till fifty
dayes after. viz. the <hi>Feast of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi>
but this was given upon the
day of his Resurrection; So that
a third sense must be had, which
was the <hi>Primates,</hi> as followeth.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost]</hi> i. e. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Ministeriall</hi> power of offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating

and through which, as the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-Pipes,</hi>
this holy water is

for their <hi>own</hi> benefit, as the good

power as the <hi>Stewards</hi> of God,
to be dispensers of holy and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things, to the benefit of
such, over <hi>whom the Holy Ghost
had made them overseers,</hi> which

preaching of the Word, and
Administration of Sacraments, by
and through which, the graces of
the <hi>holy spirit</hi> in repentance,
faith, forgivenesse of sins, and
the like; are ordinarily wrought
and confirmed to the hearers, and
partakers of them: yet not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
it from being a <hi>Prayer</hi>
also, <hi>viz.</hi> that the person thus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized,
might <hi>receive</hi> such a
<hi>spiritual assistance</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Receive</hi> first by way of <hi>donation</hi>
in the name of Christ, as to the
<hi>office;</hi> and <hi>secondly,</hi> by way of
<hi>impetration,</hi> as to the efficacious
spiritual <hi>assistance</hi> of him in it,
which the accustomed succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>prayer</hi> did confirm: which
as it was in both senses frequently
effectual by the mouth and hands
of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> so hath it been
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56045:127"/>
accordingly from age to age, in
and by the <hi>Ministery</hi> succeeding,
and therefore why may not the
same form of words be used at
their Ordination also.</p>
            <p>Can we think this <hi>solemn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the Holy Ghost, in
that sense as hath been explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was onely for the benefit of
that age, and withdrawn totally
again in the next.</p>
            <p>That <hi>his being with them</hi> thus
by his spiritual assistance, <hi>to the
end of the world,</hi> was to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
with the death of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
some of which, (as Saint
<hi>Iames, Acts</hi> 12.) were not long
after; No surely, this <hi>oyle poured
upon their heads, descended</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then so, even <hi>to the skirts of
their garments,</hi> in these dayes.</p>
            <p>The third Chapter of the first
Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> hath
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56045:127"/>
much in confirmation of this. In
the third verse, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> styles
the <hi>Minister</hi> ordained by Christ,
his <hi>Amanuensis; ye are the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of Christ ministred by us,
written not with ink, but with
the Spirit of the living God.</hi>
Christ the inditer, the Minister
is as <hi>the hand of a ready writer;</hi>
or the <hi>Spirit</hi> is as the ink, the
<hi>Minister</hi> as the pen, through
which 'tis diffused upon the <hi>flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Tables of your hearts,</hi> and by
saying <hi>us,</hi> he doth not <hi>appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>
it to himselfe, but gives the
like to <hi>Timothy</hi> ordained by him,
which he continues in the sixth
verse; <hi>God hath made us able
Ministers of the New Testament,
not of the letter, but of the spirit;</hi>
as he calls the Word, the <hi>sword
of the spirit</hi> (Ephes. 6.) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the hands of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56045:128"/>
so the whole office is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the Ministration of the Spirit,
v. 8. the Ministration of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi>
v. 9. i. e. instrumental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
be it that of <hi>Iustification,</hi> or
<hi>Sanctification,</hi> by which he saith,
<hi>it did exceed in glory that under
the law;</hi> The shining of <hi>Moses</hi>
face, the glory of the Temple,
and vestments of the Priests were
<hi>glorious,</hi> but yet had <hi>no glory in
this respect, by reason of the glory
which excelleth; for if that which
is done away were glorious, how
much more that which remaineth,
is glorious.</hi> Now wherein lieth
this <hi>glory,</hi> but in being by this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
the Conduits through
which the Spirit is conveyed, and
received, or being (<hi>cap.</hi> 6. 1.) <hi>co-workers
together with him of it,</hi>
even as the <hi>glory of the latter Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
by the presence of <hi>Christ</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:56045:128"/>
himselfe, is said to be <hi>greater
then the former,</hi> though it had
types of him in a more outward
glorious lustre: 'tis therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
v. 18. <hi>the glass of the glory of the
Lord, by which we are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same Image from glory to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which as it rebukes the
Contemners of the office of
the Ministery, so it answers that
frequent <hi>objection</hi> made against
the use of these words, at the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
to it; viz. That the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
graces of the spirit,</hi> were
sometimes lacking both in the
<hi>Ordainers</hi> transmitting, and <hi>ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
the recipients; It is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the <hi>Transmission,</hi> or recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Holy Ghost here, is not
meant in that sense, as to the <hi>rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of it in the persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but as the conveyers of it,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56045:129"/>
for the use and benefit of others,
<hi>viz.</hi> through these <hi>Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which they are now by
this authorized to performe.</p>
            <p>And that it may be so, ye see it
in <hi>Iudas,</hi> who by our Saviours
Commission to him <hi>through</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and baptizing, was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
accordingly of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of it, (i. e. <hi>remission of sins,</hi>
&amp;c.) unto others, without parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it himself: our Saviour
calls him a <hi>Devill,</hi> and <hi>a son of
perdition,</hi> but yet in this Office,
the <hi>Devils were subject to him;</hi>
and he the means of dispossessing
of others; like <hi>Noahs</hi> Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who were instruments to
save others, but were drowned
themselves. 'Tis probable, Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> or some of the Apostles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Phyletus,
Phygellus, Hermogenes,</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephas,</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:56045:129"/>
but as in neither of them
doth there appear any sanctified
grace of the spirit, so we do not
read it caused any <hi>suspension</hi> of
the vertue of their ministerial
acts to the receivers, or that the
Apostles gave order for any <hi>rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration</hi>
of them; personal faults,
not voyding Acts of Office; and
so, why should the like be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to it in these succeeding
Ages? <hi>Receiving</hi> supposeth a gift,
but 'tis as the giving of a summe
to a <hi>Steward</hi> by his Lord, not to
his own private use, but for the
dispensing of it to the family.</p>
            <p>

in this point, whose authority
prevails much with all good men,
and how remote our Church is
from that of the <hi>Papists</hi> in the use
of those words in ordination,
I shall give you some brief colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
out of that <hi>Answer</hi> of his
to the <hi>Iesuite Malones challenge</hi>
concerning this subject, and the

the injury, which (among
others) <hi>Doctor Heylene</hi> hath done
him in this, as if his judgement
were opposite to the Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Primate</hi> complains of
the wrong done by the Papists in
charging us with denying any
power to be left by Christ to
the <hi>Priests,</hi> or Ministers of the
Church, <hi>to forgive sins,</hi> being the
<hi>formal words which our Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
to be used in the Ordination
of a Minister,</hi> and there states the
question between them &amp; us; That
in the general, it was ever the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Church, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
office of our Ministery is excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in the forgivenesse of sins,</hi> as
the means, and end of it. The
Question is of the <hi>manner of the
execution,</hi> and the <hi>Bounds</hi> of it,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56045:135"/>
which the <hi>Pope, and his Clergy
have enlarged beyond all measure
of truth and reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We say, that to forgive sinnes
<hi>properly, directly,</hi> and <hi>absolutely,</hi>
is Gods propriety onely; <hi>Esay</hi>
43. 25. <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 5. produced
by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. to

shewes it to have been the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and practice of the Fathers
and the ancientest of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that the power of the <hi>Keyes</hi>
in this particular, is much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in our being <hi>petitioners</hi> to
God; for the persons remission,
not excluding the prayers of the
<hi>whole</hi> Church in <hi>assisting</hi> them
with theirs, for which cause in
publick offences, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
men to shew their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
accordingly, that the <hi>Church
might pray with the Minister for
them,</hi> for the more sure imparting
of the benefit of absolution. And
that before <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> time,
the form of absolution was <hi>by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for the partie,</hi> &amp; that a learned
man in his time found fault with
that <hi>indicative</hi> form newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced.
Then the form being
not, <hi>I absolve thee,</hi> but <hi>absolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56045:137"/>
&amp; remissionem tribuat tibi
omnipotens Deus,</hi> the Almighty
God give unto thee absolution,
and remission, &amp;c. unto which
the antient <hi>Ritualls</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church as the <hi>Greeke,</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that of <hi>Damascenes</hi> form,
yet retained) doth agree; and 'tis
the <hi>Primates</hi> observation, that the
<hi>ancient Fathers never used any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative
form, but alwaies prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;</hi>
as ye have heard, according
to which were the <hi>ancient Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi>
of the Latine, and Greek
Churches; howsoever the <hi>Popish
Priests</hi> now stand so much upon
it, that they <hi>place the very es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and efficacie of that their
Sacrament in it, in the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and not in the third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed our Church, to shew it
stood not upon forms, did in its
<hi>Liturgie</hi> observe each. 1. In <hi>the

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. In the <hi>Censures</hi> of the
Church, there is an exercise of this
part of our function, which we
maintain against <hi>the Montanists &amp;
Novatians,</hi> who deny any mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall
power of reconciling of
such penitents, as had committed
heynous sins, and receiving them
to the Communion of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
which is contrary to that of
<hi>Saint Paul,</hi> (as 'tis generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by antiquity) <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1.
<hi>If any man be overtaken in a fault,</hi>
(i. e. <hi>in a</hi> scandalous one) <hi>you who
are spiritual, restore</hi> (i. e. upon his
repentance) <hi>such a one in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of meeknesse,</hi> as in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56045:138"/>
of the <hi>Incestuous Corinthian,</hi>
whom, as in the <hi>name and power of
the Lord Iesus,</hi> he had bin excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and
the Elders there, so upon his
repentance, he was in the same

again, even by such, <hi>to
whom was committed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of reconciliation, 2 Cor.</hi> 27.
10. &amp;c. And indeed this loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of men, is generally by the
Fathers accounted a restoring
them to the peace of the Church,
and admitting them to the Lords
Table again, as is evident by their
frequent expressions that way,

are said to shut up the Kingdom

And by applying the word
unto the consciences of their

did discharge that part of their

even as <hi>Ieremiah, (cap.</hi> 1. 10.)
is said to <hi>be set over the Nations,

               <hi>that in remitting, and
retaining of sins, the Priests of the
Gospel have the like power, and
office, which the Priests of old had
under the Law in curing the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi>
who <hi>therefore accordingly
may be said to forgive, and retaine
sins, whilst they shew, and declare,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56045:143"/>
they are forgiven, or retained of
God<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 6.</note> So the Priests put the
name of the Lord upon the children
of</hi> Israel, and were commanded
to blesse the people in saying, <hi>The
Lord blesse thee:</hi> but it was <hi>the
Lord himself that blessed them;</hi>
according to the next words, and
<hi>I will blesse them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus in these four things, I
leave it to be calmly considered of,
if the Ministers have not power
left them by Christ in relation to
<hi>forgivenesse</hi> of sins, and with these
limitations, whether that part of
<hi>the old form</hi> of the words of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi>
might not be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also, which seems to me to be
explained in the next following
them; viz. <hi>And be thou a faithfull
dispenser of the word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp;c.</hi> (through both which
the graces of the Holy Ghost,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56045:144"/>
and remission of sins are convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and sealed) <hi>in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.</hi> According as in the
words at the Communion used
to the <hi>recipient,</hi> the former clause
was added <hi>in Q. Elizabeths</hi> dayes,
to give the more full sense of the
latter. And let not any by this
<hi>Moderate</hi> expression, extenuate
the office of the Ministery, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
would by this inferre,
<hi>that any Lay-man, Woman, or
Child,</hi> may absolve as well as the
Minister, (as we have among our
selves, too many of that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.)
For it consisteth not in
<hi>speech,</hi> but in <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
he being as the officer of a

is given, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16. power

them <hi>able Ministers, not of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but of the Spirit.</hi> That from

only in <hi>word,</hi> but in <hi>power</hi> also;
<hi>and in the Holy Ghost, and in much
assurance;</hi> which accordingly hath
been experimentally found; that
howsoever another may from the
Scripture shew as <hi>truly</hi> unto the
penitent, what glad tidings are
there intended to him; yet to
drooping and doubting soules, it
hath not been so <hi>efficacious,</hi> in
quieting them, and giving satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to their consciences, either
in sicknesse, death-bed, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
as by the Ministery <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and commissionated for that
end; That as 'tis their office <hi>to
pray and exhort you in Christs stead
to be</hi> reconciled unto God; so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56045:145"/>
listened to that Motion, and
submitted your selves according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
'tis their office <hi>to declare,</hi> and
<hi>assure</hi> unto you in Christs stead,
that God is reconciled with you,
All which appeares to be the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
doctrine of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> by what is publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the exhortation before
the <hi>Communion</hi> to be read some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at the <hi>discretion</hi> of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
which is the recitd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the <hi>Primate,</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>And because it is requisite that
no man should come to the holy
Communion, but with a full trust
in Gods mercy, and with a quiet
conscience, therefore, if there be
any of you, which by meanes
aforesaid, (<hi>i. e. Private exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and confession of sinnes
to God</hi>) cannot quiet his own
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56045:145"/>
conscience, but requireth further
Councell and Comfort, then let him
come to me; or some other discreet,
and learned Minister of Gods
word, and open his grief, that he
may receive such Ghostly Councel,
Advice, and Comfort; as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
may be relieved; and that
by the Ministery of Gods word,
he may receive comfort, and the
benefit of absolution, to the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his conscience, and avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all scruple, and doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>And now let the Reader judge
if Dr. <hi>Heylene</hi> hath not cause to
repent of his rash censure of the
Primate, (in his late book p. 108.)
as if in this part of his Answer to
the Jesuite, he had (as he saith)
<hi>in this particular, utterly subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as well the doctrine of this
Church, as her purpose in it, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:56045:146"/>
when those two arguments
which himself urgeth, from the
words of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi>
at the communion, are
produced and defended by the
<hi>Primate</hi> also. What would he
have? he saith the doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is, that, <hi>The
Priest doth forgive sins</hi> authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè
<hi>by a delegated, and commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
power committed to him from
our Lord and Saviour,</hi> doth not the
Primate say the same; that 'tis not
only <hi>declarativè,</hi> but <hi>designativè,</hi>
not only by way of informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of the word of God (as
another understanding Christian
may do) to the penitent, that his
sins are pardoned, but he doth it
<hi>authoritative,</hi> as having a power
and commission from God to
pronounce it to the party, and
by the seale of the Sacrament to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56045:146"/>
assure the soule of the penitent,
that he is pardoned of God,
which no other man or Angel
can do, <hi>ex officio,</hi> but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Christ, according to that
of the Apostle; <hi>To us is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to have justified God: the Iewes
in <hi>Malachy</hi> to have blessed the
proud man, which sin, and prosper;
not that the one did make God
righteous, or the other, the wicked
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56045:147"/>
happy; but to blesse, to justifie, and to
absolve, are as commonly used for
words of judgement, or declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as of true and reall efficacy;

that is to say, declare who are

<hi>Saint</hi> Ierome <hi>also, (whom the
Master of the Sentences alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
directly affirmeth,</hi> That as
the Priests of the Law could only
discern, and neither cause nor
remove Leprosies; so the Ministers
of the Gospel, when they retain or
remit sinnes, do but in the one
judge how long we continue guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in the other declare when
we are clear, or free. (<hi>Tom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.

Mr.</hi> Hooker,) when conversion by
manifest tokens did seem effected,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56045:148"/>
Absolution ensuing, (which could
not make) served onely to declare
men innocent. p. 108. When any
of ours ascribeth the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to God, and interprets
the Priests sentence to be but a
solemn declaration of that which
God himselfe hath already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
they (<hi>i. e. the Church
of</hi> Rome) scorne <hi>it. And so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much to this purpofe, he thus
concludes. p.</hi> 113. Let it suffice
to have shewen how God alone
doth truly give, and private Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
absolution, but declare
remission of sinnes. <hi>And thus I
leave Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>under Doctor</hi>
Heylen'<hi>s Censure, who hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
concluded,</hi> that forgivenesse
of sins by the Priest, onely <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi>
doth not come up to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of England.
<hi>Though the reason he gives,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56045:148"/>
it holds, the Priest doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

whose place it is, solemnly
to make Proclamation of the

<hi>nay, dares not do it, unlesse
he were authorized accordingly.

cannot be contemned by any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

<hi>pious</hi> and <hi>eminent</hi> men of

shall deferre them till the last,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56045:151"/>
who do very fully concurre with
the <hi>Primate</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> was a wise and learned
man, now as <hi>Beza</hi> tells us, it was
his <hi>constant</hi> practice to use a set
form of Praier <hi>before Sermon,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
alteration; So was it his advice
in his Epistle to the <hi>Protector of</hi>
England, <hi>in</hi> Edward <hi>the sixth's
time,</hi> (which hath bin mentioned
elsewhere) <hi>for the establishing of
a set form of a Liturgy here, from
which it might not be lawfull for
pastors to depart, both for the good
of the more ignorant, preventing
of an affected novelty in others, and
the declaring of an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in all the Churches.</hi> For which
practice and advice, he had suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
warrant from the President
of the <hi>Ancient</hi> Fathers, in the
<hi>Primitive</hi> times, which might be
here also produced. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56045:151"/>
the councell of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is
is good, <hi>Iob 8. Enquire I pray
thee of the former ages, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
thy selfe for the search of
their Fathers (for we are but of
yesterday, and know nothing;) shall
not they teach thee; &amp;c.</hi> as that of
the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah (cap.</hi> 6.
19.) <hi>aske for the old way, and
walk therein;</hi> which may well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
the presumption of some,
who are so led by their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
that the Ancient Fathers are
of no exemplary esteem with
them. Onely I may safely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
this to the consideration
of any ingenuous person; that
if it were the practice of the
Church of God in all ages for
1500 (or but 1300) yeares after
Christ, not only of the <hi>vulgar,</hi>
but of such as were glorious <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
and the most <hi>eminent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:56045:152"/>
of former and later yeares,
with whom the <hi>holy spirit</hi> did
much abound, doth not the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the contrary <hi>condemn the
generation of the just,</hi> or at least
argue a bold presumptuous cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<hi>of the spirits of just men now
made perfect</hi> in heaven. This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by way of <hi>preparative</hi> to the
Readers attention, that there is
no <hi>singularity</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>2. See the warrants for it in
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> i. e. in the Old
Testament: (<hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 23.) the
Lord gives a form of words to
<hi>Aaron,</hi> and his sons, to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
as a perpetual <hi>Liturgy</hi> from
age to age, for the <hi>blessing the
children of Israel, saying unto them,
the Lord blesse thee, and keep thee,
the Lord make his face to shine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, and be gracious unto thee;
the Lord lift up his countenance
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56045:152"/>
upon thee, and give thee peace,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Numb. 10. 35. Moses</hi> gives himself
a set form, at the <hi>rising</hi> and <hi>rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the Ark. When the Ark
set forward, <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>Rise up
Lord, and let thine enemies be
scattered, and let them that hate
thee, flee before thee;</hi> And <hi>when
it rested, he said, return O Lord
unto the many thousands of Israel.</hi>
Continued by <hi>David</hi> at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall
of the Ark in his time,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 1. In the 26. of <hi>Deut.</hi>
ye have two set formes prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of God himself. First, to
him that offers his <hi>first fruits,</hi>
verse 3. <hi>thou shalt say unto the
Priest, &amp;c.</hi> verse 5. <hi>thou shalt
speak, and say before the Lord
thy God,</hi> &amp;c. consisting chiefly
of confession to the 11. verse,
and then to him that offers his
<hi>third years tythes.</hi> verse 13. when,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56045:153"/>
after a solemne protestation of
bringing all the <hi>hollowed things,</hi>
paying his Tythes truly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diminution, or alienation, he
is prescribed to say this prayer,
<hi>before the Lord his God,</hi> verse
15. <hi>Look down from thy holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
from heaven, and blesse
thy people Israel; and the Land
which thou hast given us, as thou
swearest, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The book of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> some
consisting of Petitions, some of
Confession, some of praises, (the
several parts of prayer) what was
the end of their composing and
collection, but as a <hi>Liturgy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
the severall formes fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the <hi>Saints</hi> of God in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
ages, and accordingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and used in the Temple,
and Synagogues upon severall
times, and occasions; As that for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56045:153"/>
the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> in speciall by the
Title of it (Psal. 92.) as <hi>Moses</hi>
prayer was preserved for the use
of the Church (Psal. 90.) to
<hi>Davids</hi> time, so was his, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
after the <hi>captivity</hi> to our
<hi>Saviours</hi> time, some were used
to <hi>begin</hi> the service with; some
to <hi>end</hi> it; some <hi>before</hi> the reading
of the Law, and Prophets, some
<hi>between</hi> them and before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of either, (as those who
have searched into those cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
of theirs, tell us.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Praise</hi> is the principall part of
prayer, and for that, how often
do you read of <hi>Set Forms</hi> used
by the most eminent Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> after the delivery from
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> at the Red Sea, pennes
a set form of <hi>praise,</hi> for <hi>Myrian</hi>
(Exod. 15 1.) unto which that
of <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. relates where the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56045:154"/>
Saints in heaven, are said to use
that form also; at the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their enemies, <hi>they sang the
song of</hi> Moses (1 Chron. 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7.)
<hi>Asaph and his Brethren</hi> had
forms delivered them by <hi>David,
to thank the Lord</hi> with, (verse
35.) <hi>say ye, save us O God of our
salvation,</hi> &amp;c. (2 Chron. 7. 6.)
<hi>Solomon,</hi> at the <hi>dedication</hi> of the
<hi>Temple,</hi> observes that form which
was observed by his Father, <hi>prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be the Lord, for his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for ever;</hi> at which, (sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
an acceptance of it) <hi>the
glory of the Lord filled the Temple,</hi>
(2 Chron. 29. 30.) <hi>Hezekiah cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Priests, and Levites, to
praise God in the words of</hi> David
<hi>and</hi> Asaph <hi>the Seer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt, but these worthy
reformers, <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
were able to have framed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56045:154"/>
and praises of their own; and
that <hi>suddenly,</hi> (as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> seems
to have done at a special occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.

in their private) but for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

rather chose to use those Formes
which were used in the Church
many ages before in <hi>Davids</hi> time;
see then a respect to <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
not only in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but in the
Forms of <hi>prayer</hi> framed by the
Saints before them. And surely
if it were pleasing unto God then,
according to the Counsell of the
Prophet <hi>Hoseah</hi> to the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
in their repentance, (<hi>cap.</hi>

for ever.</hi> (Ezra 3. 10.) The like
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:56045:155"/>
was observed after the Captivity,
at the repairing of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when <hi>Ezra</hi> appointed the

of</hi> David <hi>King of Israel.</hi>
So much for the Old Testament.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>New Testament,</hi>
yee have a President for it;
(which is above all Presidents)
in our <hi>blessed Saviour,</hi> who gave
a form to his disciples, (<hi>Luke</hi>

only (as <hi>Matthew</hi> 6.) say <hi>after
this manner,</hi> or say <hi>thus;</hi> but
say this. In Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> he
gives a form to the people, and
disciples together, which was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
he sent them forth to preach;
(for that was not, till <hi>cap.</hi> 10.)
In Saint <hi>Luke</hi> he gives his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
a Form, <hi>after</hi> he had made
them <hi>preachers</hi> and <hi>Apostles, cap.</hi>
9. 1. and after the 72 were sent
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:56045:155"/>
out also, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. 1. and both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from preaching <hi>through
the Cities of Israel,</hi> see how both
<hi>people</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> are allowed a
set Form, and it seems <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>
had done the like by the
ground of their requests, <hi>Teach
us as</hi> John <hi>taught his disciples.</hi>
They were not then for <hi>New,</hi> and
different wayes from the Church
before, or coaetaneous with them,
but for a <hi>conformity,</hi> that it might
appear <hi>Iohn Baptist disciples,</hi> and
<hi>they</hi> were one Church, and one
body. A good example for us
to follow, not to ayme at a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,</hi>
or a division between
other Churches, and us, but to
draw as near as we can to a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi>
with them, in having one
<hi>heart,</hi> and one <hi>tongue.</hi> Seek not
wayes never before thought of,
but tread in the steps of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56045:156"/>
times, as the Disciples did
here <hi>teach us, as Iohn taught
his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Reconciling of the
<hi>Evangelists</hi> is easie, <hi>viz.</hi> It was
our Saviours mind, that it should
be both a <hi>rule</hi> for all other, and
<hi>said for a prayer</hi> also, and that
which is a rule for others, must
needs be in the highest degree so it
selfe. A <hi>Standerd</hi> for any measure,
dry or liquid, may be used for that
measure too; and so 'tis no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
that the <hi>Lords prayer</hi>
should be as the <hi>measure</hi> for other
prayers, and said for a prayer also.</p>
            <p>And that it was so understood
by the Fathers in the Primitive
times; I shall onely represent
unto you some of the words of
Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in <hi>his Sermon</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, who lived about 250. years
after our Saviour: and died a
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56045:156"/>
Martyr. He exhorts the people
<hi>not to omit the use of the Lords
prayer with their other prayers,</hi> in
which he hath some such speeches
as these, surely thou art more
likely to obtein thy request; <hi>cum
qui habitat intus in pectore, ipse sit
in voce,</hi> when he that is in thy
heart, is also in thy tongue: <hi>How
can God but hear thee, when thou
comest in the words of his Sonne,
takest up the prayer sanctified by
his sacred mouth; If thou hast no
other prayer, use this; if thou hast
others, use this also, and urge
God daily in his own language; and
with the words of his beloved
Son. Like him that catched up</hi>
Alexander <hi>in his Armes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
his Father</hi> Phillips <hi>anger;</hi> so
saith he, <hi>take up Christ in thy
Armes, make him thy spokes-man,
by taking up his own words;</hi> (that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56045:157"/>
is with right understanding, and
affection.) By these, and the like
expressions in that <hi>Father,</hi> may
be seen, what was the judgement
and practice of the <hi>Primitive</hi>
times, in relation to the use of
that form of the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi>
which the <hi>Divines of</hi>

               <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of Baptisme, and

&amp;c.</p>
            <p>And can that of the <hi>Apostle</hi>
(Col. 3. 16.) exhorting <hi>to praise
the Lord with Psalms and hymns,
and spiritual songs,</hi> imply any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then a set form of words,
according to our custome, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in singing of Psalms in the
<hi>congregation.</hi> And may not that
of our Saviour (Mat. 18.) <hi>Where
two or three of you shall agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
touching any thing they shall
aske,</hi> &amp;c. imply that a prayer,
composed by the consent and
<hi>unanimous</hi> agreement of the
Church, to be the more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
put all these together, and
are they not <hi>a Cloud of Witnesses,</hi>
at least to confirm, and support
the weaker sort in <hi>knowledge
and utterance,</hi> who though of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56045:159"/>
hearts, yet cannot suddenly
poure forth their desires in fitting
expressions, worthy (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
the eares of <hi>Almighty God,</hi>
but must make use of the <hi>pennes,</hi>
and formes of others, or of what
they have <hi>premeditated,</hi> and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to themselves; surely in
these, if their hearts be, (as they
may be) raised to a due height of
holy affection, God accepts of
them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>necessary</hi> requisites to a
prayer, are such as these, That
the <hi>person</hi> be acceptable, that the
matter be good; that it be done
in the right <hi>manner</hi> (i. e. with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
with <hi>affection,</hi> and
that <hi>rightly ordered,</hi> and <hi>qualified</hi>)
and the <hi>end</hi> rightly terminated,
with a <hi>submission</hi> to Gods will,
for the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> with the
like, which I cannot now insist
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56045:160"/>
upon. But I never heard of any
<hi>Divine</hi> that hath wrot of it, to
have put in this for one. <hi>viz.</hi>
That it must be <hi>suddenly</hi> poured
out, <hi>without premeditation of
matter, form, or method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The common</hi> Objection is this,<note place="margin">Object.</note>
that a set form is a limiting, or a
stinting of the spirit in prayer,
<hi>which ought not to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> this is but an <hi>unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Tradition,</hi> for if the <hi>spirit
of a</hi> single <hi>Prophet</hi> in <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
gifts, <hi>must be limited in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>
to the greater number of
the Prophets, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) why
may not the spirit of a <hi>private</hi>
Minister in these <hi>ordinary gifts,</hi>
be limited by the vote and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the <hi>whole Ministery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, see the <hi>ill consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of it. It must be appliable
against <hi>singing of Psalmes</hi> in the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56045:160"/>
spirit, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> puts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with prayer, <hi>I will pray
with the spirit, and I will sing
with the spirit,</hi> (1 Cor. 14. 5.) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Psalmes are prayers,
now if the set form of words in
<hi>them,</hi> be not an obstruction to
the making a spiritual <hi>melody in</hi>
your <hi>hearts to the Lord,</hi> why shall
it be a stop to <hi>the overflowings,</hi>
and enlargements of the heart,
and spirit, in <hi>prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, it must be of the like
force against <hi>preaching</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that if it be premeditated, or
the <hi>Sermon</hi> be before composed, it
cannot be in the <hi>demonstration of
the spirit and power,</hi> nor have any
efficacious operation in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which is both against our
daily <hi>experience,</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi>
Commendation of the <hi>Preacher,</hi>
(meaning it may be himself, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56045:161"/>
12.) because he was wise, he
gave good heed, and sought out
fit words, and set them in order,
even words of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the spirit was not obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the pens of the <hi>Evangelists
writing</hi> their Gospels, or with the
<hi>Apostles</hi> in their several <hi>Epistles,
then;</hi> notwithstanding both were
done with <hi>labour,</hi> and studdy;
why should our labour accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>doctrine,</hi>
by the pen or premeditation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it <hi>now:</hi> and if a set form
doth not stint the spirit either in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inging, preaching, or writing of
holy things; why must it be so
injurious onely to the spirit of
prayer.</p>
            <p>3. But thirdly, if a set form be
the stinting of the spirit, it must
be either in the <hi>speaker</hi> or <hi>hearer.</hi>
1. Not in the <hi>speaker,</hi> for his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:56045:161"/>
may be the <hi>more</hi> at liberty to
<hi>spirituall</hi> fervent <hi>enlargements,</hi>
when there is no obstruction, or
diversion by the work of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>
in <hi>inditing</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> and
words, the unaptnesse, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readinesse
unto which in many,
hath so disturbed them, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them to wander into such
<hi>immethodicall</hi> impertinet wayes,
that they have been far from the
spirit of prayer.</p>
            <p>2. Not in the <hi>hearers,</hi> for then
it must <hi>ever</hi> be so stinted, for
whether the <hi>speaker</hi> useth <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
or <hi>premeditated</hi> expressious,
(which they cannot judge of)
the hearers are alike bound to
mind what proceeds from his
lips, so that if the spirit be stint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>them</hi> in the <hi>latter,</hi> it is as
much in the <hi>former.</hi> For as the
<hi>judgment</hi> is the <hi>freer</hi> to say Amen
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56045:162"/>
by the fore-knowledge, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the prayer, so the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and affections are at <hi>an equall
freedom</hi> also; so that this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is of no value.</p>
            <p>I shall onely put this to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
whether that mans <hi>heart</hi>
may be accounted most spiritual,
which can be daily enlarged, and
his <hi>affections</hi> lifted up in the use
of the same words, or which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without the help of a <hi>varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
like those <hi>weak</hi> stomacks, or
<hi>distempered</hi> in their health, that
cannot relish one dish <hi>twice,</hi> but
must at each meale, have the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi>
of men imployed to
give them various; nay, in danger
of losing their stomack, if they
hear of them before they come
<hi>suddenly</hi> before them; Now in this
I would not be understood, to
discourage any persons in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:56045:162"/>
themselves this way, and
<hi>striving to perfection</hi> in this gift,
which I do much commend; only
as those that learn to <hi>swim,</hi> have
help at first of some suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but afterward come to
swim without them. <hi>Children</hi> at
first have their <hi>Copies,</hi> their paper
<hi>ruled,</hi> their hands <hi>held,</hi> but in
time do it of themselves, and so
there is an expectation, that you
that are of ability should <hi>grow in
knowledge</hi> and utterance this
way: but for the <hi>weaker</hi> sort, is
it not better they should use a
<hi>staffe</hi> then slip, and are not the
<hi>Major</hi> part of this kind, like men
with weak sights, needing the
help of <hi>Spectacles.</hi> To whom,
by denying them a <hi>set Form,</hi> are
we not injurious accordingly,
Though those we call <hi>weak,</hi>
may possibly, by their fervency,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56045:163"/>
and ardency of affection be said
of, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of himself; <hi>when
I am weak, then am I strong,</hi> and
<hi>Gods strength perfected in their
weaknesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prevalency of a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
being not in the elegancy
and loftinesse of the stile, but
in the <hi>sighes and groanes,</hi> and
inward workings of the heart,
like that of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
though their voice were not
heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a word,</hi> an <hi>Vniformity</hi> in the
<hi>publick prayers</hi> of the Church to
be observed in each congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
would tend much to the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of hearts and spirits among us,
which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commends as the
<hi>more excellent way,</hi> and the <hi>end</hi>
of coveting all <hi>gifts</hi> whatsoever,
viz. a <hi>Composure of a Form for the
publick service of God,</hi> by the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56045:163"/>
joynt assistance of the most <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and pious,</hi> from which, the
most eminent gifted person might
not depart, more then the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.
I speak not of prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Sermon</hi> and after, (when
each may take their liberty,
though therein the <hi>Dutch and
French</hi> Church are strict also) but
of some <hi>consent</hi> in the manner of
<hi>Administration of Baptisme, the
communion,</hi> and other offices in
the publick, that might be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by us all in <hi>Common,</hi> as the
form of the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
which as it hath been a means to
continue a <hi>unity</hi> in <hi>other reformed
Churches</hi> at this day; so I believe
would be a means for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it with us, even a setled

which ought to be the prayer
and <hi>principall</hi> endeavour of every

<hi>He thus beginneth.</hi> If that
mind be in us, with the which we
have been taught to come to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercises, and so to be prepared
for them; who doubteth, but that
we may receive much help by them?
yea, and the better a man is, the
more he shall profit by them, &amp;c.
Some have thought all set forms of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:56045:165"/>
prayer are to be disliked, and such
onely to be offered up to God, as
by extemporary gift, are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and uttered; And that the
Minister should use no set form of
prayer, but as they are moved by
Gods spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answer.</hi> It is a foul errour so
to think. For as there be necessary
things to be prayed for of all men,
and alwayes, and those are the
most things which we are to pray
to the Lord for, so there may be a
prescript form of prayer made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all such things; which
being so, what letteth that in the
reading of such forms, either of
confessing of sinnes, request, or
thanksgiving; what letteth, I say,
that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earers hearts may not
profitably go on with the same,
both to humble, to quicken and to
comfort: For is the reading it self
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56045:165"/>
unpure, when the Minister in his
own behalf, and the peoples, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them to God; I speak not (ye
see) of the matter of prayer, but of
reading it, for if the matter be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,
and naught, the pronounceing
of it, maketh it not good, any more
then the reading doth; and if it be
good and pure being uttered or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
the reading cannot hurt
it, or make it evill. And as the
Church in the Scripture did, and
doth sing Psalmes upon a book to
God, and yet, though it utter a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
form of words, I hope none
will say that it is a sin to do so, the
heart being prepared. In like manner
to follow a prescript form of words
in praying is no sinne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to be offensive to
any, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And further, they may know
that in all Churches, and the best
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56045:166"/>
reformed, there is a prescript form
of prayer used, and therefore they
who are of mind that it ought not
to be, must seperate themselves
from all Churches. Also, if a set
form of prayer were unlawful, then
neither were the Lords prayer
(which is a form of prayer, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by our Saviour, himself) to
be used. <hi>And so he proceeds to
perswade all good Christians</hi> to
lay aside contention, and endlesse,
and needlesse questions about this
matter, and with well order'd hearts
and minds to attend unto, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to themselves the prayers,
which either before Sermon or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sermon are uttered, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which through the whole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods worship, are read in their
hearing, <hi>&amp;c. So much Mr.</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now this book of the</hi> seven
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56045:166"/>
Treatises, <hi>hath been since epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized
by Mr.</hi> Egerton, <hi>and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
the</hi> practice of Christianitie,
<hi>which hath an Epistle of Doctor</hi>
Gouge <hi>before it, in a high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of it. Now, at the
conclusion of that he hath added,</hi>
Certain Advertisements concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prayer, <hi>in which, his, or both
their judgements in this subject,
are declared accordingly. viz.</hi>
That it is lawfull, and in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
expedient, to use a set form of
prayer. Question (<hi>saith he</hi>) is
made by many of the lawfulnesse,
or at least of the expediencie of
praying by the help of a book, or of
using a prescript, and set form of
prayer. It is to be considered, that
there be divers degrees and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of gifts, both naturall, as of
grace; besides, some have been by
custome more trained and exercised
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56045:167"/>
in this holy dutie then others, &amp;c.
which difference I have observed,
not onely in private Christians, but
also in some most reverend, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and worthy Ministers. Some
using both in their publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
and in their private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;
a stinted prayer, and set
form of words, with little altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all, except some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
occasion have happened, and
yet both sorts so furnished with
pietie and learning, as I could
hardly prefer the one before the
other.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Liberty in solitary pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> Moreover, whereas in respect
of the place and company, there be
three sorts of prayer publick in the
Church, private in the family, and
secret by a man self; greatest li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
may be taken in secret and
solitarie prayer, because we are
sure (that if there be a believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:56045:167"/>
humble, upright heart) God
will not upbraid any man for his
method, order, words, or utterance.
Yet in private prayer we may not
take so great a libertie,<note place="margin">Lesse liberty in private prayer.</note> &amp;c. and
some well-affected, have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
faultie and offensive in this
behalfe: weak and tender Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
(such as commonly are in a
family) are not so capable of that
kind of prayer, which is called,
conceived, or extemporate, vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every time in words and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
manner, and order, though
the matter and substance be the
same.<note place="margin">Least liberty in publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k prayer.</note> But especially care must be
had in the publick congregation,
that nothing be done in praying,
preaching, or Administration of
Sacraments, but that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and orderly; because there,
many eyes do see us, and many ears
do hear us; and therefore it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56045:168"/>
(for the most part) to
keep a constant form, both of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and words, and yet without
servile tying our selves to words
and syllables, but using herein such
libertie and freedome, as may stand
with comelinesse, &amp;c. <hi>And so he
proceeds thus to direct men, that
though a</hi> Book may be used in
private prayer, yet that it is much
better to get their prayer by heart,
commending the use of the Lords
Prayer, and the varietie of other
formes of godly prayers in print,
penned by forreigne Divines, as
our own countreymen; as Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
that blessed Martyr, Master
<hi>Deering,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hieron, and divers
others yet living,</hi> whose printed
prayers are nothing inferiour to
the former. <hi>And so because</hi> there
ever have been, and still are many
Babes in the Church of God, which
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56045:168"/>
have need of milk, &amp;c. and some of
bad memories, and heavie spirits,
&amp;c. he frames divers formes of
prayers to be used for Morning and
Evening in case of sicknesse, for
the Lords day, <hi>&amp;c. Thus much
very excellently, Mr.</hi> Egerton,
<hi>approved by Doctor</hi> Gouge.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Arthur Hildersham, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
at</hi> Ashbie-delazouch <hi>in</hi> Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester-shire,
<hi>upon the 51 Psalme,
p. 63. saith thus.</hi> I dare not deny,
but a weak Christian may use the
help of a good Prayer-book; better
to pray on a book, then not to pray
at all. Certainly 'tis a spirit of
errour, that hath taught the world
otherwise.</p>
            <p>First, our blessed Saviour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to his Disciples a Forme
of prayer, not only to be to them
and his whole Church a rule, and
sampler, according to which, all
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56045:169"/>
our prayers should be framed, (as
appears, when he saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.
9. After this manner pray ye,) but
even for them; to say, tying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the very words of it, as
appeareth, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2. when ye
pray, say, our Father, &amp;c. By
which answer of our Saviour to
his Disciples, it may also appear,
that <hi>John</hi> taught his disciples to
pray, by giving them forms of
prayer; to say, yea, even in secret
prayer. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6.</p>
            <p>2. All the best reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
do now, and ever have used,
even in publick Liturgies, prescript
forms of prayer; and have judged
them of great use and necessitie for
the edification of the Church: And
surely this argument is not to be
contemned by any sober Christian,
as appeareth by the Apostles speech,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. If any man seem to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:56045:169"/>
be contentious, we have no such
custome; neither the Churches of
God: So doth he again presse the
example and practice of all the
Churches of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14. 33.</p>
            <p>3. This is no stinting, nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to the spirit of Prayer in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Gods people, no more then the
singing of praise to the Lord in the
words of <hi>David,</hi> is now, and was
in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, 2 <hi>Chron. 29.
30.</hi> or the joining in heart with
the words that another uttereth
in conceived prayer: Thus far
<hi>Mr. Hildersham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctor</hi> Preston (<hi>who used a
set Form of Prayer before Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
in that Sermon of his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
before</hi> King Iames, <hi>Text,</hi>
Iohn 1. 16. Of his fulnesse we have
all received, <hi>&amp;c. p. 22. saith thus.</hi>
That a set form is lawfull, much
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:56045:170"/>
need not be said, the very newnesse
of the contrary opinion is enough
to shew the vanitie and falshood
of it. It is contrary to the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
judgement of approved Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
learned Fathers, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
practice of the Church. <hi>He
instanceth in</hi> Tertullians time, <hi>and</hi>
Origen, <hi>Saint</hi> Basil, Ambrose. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine
the Great prescribed a set
form of prayer to his souldiers, and
<hi>Calvine</hi> in his 83. Epist. to the
Protectour of <hi>England,</hi> saith, that
he doth greatly allow a set form of
Ecclesiastical prayer, which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
shall be bound to observe.
But (as I said before) of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of it, there is no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>How slight is that which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against the lawfulnesse of it;<note place="margin">Object.</note>
to wit, That the spirit is stinted,
when we are fetterd with words
appointed?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:56045:170"/>
               <hi>I answer,</hi> The freedome of the
spirit stands not so much in the
extent of words, as in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of zeal, wherein they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
And if a set form be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
then must a set form needs
excell, which is dictated by Christ
himself, and is therefore more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to be used, and with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
both in mind and gesture;
nor doth this want the practice
and approbation of the Antientest,
<hi>instancing in Saint</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and
Saint</hi> Augustine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for a further confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
see the same affirmed by him
again; in his book called the
<hi>Saints daily exercise,</hi> set forth
and approved by Doctor <hi>Sibbs,</hi>
(who himself used a set Form of
Prayer before Sermon,) Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi>
p. 80. viz. <hi>Another case</hi>
(saith he) is, <hi>Whether we may</hi>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:56045:171"/>
use a set Forme of Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I need not say much to
you, for I think there is none here
that doubts, but that a set Form
of Prayer may be used: you know
Christ prescribed a Form; you
know there were certain Psalmes,
that were prayers that were used
constantly, and therefore no doubt,
but a set Form may be used, and
in the Church at all times, both in
Primitive times, and all along to
the beginning of the Reformed
times, to <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvins</hi> time,
still in all times, the Church had set
Forms they used, and I know no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is of weight. One main obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is this. <hi>That in stinted pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the spirit is streitned, &amp;c. To
this he gives a three fold answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. They that object it, do the
same thing daily in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whose spirits are limited and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:56045:171"/>
stinted by being hearers of him
that prayes.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis no generall tye, but at
other times in private, they may
be as free as they will.</p>
            <p>3. The spirit or affections are
not tyed, or restrained hy a set
form, there may be largenesse of the
heart, though there be a limit of
words; <hi>This is the summe of the
answer, which the Reader may
have more at large there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have given ye the
judgement of these four <hi>eminent</hi>
men in their time, approved by
three other equall with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
all fully concurring with
the <hi>Primate</hi> in this particular,
which cannot but prevail much
with such as have been, or are
otherwise minded at this day, I
adde no more, presuming that
those that will despise these, will
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56045:172"/>
set light by any other; and so
much for this subject, <hi>concerning
a set Form of Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are <hi>two</hi> other
things, which upon this occasion
might not be unseasonable to
speak a word of, according to
the <hi>Primates</hi> judgement also.
viz. <hi>Of the length</hi> or <hi>brevity</hi> in
prayer, and of the <hi>Gesture</hi> at it;
in both which, many of this age
have gone astray.</p>
            <p>1. For the <hi>length.</hi> In the
publick, all good discretion
teacheth <hi>ordinarily</hi> not to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
large, (for we speak not now
of <hi>extraordinary</hi> duties in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Fasts) because in a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
all the Auditours are not
of the like <hi>strength.</hi> Some, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that distinction of
<hi>Iohn 1. Ep.</hi> 2. 13, 14.) may be
<hi>Fathers,</hi> some <hi>young men,</hi> but
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:56045:172"/>
others <hi>Children</hi> fitter for <hi>milke
then strong meat,</hi> that a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
at prayer may as ill suit
with them, as putting of a <hi>new
garment to an old,</hi> or <hi>new wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
old bottles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacobs</hi> speech in answer to his
Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> when he would
have had him driven on his pace
with him (<hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 13.) <hi>I will</hi>
(saith he) <hi>lead on softly according
as the Cattle with young, which
are with me, and the children
which are tender shall be able to
endure, lest if I should over-drive
them one day, the flock should
die,</hi> may have its Morall applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the prudence of a Pastor
this way.</p>
            <p>'Tis very dangerous to cause a
<hi>fulnesse</hi> in the worship of God,
that for prayer men should be
apt to say, as those in the <hi>Prophet</hi>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:56045:173"/>
for the <hi>Sabbath, when will it be
done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomons</hi> caveat (<hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 2.)
against <hi>rash and hasty utterings,</hi>
and <hi>multiplying of words in the
house of God,</hi> and his Councell,
upon it. <hi>Let thy words be few,</hi> are
observable, much may be spoken
in a little, and 'tis true in this,
as other matters, <hi>vis unita for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is an excellent Epistle
of Saint</hi> Augustines <hi>concerning
this subject,</hi> (Epist. 121. Probae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duae.)
<hi>that (saith he</hi>) is not a
commendation that he was long at
prayer; <hi>there may be</hi> much speech,
but little praying (multa loquutio
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n multa precatio) <hi>while the
affection is lifted up; like the</hi>
hands of Moses, <hi>so long the party
prayes, when that</hi> is heavie, <hi>the
Act of prayer ceaseth; sometimes
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56045:173"/>
(saith he</hi>) the work of prayer is
rather done (gemitibus quàm ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monibus;
fletu quàm afflatu) with
sighes, then words, teares, then
lips.</p>
            <p>The time when our <hi>Savionr</hi> is
observed to have used a <hi>prolixity,</hi>
was in the <hi>private,</hi> then <hi>whole
nights</hi> in prayer, and <hi>the whole
day till even,</hi> but not in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
respecting, it may be, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
before mentioned. So much
for the length of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the <hi>gesture;</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
the most comely is <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

is <hi>principall,</hi> but that of the body
must not be omitted; both being
<hi>bought with a price,</hi> God must be
<hi>glorified</hi> in both; <hi>present your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as a living holy acceptable
sacrifice</hi> to him (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A second</hi> which is allowed, is
<hi>standing,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 5. <hi>Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat
stood</hi> and prayed, &amp;c. (<hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi>
9. 14.) At a solemn fast, the
<hi>Priests and people stood,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed</hi>
their sinnes: allowed by
our Saviour (<hi>Marc.</hi> 11. 25.) <hi>when
thou standest praying; sitting</hi>
is no fit gesture for it: as even
<note n="*" place="margin">Cas. Cons. de Orat.</note> 
               <hi>Amesius</hi> confirms it. <hi>Sessio non
est gestus orandi,</hi> which is not
justified by that of <hi>David,</hi>
(2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18.) who upon the
Message from God by <hi>Nathan,</hi>
is said presently to have went
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:56045:174"/>
in, and <hi>sate before the Lord and
prayed,</hi> or that of the <hi>Israelites,
(Iudg.</hi> 20. 26.) Who at their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Fasts are said to have <hi>wept,
and sate before the Lord till Even;</hi>
because the same word is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
and as properly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
elsewhere; to <hi>remain, abide,</hi>
or <hi>tarry</hi> in a place, as <hi>Genes.</hi> 27.
44. <hi>tarrying with him, &amp;c.</hi> Lev.
4. 8. <hi>he shall tarry abroad,</hi> 1 Sam.
1. 23. <hi>tarry till thou have weaned
him, &amp;c. cap. 20. 29. thou shalt
remain at the stone, &amp;c.</hi> and so
here, both for <hi>David</hi> and the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi>
the sense is, only they <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued</hi>
or <hi>remained</hi> before the Lord
in prayer and fasting, as that of
<hi>Matth. 4. the people which sate in
darknesse,</hi> &amp;c. can be meant in no
other. Our Saviours <hi>sitting at the
right hand of his Father,</hi> hath as
well the sense of <hi>standing,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:56045:175"/>
to Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> vision of
him, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 56. and that which is
said of the Apostles at the Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>Mark 14. 18, and as they sate
and did eat</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) signifies
rather <hi>a lying down,</hi> leaning one
upon another, and according to
the former instances, may imply
as well a standing, which 'tis
probable was the ancient gesture;
so that sitting may be taken, in
the <hi>latitude</hi> of any other gesture
used at their <hi>remaining</hi> there.</p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>standing</hi> is not so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
limited, but 'tis sometimes
taken for <hi>kneeling,</hi> (2 Chron. 6.
12.) 'Tis said, <hi>Solomon stood</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Altar, <hi>and spread forth
his hands towards heaven;</hi> yet
verse 14. <hi>he stood, and kneeled
down upon his knees,</hi> and (1 Kings
8. 54.) <hi>he arose from kneeling on
his knees,</hi> That woman which
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:56045:175"/>
is said to have <hi>stood</hi> at <hi>Iesus</hi> feet,<note place="margin">Luke 7. 38.</note>
and <hi>kissed</hi> them, and <hi>washed</hi> them
with <hi>her teares, and wiped them
with the hair of her head,</hi> must
imply a <hi>bowing</hi> down, at least to
a kneeling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A third,</hi> which in Scripture
was accustomed with both the
former, is <hi>the lifting up of the
hands,</hi> according to that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
in the Psalmes. <hi>Let us lift up
our hands unto God in the heavens,</hi>

of the face</hi> at publick prayer,
seems to be against the <hi>order</hi> of
the Apostle, and the then <hi>custome</hi>
of the <hi>Churches.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 7. for
by the <hi>head</hi> there is not meant
the hairy scalp, but the <hi>face,</hi> both
by several circumstances in it,
and the acceptation of the word
elsewhere. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. David
<hi>wept as he went, and had hishead
covered, and all the people that
were with him, covered every man
his head, weeping as they went;
&amp;c.</hi> here by the <hi>head</hi> must be
understood the face, after the
manner of <hi>mourners,</hi> as on the
contrary, that of our <hi>Saviour</hi> to
his Disciples, in token of <hi>joy; lift
up your heads,</hi> must be meant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:56045:176"/>
And the <hi>face</hi> being the
seat of <hi>shame,</hi> the <hi>head</hi> must be so
taken, <hi>Ier. 14. 3, 4. they were asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and confounded, they cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their heads,</hi> &amp;c. unto which,
some passages out of <hi>Tertullian</hi>
might be given, by way of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>Now for the better reception
of this latter part of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi>
judgement, concerning
our <hi>outward reverence</hi> in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
worship of God, whether at
<hi>hearing of the Word</hi> or <hi>Prayer;</hi>
so much neglected in these times;
I shall here adde what I find in
the foresaid Mr. <hi>Arthur Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,</hi>
in his <hi>Lectures</hi> upon <hi>Iohn</hi>
4. In the 26. Lecture he speakes
much for the <hi>outward reverence
of Gods publick worship in the
Church.</hi> viz. <hi>That we should neither
come into that place, nor go out of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:56045:177"/>
it, as ye would in or out of a dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-schoole;
But in our very come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, and going out, and whole out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
carriage; we should give
some signification of the reverence
that we bear to this place, and that
we do indeed account it the house
of God; Exhorts men to come to
the beginning of the then publick
worship, or before it begins; and
tarry till all be done:</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the <hi>Administration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and at the blessing pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by Gods Ministers. Affirmes,
that there was nothing then
done in Gods publick worship
among us, but it was done by the
Institution, and Ordinance, and
Commandement of the Lord;</hi> the
particulars of which, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>In his 27. Lecture, he exhorts
to <hi>a reverend gesture in prayer,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:56045:177"/>
kneeling as the fittest; or standing,</hi>
not <hi>sitting.</hi> And commending
the reading of the Scriptures in
publick; he saith, <hi>At the hearing
of the word read, some further ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
and outward signification of
reverence is to be used, then is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at the hearing of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi>
which he confirmes by
proofes out of Scripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
too large to be related
here. But he thus concludes. <hi>viz.
So you see the custome of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in sitting bare while the
Word is read, is grounded upon
good reason and warrant from the
word of God, and such, as it well
becomes every one of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to conform themselves unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lect. 29. he complains of that
irreverence thus.</hi> Some will not
vouchsafe to be bare at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word, some will be bare
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:56045:178"/>
at the Psalmes, not at the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and if they could justly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
infirmity for it, they were to
be excused; but they will not be
bare many of them, so long as the
Text is in reading: yea, every
youth and boy in our Congregations,
are wont to be covered, while the
Word is read.</p>
            <p>But the chief abuse is, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of kneeling in prayer, many
that will kneel at their own private
prayers (which they make at their
coming into the Church) can never
be seen to kneel at the common and
publick prayers. Many that will
kneel at the Lords prayer, will
kneel at no other, wherein (though
the Lords prayer be in sundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
more excellent then any other
yet) there is as much reason we
should kneel at any other prayer,
as at it; for the reason of our
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:56045:178"/>
kneeling, is not the excellency of
the words used in prayer, but the
reverence and duty we owe to the
person we pray unto, <hi>&amp;c. This saith
that</hi> worthy and judicious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Mr.</hi> Hildersham,) <hi>I can but
wonder, upon what pretence
such a man could be silenced,
(as he wrot himselfe to the</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>I conclude only with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
to <hi>decency, and a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
comelinesse</hi> in our solemne
meetings, that devotion and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may <hi>kisse</hi> each other, that
while the soule is <hi>lifted up</hi> in
prayer, the body may be <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi>
and the whole man <hi>present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
to God as an <hi>acceptable sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
that <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>uniformity</hi> in

found among us, and that we
may all be of <hi>one heart,</hi> and <hi>one

            <head>A
CHARACTER of Bishop
Bedell late Bishop of Kilmore,
in Ireland.</head>
            <p>UPon the occasion of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
this <hi>Sermon</hi> of his
(on <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4.) I have thought
fit to give this <hi>exemplary character</hi>
of him. Somewhat of his life is
already extant, within that of Sir
<hi>Henry Wotton's,</hi> the enlargement
of which, I leave to the prudence
of others, onely thus much in
brief.</p>
            <p>He was <hi>Fellow of Emmanuel
Colledge in Cambridge,</hi> where he
was one of the <hi>eight</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
<hi>Batchellours of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:56045:180"/>
of that house in one yeare:
whereof <hi>Bishop Hall</hi> and <hi>Doctor
Ward</hi> were two, between whom
and him, there was a continuall
intercourse of Letters to their
last. From that <hi>Colledge</hi> and <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,</hi>
he had that <hi>Character</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him of learning, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that he was chosen to go
with the <hi>Embassadour Sir</hi> Henry
Wotton <hi>unto Venice.</hi> What the
fruits of his some yeares being
there produced upon <hi>Padre Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
and other learned men, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
appears by the testimony
given of him in a letter of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador's</hi>
hereunto annexed. The
<hi>Interdict of Venice</hi> (wrot by the
foresaid Authour,) he translated
out of <hi>Italian</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> for
whose use he also translated the
book of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
and made an <hi>English Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:56045:180"/>
(which I have seen writ with
his own hand.)</p>
            <p>After his return from <hi>Venice,</hi>
were wrot those learned <hi>Letters</hi>
of his to Mr. <hi>Wadesworth,</hi> who
at the same time, going with the
<hi>Embassadour into Spain,</hi> had been
withdrawn to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
whose temper and meeknesse of
stile to an <hi>Apostate,</hi> I wish were
so far exemplary with some Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
among our selves, as to abate
that <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>bitternesse,</hi> which
hath broke forth in matters of
lesse consequence.</p>
            <p>At his Benefice of <hi>Horningesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earth</hi>
near St. <hi>Edm. Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
he continued long in great esteem,
sometimes chosen by the Diocesse
to be a member of the <hi>Convocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the death of Sir <hi>William
Temple</hi> Provost of the Colledge in
<hi>Dublin,</hi> the late <hi>Primate</hi> wrot ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:56045:181"/>
to him to accept of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unanimously chosen by the
<hi>Fellowes.</hi> During his abode there,
he performed the duty of the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chist,</hi>
&amp; preached a Lecture Sermon
once a week in Christ Church.</p>
            <p>He was not long <hi>Provost,</hi> but
he was promoted to be <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> where (I being then
the <hi>Dean</hi>) it gave me the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be more known to him.</p>
            <p>In relation to the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he gave
this direction; <hi>viz.</hi> to observe
whatsoever was enjoyned in the
<hi>Rubrick</hi> without <hi>addition</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution;</hi>
not to be led by <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi>
but by <hi>rule.</hi> And in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,
he ordered that the whole
<hi>Doxology</hi> to the blessed <hi>Trinity,
Glory be to the Father,</hi> &amp;c. should
be alwayes read by the <hi>Minister
alone,</hi> without the <hi>respond</hi> of the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56045:181"/>
people, and the like for the
<hi>Psalms: Te Deum,</hi> &amp;c. with the
rest, appointed to be read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
and after the <hi>Lessons,</hi>
though the custome had prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
otherwise in most Churches.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Communion Table</hi> was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by him, not at the <hi>East</hi> end,
but within the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi>
and for other <hi>Innovations</hi>
elsewhere introduced, he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them not. His judgement
being, that those were as well
<hi>Non-conformists,</hi> who <hi>added</hi> of
their own, as those who came
<hi>short</hi> of what was enjoyned, as
he that <hi>addes</hi> an inch to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
disownes it for a <hi>rule,</hi> as well
as he that cuts an inch <hi>off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a careful observer of
the <hi>Lords Day</hi> both in the <hi>publick</hi>
and <hi>private,</hi> at one of the clock
in the after-noon; he had then
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:56045:182"/>
the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> read
in the <hi>Irish</hi> tongue in the Church
for the benefit of the <hi>Irish;</hi> at
which he was constantly present
himself, who in that little space
had obtained the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the
language. And as the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
had been long before tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into <hi>Irish;</hi> so had he caused
the <hi>Old Testam.</hi> to be accordingly,
&amp; was almost ready for the press.</p>
            <p>And Whereas Doctor <hi>Heylene</hi>
hath censured the late <hi>Primate</hi>
very liberally for his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Articles of Ireland,</hi> he
must take <hi>Bishop Bedell</hi> into the
number also, who was so much for
them, that I was present when,
at the examination of an<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr. Thomas Price</hi> then Fellow of the Colledge of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who afterwards suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much in the same Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse by the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and is yet living in <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </note> able
<hi>Minister</hi> then to be <hi>ordained,</hi> he did
in the Church examin him in each,
or most of the <hi>Articles,</hi> in a solemn
meeting of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesse
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:56045:182"/>
for that end, at least 2 full
hours, whereby our <hi>votes</hi> might
be also given for his approbation.</p>
            <p>At his <hi>Courts of Iurisdiction,</hi>
he frequently sate himself; where
he caused alwayes some of the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> (if any were there) to sit
covered on each side of him, with
<hi>liberty</hi> to give their opinion in
each case, and at a <hi>sentence,</hi> he
asked their votes man by man:
In some degree reducing then his
<hi>Episcopall</hi> to a <hi>Synodicall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
according to the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi>
proposall by way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
<hi>an.</hi> 1641. It was his
custome usually on the <hi>Lord's</hi>
dayes, to preach upon those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
portions of Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the <hi>Epistles</hi> and
<hi>Gospels</hi> of the day.</p>
            <p>At the <hi>Visitations,</hi> he usually
preached himselfe. The <hi>Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
were bestowed in defraying
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:56045:183"/>
the charges of the Ministers, and
the rest given to some pious uses.</p>
            <p>After <hi>dinner</hi> and <hi>supper,</hi> a <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
was constantly read at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and some time spent by him in
opening some difficulties in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>publick Catechisme,</hi> he had
branched out into 52 parts; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he appointed one to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
explain'd in the <hi>Afternoons</hi>
in each Church, within his Diocess.</p>
            <p>He was very indulgent to the
<hi>Irish</hi> Natives, in the preferring and
encouraging of them for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery;
and yet such was their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi>
(i. e. the Popish party)
that in that horrid <hi>rebellion,</hi> 1641.
they exempted him not from
their rapine; but seized upon his
<hi>cattle,</hi> pillaged his <hi>house,</hi> ransack't
and spoyled his <hi>Library;</hi> put him
into a <hi>Castle,</hi> standing in a <hi>Lough,</hi>
(called <hi>Lough-outre</hi>) about a
mile and a halfe from his house,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:56045:183"/>
where he was <hi>imprisoned</hi> that
winter. And at length being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to come out, died in a
poor house of one who was an
<hi>Irish-man,</hi> and a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and
continued faithfull to him; by
whose means an <hi>Hebrew manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
Bible</hi> of his, (which he
brought from <hi>Venice</hi>) was preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and is now in <hi>Emmanuel</hi>
Colledge Library in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was <hi>buried</hi> acccording to his
own <hi>appointment</hi> in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
of the Cathedral of <hi>Kilmore,</hi>
where he had caused his <hi>wife</hi> and
<hi>son</hi> some years before to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
His judgement being against
burials in Churches, as an <hi>abuse</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by pride &amp; superstition.</p>
            <p>I conclude only with this, if
the <hi>Moderation</hi> of this <hi>Bishop</hi> had
been observed elsewhere, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> might have been
kept <hi>upon its wheeles.</hi>

truth (so far as your Majesty will

            <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Pierce</hi> hath in an
<hi>Appendage</hi> to a late book
of his, printed <hi>five Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
wrot unto me by him, in each
of which I cannot but much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his <hi>respects</hi> to me.
To the <hi>four</hi> first I gave little else
but brief returnes of the like to
him, which consisting <hi>chiefly,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the asserting of the <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
of his judgement to the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's,</hi>
or the <hi>remotenesse</hi> of Mr.
<hi>Barlee's,</hi> I did not conceive it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for me to interpose, and
where there was a professed <hi>full
agreement,</hi> it was no good office
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:56045:186"/>
in me to make a <hi>difference.</hi> Now
for those, the cause rendred of his
not publishing them is good,
there being <hi>nothing</hi> (as he saith)
<hi>needfull, or of concernment, in any
one of them,</hi> Only to the <hi>fifth</hi> of
his, wherein <hi>three Certificates</hi> are
published as testimonies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
his former assertion of a <hi>late
change of judgment in the Primate,</hi>
with other applicatory passages
from thence, I did return him a
<hi>larger</hi> answer in this <hi>Letter</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
(excepting somefew <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiall</hi>
alterations) having
then no imagination that <hi>either</hi> of
them should have bin made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
And I have as little mind to
it now, only by the <hi>provocation</hi>
of divers of my Friends who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Primate</hi> suffers in the
interpretation of many by the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of it, I have been compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56045:186"/>
upon this occasion, to put
forth this brief <hi>defence</hi> of him
without any <hi>offence</hi> to Mr. <hi>Pierce.</hi>
For his <hi>Appendage</hi> (wherein his
respects to me are rather encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
then lesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed) I have thought
fit to clear <hi>one passage.</hi> He saith
I have spoken <hi>indiscriminately</hi> of
Universal <hi>Grace,</hi> and Vniversall
<hi>Redemption,</hi> and the place he
quotes for it, is out of my second
Letter to Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> p. 64. in
these words, viz. <hi>But that by an
Vniversall Redemption should be
understood, an Vniversall Grace,
&amp;c. will not be attested to have
heen affirmed by the Primate,</hi> &amp;c.
doth not this clearly imply a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
to be made between
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am sure I then so inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it. And therefore that which
he addes immediately after. <hi>viz.
That there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:56045:187"/>
them, I</hi> do fully concurre
with him in it. Yet it seems to
me, that himself puts them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
often <hi>indiscriminately,</hi> as in
the page before this, thrice in
one page, 86. and p. 88. l. 32. as
in his <hi>Philanth.</hi> p. 15. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
And if I have in any
other place done it, as in the title
of the Letter, I was led to it by
him. In this we have no disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I wish this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Letter may not occasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Owe you many thanks for
the labour you have taken in
your last Letter of the 28. of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> in transcribing the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates
of those learned persons,
which (supposing to have been
rightly apprehended by them,
without any mistake of him, yet)
favourably interpreted, do not
seem to me necessarily to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
what you have apprehended,
and concluded of the change of
judgement in the <hi>Primate,</hi> which
I shall now ingenuously give
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:56045:188"/>
you my sense of, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of further dispute or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about it.</p>
            <p>First for Doctor <hi>Walton's,</hi> where
he saith, <hi>My Lord Primate did
declare his utter dislike of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of absolute reprobation;</hi> I
conceive it may be understood
of the <hi>Supralapsarian</hi> opinion,
which makes reprobation to be
antecedent to the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and not only as a <hi>Praeterition,</hi> but
a <hi>Predamnation</hi> for actuall sins.
<hi>That he held the universality of
Christ's death, not onely in respect
of sufficiency, but also in regard of
efficacy, so that all men were by
that made salvable</hi> (for so much
<hi>efficacy</hi> I do not deny) differs
not from that which his letter
published, doth testifie, <hi>and that
the reason why all men were not
thereby saved, was because they
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:56045:188"/>
did not accept of salvation offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
is also granted, if it be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his judgement rightly
understood, <hi>viz.</hi> of those to
whom the Gospel is preached; not
of Pagans, and Infidels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the grace of Conversion
was not irresistable, but that men
did often resist and reject the same,</hi>
may well stand with my Lord
<hi>Primate's</hi> Judgement, and no
wayes opposite to this. <hi>viz.</hi> That
it is so effectual, that by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of his election; It is not
<hi>resisted</hi> by the elect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>his dissent from Geneva</hi> (as
Doctor <hi>Walton</hi> certifies) is to be
understood of <hi>Beza,</hi> not of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin;</hi>
nor of the <hi>Sublapsarian</hi> (as I
have intimated before) and I
conceive his <hi>concurrence with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Overall,</hi> which he averreth
him to have professed, is to be
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:56045:189"/>
understood as I have expressed it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for you know that <hi>Bishop Overall</hi>
distinguished the <hi>Remonstrants</hi>
opinion, and that which he is
pleased to call the opinion of the
<hi>Puritans;</hi> (which title I wish he
had spared) from the doctrine of
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which
joynes the universality of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
with the speciall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, effectually to save
the elect. This for Doctor <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's</hi>
Certificate.</p>
            <p>Now for Mr. <hi>Goninges,</hi> which
seems (by the Preface of it) to have
bin given you after your publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord <hi>Primate's</hi> change of
judgment; somewhat of that may
be safely granted; <hi>viz. The sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God's universal call of all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to whom the Gospel was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,</hi>
which is the summe of
what he affirmes to have heard,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:56045:189"/>
from him in the publick, but for
that which he saith he received
from him in private, <hi>viz. That
God, together with his word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
did give internal grace to all
that are called by it, that they may
repent if they will, yea they all
can will, &amp;c.</hi> If the <hi>Primate's</hi>
words were not mistaken by him,
(as they might the more possibly
by the distance between the
hearing, and the date of his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
to you) I suppose this was
the sense of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That by
<hi>internall</hi> grace he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
more, then that there are
some <hi>good motions</hi> offered unto
the <hi>hearts</hi> of sinners, which if
they did not <hi>extinguish</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,</hi>
and thereby draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves a <hi>further guilt,</hi>
they should be <hi>seconded</hi> with
more <hi>effectuall</hi> grace; and, that
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:56045:190"/>
upon their disobedience, God
doth <hi>justly</hi> leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and doth not superadde
that <hi>speciall grace,</hi> whereby their
<hi>Wills</hi> are <hi>changed,</hi> and their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi>
wrought. As for <hi>posse non
resistere,</hi> it is consistent with actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>resistance,</hi> which is taken away
by speciall grace, and thus far
I conceive he might hold with <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Overall;</hi> so much for Mr.
<hi>Goninge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Thornedick's</hi> Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I see not wherein it differeth
from the Lord <hi>Primate's</hi> Letter
published, and needs no further
answer. So that upon the whole
I do not find, even by these Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates,
so sure a ground, for
your assertion of my Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's
change of judgement,</hi> and his
<hi>being of late a serious convert, &amp;c.</hi>
as you have supposed; The first
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:56045:190"/>
pretend but little, the last less, and
the middle not much; thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted:
Howsoever for <hi>my self,</hi>
had I been an ear-witnesse of that
which certifies the most <hi>largely,</hi>
I should have had more <hi>caution</hi>
then to have adventured to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the judgement of so <hi>eminent</hi> a
person, <hi>under hand, and seale,</hi> (as
you say you have it) without his
knowledge, or consent, whether
when he was <hi>living,</hi> or since his
<hi>death,</hi> especially in that which
should seem to <hi>imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
to what he had before
<hi>said</hi> and <hi>wrot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that <hi>Objection</hi> of the 32
Article of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Article
may very well admit of some
<hi>preparative</hi> motions tending to
conversion, but not the actuall
grace of conversion; and may also
be understood of denying an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:56045:191"/>
tuall call</hi> of all men, which are
out of the <hi>Pale</hi> of the Church, or
that the works of the creation
and providence do lead men, or
enable them to come to Christ,
as some <hi>French Divines</hi> have
lately taught.</p>
            <p>For that <hi>inconsistency</hi> implyed
by you, from what I have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of my Lord <hi>Primates</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Massa corrupta</hi>
was the object of predestination,
it will well consist with his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of universall redemption,
expressed in his letter. And, the
decree of <hi>reprobation,</hi> supposed to
be <hi>ex intentione speciali,</hi> doth not
deny a <hi>salvability</hi> of all men,
but onely an effectuall grace to
be given to work their conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and may also consist with
universall redemption, and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of salvation, because repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:56045:191"/>
is onely <hi>negatio specialis
gratiae, non nudae sufficientis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Goteschalchus,</hi> the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
relating the truth of the
story, and his opinion, is not
thereby obliged to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of them, and if there were
any mistakes of Mr. <hi>Barlee's</hi> from
thence, or that large <hi>Catechisme</hi>
going under his name, doth
not concern me to take notice of:</p>
            <p>For that which you mention of
Mr. <hi>Vaughans</hi> relation in the life,
and death of Doctor <hi>Iackson,</hi> of
the care which the <hi>Primate</hi> took,
(being (as you say) a <hi>Mourner</hi>
at his funerall) to have his
writings <hi>very religiously</hi> preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
First, I have viewed the
place, and find some mistake in
the words, which are onely thus;
<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Bishop of Armagh, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his funerall</hi>) much desired
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:56045:192"/>
his papers might be <hi>carefully</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
But secondly, I do not
believe the <hi>Primate</hi> meant, or
approved those works of Doctor
<hi>Iacksons,</hi> wherein he professeth
himself to be for the <hi>Arminian</hi>
way, as he doth in the Epistle
Dedicatory of those Bookes
which he dedicated to the <hi>Earle
of Pembrook,</hi> and which were
answered by Doctor <hi>Twisse.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
works it may be, that <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
man might have of other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which might be usefull
to posterity, which the <hi>Primate</hi>
might have a care of, but I do
not believe they were any of
<hi>that nature;</hi> and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they must be meant of
such works which were <hi>not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi>
at his death, and not of those
which were <hi>already</hi> printed, as
you seem to apply it. Besides, it
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56045:192"/>
doth not appear, the <hi>Primate</hi>
then understood what subjects
they were of; And therefore,
that which you have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
added of your own; <hi>viz.
That such inestimable <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> might
not be wanting to posterity, but
might performe their work of
bringing religion into its wits,</hi>
(which the Reader might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
mistake, in apprehending
them to have been the <hi>Primates</hi>
words) and your somewhat se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
application to <hi>him,</hi> from
thence, and what Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> had
said of Doctor <hi>Iackson,</hi> seemes to
want a foundation here.</p>
            <p>For that which you write in
your <hi>Postcript</hi> concerning my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the doctrine of St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
was confirmed,</hi> or inclined
unto by the <hi>Primate</hi> in his works,
if you observe the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:56045:193"/>
it is onely in relation to
<hi>Pelagius</hi> and his disciples, and
limited to those points in debate
concerning the <hi>Primates</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereof <hi>universall redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and free will,</hi> were mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
not that by it I had obliged
the <hi>Primate</hi> to be of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi>
judgement in all points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides:
And for that particular
of <hi>perseverance,</hi> which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in, it came not into my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in either of my Letters
to Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> what he or Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> have produced of the
<hi>Primates</hi> apprehension; what
was Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> judgement
in that point, cannot argue
it was therefore his own; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
conceived in it, in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Tractates, and where he
hath some expressions <hi>tending to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56045:193"/>
the finall falling away of some
who have been regenerated and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified;</hi>
he is thus salved by others,
who understand him either, <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificatis
Sacramento tenus,</hi> or <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio
charitatis,</hi> that they were such,
or of some <hi>predispositions</hi> to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
in some Morall reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
not of a spiritual real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
which he denies to any
reprobate.</p>
            <p>Now in this variety of senses,
you should have done better then
thus, to chuse the worse; for the
<hi>Primates</hi> judgement, who was
against the <hi>Total and final</hi> falling
away of those, who were effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
called, truly regenerated
and sanctified, according to the
38 Article of <hi>Ireland;</hi> And thus
I have touched the principal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
in your Letter.</p>
            <p>For that you say, <hi>some have
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:56045:194"/>
endeavoured to gain credit to their
Calvinistical opinions by their
unjust usurpation of the</hi> Primates
<hi>name.</hi> I could wish those hard
expressions tending so much to
the distaste of <hi>Calvin,</hi> might be
abated; whom divers of the most
<hi>eminent Writers,</hi> and <hi>learned
Fathers</hi> of our Church, (whom
I suppose you reverence) have
had in <hi>great esteem;</hi> and usually
name him with honour.</p>
            <p>I might quote divers, as Arch-Bishop
<hi>Whitgift,</hi> Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi>
Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Ward,</hi> &amp;c. but Bishop
<hi>Andrewes</hi> shall suffice, who in
his <hi>determination against usury,</hi>
(a case wherein he dissented
from <hi>Calvin</hi> yet) thus writes of
of him. <hi>Calvino (illustri viro nec
unquam sine summi honoris prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatione
nominando</hi>) &amp;c. i. e.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:56045:194"/>
               <hi>Calvin an excellent man, never to
be named without a Preface of the
highest honour.</hi> I wish that spirit
of <hi>meeknesse</hi> and charity found in
those old Bishops, were <hi>doubled</hi>
upon us in these dayes, when we
are as much (if not <hi>more</hi>) called
unto it; The contrary may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be gratefull to the <hi>See of
Rome,</hi> but I do not see what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
it can be to <hi>us.</hi> For his
<hi>discipline,</hi> you may take your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
which may well be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from his <hi>doctrines.</hi> And
for the <hi>Primate,</hi> though I cannot
say he was of his judgement in
<hi>all</hi> points, yet he had a <hi>due respect</hi>
for him.</p>
            <p>For that which you <hi>object</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to me, as you did in your
third Letter, <hi>viz. my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeing</hi>
an engagement to Mr.
<hi>Barlee for his readinesse offered,</hi>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:56045:195"/>
(in his first Letter unto me) <hi>to
clear the Primate,</hi> &amp;c. did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a repetition, being it was in
my first to him, when he was as
much a <hi>stranger</hi> to me, as I was
to you: only, let me say thus
much of him. How far he had
disagreed in his book from the
<hi>Primates</hi> judgement; I shall not
now enquire, but after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of that <hi>tractate,</hi> wherein he
read what his was; he wrot thus
unto me (<hi>Decemb.</hi> 21. 1657.) viz.
<hi>It is true, there be some</hi> minutiae,
<hi>about which I am not satisfied,
and shall be glad to have an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
conference with you. However
as to the</hi> rei summam, <hi>I do so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
agree with the most venerable</hi>
Primate, <hi>as that I dare discharge
you from all feares of ever having
him exposed to my pen, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
&amp;c.</hi> which I doe the rather
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:56045:195"/>
thus punctually repeat his words,
because in <hi>short</hi> you have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it from me in your <hi>fourth
Letter.</hi> And when I had <hi>read</hi> you
both, meeting in the <hi>Primate,</hi> I
thought it my part to sit down
in <hi>silence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, you have with much
industry viewed, and reviewed
the <hi>Primates</hi> judgement in that
<hi>point,</hi> which hath been published,
but I wish I did not find you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that use of it, to endeavour
to confirm <hi>your former assertion of
a change in him,</hi> in which I am not
in the least <hi>shaken in mind</hi> by
what hath passed between us, but
must still conceive (contrary to
your expectation in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of your Letter) there was
a <hi>mistake</hi> wheresoever it lights,
which being so gentle an expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and which we are all subject
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:56045:196"/>
unto, I see no cause of any offence,
either to your self, or Certifiers.</p>
            <p>I shall entreat you to let <hi>the
venerable name</hi> (as you stile it) of
that good man rest in peace,
without any further <hi>strife of
tongues or pens;</hi> and let us leave
his judgment to his works, which
do <hi>undoubtedly</hi> testifie of him:
and for any further dispute of
<hi>this subject</hi> between us, I wish
this might be the <hi>last,</hi> as it is the
largest; and that neither by this,
nor any other, the least breach
may be made between us, as to
love, and friendship, which upon
all occasions, shall ever ber rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
