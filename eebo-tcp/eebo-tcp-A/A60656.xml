         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the firſt part of this Book thou mayeſt behold the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Love of God, with the Work of his Power, and
thou mayeſt alſo behold how man comes to be regenerated,
and waſhed, by the Everlaſting Truth, and what the ſtate of
man is in the Truth, and what the ſtate of man is out of the
Truth; and thou mayeſt ſee how Life is attained through
Death, and how Reſt and Peace in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> comes to be
poſſeſſed. In the middle part thou mayeſt behold a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
unto the Truth, and Enmity and Deceit in oppoſition to
the Truth. In the latter part thou mayeſt behold divers
Caſes ſtated, by which thou mayeſt perceive ſomething of the
Law, and the practice in it, and how deeply innocent people
ſuffer for want of Right: And theſe things thou reading
over, and diligently obſerving, it may overcome thee, to chuſe
the better part; and in ſo doing, thou wilt be kept out of all
crooked and perverſe wayes, and not run with thoſe that are
wicked, nor joyn hands with cruel men. And as for the
middle part of this Book coming to view, it is through a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
upon me to do good, and that Warning may be taken
by all who in ſuch caſes are concerned: for I do not publiſh
that part, becauſe I would lay open the faults of any, neither
to boaſt or glory over the weakneſs of any; for I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Love of God, and with that I can cover a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb facs="tcp:40200:3"/>
of Offences; though in the ſame Love a Neceſſity is
upon me, to make ſuch Practices manifeſt, that whoſoever
is found in them, may ſpeedily repent and turn from them;
and that ſuch as are yet free from them, may be preſerved
out of them, that ſo all may come to finde mercy with the
Lord. And now let thy mind be to the Good in thy ſelf,
and with the Light of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> reade this Book thorow,
and learn of the meek Spirit of God, for in that there is no
envie; ſo will it teach thee Truth, and lead thee into all
Truth, where thou wilt feel the Everlaſting Springs, and
the pure Streams of clenſing; and as thou waiteſt in the
Spirit, thou wilt feel the Effects of it to be Love, and the
Virtue of its nature, Gentleneſs and Peace; and if thou mindſt
it, to obey it, thou mayeſt do well, in which my labour will
be anſwered, who deſires the well-being of all men.</p>

            <head>THE
Standing Truth, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>LOve is of God, and by the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, the
Love of God is ſhed abroad in the hearts of all that
believe; for the Light is a manifeſtation that beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth from the Love, and in the Light the Love
is tendered, it is an univerſal Principle, that in its own purity
diſcovereth the world in mans heart; for the uiniverſality of its
manifeſtation is not incloſed within the compaſs of any bounds,
but unto all men it giveth light, and makes manifeſt with its
light, what is preſent in every man; and in this manifeſtation
the darkneſs cannot limit it, for it is manifeſt in the univerſal
love of God, to give light to all that are in darkneſs, that all in
it might believe, and come to everlaſting Life. Now here
is the love of God firſt to man, which love being received, as
in the Light it is manifeſted, then man comes to be drawn with
the love of God, to love God again, and this is perfect love,
with which love the ſinner is ſought, and for ſin reproved, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Lord God doth make known his own compaſſion to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and doth manifeſt, <hi>That he would not the death of a ſinner,
but hath given his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in
him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting Life.</hi> And with this light
of Chriſt Jeſus, is every man enlightened that cometh into the
world, and by it, there is an univerſal manifeſtation of the love
of God; and though the Lord God doth thus manifeſt his love
unto man, and hath given to every man a meaſure of the Light
of Chriſt, with which he is enlightened, and with which he ſees
his ſin, yet man not obeying the Teſtimony of it, he abideth
ſtill in darkneſs, and ſo he errs from the way of Truth and Life,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40200:4"/>
and is a wanderer in deſart places, and takes up his abode in the
dark corners of the earth, and there ſits eſtranged from God,
and alienated from his Life, and there man ſuffers bondage and
affliction in himſelf, his pain and his ſorrow is daily upon him,
and his anguiſh and his grief is continually about him; for no
man can have true peace in his own houſe untill he come to the
Light of Chriſt, with which he is enlightened; and after he is
turned unto the Light, and come into obedience, then he hath
a war to make, and a great battel to fight, before he can come to
feel his peace ſetled and ſealed; for with the Light, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of ſin, and the body of death is diſcovered, and then m<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
comes to ſee how many enemies doth compaſs him about, and
how by them he is ſeparated from God, then he comes to ſee
what he muſt war againſt, and what armour he muſt put on to
ſtand in the battel, and what weapon he muſt take to make way
thorow his enemies; and by believing in the Light and following
the Light, he receives ſtrength againſt his foes, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Light, he hath received the Love of God, and then
he ſtands clad with the whole armour of God, and takes the
ſword of God, with which he ſmiteth to the heart of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and wounds them to death, ſo ſees his enemies fall before
him, and when they are fallen he caſts them out, and cleanſeth
his houſe, and then Chriſt Jeſus takes the poſſeſſion, and he
brings everlaſting peace in with him; and this is a wiſe man,
whoſe eye looks to his own houſe, and takes care of his own
family; ſuch a man loves peace at home, and delights to ſee
his family in order, and he is a Chriſtian and not an Infidel;
for all Infidels are unfaithful to the Light, and ſo neglect their
own houſes, and take no care for their own family, and their
houſe is out of order, and their family is not provided for, and
there is no peace in that houſe; for, when man's eye opens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, he lets his enemies into his houſe, and they ſit
and rejoyce over him; there the luſt of the Eye goeth forth, and
the pride of Life exalteth and ruleth, and in that part, all envy,
and malice, and evil-will is begotten and nouriſhed, and there
the ſeed of the evil-doet hath his authority, and from his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
proceeds all unrighteouſneſs, all the bad thoughts, words,
and deeds; it is the very Womb of cruelty, and the Breaſt that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40200:4"/>
nouriſheth the perſecuting Birth; and whileſt this is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that peace of the houſe is diſturbed, and all the family
is out of order, and ſuch a man is worſe than an Infidel, who
takes not care of his own family, but lets in enemies and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
them, and ſo harbours that which diſquieteth his family,
and deſtroyes it; and then his own houſe being filled with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and they ſitting in authority over him, he becomes actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
diſpoſed by them, and in their nature he appears againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and ſo envy, and malice, and evil-will, and cruelty,
and perſecution is brought forth, and from the ſtrength of
darkneſs within, it comes to be executed upon the innocent
without, and this is the wicked ſtate, unto which there is
no peace; but the righteous rejoyce in God, and in his Love
their peace is ſealed: Now the Light being loved, the houſe
comes to be cleanſed, and all the old rubbiſh of envy and
malice purged out; for the Power comes to have an operation
in all that believe, and by its working it kills the luſt of the eye,
and cuts down the pride of Life, and ſlayes the perverſe Nature
in every part, and roots out the man of Sin, and brings down
the Throne of Antichriſt, and ſo the Seed of God riſeth, and the
water of cleanſing is felt, and the little leaven is known, that
worketh all into a new lump, ſo that the heart and mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
clean, and the inward parts are waſhed, and here Chriſt
is known in his power, and his fan is felt to go in man, and the
fire is felt that burns the chaffe, and for this end is Chriſt made
manifeſt; and thus doth he come to man in the fall, his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is with him, yea it goes before him, to cut down the ſeed
of the evil-doer: but they who abide the day of his coming, or
who ſtand before him when he thus appeareth, who love his
refining hand, and turn not their back upon him, or who abide
the furnace, until the work be perfected by him. Oh his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is dreadful whilſt the wicked ſtandeth, but his mercy is
ſweet when the wicked is removed. And thus to be regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is a work beyond man's own reaſon, and thus to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
and changed is a ſtate not to be comprehended: and who
comes to the putting off their old things, they are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
new, and ſo paſſes from death to life in the tranſlation,
and then they are born again of incorruptible Seed, in which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40200:5"/>
Seed the Goſpel is known, and Goſpel-Peace poſſeſſed; and
there is Chriſt in his power over all, he rules in the family, and
all the houſe is in good order, and plentifully provided for; and
he fills that houſe with his peace, and all the family have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of joy in his preſence; Here a man is in Chriſt, and is a
Chriſtian, and then he is no more his own, but in the Life he is
diſpoſed, and all his fruits appear for God; Love is become his
Garment, and Meekneſs the Girdle of his Loins; and this is
the Birth born of God, and to do his will it doth delight; to
love enemies is its nature, and it can feed them when they hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and give them drink when they thriſt; it cannot revile when
it is reviled, it cannot ſeek revenge when it is perſecuted, for it
is born of Love, and in love is naturally diſpoſed; and this is the
man that is after God, who is regenerated by the power of God,
and is born of the Seed of God, which Seed is holy, pure, and
perfect, which Seed is Chriſt, the Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs
of God; and as he is in himſelf, ſo he is made the ſame to all
that are born of him; then man with his virtues becomes cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and is holy as he is holy, in which holineſſe God is ſeen, and
in this pure holy life of Chriſt, the pure Religion is known, a
Religion undefiled, (mark) Chriſt undefiled, the Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled,
and that Religion that is not ſo, is none of his, for the
pure Religion ſtandeth in him, and all his freſh ſprings open
in it; the heavenly water of Life is felt, and known, and his
Streames run and ceaſe not; the Lord God doth open his
Fountain, the ſtrength of his love goes forth, the River clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the Valleys, and the ſweetneſs of its virtue is felt from
ſea to ſea, the ſtrength of it is very great, and the banks with
its fulneſs is ready to break; this Religion flouriſheth in the
Life, and in the Life it ſtands firm for ever, and of its heavenly
virtue there is no end. And here is the ſtanding Truth, in which
Truth Chriſt is fed upon, and the meat that endures to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life is known; <hi>This is the Bread that comes down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which if a man eat he ſhall never die; and except man eat of
this, he hath no Life in Chriſt;</hi> and in this all changable things
have their end, he puts that part down, out of which the many
Religions ariſe; and ſo they decay and wax old, but he endures
the ſame for ever, and brings in a ſtanding Religion in his own
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40200:5"/>
nature, and in this Religion there is no ſtrife, nor envy, nor
perſecution, (for that is <hi>Cain's</hi> mark) but love, and peace,
and good will to all men, the love that overcomes <hi>Cain's</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and races out his mark, and proclaims <hi>Peace on earth, and
Good-will amongſt men:</hi> Here is Chriſt manifeſted in the Fathers
Love, and <hi>he would not the death of a ſinner,</hi> this is his mind;
and a ſinner is conttary to his pure Nature, in which <hi>there is no
ſin.</hi> Then they have not the Mind of Chriſt that will <hi>Kill</hi> and
<hi>Perſecute</hi> about Religion, and <hi>Oppreſs</hi> thoſe that are contrary
minded; that is the work of Antichriſt where ever it is, and
ſuch are not redeemed out of the World, but lives in it, and
with that part ſlays the Lamb, and crucifies the holy One, and
that is ſpiritual <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the Juſt ſuffers; for man
not being redeemed, hath a part ſtanding that doth not regard
the Innocency, but rules over it, and there man is wiſe in his
own eyes, and with that part he is lifted up, and under that part
doth the Innocent ſuffer, and that is the part which defiles a
man, and toſſes his mind with the waves of its ſea; for man
can never come to true ſettlement, whilſt that part liveth in
him, that would be wiſe in knowledge out of the Life; and
whilſt man is there ſeeking to know, and to be ſatisfied with
knowledge, that very part comes over him with a vail, and
blinds his mind from that which he is ſeeking to know; and this
part will wreſt things according to its own apprehenſion, and
from its own apprehenſion will draw concluſions, and that doth
thicken the vail upon man's heart, but never removes it; and
man being thus ſcituate in his own Wiſdom and Reaſon, and
with that part comprehending, he ſtands at the greateſt diſtance
from that through which the things of God are revealed, and
his mind is not ſimple to receive the ſimple Truth, but in the
ſubtile wiſdom of the fleſh, and the reaſon in that part, he is
ſtriving to comprehend; and here many ſeek but find not, ask
but receive not, they are amiſs in themſelves, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
things into that part which God doth never anſwer; and
many lye here unſatisfied, and many alſo that ſatisfie themſelves
with that which they have comprehended, into which their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
is entered, though from God that part was never anſwered,
and ſo they build their neſts on high, and in their wiſdom ſit puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40200:6"/>
up, and there the fowls of the aire pleaſe themſelves with
notions, with which the juſt are oppreſſed. Oh how many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
their enemy in their houſe, how do they harbour him,
and lodge him, and every way ſeek to pleaſe him, as the moſt
worthy gueſt; but the beſt friend may ſtand and knock, and not
a door open to let him in! Oh that people did but conſider their
preſent ſtates, how is man filled with that which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
brings home, and how doth he receive it as the moſt lovely
thing, if the old wiſdom doth but hunt, and the old reaſon bring
it home, with what joy is that entertained, and how choicely is
that treaſured up, and what pride and glory doth man take in
ſuch riches, it needs not be anſwered in words, for he that with
the Light of Chriſt will ſearch his own houſe, may find it to be
ſo, and receive an anſwer from the Witneſs of God in his own
Conſcience? and therefore it is high time for all people, of all
ſorts and ſects, to awake, for time is ſwift, and being paſt, none
can make it their own again. Oh ſearch with that of God in
you, that which bears the burden of uncleanneſs, and of all your
own righteousneſs. Oh down into the deeps, where you never
yet have been, that you may come to clearneſs in the bottom,
and learn the wonders of the Lord in that place; and if you
love the Light, you may ſee your gueſts, and how with ſtrangers
every room of your houſe is filled, and how the Son of Peace
and Love is excluded and ſhut out, he is too low for your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and too mean for your Reaſon, and when he would come
in by his Light, and beget your love unto him, your eye cannot
behold any comlineſs in him, and ſo you exclude him as not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of acceptation; and he being thus rejected, that is holy,
and meek, and juſt, and good, what can your houſes be filled
withal but paſſion, and deceit, and envy, and malice, yea rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs
and hypocriſie is lodged in your rooms, and with ſuch
gueſts your houſes are filled; and there is an unclean houſe, and
an unclean heart and mind, which God's beeſom of judgement
muſt paſs thorow, before the Son of Peace come into that houſe
to govern: So in the univerſal Love of God, here is the <hi>Truth</hi>
laid down, <hi>as it is in Jeſus,</hi> that all who ſeek after the Lord God,
may be informed into the right way, and let them mind well,
what here breefly followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40200:6"/>
The Light comes from God, and ſhines in darkneſs, and
with the Light darkneſs is diſcovered; for the Light is not of
darkneſs, though it ſhines in darkneſs; but with its manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it ſheweth and reproveth darkneſs with its deeds, and that
is the firſt Principle of the pure Religion, and the firſt Step
into the way of Peace: for to obey the Light, is to obey Chriſt
the Power of God; and through obedience, when the Light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth,
the Power is felt to take away that which is reproved;
and Judgement is executed upon that Nature which hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed;
for the Power being minded, it begets man into a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial,
and leads him in the daily croſs, to all that which it doth
reprove in him; and then the Power crucifies that part down
which hath diſquieted, and troubled man in himſelf, and through
the Power, man comes to his Peace; for the way of the Croſs
is the way of Peace, and the Croſs is the Power of God, and
the Power ſtands in the way which leads unto Life; and ſelf
muſt bow and be humbled unto it, and the Croſs muſt be daily
taken up to that part which would ſave its Life, and there muſt
not be a turning aſide to flie the Croſs; for that which draweth
to do ſo, is darkneſs and not Light, and there is a part in man,
that is very hardly brought to the Croſs; and if it be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, it is a very hard thing to keep it there; the Life is ſweet,
and would ſave it ſelf, and ſo the darkneſs ſtandeth to wreſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
from the Croſs, and that which wreſteth from the Croſs,
doth wreſt the Scriptures alſo, unto which it draws the mind,
and raiſes up a defence for its Liberty: here darkneſs wreſteth,
and then catcheth and enſhareth, and the old Wiſdom and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
doth here betray the Innocency, and ſuch never come clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thorow, though they may have ſeen ſome openings; for the
Croſs being denied, and the judgement fled, man never comes
to be changed, but abides in the old nature, and what he hath
ſeen afar off, he gathers it into the old part, and with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
part, he holds the Truth; and that is the part which
loveth not the Croſs; but to die is the greateſt gain: <hi>Who have
ears to hear, let them hear.</hi> When a man can ſtand ſtill, and eye
the Power, and the work of the Power in himſelf, then he ſees
from whence his Salvation cometh; and then Chriſt is known
in his Power, and received in his Power, and there is no reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40200:7"/>
againſt him; which Power is the Croſs to every part of the
old nature, and humbles it down to the death, and crucifies the
world unto man, and man unto the world; and there he loſes his
own Life, with all his Wealth, and all his old garments are
ſtripped from him, and the willing and running ceaſeth in him;
and all his own Wiſdom and Reaſon comes into ſilence; and
there he lies before the Power a naked Child, and in that ſtate
waits for an entrance into a new Life, which through the Croſs
is attained; and there is the paſſing from Death to Life, and
Chriſt Jeſus is then known, and Life in him, and ſo an innocent
birth is born of the Seed of God, and man riſes in Chriſt, and
becomes an heir of Life and bleſſing, and then he knowes the
Kingdom and the Inheritance, and there he poſſeſſes the Peace
and the Joy; and then the Seed manifeſts its perfect beauty, in
its own perfect righteouſneſs, and perfect holineſs, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it ſpreads abroad; and this is a ſtate which can never be
compaſſed, nor attained, but as in it ſelf it is revealed; for the
ſtrongeſt Reaſon of man is below it, and the deepeſt of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
cannot fatham it, nor compaſs it; neither is there any other
way to poſſeſſe it, but through death to all that part which would
compaſs it and comprehend it; therefore every man to become
a fool, that he may be wiſe; and if People would but come to
ſuch a ſtate, they might behold the ſon in his beauty, and the
glory of his incomprehenſible Life and Wiſdom, which many
are come to witneſs to his praiſe for evermore. And all that
would be anſwered with Peace, muſt come to the ſimple ſtate;
for the ſubtil ſearcher createth grief and trouble; and therefore
every man and woman to deny themſelves, and receive Chriſt
Jeſus, in the deſpiſed way of the Croſs, that he may baptize them
into his death, and raiſe them again in his own Life, and then
his Life, and Power, and Wiſdom ſpreads abroad, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
over all is ſet, and there is reſt from labour, and ſitting
down in perfect peace: The Inheritance known in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the Poſſeſſion known in the Riches of it, then man knows
his portion in God, who is the Fountain of everlaſting good.

               <head>A Narrative of ſome unjuſt and cruel Dealings, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>I Having received the Truth of God, and coming to walk in
obedience to it, and to live it, I came to be convinced
by it, of the unlawfulneſs of many things, that in times paſt I
had practiſed, and obſerved; and amongſt divers other things, I
was convinced in my Conſcience of the unlawfulneſs of Tythes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and being ſo convinced, I duely conſidered them in the ground,
becauſe I would not keep back any thing from another, that
might be his right: And waiting in that which did convince
me of the unlawfulneſs of them, it was manifeſted to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that the ground of them under the Goſpel, was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of the truth; and beſides, if any man had a due in ſuch a
part of my eſtate, as was under the Law, when ſuch a part was
due to certain People, and for certain uſes, yet I found that the
ſame uſe was not made of that part now, neither were they ſuch
a People that now in divers places did receive them; for under
the Law they were paid into the Storehouſe, and the <hi>Levites</hi> had
one part, and the <hi>Fatherleſs,</hi> and the <hi>Stranger,</hi> and the <hi>Widows</hi>
they were relieved with another part; ſo that the Store-houſe
did ſupply the neceſſity of many, and there was not an <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priator</hi>
known in that day; to have his own private Barn to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his <hi>Tythes</hi> into, and diſpoſe of them to his own private uſe.
But beſides this great diſproportion, betwixt <hi>Tythes</hi> under the
Law, and the uſe of them then, and <hi>Tythes</hi> at this day, and the uſe
of them now; I alſo was convinced; that Chriſt Jeſus was come
<hi>to be the end of the Law,</hi> and <hi>the end of that Prieſthood;</hi> and the
<hi>Prieſthood being changed, there is of neceſſity a change of the Law;</hi>
and <hi>that by Chriſt Jeſus, Life and Immortality was brought to light
through the Goſpel;</hi> and that a free diſpenſation was now to be
enjoyed, and lived in: And ſtill waiting to underſtand theſe
things perfectly, I came to know my own freedom, by the
power of Truth, in my own heart, and the Truth ſet me free
from that ſtate where I had been in bondage, and ſo I was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by the Light of Chriſt Jeſus manifeſt in my Conſcience,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40200:8"/>
into the love of God, where he opened his Fountain, and I
taſted the freeneſs of his grace, and of his Mercy; and in this
diſpenſation, the Son of God was revealed in me, and then I
knew the Law, to be fulfilled by him, and all the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
and <hi>Shadows,</hi> and <hi>variable Things</hi> to paſs away, and come
to their end; then was my Underſtanding perfectly informed,
concerning the particular caſe of <hi>Tythes,</hi> and I was clear in my
Underſtanding, that no Commandment ſtood in force for the
continuing of them; but by Chriſt Jeſus, the Law and the
Commandment, was fulfilled, and that no man had any right,
either to give or ſell to another any part of that increaſe which
the Lord increaſed unto me; and was truly the fruit of my own
labour and charge: And upon this ground, I could not for
Conſcience-ſake towards God, obſerve that Practiſe or Cuſtom
of <hi>Tythes</hi> any longer, though before I had done it with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
yet now I could not ſet out any part of that to another,
which I was ſatisfied was my own; but I did mind to gather my
corn, as it came into order, without taking notice of any man.
And <hi>William Pocklington</hi> of <hi>North Collingham,</hi> was at that time
the Farmer by Leaſe, from the <hi>Impropriator,</hi> of that part called
<hi>Tythes,</hi> within that place where I had corn growing; but this is
to be noted, how that he had aſſigned the intereſt of his Leaſe,
unto <hi>Anthony Pocklington</hi> his Brother, as the ſaid <hi>Anthony</hi> told
me himſelf, and as there was ſufficient cauſe to believe it; for
the ſaid <hi>Anthony</hi> was in Poſſeſſion, and did gather the <hi>Tythes</hi> for
his own uſe; by which it did evidently appear, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Poſſeſſion, after the manner of the Law, did lye in <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and not in <hi>William:</hi> Yet notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>William</hi>
cauſed a Sheriffs Warrant to be brought againſt me, and ſued me
in his own Name: and one <hi>John Taylor</hi> came into my dwelling
houſe, and did arreſt my Body at <hi>William Pocklington</hi>'s ſuit, and I
deſired to ſee the Warrant, and he ſhewed it unto me, and I
found the day of appearance to be paſt, according to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
and when I told the ſaid <hi>Taylor</hi> of it, he left me and went
his way: then the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> procured another Sheriffes
Warrant againſt me, and one <hi>John White</hi> came to my houſe and
did arreſt my Body, and he gave me time untill the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to come to his houſe at <hi>Newark,</hi> and when I came there, I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40200:8"/>
found <hi>William Pocklington,</hi> who would have been drawing of me
to Compoſition, and ſaid he would put it to me, if I would but
give him any thing; but I could not conſent to give him any
thing upon that account, whereupon he cauſed me to be ſent to
<hi>Nottingham</hi> Priſon, and it being mentioned in the Warrant that
the Goaler was to keep me ſafe, ſo as the Sheriff might have my
Body, in one of the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſuch a day before <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Cromwels</hi> Judges, to anſwer the ſaid <hi>William</hi> in a <hi>Plea of
Treſpaſs:</hi> I was deſirous to have gone, and given him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but without an Attorney nothing would be accepted,
though there is not any Law to compel a man to uſe an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in ſuch a caſe, but in his own Perſon he is to appear; which
thing I was very willing to have done, but I was kept cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
until the day of appearance, and alſo at the day, and after
the day, and was not ſuffered to have any liberty at all, but was
kept among the Felons in the Dungeon, and ſo continued a
Priſoner about twenty one weeks, and then I was ſent for to
<hi>London</hi> by a Warrant from a Committee of Parliament, and I
appeared before them, by whom my liberty at that time was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and I was ſet free from my Impriſonment. And a little
time after I had much weakneſs upon my Body, and I was ſo
weak that I had not been forth of my Bed for about three weeks,
neither could I ſtand upon my Feet; and in that very time, and
in that exerciſe, the ſaid <hi>William Pocklington</hi> procured another
Sheriffs Warrant againſt me, and one <hi>John Muſſon</hi> came to my
houſe, and by making a lye, he got into the room where I lodged,
and did arreſt my Body in bed, at <hi>William Pocklington's</hi> ſuit, and
preſently after him came <hi>John Taylor,</hi> and he asked me what I
would do? I told them, they had my Body, they might to what
they were permitted; unto which <hi>Taylor</hi> replyed, that Mr. <hi>Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi>
ſaith, <hi>If you cannot ride, he will hire a Cart to carry you to
Nottingham:</hi> So I was willing to give them Bond to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
deſiring to have come at that time to a Trial with
him, and for that end I procured two Friends to be bound with
me for my appearance: <hi>Thomas Elſam</hi> of <hi>Gerton</hi> was one, and
<hi>Robert Cranil</hi> of <hi>North Collingham</hi> was the other; and after the
Bond was ſealed and finiſhed, the ſaid <hi>Muſſon</hi> did arreſt <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Elſam</hi> in the chamber, at the ſaid <hi>William Pocklington's</hi> Suit
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40200:9"/>
also; and he not being willing to anſwer their practice, he
hailed him away: and the ſame day another Friend was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted,
called <hi>William Thorpe</hi> of <hi>Gerton,</hi> at <hi>William Pocklington's</hi>
Suit also, and they were both ſent to Priſon; though ſuch
perſons as were concerned to take the <hi>Tythes</hi> in that place, had
taken Corn and Hay from them, both in the Meadow and the
Fields: but the ſaid <hi>William Pocklington</hi> releaſed the ſaid <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Thorp</hi> within a little time, and continued <hi>Thomas Elſam</hi>
many weeks, and then releaſed him alſo. So, according to my
Bond, I went up to <hi>London,</hi> and was there at the day of Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and did appear in my own perſon before the Judge, in the
ſame Court as was expreſſed in the Warrant and in the Bond,
and I had an <hi>Attorney</hi> of the ſame Court with me, who was an
eye-witneſs of my Appearance; which being done, I gave him
order to enter it in the Office, according to their practice, and
he told me he did ſo: but the ſaid <hi>William</hi> did not proceed any
further againſt me at that time, but cauſed <hi>Robert Carnil,</hi> who
was one of my Bonds-men, to be arreſted at the Suit of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,
upon forfeiture of the Bond, though the Bond was wholly
diſcharged by my Appearance, as before is mentioned; yet
notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>Robert Carnil</hi> was ſent to <hi>Nottingham</hi>
Priſon, and there did remain a Priſoner about twelve weeks;
about which time I releaſed his body by a <hi>Supercedas:</hi> then he
let all his Suits fall, and cauſed my Corn to be taken in harveſt-time;
and thoſe that he imployed, took away my Corn in their
own wills, and this they have done for two years laſt paſt; yet
notwithſtanding he hath cauſed another Warrant to be brought
againſt me, which was ſerved upon me the ſeventh day of the
eighth moneth 1662, I being in the Priſon at <hi>Nottingham</hi> to
viſit Friends that were in bonds, the Under-Goaler brought me
the Warrant, and ſhewed it me, and ſaid it was at <hi>Pocklington's</hi>
Suit, by which I am now detained a Priſoner; and the ſaid
<hi>Pocklington</hi> meeting the Under-Goaler about two dayes after, he
bid him tell his Maſter, that he ſhould not let me have any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
(as the Under-Goaler told me) for if he did, he would
complain to the Sheriff: by which practice his ſpirit is made
manifeſt to all reaſonable men, and every moderate eye may
ſee that he is not cloathed with Chriſtianity, which is <hi>to love
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40200:9"/>
enemies,</hi> but hath a Heathens nature, and the mark of the Beaſt
in his forehead; and his envy doth appear to be exceeding
great, who cannot appeaſe it in ſo many years together, but ſtill
preſſes forward to the filling up of his meaſure, which is very
near at hand; and though I have patience in the love of God to
bear theſe things, and have from time to time overcome the
evil with good, yet I am free to open, wherein, and in what
places I might or may take juſt advantage according to the Law,
ſo far as I am free to uſe it, both in relation to himſelf, and ſome
others by him imployed in that buſineſs, whoſe proceedings
have been illegal and unjuſt, as in theſe particulars following
may be clearly ſeen.</p>
               <p>1. The ſuing of me in his own name, when the Intereſt was
in another, as before is mentioned, and in that Caſe being
falſly impriſoned by him about twenty one weeks.</p>
               <p>2. To ſue me again the ſecond time in his own name, when
the Intereſt yet did continue in another, as aforeſaid, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
me upon that account to go to <hi>London,</hi> and then never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
further againſt me.</p>
               <p>3. To cauſe <hi>Robert Carnil</hi> to be arreſted upon forfeiture of
the Bond, when I had diſcharged the Bond by my own Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and by an <hi>Attorney</hi> had cauſed my Appearance to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
according to their practice, and cauſing the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi>
falſly to be impriſoned about twelve weeks.</p>
               <p>4. To ſue me again this laſt time, and having cauſed my
Corn to be taken and ſpoiled as aforeſaid; and there being now
Eccleſiaſtical Courts, in which all Caſes of <hi>Tythes</hi> are to be
tryed, according to that Law, and not in any Temporal Court
whatſoever, which doth amount to falſe Impriſonment for ſo
long as I ſhall continue a Priſoner upon this account.</p>
               <p>Then concerning others, which have been imployed by him
in that very buſineſs, who have acted illegally and contrary to
Law; As firſt, <hi>John Taylor</hi> coming into my dwelling houſe, and
there arreſting my body, when the day of Appearance was paſt
according to the Warrant, and ſo he had no authority nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
power, either to come into my houſe, or to arreſt my
body.</p>
               <p>Then concerning thoſe that have forcibly taken away my
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40200:10"/>
Corn, though I did never oppoſe them by reſiſting, yet againſt
them all I bear forth my Teſtimony in the Truth; and there
were four concerned in that matter, namely, <hi>Sutton</hi> of <hi>Beſthorp,
Daulton</hi> of <hi>South-Scarle, Richard Light foot</hi> of <hi>North-Collingham,</hi>
and <hi>Pocklington's</hi> own Servant, whoſe name I know not; and I
did let all theſe men know, as I had opportunity to ſpeak to
them, that they did me wrong, and warned them to take heed
what they did in that caſe, and told them I did not give any
conſent for them to take away my Corn; yet notwithſtanding
they proceeded ſo to do from time to time, which doth amount
on their part to a forcible taking, though never oppoſed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting;
and beſides, the Law doth not give any ſuch power to
take <hi>Tythes,</hi> but only binds the party to set them forth, and not
to carry them away; therefore theſe perſons aforeſaid, are no
leſs than deep tranſgreſſors of the Law, and have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
liable to the Law, as there is freedom to make uſe of their
own weapon: and hereby all ſober people may ſee, how this
man's houſe hath been furniſhed with envy, and though he hath
had ſo many years to empty it, yet he hath not cleared it, as by
his practice is manifeſt; but I deſire his eyes may be opened,
and that he may ſee the end of thoſe things, and come to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
before it be too late, for his glaſs is almoſt run, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Repentance his end will be bitterneſs; and I would have
him know, that there is a righteous God that judgeth between
him and me this day, and into his hand alone I commit my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Cauſe.</p>

with its Law, and Prieſthood, and Tythes, and Temple,
and Sacrifices, and Offerings of divers ſorts; and Meats, and
Drinks, and divers Waſhings; all which was but a figure of him
that was to come, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> for the Law made nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
but the bringing in of a better hope did; and when through
thoſe figures and ſhadows the better hope was brought in, then
was <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Adminiſtration fulfilled, with all things that
did pertain unto it; and in fulneſs of time <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> came,
and Grace and Truth came by him; which Grace and Truth is
free, and ends the firſt Covenant, with all its Services and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and eſtabliſheth a new Covenant upon better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
in which Covenant <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is known to be the High-Prieſt
over the houſe of God, and there is the Goſpel free,
<hi>without money</hi> or <hi>without price,</hi> and the Grace free which ſaveth,
and not the works of the firſt Covenant; and it was never the
practice of Chriſt or his Apoſtles, to take Tythes, or to ſue
people for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither is the name of an <hi>Impropriator</hi> to be
found in all the Scriptures, and how theſe things are come to
paſs let people conſider; for Chriſt nor his Diſciples did never
receive Tythes, neither gave any Commandment for any man
to take them, or for any man to pay them; then ſuch as now
take them, and ſue people at Law for them, do not walk either
by precept or example from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their practice is altogether unlawful; and out of the Truth,
and all <hi>Impropriators</hi> are wholly excluded throughout the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
for Tythes under the Law were never appointed to any
under that name, therefore they cannot have any juſt right in
them.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But ſome may ſay,</hi> Surely they have the greateſt right
to Tythes, becauſe they have purchaſed them; and the Law hath
made Tythes to become unto them, as an Eſtate in Fee Simple?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There not being either precept or preſident from <hi>Chriſt</hi>
nor his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> nor no ſuch Inſtitution under the Goſpel, it
muſt needs remove this Objection wholly; and that any man
can have juſt power to ſell the labour of another, or any increaſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40200:11"/>
that riſes from his labour, and to give unto another perſon an
intereſt in it, as an Eſtate of Inheritance, this will not ſtand
with the reaſonable part of a man: for that which doth ariſe to
one man through the labour of another man, cannot ſtand for a
certain Intereſt; becauſe it cometh through labour and charge,
and not through any thing certain; ſo that if a man labour not,
then the party that doth claim an intereſt in his Increaſe, is
wholly diſſeized and diſpoſſeſſed of that part which he claims as
an Inheritance: and the ſelling and buying of Tythes is come in
of late years, compared with the years ſince the Apoſtles time;
and both the buyer and the ſeller were under a vail of thick
darkneſs at that time, which the Light of the Lord doth now
make manifeſt; and it is now ſeen with a clear eye, that ſuch
things are come to paſs in the Apoſtacy, and inſtituted after the
Inventions of men, and not after Chriſt the Wiſdom of God;
and therefore they are now to be denied, and the Root of them
plucked up and deſtroyed, and not to ſtand in any place, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any man; for Grace and Truth is come by Jeſus Chriſt, in
which Grace and Truth the Freedom is known, and Tythes, as
now uſed in <hi>England,</hi> are an invention of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and who
would know their riſe and ſetting up, muſt look into Hiſtories
for their ground, for in the Goſpel-Scriptures there is no ground
for them to ſtand upon; and <hi>Verſtegen</hi> an Antiquary doth relate
their very riſe in <hi>England,</hi> and doth declare that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>
ſent over a company of his Prieſthood and Officers into the
Iſland of <hi>England,</hi> who preached their Doctrine, and turned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to their Faith; and then the Pope ſent them a Letter, to take
the free gift of ſuch as they had converted, and to live upon it:
which thing they at the firſt did, as the Hiſtory relates, and thoſe
gifts were all brought into one place, out of which the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of thoſe were ſupplyed whom it concerned; but after they
had ſpread their Doctrine more generally, and that there was
an increaſe amongſt people in their practice, then they began
to divide the whole into particulars, and appointed to each
man his place of Cure, which he was to take the charge of, and
to receive their particular gifts, but not to receive or take of
any other but ſuch as were of his Faith, and owned his practice;
And here was the firſt inſtitution of Pariſhes and Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40200:11"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> according to Hiſtory: and when they were thus
ſetled, and that the gifts would not anſwer their particular ends,
ſome beginning to cool in their love, and in their zeal, and were
not ſo liberal in giving as ſometimes they had been; then the
<hi>Pope</hi> decreed a Law, and by that Law, gave his Prieſts power to
compel the Tenth part of increaſe from all People generally,
which before was but a free gift from ſome, as may be ſeen more
at large in the Hiſtory. And here was the firſt ground of Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in <hi>England,</hi> and out of which Pariſh Churches are ſprung,
which People now make ſo much to do about: And here alſo
was the firſt Law for compelling the payment of <hi>Tythes.</hi> And
after proceſs of time, it came to paſs that the <hi>Popes</hi> power was
denied in <hi>England,</hi> then what had been gained unto Abbies and
Monaſtries, with a great part of predial <hi>Tythes</hi> was diſpoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a general ſervice, by way of Sale, and ſo became converted
into the hands of Lay perſons, who were called <hi>Impropriators:</hi>
And here is the ground from whence they riſe, and all the right
they can claim originally for their <hi>Tythes.</hi> And now, Whether
the Pariſh Churches, and <hi>Tythes,</hi> and Worſhip, which are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
in Pariſh Churches, have a ſound root, let all moderate
People conſider? And whether their ground be ſufficient for
any man to perſecute another, either for not paying <hi>Tythes,</hi> or
for not going to the Pariſh Church, or for not Conforming to
the Worſhip which there is practiſed? And how People can
ſtand by theſe things, and yet profeſs Chriſtianity? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do not ſtand upon a ſlippery place, let them all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider?
But many are come to know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and
by his power are redeemed out of all Inventions, and Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
and are made a free People in his Life, and Wiſdom, and
he over all is exalted, and his Kingdom is ſet, and ſtandeth
firm, in which is Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy for ever.</p>
               <p>And now the root of this matter being found in a corrupted
earth, the fruit of its nature hath its perfect ſavour; and many
have taſted of its bitterneſs from time to time, until this day;
and there hath been ſince the firſt Inſtitution, ſeveral Laws
made, for the continuing of the payment of <hi>Tythes</hi> in general,
yet by all the Laws in that caſe made, the recovering of <hi>Tythes</hi>
was referred to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts,</hi> and by <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40200:12"/>
Judges, and not in any <hi>Temporal Court</hi> whatſoever, as in divers
Statutes for recovering of <hi>Tythes</hi> may be mentioned. One in
particular I ſhall quote, namely, 3. <hi>Edw. 6. Chap. 13. And that it
ſhall not be lawful unto the Parſon, Vicar, Proprietor, Owner or other
their Farmer, or Deputies, contrary to this Act, to convent or ſue
ſuch withholder of Tythes, Obventions, or other Duties aforeſaid,
before any other Judge than Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> By which it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
how much innocent People are this day wronged in that
caſe, who are ſued for <hi>Tythes,</hi> by original Wirts out of <hi>Temporal
Courts;</hi> and likewiſe how much they are wronged through the
practice that is uſed in that Law, and how many this day lye in
Holes and Priſons, becauſe the Practice of the Law hath been
made a ſnare unto them, ſo that they could not proceed in their
own caſe, as of right they ought to have done, and this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
in many particulars; a few of which I ſhal briefly inſtance.</p>
               <p>1. To be arreſted by a Sheriffs Warrant, grounded upon an
original Writ out of any <hi>Temporal Court;</hi> and by that Warrant
the Sheriffe is to have the Body of a man in the Court at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
ſuch a day as is expreſſed, there to anſwer the Party
who hath ought to plead againſt him, and then the Body of that
man to be caſt into Priſon, and there kept, and not brought into
the Court by the Sheriffe, according to the Warrant; is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
through which many innocent People ſuffer this day in a
deep manner, and is a practice that ſtands wholly in deceit, lyes,
and hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>2. For a man to give Bond for his appearance upon his arreſt,
and he doth appear accordingly, and in the truth diſcharges his
Bond; yet notwithſtanding his appearance will not be accepted
to be good in Law, though by the Law it is onely ſufficient; and
then to proceed againſt him upon forfeiture of his Bond, when
in the Truth, and alſo according to Law, he hath really diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his Bond: this is a deceitful Practice, and through this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
many innocent People have ſuffered.</p>
               <p>3. To be Subpena'd into the Exchequer, and commanded to
appear there in a man's own perſon, and when he doth perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
appear, then not to accept his appearance, to be good in
Law, and in that caſe to proceed againſt him as an offender, and
to cauſe his Body to be arreſted and impriſoned for a contempt,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40200:12"/>
when he hath truly anſwered what he was commanded; this is
a practice through which many innocent People do ſuffer.</p>
               <p>4. For a man to give his own Anſwer unto any Bill exhibited
againſt him, and to anſwer it in the Truth, and to tender his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Court, and that Anſwer to be refuſed, as not being
ſufficient in Law, when it is a man's own Anſwer, who by the
Law is required to anſwer, and no Law that enjoynes him to
anſwer otherwiſe; and notwithſtanding his Anſwer truly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
yet to be arreſted and impriſoned for a contempt, when
he hath obſerved the thing commanded: this is a practice
through which many innocent People ſuffer.</p>
               <p>5. To refuſe an Anſwer as inſufficient, becauſe a man cannot
ſwear unto it, though in it ſelf it be really true; and then to cauſe
that man to be arreſted, and impriſoned for a contempt, when
he hath tendred a true Anſwer: this is a practice through which
many innocent People ſuffer.</p>
               <p>6. There being no Law in force, by which any <hi>Temporal Court</hi>
can receive power to proceed in the caſe of <hi>Tythes,</hi> it is wholly
inſufficient on their part, who put ſuch things in practiſe; through
which practice many have and do very deeply ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Therefore who are yet in ſuffering for <hi>Tythes,</hi> and remain in
Priſons upon the account of ſuch proceedings in any <hi>Temporal
Court,</hi> they ought by the Law to be forthwith diſcharged, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed;
and not only ſo, but to be repaired for their great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
loſs, and damage which they have ſuſtained by ſuch illegal
proceedings, and deceitful practices; through which many have
ſuffered to Death, others to the great loſs of their outward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
and others to the decay of their bodily Health, by being
ſo long continued in hardſhips, who are men of ability, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
in their Country; and Liberty may be juſtly challenged and
demanded touching all that yet do ſuffer upon the account here
mentioned, and alſo for theſe Reaſons following.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe many who are in Bonds this day, were caſt into Priſon
by Writs original from the <hi>Temporal Courts,</hi> whoſe Authority was
upheld by <hi>Oliver's</hi> Power, and now his Power being diſanulled, and
all that was acted and done by his Power, made void by this preſent
Power, and is now judged ineffectual to all intents and purpoſes as if
it had never been: Then why ſhould not that judgement reach to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40200:13"/>
Innocent, and ſet them free from their ſufferings, which originally
was occaſioned by his Power, and have for many years together conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Priſoners? I am ſure ſound Reaſon, or a tender heart, will judge
this demand both lawful and expedient to be granted.</p>
               <p>2. This preſent Power now being in Government, under which
Power there are <hi>Courts Eccleſiaſtical</hi> appointed; then all that have
been Arreſted, by Writs original from any <hi>Temporal Court,</hi> ſince
this preſent Power Governed, and who do remain in Priſons upon
ſuch Arreſts, in caſe of <hi>Tythes;</hi> their Liberty may be juſtly
challenged and demanded, and it will be but a reaſonable thing
for ſuch as are now in Power to grant it, and cauſe it to be done.</p>
               <p>I do not ſtate theſe Caſes as being verſed in points of Law,
but as they are opened to me in the Truth, in which Truth is
the pure and ſound Reaſon; and that Truth and Reaſon ſeeth
thorow all things that are unreaſonable, and alſo manifeſts what
is reaſonable, that the Truth and ſound Reaſon, in another may
anſwer it, and receive it; and in the Truth man comes to ſee all
uunreaſonable things: and let all reaſonable People now judge
whether it be reaſonable on their part, that practiſe ſuch things
as are here mentioned, and through ſuch practices cauſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
People to ſuffer? and whether it be reaſonable that
Innocent People ſhould yet ſuffer and be continued in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
upon ſuch grounds? And whether ſuch as now do ſuffer
in thoſe caſes, can be lawfully detained, being Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon original <hi>Writs</hi> in caſe of <hi>Tythes?</hi> And though ſuch
things were done, when there was not another way left to
recover them, and greedy men would not be ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, though at that time there was ſuch a practice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
yet that Power being now judged unlawful, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
ſuch things are returned into their old channel again,
and are to be tried in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi> onely: Not that I
hereby juſtifie the proceedings of any Court in this caſe, for I
have already ſhewed the ground of this matter to be corrupted;
and am now wading amongſt the fowl and unclean ſtreames,
where I find little delight as to my ſelf, but through a neceſſity
laid upon me, to do good both to Perſecutors and Sufferers, I
am conſtrained to travel amongſt theſe things, though I haſten
through them, as contraries to my Life. Now theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40200:13"/>
duely conſidered, it cannot but reaſonably be judged, that
we have good cauſe, who in theſe caſes are concerned, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
our <hi>juſt Liberty,</hi> and do expect it; and if Liberty be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
unto us upon this reaſonable demand, then let ſuch know
who are our Oppreſſors, that we yet in patience do abide, and in
patience we do bear a ſure Teſtimony againſt all evil-doers and
unreaſonable men. And here it may be ſeen what bitter ſtreams
the Pope's fountain ſendeth forth; and not only ſo, but alſo how
thoſe that are concerned in the practice of the Law, do degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from reaſonable men, and with their unreaſonable part do
divert the ſtreams from their proper courſe; though in that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
they are too bitter for honeſt men to drink, yet being diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from that courſe, they are made much more bitter from ſuch
as do practiſe in them: for if any part of Reaſon did order the
practice in ſuch caſes, it would not prove ſo tedious and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to thoſe that are concerned to make defence; If a man's
own Appearance would be taken for a ſufficient Appearance,
as it ought to be; or, if a <hi>true Anſwer</hi> would be taken for <hi>a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Anſwer,</hi> without an Oath, as it ought to be; or, if the <hi>Sheriff</hi>
would have a man's Body to appear according to his <hi>Warrant,</hi>
as he ought to do; this would come ſomething near to Reaſon
in practice, and would not be ſo grievous to poor men, who
deſire to fear God and walk in his Truth: but men are ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
degenerated from Truth and Reaſon, and their very hearts
and minds are corrupted, and their wayes are all crooked, and
there is no ſoundneſs in their goings, ſo that an houeſt ſimple
man cannot walk with them, but be defiled and enſnared.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall mention one thing, and that from the Law,
for confirmation of what I have here layed down in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
caſe of <hi>Tythes,</hi> by which it doth fully appear that no Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Court hath any power to proceed againſt any man in that
caſe; for the Law ſaith after this manner, <hi>(32. Hen.</hi> 8. ch. 7.)
<hi>That ſome have not letted to ſubſtract the lawful and accuſtomed
Tythes of Corn, Hay, Paſturages, and other ſorts of Tythes and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
commonly due to the owners, proprietors, and other poſſeſſors,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Wherefore it is enacted, That all and ſingular perſons of what
eſtate or degree ſoever, ſhall fully and truly, and effectually divide,
yeeld, or pay, all and ſingular Tythes and Offerings aforeſaid,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40200:14"/>
                  <hi>and if any do detain any part of the ſaid Tythes or Offerings, then the
party either Eccleſiaſtical or lay perſon, having cauſe to demand the
ſaid Tythes, and being thereof wronged or grieved, ſhall and may
convent the perſon or perſons, ſo offending, before the Ordinary, his
Commiſſary, or other competent Miniſter or lawful Judge of the
place where ſuch wrong ſhall be done, according to the Eccleſiaſtical
Laws,</hi> &amp;c. And another branch of the Statute ſpeaketh on this
wiſe, <hi>That if any Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual profits, which now be,
or hereafter ſhall be made Temporal unto any perſon or perſons; and
that if any other perſon or perſons go about to diſſeize them, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherite
them, then in that caſe the party or parties grieved, may
have their remedy in the Temporal Courts,</hi> as may be ſeen more
at large in the full Statute. So here is a plain diſtinction made:
for whilſt any thing remains in the nature of Tythes, and only
denyed as Tythes and Offerings, no Temporal Court hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to examine or determine in that caſe, but the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Courts onely: but if any man ſhall call in queſtion the
Eſtate of another in the ground, as it was once counted Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and now converted into the poſſeſſion of a lay perſon, if an
Intereſt in this caſe be queſtioned, then have the Temporal
Courts power to examine and determine the Intereſt of ſuch
Eſtate. And there are divers other Statutes which do refer the
recovering of Tythes, where they are denyed, to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Eccleſiaſtical Courts only, which I ſhall not at this
time, and in this place, take notice of to mention; for that
which is already ſaid, may be ſufficient to convince a reaſonable
man or woman, that the ground and riſe of them is out of the
Truth; and the way to recover them, if denyed, is to be in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Courts only, and not in Temporal Courts, and that
from determination of the Law in that caſe. All which doth
make it evidently appear, how much we have been, and are ſtill
wronged, who have been a ſuffering People many years in this
caſe, and through theſe practices; and the wrong is much more
at this time in this caſe, than in times lately paſt, becauſe there
is now Eccleſiaſtical Courts ſet up and appointed, unto which
the Law doth only refer for the recovering of Tythes, and ſome
that in thoſe Courts are called in queſtion about Tythes: and
therefore the People of God, who are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> ought to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40200:14"/>
be ſet free from their Impriſonments in that caſe, who have
been wronged ſo long together, and yet are ſufferers by <hi>Writs,</hi>
and <hi>Warrants,</hi> and <hi>Subpena's</hi> out of Temporal Courts, and through
the practice of ſuch Courts: And if any man be henceforth
grieved for want of his Tythes, then let us come to anſwer in
ſuch Courts as by the Law is appointed to hear and determine
the ſame; and let us have free liberty to make our juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Defence on our own behalf, and not to be interrupted
in our Defence, for it is a Caſe that doth relate to our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
and therefore ſuch as are counted Spiritual men, who
are appointed to judge in Spiritual matters, ought to hear us to
the full in what we have to ſay in our own Defence, that ſo
our Anſwer may be taken and conſidered, touching the matter
which by any Bill may be exhibited againſt us; and then how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it comes to paſs concerning us, or what Sentence may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt us, we ſhall be contented in our places, and ſhall
either <hi>actively</hi> or <hi>paſſively</hi> be ſubject without reſiſting, as our
Teſtimony hitherto doth ſufficiently evidence for us; only let
us have fair dealings, and legal proceedings, as Men and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:
for, as Men, we have a perfect underſtanding, and in
truth and ſoberneſs we do behave our ſelves; and, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
we have patience to endure, and do not ſeek revenge;
and therefore we ought to have fair dealings amongſt all men
who are concerned with us in any caſe.</p>
               <p>There are other corrupted ſtreams, which deſcend from the
unreaſonable part of men towards us, and are practiſed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
caſes concerning us, by which great ſufferings are inflicted
upon us; and ſuch practices may briefly be reduced into theſe
particular heads.</p>
               <p>1. To ſummon us to appear at Seſſions, and when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
according to our Summons, and ſtand at the Bar to make
our juſt Defence to what may be charged againſt us, then to
tender unto us the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and preſs us with much
violence to take it; and though that Oath was inſtituted touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another people, as by the title of it may appear, which is for
<hi>ſuppreſſing Popiſh Recuſants;</hi> and it was inſtituted in the ſence
of that danger which was by ſuch a people intended againſt the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40200:15"/>
King and his Government, by the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot;</hi> and though
afterwards it was preſſed to the King, that he would grant the
extent of it to all his Subjects, and that he gave his conſent ſo
to do, yet it may be ſeen by that Law which did ſo inſtitute it
in that caſe, and upon the requeſt of that Parliament, that the
Intention and mind both of the King and Parliament, was for
the finding out of ſuch a people as did adhere to the <hi>Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy;</hi>
and though it doth extend to all, as to the tender of it,
yet it is with certain conſiderations; as if any Officer of a Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
do complain to a Juſtice of Peace, that any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
above the age of ſixteen years, do not duly repair to their
Pariſh Church, or do not duly receive that which is called <hi>a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
as in the ſaid Act is more fully expreſſed, That then in
ſuch caſes the Juſtice of Peace hath power to ſend for ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or perſons, ſo complained of, by his Warrant, and may ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto them the ſaid Oath, which for refuſing, he hath power
to proceed againſt them, as is appointed by the ſaid Act: but
ſtill it is to be obſerved, that it is but to diſcover ſuch perſon or
perſons as privately do adhere to the <hi>Popes Supremacy;</hi> and
therefore it is expreſſed in the Oath, that they ſhall <hi>renounce the
Pope;</hi> and <hi>Premunire</hi> was ordained only againſt ſuch perſons as
ſhould purchaſe <hi>Bulls</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> as may be ſeen in the 16th of
<hi>Rich.</hi> 2d. chap. 5. And now to make this the great buſineſs in
Courts, and at other times againſt us, who are an innocent
People, who deny the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> and all his practices, and
to entrap us with it, as with a ſnare, becauſe we cannot for
Conſcience towards God take any Oath at all, but live in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Chriſt's Command, who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and it
is <hi>the matter</hi> contained in the Oath that was chiefly intended in
the firſt inſtitution of it, and now to enſnare us with it upon
every occaſion, who make conſcience of an <hi>Oath,</hi> and yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the <hi>matter</hi> as full as any people: for our peaceable living
under the King's Government, doth evidently demonſtrate our
obedience to him, whilſt many others that fear not an Oath,
can ſwear and yet not anſwer the matter contained in the Oath;
and here we ſhew forth our obedience to the King, by anſwering
the <hi>matter</hi> in the Oath; and we alſo ſhew forth our true love to
God in keeping his Command, for it is Chriſt's Command that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40200:15"/>
we do obey in this caſe; and ſo it is to us the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of an
Oath, and not wholly the <hi>matter;</hi> and to proceed againſt us in
this caſe, is very hard meaſure; and how many of us that have
ſuffered Impriſonment, and ſpoyling of our goods, and divers
other wayes have deeply ſuffered by it, and through the practice
of it, though we are not at all concerned, by the intention of
thoſe from whom the Oath had its firſt inſtitution; and for to
fine us, or impriſon us in this caſe, as hath been, and is yet pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed,
is not only unreaſonable from the conſideration of theſe
grounds here mentioned, but it is alſo a practice which ſtandeth
oppoſite to the Law it ſelf, as in the 42. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3d. ch. 3. where
it is expreſſed, <hi>That for the good government of the Commons, no
man ſhall be put to anſwer without preſentment before Juſtices, or
matter of Record, or by due Proceſs and Writ original, according to
the old Law: and if any thing from henceforth be done to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
it ſhall be void and holden for error, &amp;c.</hi> Now by this Law
none ſhould be put to anſwer without Preſentment, or matter of
Record, or due Proceſs; Therefore to wave a Preſentment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the party ſtands preſented, and for which cauſe he is
ſummoned there to appear, and doth appear, and then to tender
the Oath unto him, and put him ſtrictly to anſwer whether he
will ſwear or no, it is not legal in Law; for there is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,
nor matter of Record, nor due Proceſs againſt him in
that caſe; and to ſay, <hi>Will you take the Oath of Allegiance?</hi> or,
<hi>Will you ſwear?</hi> when a Preſentment lies againſt him in another
caſe, and he ſtands at the Bar to anſwer his Charge, and if he
do not give a full Anſwer to that Queſtion as it is demanded,
which as a new thing is tendred, and goes beſide the matter for
which he ſtands preſented, and to fine him, or impriſon him,
becauſe he doth not give a full Anſwer, is a Proceeding void in
Law, and holden for error; becauſe no man is to be put to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
without Preſentment, or matter of Record, or due Proceſs.</p>
               <p>2. To be impriſoned, and kept as a Priſoner, and at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes
or Seſſions brought to the Bar as a Priſoner, and then to
tender the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> when a man ſtands a Priſoner at
the Bar, and expecteth a due Tryal in order to his Releaſment,
and if he deſire to hear his Charge, as a Priſoner, which every
Priſoner ought to do, and to call for his Accuſers, if any be, who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40200:16"/>
ought to be there preſent, and that he ſtand upon the caſe of his
Impriſonment, and doth not give a full Anſwer to the Queſtion
demanded about the Oath; then to proceed againſt him as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſer
of the Oath, and to Fine him, or Impriſon him, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeize
him of his Free-hold, or any other Eſtate: It is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
void in Law, and held for <hi>Error;</hi> for in that caſe he
ſhould not be put to anſwer.</p>
               <p>3. To be Impriſoned for meeting together to worſhip God, and
to be kept in Priſon many weeks, and then to be brought into a
Court and ſet to a Bar of Judgement, and there have the Oath
tendered, and no charge impoſed upon the Priſoner, touching his
Impriſonment, but the Oath alone preſſed, and his Anſwer requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
&amp; for not anſwering fully to the Queſtion demanded, which
generally is this, <hi>Will you take the Oath of Allegiance?</hi> Or, <hi>Will
you Swear?</hi> And ſo to be Fined, or Impriſoned upon the account
of refuſing the Oath; or, to have his Lands and Goods ſeized, in
the caſe of <hi>Premunire;</hi> this is void in Law, and holden for <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:</hi>
For no Preſentment, nor matter of Record, or due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in that caſe, lyes againſt the Priſoner; and the Law ſaith,
<hi>That no man, of what Eſtate or Condition that he be, ſhall be put out
of Land or Tenement, nor taken, nor Impriſoned, nor Diſinherited,
nor put to Death, without being brought to anſwer by due Proceſs of
the Law,</hi> 28. Edw. 3d. Chap. 3. And again <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
Chap. 29. <hi>No Freeman ſhall be taken or Impriſoned, or be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeized
of his Free-hold, or Liberties, or free Cuſtoms, or be Outlawed
or Exiled, or any other wayes Deſtroyed; nor we will not paſſe upon
him, nor condemn him but by Lawful Judgement of his Peers, or by
the Law of the Land.</hi> And in 3. <hi>Charles 1. And I aſſure you, my
Maxime is, That the Peoples Liberties ſtrengthens the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
and that the Kings Prerogative is to defend the Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</hi>
And again, 3. <hi>Charles</hi> 1. in the <hi>Petition of Right, No
Free man to be Impriſoned without cauſe ſhewed.</hi> And how
contrary to theſe things have men acted againſt us, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Quakers?</hi> and how have they made their Wills their Law,
and in their Wills have Impriſoned us, without any cauſe at all
ſhewed, and have reſtrained us of our Liberty, though Free men
of <hi>England,</hi> contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and divers Statutes which
have been made for the preſervation of the Free-born People of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40200:16"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> of which number we are, and can challenge as much
Liberty by our Birth-right, in all juſt Priviledges, as any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whatſoever? and therefore if the good and ſound Law was
obſerved, we ſhould be outwardly the Freeſt of all People in
this Nation, as inwardly we are by Chriſt Jeſus, and ſhould not
come within the compaſs of any Law, as Tranſgreſſors; for by
the Law it ſelf it is expreſſed, <hi>That the Law of God is the Law of
the Land,</hi> and that no man of what eſtate, degree, or condition
he be, hath power to diſpence with God's Laws; and the Law
of God doth not take hold of the righteous, but ſinners, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
of murtherers, and thieves, and evil-doers; and when
hath the Law taken hold upon us as ſuch a People? Hath evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds
been found amongſt us? or have we ever been brought
before a Judgement Seat, and juſtly charged with any miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour?
And are not we then cleared by the Law of God,
which is righteous? and the Law it ſelf ſaith, <hi>That the Law of
God is the Law of the Land,</hi> and, <hi>no man hath power to diſpence with
the Law of God;</hi> as in the 28. <hi>Hen. 8. Chap.</hi> 7. And if this was
practiſed, then no impriſonment nor reſtraint, ſhould be by any
man exerciſed towards us, nor no ſpoiling of our goods and
eſtates would fall upon any of us, but in all things we ſhould be
Protected by the Law of the Land, as we are Juſtified by the
Law of God; and then we ſhould meet without any diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and Worſhip our God in his unlimitted Spirit, and the
Law would ſtand by us in it, and in all that we practiſe in anſwer
to God we ſhould be Protected; and that which the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
unto us, would not be taken from us, and ſpoiled, nor
an Oath upon any account would be tendered to us; For by the
Law of God, which is <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi>
our Meetings are lawful, the Increaſe of our Eſtates is our own,
and our <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> is true without an Oath, and all that we
practiſe in Conſcience towards God, is by the Law of God
juſtified: And therefore no Law, Statute, or Ordinance,
ought to ſtand againſt us, ſeeing that no man hath power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with God's Law. And, is it not the great cry againſt us,
<hi>You will not be obedient to the Laws, but are a willful People, and
run your ſelves into danger and ſufferings in your own wills, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you deſerve to be puniſhed.</hi> But let all people know, that in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40200:17"/>
what we practiſe, we are juſtified by the Law of God; and if any
Law in the Land do condemn us, &amp; inflict puniſhment upon us
for our practiſe, then it is not what the Law it ſelf ſaith it is, but
from another ground; and we do not run in our own wills to do
thoſe things that we practiſe, but through a neceſſity in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
motion of God's power we are conſtrained to bear teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
unto the Truth, as we have received; and I am very ſure
that in anſwering the Lord in obedience to what he layes upon
us, we have the anſwer of a good Conſcience in it, and peace
with God; and his righteous Law juſtifies us, and the Law of
the Land ought not to condemn us, or puniſh us; and let fooliſh
People learn to be wiſe and not charge the motion of God's
Spirit, to be <hi>an unruly Will,</hi> leſt they be found in the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſin; for we are a People unknown amongſt the Sons of
men, though our Teſtimony ſtands in Innocency to their view,
yet our Life is hid from their eyes, and they know us not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they know not him. And do not People from their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of our tranſgreſſion of the Law, take occaſion againſt us,
and perſecute and ſpoil us, whilſt they themſelves are the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors,
and that by their own Law; which ſaith, <hi>The Law of
God is the Law of the Land:</hi> And the Law of God ſaith, <hi>Thou
ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> but he that will Impriſon him,
and ſpoil his goods, and perſecute him, doth not love him, ſo
is a tranſgreſſor; but we are free, and the Law of God doth not
charge guilt upon us, nor condemn us in the things we practiſe;
and therefore it muſt needs be that ſuch as act againſt us are the
tranſgreſſors, and whatſoever ſtands for Law this day, which
doth condemn our practice, and puniſh us for the uſing of it,
the ſame doth differ from the Law of God, and ſo degenerates
from that Concluſion which the Law it ſelf makes, and in plain
words expreſſeth, <hi>That the Law of God is the Law of the Land.</hi>
And through the miſcarriages of men towards us, whoſe wills
have wreſted the Law in divers caſes, we have through ſuch
things deeply ſuffered; and yet the yoak is continued upon us,
and our Innocency is made a prey upon, for we being a quiet
People, and diſpoſed in the principle of Love towards all men,
and cannot ſeek revenge upon any, therefore are our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
increaſed, whether with Law, or without Law, or againſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40200:17"/>
Law, it is not by many much regarded, as in divers caſes
might be truly inſtanced, which is at preſent waved.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that the Law it ſelf doth make ſuch a Concluſion
of its own ſtanding, that it is the Law of God, then to examine
a little ſome particulars, and places in it, if in all things it have
perfect agreement with the Law of God; for the Law of God is
<hi>pure, holy, juſt and good;</hi> and as it hath been ſhewed, that the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
in divers caſes doth degenerate from the Law of the Land,
ſo it may come to paſs that the Law of the Land may degenerate
from the Law of God; for the Law of God ſpeaketh on this wiſe,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow to any graven Image, nor the likeneſs of any
thing;</hi> And whatſoever is ſet up, and not by the Spirit of the
Lord, is graven out of an imagination, and is an Image, and to
bow unto that thing is to bow unto a graven Image; and if the
Law of the Land do reſtrain from ſuch a practice, then it ſtandeth
right, but if it do allow ſuch things, or rather compel people to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
ſuch things, then doth it degenerate from the Law of God.</p>
               <p>2. The Law of God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of
the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> And to Swear by his Name, is <hi>to take
his Name in vain;</hi> and if the Law of the Land do reſtrain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from all manner of Oathes, then it ſtandeth right, but if it do
allow ſuch things, or rather in ſome caſes, compel into ſuch
things, then doth it degenerate from the Law of God.</p>
               <p>3. Chriſt Jeſus the Lawgiver ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord
thy God, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> and to love God, <hi>is to
keep his Commandments;</hi> and to love a Neighbour, as to love a
mans ſelf, <hi>is to do him good, and not to harm him;</hi> Now if the Law
of the Land do encourage ſuch things, then it ſtandeth right, but
if it do allow the breaking of God's Commands, and teach men
ſo; or if it do allow one Neighbour to ſpoil the goods of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or in ſome caſes rather compell ſuch things to be done, then
it doth degenerate from the Law of God, and from the Doctrine
of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>4. Chriſt Jeſus the Lawgiver ſaith, <hi>God is a Spirit, and muſt
be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> Now if the Law of the
Land do allow ſuch a worſhip and protect it, then it ſtandeth
right, but if it do prohibit it, or rather compel from it, then it
doth degenerate from the Law of God, and from the Doctrine
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40200:18"/>
of Chriſt Jeſus; and in this caſe, two things are very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to be minded, and not to be practiſed.</p>
               <p>1. Not to bind Peoples Conſciences into any Practice, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any Worſhip which in their own Conſcience they are not
perſwaded into, nor to compel a Conformity unto any Practice
or Worſhip which ſtandeth not in the Spirit and in the Truth;
for to uſe Force and Compelling-Laws in ſuch Caſes, is but to
force People to bow unto an Image, or to the likeneſs of a thing
which the Law of God doth expreſly forbid.</p>
               <p>2. Not to prohibite or forbid People for meeting together in
any place, or at any time above ſuch a number; for this is to
limit God, if it were poſſible, and to reſtrain tender Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from their holy Exerciſe in God's Spirit, and to keep them
from the <hi>pure Worſhip,</hi> which ſtandeth in the Spirit, and in the
Truth only; and to ſtop them from that practice which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeeks them to perform; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the Father ſeeketh
ſuch to worſhip him:</hi> and no Law of the Land ought to take place
to diminiſh that Liberty which any People have in the Spirit,
nor to prohibit that Worſhip that is performed to God in the
Spirit, though in the practice there may be contrary minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them; for the Spirit of the Lord God is free, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
limitation; and all that are born of the Spirit they are a
free-born People, and their Worſhip ſtands ſingly to God in the
Spirit and in the Truth; and though there may be a difference
in Worſhips outwardly, and amongſt the Worſhippers in point
of practice, yet none ought by any outward Law, either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
or prohibit each other, for that is peculiar to God alone;
and no man is to ſtand up in Judgment concerning it, or to
bind the Conſcience of another by an outward Law, either to
obſerve the one, or to deny the other; for whoever hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Power to rule, and would ſet that Power to judge in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Conſcience, Worſhip and Religion, and from their own
Judgment in ſuch caſes, make Laws, to compel to one thing,
and to reſtrain from another thing, ſuch Laws do degenerate
from the Law of God, and from the Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus,
and from his Life and Wiſdom: And therefore theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
and weighed, it will be found of great neceſſity to ſearch
well into the Laws; and where any are found to oppoſe the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40200:18"/>
Law of God, and yet ſtand in force in any ſuch caſe, to
repeal them, that ſo the Law of the Land may be reduced into
the truth of its own ſaying, and ſtand in Juſtice, Equity and
Mercy, as doth the Law of God; then Perſecution would ceaſe
about Religion, and there would be a ſtream of <hi>perfect Liberty</hi>
to all <hi>tender Conſciences,</hi> and <hi>no Reſtraint</hi> would be upon any in
caſe of <hi>Worſhip</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> otherwayes living peaceably in the
Nation; ſo would hearts and minds of men come into Love,
into Peace, and into Settlement and good Order, and it would
allay all the heat and heart-burnings amongſt men, and cool
them and quiet them; and then there would not need Swords
and Spears to preſerve Order: for People coming to that of
God in themſelves, and worſhipping and ſerving God in the
Spirit and in the Truth, and every one ſtanding in the Spirit's
Liberty; then People would ſettle and be quiet, and love one
another, and be at Peace one amongſt another, and there would
be good Order through the Nation; but this being wanting,
and Compelling-Laws ruling, it makes Broils in the Nation,
and cauſeth Diſtractions amongſt People, which would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
if <hi>Liberty</hi> in matter of Worſhip and Religion <hi>was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
and <hi>tolerated:</hi> And what harm would this do to any man? or
what prejudice could come to any man by ſo doing? Surely
none at all, but rather happineſs both to ſuch as rule, and ſuch
as are ruled; and the comfort of it would be found to be very
great unto all that truly fear the Lord: And this is the <hi>Liberty</hi>
which the <hi>King's Prerogative</hi> is to <hi>defend,</hi> according to the
Maxime of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt. But however it hath been, or yet
is with us in theſe caſes outwardly, our truſt is in the Lord God,
and in him we do rejoyce; and we deſire that all people were
like-minded with us, and were as we are, except our Bonds and
Afflictions; for the Preſence of the Lord God is with us, and
by his Arm we are ſupported, and through all theſe things the
Truth ſtandeth, and that is the Word of the Lord to all people,
<hi>Truth ſtandeth:</hi> And if any yet think with themſelves that with
their ſtrength they can prevail againſt the Truth, then let them
try their ſtrength, but let them alſo mind what will be the end
of it; for this I know in the Truth, that whoſoever riſes againſt
the Truth will toil themſelves in vain, and ſpend their ſtrength
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40200:19"/>
for nought, and in the end will lie down in ſorrow; for <hi>Truth
ſtandeth:</hi> And how many have come up, and have appeared in
full ſtrength, and have been permitted to have a blow at Truth?
but how are they waſted, and how are they paſſed away and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed!
yet <hi>Truth ſtandeth.</hi> Therefore all people, fear the living
God, and in time be warned, for <hi>no weapon formed againſt the
Truth ſhall proſper;</hi> for <hi>Truth ſtandeth over all,</hi> and Chriſt Jeſus
reigneth, his Power, and Glory and Dignity is ſet on high, and
in his Love all Wrath is ſwallowed up; and here is the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
known,</hi> and here is the <hi>ending ſet;</hi> for the Love of God was
<hi>firſt,</hi> and the Love of God is <hi>laſt,</hi> and here is the finiſhing of
the Work, and the cloſing up in perfect Peace; and with this
Love all contrary Beings are comprehended, and in its own
Being it remains unchangeable, and it is Truth and no lye; and
<hi>Truth ſtandeth,</hi> Glory to the Moſt High for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
