            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> under the broad seal of Heaven; all things <hi>are put into his hand</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of strength and all; God <hi>the Father loved him and hath put all things into his hand,</hi> He being <hi>Immanuel</hi> God man, and the onely mediator to bring sinfull man into a capacity to <note place="margin">Joh. 3 34.</note> receive grace and glory from God 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. And thus all this strength is <hi>concenterd in Jesus Christ,</hi> and so confined to him that there is not the least drop or dram of spirituall strength, but what comes <hi>derivatively</hi> and <hi>redundantly</hi> from him: Trust in the Lord Jehovah, for in the Lord <hi>Jehovah is everlasting strength; he was Abrahams Rocke</hi> to anchor upon, and though many waves may have beate upon it since, <note place="margin">Isa 26. 4.</note> yet it is not wasted; the same Rocke <hi>in Davids time,</hi> the same Rocke in <hi>Pauls time,</hi> the same Rocke for his poore Saints in <note place="margin">

            <p>Fourthly and lastly, It is a high point of wisedome, because a <hi>Christian will have so much need of this strengthning grace from Christ</hi> there is an hint to this purpose in, the 6. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 10. <note place="margin">4. <hi>Consider.</hi>

and children to their parents: But there is another peece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde that must not be forgotten, you must make account to conflict with temptations, and therefore endeavor <hi>after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting graces;</hi> you must wrastle many a fall with the Devill, before you go to heaven; a you must <hi>wrestle with God,</hi> so <note place="margin">Conflicting graces very necessary to inable us to out wrastle the Divels temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

            <p>To what <hi>effectuall purpose is this, for the Saints to be at cost and charges to learne this skill?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. To what good purposes Saints should learn to make Christ their strength.</note>

               <hi>by anothers righteousnesse;</hi> Can a man be warmed by anothers cloaths, (say they) can a man be wise by anothers wisdome? <note place="margin">Note</note> I answer, it is very easily possible, if that another mans <hi>wisedom be made ours,</hi> or another mans cloaths be put upon us; so this is possible, if Jesus Christs strength be made ours; that is the thing, the Apostle presses it here, be strong in the Grace in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, let this be your care, how to make the strength of Christ yours; and therefore (I say) this possibility will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to act in these three particulars;</p>
            <p>First, by our <hi>Union with Christ,</hi> when once you are united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jesus Christ, what is Christ <hi>is yours,</hi> for union <hi>makes way</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Its possible up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a threesold account.</note>

            <p n="2">2. By <hi>impressions from him;</hi> for when ever Jesus Christ draws us to union with him, he then draws us to communion with him in <note place="margin">By impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from his spirit.</note> his Ordinances; If we indeed have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion with him, we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with an <hi>Ordinance tincture,</hi> a <hi>Gospel impression upon our spirits,</hi> in some degree molded into that word, that was made known <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 18.</note> to us, and delivered to us, that you thinke, and speake, and act, in some <hi>conformity to that word</hi> that was delivered to you; and this is the blessed advantage of this mornings exercise, if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have hearts to make use of them, that before the Divel hath <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17.</note> taken possession, of your soules, the spirit of God shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him, and here you shall have the Gospell, come warme next your hearts, and that you may have something there, that may leave such a tincture that may fortify you against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of temptations, &amp; the ordinary invasions of the devil, <note place="margin">O that West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens would consider it, and know the day of their visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> here is strengthening grace conveyed by these impressions: as when a man throwes a stone out of his hands, Philosophers have very great disputes how it is possible that a stone should move, they tell you there is an impression of something upon it <hi>vis impressa.</hi> I am sure, here is an impression, when Jesus Christ comes into the soule, and drawes nigh to it, and puts <note place="margin">Fortit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

upon us, by him, so by a <hi>continued influence from him;</hi> It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have unio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> with him, it is not enough to have an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made upon our spirits from him, bulit is his <hi>continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence that doth it;</hi> when there is an obstruction in the passages, either betwixt the Liver, and Heart, and the Vitals and other parts, or betwixt the head, and the parts whence sense and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be conveighed; in any of those passages when there is any obstruction, at what a losse are we presently because the continuall influence is hindred when there is no such thing that doth obstruct, and hinder the sweet <hi>intercourse</hi> betwixt the soule and Christ, and illapses from the spirit of Christ into our spirits; O it is that that doth indeed <hi>strengthen and animate them;</hi> and so you see the possibility: Here is some seasonable use in the first place.</p>
            <p>I hope therefore, if it be so, you that are standers by (as <note place="margin">Use</note> I doubt there may be some here are still unacquainted with Jesus Christ, and at an unhappy distance from him, all this while (the Lord if it be his will discover so much of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to you, that you may long after intimacy with him,) no such friend on this side heaven unto you) I say if there be such strength in him, and it be such a high point of wisedome for Christians to make him their strength, for all supplies, O think the <hi>better of him,</hi> I beseech you do not entertaine any hard thoughts of Jesus Christ; let not either the weaknesses or <hi>impotencies</hi> of Gods people, nor their failings, nor any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate opinions that carnall men would scatter amongst you, any of your fellow drunkards, or Atheists, or Formalists, or what ever they are concerning Jesus Christ, let not them nourish in you a low opinion, it is the way to undo you; for all your strength lies in Him, you will never be able to overcome the least sin, or passion nor the least temptation without the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full grace of Jesus him; (and then indeed you are everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undone, if you cannot overcome the least evill;)</p>
            <p>Alas what will become of poor souls? it would grieve one to think of it, that it may be are under the greatest snares, as of bad company for 20 years together, so hedg'd in with carnal freinds and acquaintance, poore children with carnall fathers and mothers, and it may be a very carnall wife, sometimes a most carnall husband, and here shee is intangled, tyrannized over &amp;c.

            <p>If this be so, that it is the only strength of Christians, to make Jesus Christ their strength, give me leave to commend a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Use 2.</note> a brotherly caution to you at this time, <hi>Take heed of resting</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I beseech you beware, that you do not <hi>rest upon your own preparations for Ordinances:</hi> It is a very commendable thing, I <note place="margin">
                  <p n="1">1. Friendly Item.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Rest not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own Preparations for ordinances</p>
               </note> would have you pray that you may pray, and I would have you draw nigh, and make use of <hi>secret Communion with God,</hi> before you are <hi>to come to a Communion,</hi> and when you come to seek Communion with Him in a Sermon, let that be your great care, but take heed you do not rest upon your own prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration when you have prepared; for if you advance them into the Throne of Jesus Christ, and rest upon them, when you should rest only upon Him, truly it is the way to make all your preparations miscarry, and in stead of fruit, you'l have <hi>dry breasts,</hi> and a <hi>miscarrying womb;</hi> you'l have nothing at all come to any perfection; let the Saints that are acquainted with such trading at the Throne of grace, (as I hope divers of you are) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect and consult sometimes with their own experience, if it hath not bin so; Have not you when you have prayed very much before a Sermon, (it may be) got little by the <hi>Sermon,</hi> though it was a very wholsome one? Have not you many times when you thought you had bin prepar'd, and having kept a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret day of <hi>humiliation,</hi> (if there were no publique opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) before a <hi>Communion,</hi> have not you found that somtimes you have had even then lesser comfort at communion? what is the reason of this? Though God doth ordinarily dispense mercy, according to our care to <hi>prepare,</hi> yet sometimes he will not do it, and then especially, when there is any little carnal dependance <note place="margin">Note.</note> upon what we have done, for we may be <hi>carnally dependant upon Spiritual preparations for Spiritual duties:</hi> when there is the least degree of carnal dependance upon our preparations, he will
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62153:10"/>
not bear any thing, to be a Corrival with Jesus <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore he will let us see, that we shall fall short for that time of what we expected, and so do us good, and make us more fit another time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> As I would have you beware of resting in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for an Ordinance, so do <hi>not rest upon your enlargments</hi>

               <hi>in an Ordinance;</hi> It may be you have a <hi>Spring-tide of assistance comes in,</hi> a Minister preaches with great presence <hi>of the Spirit of God,</hi> and a Saint prayes (as we find it) in <hi>the holy-Ghost,</hi> finds the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God leading him from Petition to Petition, and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with brokenness, when he is confessing sin, and filling him with rejoycing, when he is remembring mercy, and raising him with a high wing (as it were) of importunity, when he is begging of favour; as it was an admirable temper in holy <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that he was not content, till he found God coming in to his spirit, with several dispensations, according to the several parts of his Prayer? Sometimes a Minister, and a Saint finds it thus: And so in other holy Ordinances, if you go away assoon as ever Duty is done, and stroke your selves, Oh! what an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prayer was here: and surely I shall do well this day, now, and I shall be able to wrestle with all temptations, I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well in the morning, and I have felt God with me; this is the way to miscarry, thousands have found it, and I am sure some <note place="margin">Note.</note> of us can seal to it, when they have thought they have prayed with most assistance from God, and have bin warmed in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but the weeds spring up even when the weather is dry, you that converse with gardens know it, you need never <hi>sow weeds;</hi> no more need you in your hearts, they wil come up fast enough, an evil weed called Pride comes up, which grieves the Spirit of God, that when we come to pray next, it may be we pray most dully, and flatly, and can say little or nothing; and when we come to preach next, yea somtimes when we come to preach the same <hi>Sermon again;</hi> this is certain, Ministers find they have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched such a Sermon in such a place with very much enlargment, it may be God gave in some soul, and quickn'd some others by <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Richard Rogers</hi> of <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers field</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that admirable Book of 7.
