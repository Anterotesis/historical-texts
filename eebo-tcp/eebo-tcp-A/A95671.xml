            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Teſtimony from the People of God
call'd Quakers, againſt falſe Reports.
At our Monthly Meeting in York, the Sixth Day of the
Second Month call'd <date>Aprill, 1694.</date>
            </head>
            <p>WEE under Named being (with many other of our Friends and
Brethren,) very ſenſible of the great Calamity fallen on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Families in this City, by a ſudden and dreadfull Fire which
happened on the Second Inſtant at Night, with much Regret,
do ſay; we are heartily Sorry for it, which did appear by our
Endeavours with the reſt of our Neighbours, what in Us lay to put a ſtop to it;
As likewiſe the Loſs which ſome of our Friends had in it, two of whom having
almoſt all they had Conſum'd, and others driven from their Habitations by
it, amongſt their Neighbours: Now for as much as that there is a Report that
<hi>Charles Hall</hi> Flax-dreſſer, in whoſe Houſe or Shop it firſt broke forth; is a
<hi>Quaker,</hi> he having formerly come (as many others do) to our Publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
But in a ſhort time, many of Us had a ſence of the falſeneſs of his Spirit,
and un-Godlineſs of his Converſation: And thereupon Several of Us dealt
with him, firſt privately by Reproofs and Exhortations; But ſeeing no amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
tho for a time he did Deny, Excuſe, or Subtilly evade to cover himſelf,
and we are jealous made lyes his Refuge: Notwithſtanding a Sence remained
amongſt Us, that all our Chriſtian care took no place to reclaim him, from his
Scandalous Life and Converſation; But that he rather abounded in Pride and
other Wickedneſs, growing ſtill worſe and worſe, to our great Trouble and
Grief, and to the Scandall of the pretious Truth we do profeſs. And thereupon
ſome Years ſince, Friends more publikely dealt with him in our ſeverall Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which proving ineffectuall, and no Remorſe or Amendment appearing,
but a Scornfull rejecting of Councell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A concerne lying on Us, for the
clearing the Truth, our Selves, and Profeſſion, to give forth a Publick Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our diſowning him, (as one of Us) which was done the Sixth day of the
third Month (called <hi>May,</hi>) 1692. Which Teſtimony ſtands Recorded in our
Book; and which ſome time ſince (before this ſad and to be lamented Fire
happened,) was ſhewed to the Lord Major of this City by two of Us; which
we doubt not but he will own, for the ſatisfaction of any that may doubt of
the truth of it; And further, we hope that all Sober and moderate People to
whom ſuch falſe and malitious Reports may come, that is to ſay, that a <hi>Quaker</hi>
ſet the City on Fire; will hereby be better Informed, and judge according to
Truth, and not as the prejudiced or Rabble may Report: And we humbly begg
of God Almighty, to keep both You and Us, if it be his will, from ſuch diſmall
accidents, and in his fear and Dread all our Days; is the earneſt deſires of Us
who are welwiſhers to all Men, notwithſtanding the falſe Reports we have (or
from ſuch as know us not) may lye under.</p>
