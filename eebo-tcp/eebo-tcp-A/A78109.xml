         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all that obſerve Dayes.</head>
            <p>THe Lord is a witneſſe againſt all your Idolatry who are following Idols, and obſerving dayes, and times, and ſeaſons, which is idolatry. Oh <hi>London!</hi> what, art thou falling back into Popiſh Idolatry again? which ſometime there hath been a ſpirit in thee which hath denyed? What, have you loſt your zeal for the Lord? and is your zeal quite dead which once was in you againſt the practices of the whore of <hi>Rome?</hi> Alas, what do you meane, in your obſerving the Popiſh Maſs-dayes, in obſerving <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> as you call it. I had thought that ſpirit had been baniſhed; And I looked e're this, that obſerving of dayes would have been quite extinguiſhed; and I hoped that your mindes and hearts would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to better things, and would wholly have forgotten and left off all your ſuperſtitious practices, which had any foundation or ſavour of the Popiſh Church. But alas, I ſee your zeal for God is grown dead, and the ſpirit of Idolatry cleaves faſt unto you; even ſo faſt is it ſeated in your hearts, that an Act of Parliament, or any outward teaching or profeſſion can ſeparate you from Idolatry; and I perceive there is nothing till the juſt judgement of God fall among you, becauſe of your ſins that can worke out of your hearts, the ſpirit that runs after Idols. You ſeem to be joyned to Idols, as if an Idol were your God; is not this idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? As if you kept dayes wholly to the Lord, you keep your Shops ſhut, and you forbear all manner of worke, and you put on your fine apparell; and yet you go into vanity, into pride and wantonneſſe, and commits great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the ſight of God, in pleaſures, in ſports, and luſts, and drunkenneſſe, and idleneſſe, and all this is idolatry. And thus you keep your holy-dayes, as you call them, ſpending your time in vanity, both Maſters and ſervants, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children; And ye ſay ye will keep <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and ye are greatly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at them that will not, and cries againſt them, and ſcoffes at their godlineſs; and thus are you glewed to the old cuſtomes of the Romiſh Church, that whore, from whence you have learned theſe things; for ſhe was the firſt that ever inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and practiced theſe curſed abominations; and her practices which ſhe was the author of, are you zealouſly performing even in <hi>London,</hi> the place of great Reformation as you profeſſe: And thus are you doing, that call your ſelves the Reformed Churches, and that ſeems in words to deny her; yet are you treading in her ſteps of idolatry. What, obſerving <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> in <hi>London</hi> yet? What, ye of the Reformed Churches? What, ye that have ſeemed ſome years ſince to turne away from theſe things, are ye even again obſerving theſe things? Oh! hypocriſie and deceit fills your hearts. Oh yee hypocrites! that cries againſt the Romiſh Church, and yet are obſerving of her practices, in feaſting and ryoting and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otouſneſs, in drinking and wantonneſſe, in idleneſs and ſports, and this ye call keeping the holy-dayes. Oh wretched idolatry! The Lords judgements will come upon theſe things, the Lord is a witneſſe againſt you. What, is all your profeſſion come to this? Have not ſome of you cryed againſt the Pope and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions theſe many years? and are you ſitten down in the practice of his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? It ſeems you are but reformed in words, and onely hath denyed the Pope in words, but are beholding to him for an invention, that ye may keep Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days as ye ſay, which ye keep unholy; and manifold abominations in thoſe days do abound to your ſhame. Therefore repent ye Idolaters, the time is at hand when the Lord will overturn, and overthrow all your idolatrous wayes, and practices. As for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> they feare God, and they dare not joyne with you in theſe abominations; and therefore you deſpiſe them, and ſay in your hearts, who ſhall controul you; for theſe things will ye do, and none ſhall prevent you. And thus is the Popiſh ſpirit of Idolatry ſhewed forth in thee, oh <hi>London,</hi> and thy reformed peeople are guilty of Popiſh ſuperſtitions and vain idolatries, till the judgements of the Lord enter upon you, and ſmite you, you will not regard nor return.</p>
