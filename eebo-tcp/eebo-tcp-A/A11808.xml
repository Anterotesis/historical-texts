            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17519:6"/>
and faith, was anciently held our prime vertue, inſomuch that <hi>Fey de Spagna</hi> grew into a Prouerbe, like the gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> out valewing any other, that I ſpeake no new thing, or vntruth, you may plainely perceiue it by the multitude of diſcourſes, pamphlets and paſquills that are dayly vented againſt vs from all parts of the World, wherein wee art ieſted at, derided, diſgraced, by verſes and vnſeemely Pictures, eſpecially of late dayes, from <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and <hi>England</hi>: yea as I vnderſtand in ſongs and Ballades, ſung vp and downe the Streetes in many places: whence this imputation, vpon ſo iuſt and braue a Nation, ſo potent a Monarch (at the brandiſhing of whoſe ſword <hi>Europe</hi> trembles) ſhould proceede, I cannot gheſſe, yet deſire to be ſatiſfied herein, in the King my Mr. and kinſmans behalfe, my kinſman, for you all know my neere alliance vnto his Maieſty, and my Poeſie may intimate no leſſe vnto the world which is <hi>Pues vos, nos,</hi> after you, we, being next in blood if the iſſue Royall ſhould faile.</p>
            <p>But I am a fraide the ill carriage of ſome priuate men at home, (perhaps our Embaſſadors in For. raine parts,) haue throwne this aſperſion vpon vs, hauing eyther giuen abroad to many ouertures of our deſignes, or attempted their ends with ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much haſt and violence, which in time and by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hand might haue beene eaſier won, as a bough whoſe fruite we meane to gather, is brought downe by degrees, which elſe might breake and we looſe our longing.</p>
            <p>Surely, in the firſt, me thinke our Nation ſhould not eaſily offend, we being eſteemed the moſt cloſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17519:7"/>
and reſerued to our ſelues in the world, as the euent of our greateſt and moſt important actions haue ſufficiently ſhewne. Did we not in 88. carry our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe for <hi>England</hi> ſo cunningly and ſecretly as well, in that well diſſembled treaty with the Engliſh neere <hi>Oſtend,</hi> whereto for vs were deputed, <hi>Aremberge, Champigny, Richardot</hi> and other, as in bringing our Nauy to their ſhores, while their Commanders and Captaines were at bowles vpon the hoe of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and had my Lord <hi>Alonſo Guzman,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Sidonia</hi> had but the reſolution (but in truth his Commiſſion was otherwiſe) he might haue ſuprized them as they lay at Anker, and the like.

How were our plots and correſpondence with <hi>Biron</hi> carryed, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the like examples.</p>
            <p>Touching the latter, the Spaniſh Nation hath of all other in the world beene held for the moſt ſober, ſtayd, and wiſe, and were wont neuer to attempt any thing but vpon great and long aduice, accounting it with <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> more honorable to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted droanes or cowards, then to hazard our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or Armies, French like, onely in a vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious haſtineſſe to gaine the Honor of charging the firſt. So that it ſeemeth ſtrange to me that we haue I know not vpon what grounds incurred the hate and ſcorne of other Nations, and that we eſpecially of the Nobility ſhould be thought ill of ſince of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ours of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hath beene euer held the moſt illuſtrious and eminent of the world.</p>

            <p>My Lords, I can deriue this ſlaunder of our Country, and hate of our ſelues from no other fountaine then the Fanaticall humors and diſtracted ſpirits of ſome of the Engliſh, who find themſelues not a little gall'd and vexed with our politique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes heretofore, and now our finall reiection, and (I hope) ſhaking hands with that Hereticall Nation for euer, for if your Alteſes and Honors will but conſider what aduenture and boote we haue made by them, I thinke you will ſay we might well endure theſe Britiſh Northen and cold blaſts: meane time in ſo ſuffering for our Catholique King, and in the Catholique cauſe we ought to take ſuch approbry rather as an Honor vnto vs then otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if we ſhall conſider who are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe lying Plamphlets, wee ſhall finde to proceede from the pennes of light and vnſtayed wits, with intent eyther to winne the opinion of good intelligencers and ſtatiſtes together with the aiery applauſe of the Vulgar, or to rayſe to their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Fortunes, when the tempeſt is ouer, (as it oft hath happened) and now likely we being fallen off from <hi>England,</hi> and the Treaty at an end.</p>

            <p>Whence quoth the Duke of <hi>Eſcalona</hi> ſhould this proceede.</p>
            <p>I will tell you (quoth <hi>Gondomar</hi>) my opinion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17519:8"/>
the Engliſh naturally are deſirous of nouelties, and innouations, and as it were ſicke in the ſoft beds of their long liberty, peace, and plenty, (which they enioy vnder as wiſe and as good a King as euer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) they ſuppoſe nothing wanteth to their full hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe but change and variety: I muſt liken them to <hi>Giotto</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> his Aſſe, who when he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with a rich ſaddle of beaten gold on his backe with a Crowne and Scepter lying thereon, yet he could not chooſe but ſmell vpon a Carriers packe-ſaddle as it lay at an Inne doore.</p>
            <p>Hence are ſtrangers the moſt admired and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned amongſt them, and if of quality preferred many times to place and preferment before the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, though perhaps their are many who deſerue better. I haue ſeene their a torne and tatter'd French Lacquay, but as this day arriued out of <hi>France,</hi> and the next, he hath ietted in the Court in his Tiſſue or Scarlet at the leaſt: what preferment came that arch-hypocrite <hi>Spalato</hi> vnto. <hi>Aſcanio</hi> the Frier, who left his wife in St. <hi>Martins</hi> lane, and ranne againe to his Order. And a poore and ignorant Italian Mountebanke, ſought after for his skill as if <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> or <hi>Machaon</hi> were againe raiſed from the dead, yea, when but a Spaniſh gowne (happily of the Embaſſadors Lady, or of her gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman) how was it ſought after by Ladies, and Taylors for the faſhion, happy was ſhe that could firſt get her into the Spaniſh faſhion, to their no ſmall charge, the Spaniſh garments exceeding all other in fulneſſe, compaſſe, and length, which by this time it may be they haue conuerted into Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17519:9"/>
My Lords, you would hardly haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne laughter, to haue heard how I haue beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after for Maiſters for the Spaniſh tongue, (that I may ſay nothing of ſo many bills ſet vp in euery corner of the City by Profeſſors) nay I could haue no ſeruice almoſt done me of my Mullettors and Groomes, for being employed in teaching the Spaniſh among Ladyes and their maydes, though I knew, I tell you, Engliſh muſt be that they were to truſt too when all was done.</p>
            <p>Touching my ſelfe being Embaſſadour there from his Catholique Maieſty, and the ſole inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Treaty for the match, which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques there ſo long thirſted after, if I ſhould relate vnto you the particulars of mine owne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, you would (I ſuppoſe) imagine I told you wonders beyond beleefe, for beſide the great and gracious reſpect I found, and fauors I receiued from his Maieſty of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and ſundry of the Nobility, who ſeemed wholy to be compounded of curteſie and Nobleneſſe, there paſſed not a day wherein I was not viſited, by ſome of the beſt ranke, or receiued ſome preſent or other, from Catholique Gentlemen, or their Ladyes, (ſo welcome was the very thought of the Spaniſh match vnto them) I returning them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, with thankes, large promiſes, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hopes of preferment, when the time ſhould come.</p>
            <p>And be it ſpoken among our ſelues, ſince wee are falling off from <hi>England,</hi> I made better vſe of their kindneſſe then ſo, for there were few Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques

in <hi>England</hi> of note, from whom in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, I wreſted not out a good round ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> a great Antiquary, I heare, much complaineth of me, that from his friends and aquaintance onely I got into my purſe the ſumme at the leaſt of ten thouſand pounds, I deny it not; and true it is, I borrowed of the good old Lady <hi>W.</hi> of the Pariſh in St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Feilds 300 pounds, or thereabouts, promiſing her repayment (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will not faile) ſo ſoone as <hi>Donna Maria,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> ſhould arriue in <hi>England,</hi> and for the vſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I promiſed to make her mother of her maydes, perſwading her, it was not fit that ſo graue and good a Lady as her ſelfe ſhould lye obſcured in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, but rather attend vpon my young Miſtreſſe, the braueſt and moſt hopefull Princeſſe of the World, vpon theſe hopes ſhe turned Catholique, and ſince I neuer ſaw her. I ſold moreouer, the place of Groo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe, of her highneſſe Stoole, to ſix ſeuerall Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ladyes, who were eager of it, only cauſe be they might take place before their fellowes: I loſt nothing neither by a Noble Gentleman, whom I cauſed to be knowne for a kinſman of the King my Mr. for that he was deſcended from the noble and ancient fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Aiala</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> theſe are but mites and crums in regard of thoſe great preſents, and many pentions I had ſent me vnder-hand, from the Catholiques from all parts of <hi>England</hi> during my aboade there, had my finger but aked, or beene ill diſpoſed (as I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten was in body) I had ſent me iewels, ſweet-meates, perfumes, linnen, Roſewater, and a thouſand of ſuch trifles, only I returned them thenkes, and promiſed them or their friends preferment, when time ſerued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:17519:10"/>If you were my Lord, ſo nobly entertained in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> quoth <hi>Braganza,</hi> whence is it, or vpon what occaſion haue wee gotten to our ſelues the ill will and diſtaſt of that Nation.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe, quoth <hi>Gondamer,</hi> the common people of England beare generally an inbred ſpleene toward vs, as it ſeemeth by many rude affronts, we were offered there by the baſer ſort, contrary to the will and pleaſure of his Maieſty of great <hi>Brittany,</hi> who publiſhed many Edicts and Proclamations in our behalfes, puniſhing many times the offenders ſeuerely as they could be taken, but why the name of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould be ſo become odious vnto them, is a queſtion I cannot eaſily reſolue.</p>
            <p>Some thinke that there is a naturall antipathy or contrariety of affection betweene our diſpoſition and theirs, they liuing in the North, and we in the South; which being (as <hi>Charron</hi> a French Author obſerueth) neerer to the Sunne, the inhabitants are more crafty, politique, and religious, (though he his in that) euen to ſuperſtition and Idolatry, where as on the contrary, thoſe of the North (howſoeuer goodlier in perſon, better faced, and more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then our ſelues by reaſon of the coldneſſe of the climate, preſeruing inwardly the naturall heate, and radicall moyſture,) are plaine ſimple, nothing ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious contemners withall, of the glorious cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of our Church, wherewith we haue drawne more Heathen in eyther India to Chriſtianity, in one yeare, then they can with their Lutheran and Caluiniſticall Sermons in all their liues.</p>
            <p>This very ſelfe ſame thing (quoth <hi>Gonzales</hi>) I

once vrged by way of argument to an Earle of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many who was a profeſſed Lutheran Heritique, and his reply herein was, ſo are fooles and children taken with bells, gilt pouches, and colours, and our Ladies and faire Gentlewomen, (we ſee) oftentimes woed and wonne, onely with a braue out-ſide on the back of a baſe knaue, when an honeſt man, and of deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing parts is reiected, in a plaine and ordinary ſuite of cloathes, and not held worthy the looking after.</p>
            <p>They talke as they are (quoth <hi>Gondomar</hi>) I am ſure theſe drew more to my little priuate Chappell in <hi>Holborne,</hi> then their beſt Preachers of Sermons could doe to any Church they had.</p>
            <p>But quoth the Duke of <hi>Hijaz,</hi> it may be they hate vs for the ſame cauſe, that <hi>France, Germany, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and the reſt of the Countryes of Europe, for that many of vs are diſcended of the Mooriſh race: wherefore we are termed of them in <hi>Italy, Marani,</hi> and of other <hi>Moros Blancos,</hi> and <hi>Nue Vos Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi>: For indeede it was but in the yeare 1492. when <hi>Granado</hi> was recouered from the Moores, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſirnamed the Little, and ſonne of <hi>Muley Albohaceu</hi> being King thereof, though <hi>Toledo</hi> and <hi>Cordona</hi> long before, and it may be they hold vs ſtill infected with Mooriſh mindes, and a ſpice of their manners, though they are aſſured wee are Chriſtians, yea and the moſt Catholique too.</p>
            <p>I heare (quoth Signior <hi>Gondomar</hi>) it is obiected in their now preſent Parliament, that in all treatiſes for the ſpace of theſe two hundred yeares, <hi>Spaine</hi> hath dealt with the Engliſh, <hi>fide punica,</hi> neuer kept

            <p>But the very truth is, they carry a vindictiue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution againſt vs euer ſince our intended conqueſt of them in 88. and peraduenture the powder-plot in 1605. which yet ſeemeth <hi>Manere alta mente repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum.</hi> Indeed <hi>Henrie</hi> the 4. of <hi>France,</hi> ſirnamed the GREAT, laboured at one time a reconſiliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs, but he found the rootes of eithers diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſo deepe, and the ſore ſo vnſaluable, that hee gaue it ouer in the end.

            <p>I againe entertained, to my no ſmall charge, In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>telligencers in euery Countrey (indeed Catholique Prieſts) whoſe liberty out of priſon I obtained for that very purpoſe: for being abroad they did vs a threefold ſeruice: Firſt, they gained ſoules to God, freinds to the King my maiſter, and money good ſtore in our purſes: for I got out of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques to mine owne vſe threeſcore thouſand pounds at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, it hath bene certified me for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, &amp; by report from many of their own mouthes, that the numbers of ſoules which they haue gained into the boſome of the Church ſince the remiſſion of the penall Lawes againſt them, and their freedome by my meanes obtained, amounteth to the number of eight and thirty thouſand and odde.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they haue confirmed the Catholiques, and made them ſo faſt for the King our Maiſter, that they haue auowed vnto me diuerſe times, that rather then miſſe of the Match, they would make vp the beſt part of the <hi>Infanta's</hi> portion out of their owne purſes, yea, though it were with the ſelling or paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all their plate and Iewels.</p>
            <p>Within the Cittie for a ſmall matter, I feede
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17519:13"/>
certaine diſcontented and neceſſitous Catholikes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to walke the common and moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented places of the Citty of <hi>London</hi> as St. <hi>Paules</hi> Church, the exchange, now and then among the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, to learne the Common newes, out of which many times I picked good matter.</p>
            <p>Neither could the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> or the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of any other Forraine Prince carry their buſineſſe ſo cloſe, but with my Maiſters golden Key, I could finde a meanes to diue into their Cabbinets, reſeale and ſeale againe their packets, without the helpe eyther of <hi>Arthor Gregory,</hi> or his old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <hi>Phillips.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not one of my worſt peeces, to hold the Engliſh in ſuſpence, with an apparant ouerture of the Match, and dilatory promiſe of Golden Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, with the age of old <hi>Saturne</hi> againe, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery oake on <hi>Greenewich</hi> parke, <hi>Sudaret roſcida mella,</hi> till the pallatinate was loſt beyond recouery, a matter of maine conſequence: for hereby <hi>Bohemia</hi> with the reſt of the Emperours Territories being ſecured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, our maiſter may at pleaſure call to his ayde the Emperours forces (who it ſeemeth for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hath made a League with the <hi>Turke</hi> for theſe twentie yeares) together with the ſtrength of <hi>Tilley,</hi>

            <p>All what (quoth <hi>Gondomar</hi>) I haue already ſaid is but a <hi>praeludium</hi> or ſmall Preface, to thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects I had in my braine, if (as vnluckily it hapned)
